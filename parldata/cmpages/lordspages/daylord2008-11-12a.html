In doing so, I draw attention to my non-pecuniary interest in the Register of Interests.</p>

<a name="81112-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08111224000017"></a>The Question was as follows:</p>

<ul><a name="08111224000409"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government whether, in any future review of levels of compensation awarded to service men and women who are disabled in the course of their duties, they will take into account differences between awards to civilians and to members of Her Majesty&#146;s Armed Forces and the costs of continuing care and of housing adaptations.</p>

Ours is a no-fault scheme and it is not necessary to prove negligence to receive an award. Awards do not include costs of continuing care or housing adaptations because these are provided separately through existing state benefits.</p>

The maximum award will double from &#163;285,000 to &#163;570,000. The issue of how servicemen are looked after when they leave the service is a matter for existing state benefits. Matters were brought together in Command Paper 7424, which is about how all departments look after families and veterans. The end of that document states:</p>

We are sensitive to what we will learn from individual cases. We believe that the burden of proof required under the present scheme is fair but, if there have been difficulties in the five years, we will take that into account in reviewing the scheme.</p>

Failure to hold a thorough review of the issue will lie with the Government and nobody else. There has to be an urgent review of all benefits for civilians and the armed services. Can my noble friend help on that?</p>

It is not appropriate to make a simple comparison between civilian awards and awards under the compensation scheme. An important point is that servicemen continue to have the right to bring an action against the Ministry of Defence in the civilian courts if they wish to prove appropriate negligence. It is a harsh and expensive proof. This scheme is a no-fault scheme. It is very generous in the amount paid for pain and suffering. It is a mechanical scheme that produces ongoing income throughout the life of the injured serviceman and, as I openly say, it looks to the state to provide for the serviceman&#146;s housing and health needs in future. I believe it is a fair balance, but it will be reviewed in 2010.</p>

The Royal British Legion is campaigning to have all war pensions disregarded when calculating means-tested benefits. Would acceptance of that not simplify the procedure and usefully improve the overall financial package for the war pensioner?</p>

It is a harsh fact of life that, in determining means-tested benefits, virtually all sources of income are taken into account. That is what &#147;means-tested&#148; means. It is how society uses its limited resources to apply benefits to the most deserving cases. I cannot promise any review. I can see why the Royal British Legion would campaign for it, but we believe the balance is fair.</p>

It is not very different from the ones I used to get from my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham. Is my noble friend aware&#151;I am sure that he is&#151;that banks and building societies are still offering savers well over 6 per cent and therefore pressure on them to cut their interest rates further would be pretty meaningless? Does he accept that the main issue now is that commercial banks and building societies should be doing what the Government asked them to do; namely, because of the liquidity improvement that the Government have made, to lend to small businesses in particular? Does he recognise that the evidence is that they are not doing so? Apart from talking to them, what is he doing in the cases of banks where he has a direct interest and direct control?</p>

We have made it very clear that the banks that we assisted in capitalisation exercises will continue to be managed in the best interests of all their shareholders. We will not be directing them on the pricing of their products or services. However, we will be holding them to the commitments that they made to make funding available to small companies, hard-working families and needy borrowers over the next three years in accordance with the volumes of business that were available in 2007.</p>

Does he also agree that, as is shown by the sharp fall in the exchange rate of sterling, the financial markets are extremely concerned about the prospects for the British economy in general, the fiscal position in particular and the underlying structural deficit, and that it would be disastrous if confidence were further knocked by a change in the remit of the Bank of England?</p>

Why, given that the Chancellor clearly wanted interest rates reduced a number of weeks before they were reduced, was no such direction given four to six weeks ago?

Is it not true that it is like a top general who has been given the wrong orders? Does not the fault lie, as the questions of the noble Lords, Lord Barnett and Lord Newby, imply, with the legislation that created the independent Bank of England, and in particular with Section 11, which concerns the remit? That asks the Bank of England to concentrate exclusively on inflation as the be-all and end-all of economic policy. Do we not now know that it is possible to have what the Bank of England called, contrary to what the Minister said, the largest financial crisis in human history, which has occurred during a period of low inflation? Does not that mean that there must be more to it than Section 11 suggests?</p>

The outlook is that those policies and practices will continue to be highly effective. The Government do not interfere or intervene in the decision-making of the MPC and will not do so.

On my noble friend&#146;s specific questions, employment levels now, compared to 1997, are up by about 3 million. On unemployment levels, the claimant count is at about 980,000. In the 1980s and 1990s, that figure reached something like 3 million. The key lesson to learn from the past is that, in challenging economic times, we should not abandon people who become unemployed and put them on the scrapheap; we should continue to have active labour market policies. At the moment, Jobcentre Plus is keenly geared up to do that.</p>

Unhappily, 11 years later, that figure still applies in spite of all the disability legislation that has gone through this House and the other place. Despite the looming recession, what can the Government do to encourage employers to improve on that figure, bearing in mind that there is much specialist support available to make this possible?</p>

If one looks at the overall employment rate and its composition, one sees that disabled people, lone parents and ethnic minorities do not reach the average rate that applies for the rest of the economy. It is certainly right to say that people with learning disabilities have not made the progress that we would wish. That emphasises to me the need to continue to reinforce and entrench those active labour market policies to make sure that we engage with employers through local employment partnerships and city strategies and encourage them to take advantage of the funding streams that are available. In these challenging times, we should not take our foot off the pedal of those important and progressive reforms.</p>

I used to know a chap called Paul Myners who knew what he was talking about. I do not know what is in the Treasury water.

On capacity, we should bear in mind the fact that a dynamic labour market is operating. We look at the net changes&#151;those are the figures reported&#151;but over the past month, for example, some 270,000 people have gone on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance and 230,000 have come off, while every day something like 10,000 vacancies are notified to Jobcentre Plus.

Does the noble Baroness agree with me that it is important for teachers to feel confident in having physical contact with pupils, not only when teaching an instrument but hugging a child when it is in distress or clearing up quickly and without fuss some diarrhoeal disaster? Those are ways in which a parent would be comfortable with a teacher touching a child. Does she also agree that there is a great deal of evidence that teachers do not feel comfortable with this and that teacher training institutions are advising young teachers that they should not touch children in all but the most extreme circumstances, hence the Musicians Union giving the advice that they have? Should we not review the support and advice we are giving to teachers to see whether we can help them to behave in the way we would like?</p>

Similarly, the child in the playground to whom the teacher says, &#147;Do you want a hug?&#148; will accept it or reject it. We are forgetting the role of the child in consenting to the touch.</p>

That could mean the teacher saying, &#147;I will show where to place your fingers to make this chord&#148;, and then doing it in a way that does not impose on the child and create a sense of uncomfortable pressure.

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08111224000074"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 121H brings us to the issue of commons and village and town greens, which are special forms of common land. I am not suggesting that it is a perfect amendment but I hope that it will provide a means by which the Government, in the time left to us on the Bill, can find a way to solve certain problems.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08111224000075"></a>I am concerned about the implications of the Bill for commons. It is only two years since this House and the other place passed the Commons Act 2006 that brought up to date commons legislation, some of which goes back a long way. In particular it brought up to date provisions for the registration, deregistration and protection of commons, and confirmed their special status.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08111224000076"></a>Commons are usually small pieces of land scattered around the country, comprising around 3 per cent of the land area of England, and are special historical relics of the past that nowadays perform important functions not just in terms of the traditional rights of commoners, but for biodiversity, the environment and recreation. The important point about their special status is that it is a legal status provided by the Planning Act 2006 and is outside the planning system. This amendment probes the relationship between commons under the Planning Act which are outside the planning system and commons under this Bill as it will apply to large infrastructure developments which may affect commons. The Commons Act does not prevent development on commons, but it does give extra protection. In particular, Section 38 of the Commons Act 2006 means that for development on commons a separate application must be made to the Secretary of State for Defra unless a compulsory purchase order is made on that common. In that case, other protections apply.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08111224000077"></a>Commons are not only special, historical and valuable&#151;often small&#151;pieces of land scattered around the country, but they have an unusual status in that there are two kinds of rights on those commons. First, there are normal rights of ownership; all commons are owned by somebody, usually by private individuals. Secondly, there are rights of common, which are held by other people. Those, of course, are the commoners.  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_662"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Their rights might be to gather vegetation for fuel or bedding, ancient rights of turbary and pannage, and other such rights. Nowadays, the rights exercised by commoners on commons are mainly rights of grazing. These are rights over the common which would normally be held by the owner of the land, which in the case of commons are held by the commoners.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08111224000078"></a>The Commons Act provides that if a common ceases to be a common by being deregistered, equivalent land has to be provided. This is called replacement land and it must have replacement rights for the group of commoners who have had their rights displaced. All this was confirmed recently by an excellent document, <I>Common Land Con</I><I>sents</I><I> Policy Guidance</I>, published by Defra in June 2008. In particular, it underlines that unless a compulsory purchase order is made on the common, the development that can be allowed must be quite small-scale and necessary for the common itself. The extra protection also includes developments on the common. The Commons Act consents that have to be made for development on the common include development that would not otherwise need planning permission, such as fencing and ditching.

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08111224000079"></a>I first raised the issues covered by these amendments in Committee. I have had discussions with the Minister and officials since then. I understand the issues far more clearly now than I did then; they are extremely complex. The issues come down, first, to questions about Part 3 of the Commons Act and the Commons Act consents that are required for development on commons, and the extent to which they are swept away by this Bill in the case of commons where development is sought as part of a major infrastructure development. Secondly, there are issues relating to replacement land. Clauses 129 and 130 of the Bill, which derive from the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, deal reasonably with the question of replacement land and commoners&#146; rights where the development consent issued by IPG includes a compulsory purchase order on a common. The clauses cover that very well. Clause 129 covers the question of replacement land, and Clause 130 covers the replacement rights of commoners.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08111224000080"></a>That still leaves the following questions open. First, does the Planning Bill, notably Clause 118, mean that an application for consent under Part 3 of the Commons Act 2006 is no longer required when there is an application for development consent under the Act? Secondly, if that is so, what is to prevent a situation in which a developer of a common and/or a subsequent occupier of that common finds that inappropriate rights of commons still exist on that development? Thirdly, do Clause 118(3) and Schedule 5 allow a development consent to remove commons rights from a common without the provisions of the Commons Act 2006 having to be used, particularly to provide the replacement land and/or rights? I do not believe that that is the Bill&#146;s intention, because in the case of CPOs it is there but it is not in other cases.</p>

Even if a replacement common is provided voluntarily, it is not clear in the Bill how that would be done. Presumably it would have to be done by a separate application under Section 16 of the Commons Act 2006 that deals with the registration of common land.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08111224000082"></a>These are technical and complex issues, but they are important; they are a byway in the discussion of the Bill because it is about commons and the way they are affected. It would be remiss of this House to let the Bill pass without these questions of common land, as part of applications for development consent, being resolved. I hope that we can agree on amendments to the Bill to deal with those questions, make it clear what the position is and continue to protect the special status of commons.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08111224000083"></a>I repeat that I am not saying that there should never be development of this kind on commons. The important thing is to ensure that, where such development takes place, the normal issues in relation to commons are considered as part of that development and, if necessary, replacement land and commons rights are produced. I beg to move.</p>

I have spent some 15 years in this building seeking agreement on the improvement and modernisation of the law relating to common land and I have experience, both on Dartmoor and on Bodmin Moor, of dealing with the complex situations that arise from the difficult relationship that there has often been in the past between the owners of common land and the commoners. At the time of the legislation that became the Commons Act 2006 I warmly congratulated this Administration on the initiative they took to resolve some long and deep problems that arose out of the lack of real simplification and careful arbitration within this system. Having congratulated them then, I hope that today we will have absolute assurance that nothing in the Government&#146;s proposals in this Bill could undermine the work done in preparation for that Act.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08111224000085"></a>These commons are of critical importance in many rural communities. They may be peripheral to the main purpose of the Bill, as my noble friend says, but for people in those communities commons legislation is critical. If the Government were perceived somehow to have reneged on that careful negotiation over many years by undermining what happened in that legislation, the breach of faith that could be identified would be very serious and would raise considerable concerns in those communities.</p>

<a name="81112-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08111224000086"></a>The issue, as my noble friend has said, revolves particularly around replacement land. That is where it will be of most concern to those who are directly affected, whether they be owners or commoners. The replacement of, for example, grazing land in many of the communities that I have had the pleasure of representing in the past will be of considerable importance. After so much negotiation and compromise by some

Commons are a vital part of our natural heritage. In the old days, every community used to have one but sadly they are now greatly diminished both in quantity and quality. They still serve a useful role, however, for common rights, notably grazing, and for access and leisure. Even the smallest patch of surviving common can act as a formal or informal village green. In rural communities and, more importantly, urban communities, that little patch of green can be of enormous benefit in raising the quality of life.</p>

I know how much good will the Government generated by their recent approach to the importance of commons and their proper administration, and it would indeed be a shame if inadvertently in the context of this Bill that good will was undermined. The commons have immense significance in our social history. They have real significance in terms of the character of our landscape. However much we become energy sufficient and face up to the demands which are necessary to make us energy sufficient, to undermine and destroy the quality of our landscape in doing that would be unforgivable.</p>

One of the characteristics of this Bill is that it seems to bump into a huge range of existing legislation, some of which is unfamiliar to most of us. A week ago I thought we had identified all these clashes and put them behind us. Obviously I was wrong and now we have another problem, namely common-land legislation. Like the noble Lords, Lord Greaves and Lord Tyler, and others, it is not long ago that I recall trying to understand the common-land legislation going through this House. I remember interesting passages in Committee in the Moses Room. At that time, it seemed to be pretty obscure stuff and very historical. It has, however, cropped up again.</p>

I am in no position to judge whether his analysis is correct but his arguments seem persuasive. Let there be no doubt about it, the historic common-land rights are important, as so eloquently expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. I will listen with great care, therefore, to what the Minister has to say in reply. If there is any doubt on the issue, I hope she will agree even at this late stage to take it away and come back at Third Reading with an amendment that ensures that these special common-law rights are respected. If not, I will certainly support the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, if he seeks to test the opinion of the House.</p>

Many of our debates in Committee and on Report have been on the energy needs of the nation, to which this Bill partly applies. In 1982, the Wiltshire Record Society&#146;s annual volume recorded the judicial notebook of a resident magistrate of a hundred in central Wiltshire who tried 500 cases in a five-year period in the 1740s; that is enough to be statistically significant. Much the most frequent rural crime during those five years was the theft of firewood due to the enclosure of common land.</p>

We had a short debate on this in Committee, and followed it up with an exchange of correspondence. I am glad to understand more about the important issues that he raised. I completely understand his concerns, and appreciate how he set out his case, not least the roll call of rights associated with this extraordinarily rich and unique part of our heritage.

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08111224000098"></a>I shall address some of the noble Lord&#146;s questions in context. He sought reassurance that there would be no loophole in the Bill meaning that development could take place on common land which a promoter  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_666"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 666</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already owned, or had already acquired by agreement with the freeholder. In such a case, the noble Lord is looking to ensure that the Commons Act 2006 will apply to this development. The amendment also covers the case where a promoter may own a part of common land, with the intention of deregistering that land as common. The noble Lord wishes to ensure that the IPC does not grant a development consent order affecting such land unless it is satisfied that the promoter is proposing replacement common land vested with the same rights as the common it proposes to deregister.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08111224000099"></a>The noble Lord has a great deal of experience on this matter, and he knows that we share his values and are deeply sympathetic with the intentions of the amendment. We share certain core principles about how development consent orders should operate where they cover land designated as commons. In particular, we agree that consent will still be needed under Section 38 of the Commons Act where development consent orders grant authority for works on common land, except where the development consent order grants compulsory purchase under Clauses 129 or 130 of the Bill. If common land is compulsorily purchased under these clauses, it would clearly not be sensible to require a separate consent as well.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08111224000100"></a>We also agree that development consent orders should not use the powers in Clause 118(5) to exclude or modify the application of the Commons Act in relation to land contained within the order. That would prevent a situation whereby provision of a development consent order could let a promoter off the requirement to provide just those replacement land rights which would otherwise be required when deregistering land under the Commons Act.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08111224000101"></a>The noble Lord anticipates that we have found some problems with his amendment. They concern the complexity that has been referred to, not least by my noble friend Lord Howarth. These are extremely ancient and complex pieces of legislation. In particular, the amendment would apply the Commons Act to fuel or field garden allotments and open spaces that are not covered by the Act, which only refers to commons, and town and village greens.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08111224000102"></a>Proposed new subsection (2) might also be interpreted as extending the scope of legislation on a specific common so that it covers all commons; we are indeed getting into deep waters. However, I shall consider this further and I hope that this will satisfy the House. I hoped to bring forward an amendment to deal with this, but it has not been possible in the time. I ask the noble Lord to be a little more patient and withdraw his amendment, so that we can consider further. We will table our amendment, which I believe will address the concerns that he articulated this afternoon, and the concerns expressed by all noble Lords. I will be happy to share our amendment with him ahead of time so that we can discuss it. I hope that that will do the trick.</p>

As far as concerns the definition of &#147;open space&#148; and &#147;fuel and field garden allotments&#148;, I was simply copying what was in what are now Clauses 129 and 130, which cover commons, village greens and town greens. I had never come across fuel and field garden allotments and did not know what they were.

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08111224000117"></a>The amendments take us to Clause 155 on nuisance. They are amendments to the clause that the Government brought in Committee. That amendment took us a long way to dealing with anxieties about what was in the Bill, but a few anxieties remain.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08111224000118"></a>The clause provides statutory authority, in other words, if something is not nuisance, for,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000375"></a>&#147;doing anything else authorised by an order granting development consent&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000320"></a>My question is whether that implicitly authorises any activity, notwithstanding that it may be a nuisance, or in future come to be a nuisance or to be actionable in any other way. As the institute comments, if the world were a world of perfect conditions, this would not matter, but it is simply not realistic to think that we can anticipate everything that might happen. Its concern, which I share, is how it is in practice envisaged that adequate conditions can be set. Even if one could predict the range of nuisances likely to arise from a particular development, it would be much more difficult to quantify them. Setting abatement conditions is also a problem.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08111224000119"></a>Additionally, statutory nuisance controls are not currently fixed in advance. The Environmental Protection Act provides that operators must apply,</p>

<p><a name="08111224000321"></a>What is a nuisance can change over time. There can be advances in processes and advances in the technology applying abatement. There may, for instance, be a need for abatement if housing is built closer to a polluting site. We do not live in a static world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08111224000120"></a>If the terms of a condition applied by a development consent order operate as an implied consent, the operator just has to take sufficient precautions to stay within it; but if it does not do so, or if conditions become obsolete or if there is encroachment, what is to happen? There still seems to be uncertainty, which is at the nub of the amendment.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08111224000121"></a>Amendment No. 123B arises from a concern about subsection (3), which provides that the rest of the clause is,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000377"></a>&#147;subject to any contrary provision made in any particular case by an order granting development consent&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000322"></a>It seems that that would allow the IPC not only to remove a defence&#151;it would support that&#151;but to relax a defence, which is what it is concerned about; in other words, to grant a greater immunity. As noble Lords will understand, that amounts to law-making by an administrative body. I understand that officials have commented that the European Convention on Human Rights would be an adequate protection. I am not confident about that, and that is not where it should be left. Therefore, the amendment would continue to provide for the removal of the defence, but it would not allow the defence to be extended. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_669"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 669</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08111224000123"></a>The noble Baroness eloquently raised issues about how the IPC will be able to place requirements on development consent orders that adequately deal with potential nuisances, which can certainly get better or worse depending on technologies and different situations. How can this be &#147;future-proofed&#148; to ensure that the promoter must always use best practical means to avoid causing nuisance? The noble Baroness also raised the issue of the IPC&#146;s ability to make orders that contain what we might describe as contrary provisions.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08111224000124"></a>The first concern raised by the noble Baroness was whether Clause 155(1)(b) might include observing a requirement. She has indicated that there is a concern that this interpretation might lead to a promoter of an NSIP being authorised to cause nuisances up to a level specified in a requirement, irrespective of whether technologies had advanced, such that this level of nuisance could be substantially reduced. That is clearly a rather absurd position. I am sure that she will understand that much will depend on how the IPC words any such requirement and, indeed, any other part of a development consent order.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08111224000125"></a>The Government believe that the clause as it is currently drafted already ensures that promoters must make all reasonable precautions to avoid causing nuisance, including by adopting new quieter technology, for example, where appropriate. It might help if I gave an example. A requirement might be worded, &#147;The noise levels associated with a particular operation shall not exceed X decibels&#148;. That would grant a defence of statutory authority for such a level at the time the development consent order is granted. However, as I mentioned in Committee, we intend Clause 155 to work within the common law meaning of nuisance; that is, we do not believe that a defence would be operable if a promoter had not taken every reasonable precaution consistent with the exercise of the development consent order to prevent the nuisance from occurring. If technological advances in the future mean that the operation of an NSIP can be carried out more quietly, the promoter will benefit from the defence in this clause only if it has taken advantage of these new technological advances. The developer will still be operating within the terms of the development consent order if noise levels are less than the maximum specified by the requirement. Therefore, there is an onus on the developer to keep pace with changing technologies.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08111224000126"></a>We do not believe that it would be appropriate for requirements to be phrased along specific lines&#151;whether we are talking about levels or limits&#151;such as, &#147;The noise levels associated with a particular operation shall be X decibels&#148;. If we did that, it would mean that if a promoter tried to benefit from technological advances, it would not be able to rely on the defence of statutory authority. That creates a rather perverse situation. In the light of this, the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment raises uncertainty as to when compliance with a requirement could confer a defence of statutory authority in nuisance proceedings. As I said, a better solution is to ensure that requirements are worded appropriately. I hope that I can offer some assurance. draw the House&#146;s attention once again to the model provisions in Clause 38, which could certainly include models for requirements.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08111224000127"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health&#151;which, I think, was primarily concerned about this&#151;will take comfort from that assurance. When these are drawn up, bodies such as the institute will have a role in consultation as well.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08111224000128"></a>Amendment No. 123B relates to the ability of a development consent order to depart from the default position on nuisance in Clauses 149 and 155. We included amendments in Committee for a default position, whereby a promoter should not be liable to nuisance claims in respect of nuisances which are the inevitable consequences of works authorised by a development consent order, and which cannot reasonably be avoided.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08111224000129"></a>As I have set out, this would include where technology has progressed since the development consent order was granted. We believe that it would be appropriate for the IPC to have the flexibility to make a provision that sets out, for the avoidance of doubt, how this default position would work in respect of proceedings brought under the Environmental Protection Act. There are precedents. Examples of this approach can be found in a number of recent orders made under the Transport and Works Act. I am assured that Article 40 of the Felixstowe Branch Line Order (SI 2008/2512), Article 36 of the Network Rail (Thameslink 2000) Order (SI 2006/3117) and Article 46 of the DLR (Stratford International Extension) Order (SI 2006/2905) fulfil those criteria.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08111224000130"></a>I should reiterate that we believe that this flexibility is more likely to be used to expand a developer&#146;s exposure to nuisance actions than to restrict it, which I think is the point about which the noble Baroness is primarily concerned. She referred to the fact that the IPC would have to be compliant with the terms of the Human Rights Act. As such a provision could potentially engage a person's Article 8 rights, the IPC must be satisfied that this is justified; that is, that it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, will achieve its purpose and is proportionate. In addition, the IPC is under a general duty to act reasonably. I should also highlight that if a development consent order applied powers under Clause 118(5), the Secretary of State can review the terms of the order and direct changes where he or she finds that it would contravene ECHR rights.</p>

<a name="81112-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08111224000131"></a>I hope that gives the assurances that the noble Baroness, and the people who raised the issue with her, seek.</p>

Clearly, that legal advice will need to cover a great range of expertise. I am grateful for that and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This amendment simply reflects that obligation, for the sake of consistency, in the other great area of planning decision-making, in the Town and Country Planning Act system at local level. This will affect the buildings which influence so much of our daily lives for better or worse, and will give local authorities the confidence to entrench good design into their procedures by the various means already available. It will give those who care about design more influence, pushing the whole system to have higher standards, and to implement PPS1 as a natural part of their operation. It is supported by the RIBA, for whose encouragement and technical advice I am extremely grateful, and by the Town and Country Planning Association.</p>

We have amended this Bill to lay a similar duty on the Secretary of State and the IPC in the development consent regime. But what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. It remains now to provide plainly on the face of the Planning Bill a parallel duty in the town and country planning regime. This new clause would make it clear beyond doubt that everyone exercising planning functions within the general planning system must do so with a view to promoting a high standard of design quality in the built environment.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08111224000146"></a>The Minister may argue that the new clause is inappropriate or unnecessary, because planning policy statements 1, 3 and 6 already provide the requirement for good design. Of course the planning policy statements have legal standing, and PPS 1 does indeed declare eloquently the duty to promote good design. If the duty would not, then, be a new one, there can be no objection that local authorities have not been consulted. Planners should already know in principle what they are supposed to do. The problem is that the planning policy statements are not generally perceived as creating a legal obligation for real. They are widely seen as guidance, as policy wallpaper and limp-wristed legislative gesture at most. We need to energise and make much more effective the policy in the planning policy statements. Too many planners lack the will to meet the standards set in the planning policy statements. Powerful developers, such as sections of the volume house-building industry, conform minimally in practice to the PPSs. CABE continues to pour forth justified lucubrations about the inadequacy of too much design.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08111224000147"></a>The Government may say that the notion of &#147;high standards of design quality&#148; is too imprecise to be written into statute. High quality design is no more or less vague a term than sustainable development, which we spatchcock into legislation at every turn. We need to insist on both. If the Government argue that sustainability includes high quality design, I have to disagree. The term &#147;sustainability&#148;, in its present usage as a cure-all, risks being so stretched and twisted as to lose useful meaning.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08111224000148"></a>It may be suggested that a more fruitful approach will be to develop existing initiatives on design review, design champions, improvement of skills, the recently updated building-for-life criteria, CABE&#146;s new national network of assessors, design quality indicators and so on. All of those will be useful. So, no doubt, also will be new efforts to mobilise the RDAs in the cause of good design, and the Homes and Communities Agency, too, will surely give important impetus and practical help. But all these efforts will be far more effective in the context of this amendment. Then it will be understood that a commitment to high quality design will not be an option for enthusiasts but a statutory duty on everyone. It will not just be the policy of the Government for the time being, but the established will of parliament.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08111224000149"></a>Perhaps the Government will pray in aid the impending report of the Killian-Pretty review as a reason for rejecting this amendment. Unless Killian-Pretty is going to say that high quality design does not matter after all and planners should wave through anything, however tacky, the new clause cannot be in conflict with a more rational and coherent approach in planning.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08111224000150"></a>It would be too cynical if the Government were to say that a duty to promote high quality design would be observed merely mechanistically, as a box-ticking exercise. That would be to disparage the good people in local government who want the best design for their communities. Alternatively, it may be suggested that the duty in the new clause would be a distraction for planning authorities, causing them to spend disproportionate amounts of time thinking about design. That will be the day! The quality of design in the built environment is, in truth, among the most important responsibilities of a local authority. I quote one of the greatest of local government leaders, Joseph Chamberlain, who said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000378"></a>&#147;the city which is a city must have its parks as well as its prisons, its art gallery as well as its asylum, its books and its libraries as well as its baths and washhouses, its schools as well as its sewers ... it must think of beauty and of dignity no less than of order and of health&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81112-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08111224000151"></a>Perhaps we will be told that this duty would simply be too expensive. We may be offered horrified visions of local authority resources being thrown at armies of design consultants. I remind the House that design review costs effectively nothing, thanks to the public-spiritedness of architects who are willing to provide design review services for no payment. Planning officers ought in any case, as the Government have often said, to be competent in design matters. If the duty is already there in the PPSs, unless indeed they are being ignored wholesale, in which case the amendment is undoubtedly needed, it cannot add to costs to reiterate the duty in statute. It is a commonplace that the extra upfront costs of a well designed building, which are a very small proportion in any case, pay for themselves handsomely over the lifetime of the building. CABE has compellingly demonstrated the cost of bad design in its publication of that title. Equally the benefits of good design have been demonstrated in numerous studies, notably in Alice Coleman&#146;s work. Good design quickly pays for itself in reduced crime, improved educational performance, better health and reduced staff turnover in hospitals. It is much cheaper not to have to rebuild after a Ronan Point collapses or an Aylesbury Estate proves to be a community disaster.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08111224000152"></a>I have rehearsed all the excuses I can imagine for the Government rejecting this amendment. None of them washes. I cannot believe that my noble friend, who is serious about good design, will advance any of them. So surely she will agree with us.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08111224000153"></a>If we do not state this duty in the Bill, all our other efforts will be undermined. We will drift on as we are, with occasional good and very good design amid a mass of mediocrity and ugliness which is an affront to civic values and decent aspiration for our communities.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08111224000154"></a>I do not of course suppose that good design can be brought about simply by legislation. The amendment would make it vastly more likely that people engaged in development and planning will think responsibly and imaginatively about the quality of what they bring into being. It will become normal for more people to think seriously about design and to make a conscious effort over it. There will never be unanimity about what is good design; there will always be battles of the styles. The modernists and the traditionalists will still  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_674"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>go at each other. There will still be antagonistic dogmas and silly fads. One person&#146;s carbuncle will still be another person&#146;s masterpiece. But what could transform the general standard of design for the better would be precisely an energy of debate released by a newly emphatic requirement in law that good design must be sought. More and more people would be drawn into discussion. People would no longer be resigned to enduring whatever the system and the current orthodoxy impose on them. They would demand better.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08111224000155"></a>Politicians in Britain since the Second World War have largely been embarrassed to talk about architecture and design. It was not always so. On 8 July 1861, the House of Commons debated the design of a new Foreign Office building. Lord John Manners made the case for the Gothic style. The Prime Minister himself, Lord Palmerston, made the case for the Palladian style. He opened his speech by observing that:</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000379"></a>&#147;the battle of the books, the battle of the Big and Little Endeans, and the battle of the Green Ribands and the Blue Ribands at Constantinople were all as nothing compared to this battle of the Gothic and Palladian styles&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 8/7/1861; col. 535.]</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000323"></a>It was an unpompous but passionate debate. Like the debates about the Great Exhibition 10 years&#146; previously and debates in every Victorian city about appropriate architectural styles for libraries and town halls, it was a debate about the soul of the country. Architecture, it was believed, surely rightly, should express and advance civic purpose and idealism. There is a similar spirit of debate today in Holland. The Dutch care deeply about how every square metre of their land is used. So should we. The Secretary of State, Hazel Blears, has made inspired statements in recent months about the necessity of good design. Now is the chance to give that rhetoric substance for the planning system as a whole. My noble friend has already shown her leadership in amending legislation elsewhere. If she will now accept this amendment to Part 9 of this Bill, she will take her place in history as the Minister who, with a sensitivity to the mood of the nation and with the courage of her convictions, seized the opportunity to elevate our national ambition. She will have opened the way to a new and better era of architecture and design in Britain.</p>

I am not sure whether the Minister seeks to emulate the feats of Palmerston or sees herself as a latter-day Palmerston this afternoon, but I believe that there is an additional reason to those already expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, and the noble Baroness. It is that there is a general increase in interest, concern and anxiety about the quality of design in our country. It is a public issue in a way that it has not been for several decades.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08111224000157"></a>I shall take two examples that demonstrate this. First, just recently the RIBA published the Stirling Prize. Considerable publicity was given to it, which generated a lot of genuine debate about the quality of 21st-century design. Secondly, there is the Channel 4 programme &#147;Grand Designs&#148;. Here I should perhaps declare a non-interest, in that I have been in discussion  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_675"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the programme makers because my wife and I are in the process of designing a modest retirement home that will be ecologically sensitive and sustainable. However, they have taken the view, which is probably right, that it is of no televisual interest because we do not intend to have a major row with our architect, to go twice over the price that we can afford or to have a major row between ourselves. Therefore, it will not make good television. However, the point I wish to make is that that Channel 4 programme has a huge and growing audience. People are interested in the quality of design. I wish to add to the points that were powerfully made by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, that there is an obligation on Parliament to set the tone in expecting better design in the future than we have experienced in the more recent past.</p>

I shall collect the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, to produce a short book containing the wisdom and good sense that he has delivered to us during this stage of the Bill. I shall add a small annexe to that that one of the potential criticisms of measures to support good design is that design is simply a matter of taste and subjective judgment about which it is impossible to legislate. I am pleased to note that a national standard for well designed homes and neighbourhoods has been agreed between the key organisations in this field. It is run by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment&#151;CABE&#151;and the Home Builders Federation, and the Civic Trust, the influential Design for Homes, English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation have all signed up to the Building for Life standard. That is now the subject of annual awards. Twenty-four projects have just been given the seal of approval under that standard, and CABE is now committed to establishing a network of 500 local assessors&#151;at least one in each local authority area&#151;who will be trained, accredited, monitored and supported in using this objective assessment tool to decide whether the Building for Life standard has been met. The arrival of this practical, low-cost, objective process for making design decisions significantly helps the case for insisting on design quality appearing in the Bill.</p>

Forty-seven years ago, I had to open an office for a small American firm. Our scale was such that we were not going to go out and acquire a building or even design one. I went down to the Design Council and identified the only spread-eagled coat stand that it recommended to the nation. I then found where I could buy one and purchased it. I also bought two chairs by Edward Barnsley. Thirteen years later, I led the management buyout from the American who had founded the firm, and I had five years in which to transform it from being a firm controlled by a single person into a firm that was owned by 50 people. I am delighted to say that more than a quarter of a century later, that firm is the largest of its kind in the world in private hands. I do not want to make too much of this, but it seems to me that the way we began is the way that we have gone on and have therefore been able to flourish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08111224000160"></a>Finally, although Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson&#146;s great Texan colleague, said that the three wisest words in the English language were, &#147;Wait a minute&#148;&#151;and they apply to the amendment&#151;I think that close behind them comes a sentence that I learned at the Harvard Business School, to the effect that if you do not know where you are trying to get to, any road will get you there.</p>

When we discussed design issues in Committee, I said that that I thought that the 2004 Act included something like this. I remember discussion and we were probably fobbed off with the promise of guidance rather than anything else. The noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, looked through the Act line by line, and assures me that it is not there. I am sorry about that.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08111224000162"></a>Secondly, it would be a great help to those, like myself, who struggle with local planning issues on the ground to have that firmly written into legislation. I can introduce the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, to local planning officers up and down the land who regard planning policy statements as something close to holy writ when they are arguing with their councillors. It would help to have that in the Bill. At present, I am one of the people holding informal negotiations with a supermarket chain, which has put in a reserved matters planning application for quite a large new supermarket in Colne, where I live. Design and new supermarkets do not necessarily fit together. New supermarkets challenge people interested in design more than almost anything else, because they are just big square or rectangular boxes. Nevertheless, we have had interesting discussions with the supermarket chain about how to make it less ugly than it would otherwise be, if I may put it that way, and it has come back with substantial improvements. That is because we are trying to get better design on the ground.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08111224000163"></a>Sometimes when I listen to the Ministers, I see them thinking of big projects or prestige projects of any size at the top level of design. All of the real world is not like that; it is a spectrum. There is good design, there is awful design, and there is everything in between. It is incumbent on all of us to try to push the boundary with every project as far as we can in a better direction on that spectrum, even if it is a local supermarket box. It would really help to have this in the Bill, so that we could say to people, &#147;Look, we have to consider this. We are not just arguing for the sake of it. You have to listen to what we say because if you take it to appeal, we have the legislation behind us&#148;.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08111224000165"></a>Having spent a number of years sitting on committees trying to persuade them that design might come into it, with a perfectly good presentation before the committee but a not particularly good discussion about it and, sometimes, an appalling conclusion come to, it seems to me that the great value of making a statutory requirement at this point in the Bill is that a committee

The members of the committee would not agree about what was good design. Some of them would be rather knowledgeable; others would not have a clue. Some would be totally utilitarian; some would have a good visual sense; but they would at least say, &#147;Is this good design?&#148;, and the architect could deploy his argument for why it was good design.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08111224000166"></a>The amendment is sound and I do not see why the Government should not accept it.</p>

I am passionate about good design, which is key to the creation of a humanised environment for people to live in. I may even be almost as passionate about design as the Minister told us in Committee she was. That is why the Bill needs to place a duty on the new development consent regime and the town and country planning regime to have regard to the desirability of securing high standards of design.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08111224000168"></a>Without a duty in legislation, it is all too easy for developers to ignore considerations of good design. Good practice advice and encouragement, strewn throughout reams of guidance and planning statements, are apt to operate in a rather diffuse and diluted way, if they operate at all. A duty clearly laid down in statute focuses the obligation and the mind much more powerfully.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08111224000169"></a>Government amendments to require that the new development consent regime must have regard to the desirability of securing high standards of design are very welcome. I was therefore surprised and disappointed that a duty on the town and country planning regime to have regard to the desirability of securing high standards of design in the built environment has not been written into the Bill. It is simply consistent for the same requirement to apply to the town and country planning regime.</p>

<a name="81112-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08111224000170"></a>This is the mirror image of our discussion the other day on heritage and the fact that the town and country planning regime, but not the new development consent regime, is obliged to have regard to the desirability of preserving heritage. The duty should apply across the piece to both regimes, and I support the amendment.</p>

I remind him of the adage that silence signifies assent. Again, he has said all that needs to be said, and has been reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, so I intend to take no longer.

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08111224000173"></a>The proposed new clause would amend Section 39 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, ensuring that a statutory design duty is placed on those exercising development plan functions, whether regional or local, to pursue the objective of high-quality design in addition to the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. I do not want to say &#147;yet again&#148;, because noble Lords know&#151;indeed, they have reflected my own words back to me&#151;that I have tried very hard in this Bill and in other Bills, as well as in my work at the department, to ensure not only that we have a vigorous national debate on design but that we win it, and we are winning it in practical and sustainable ways.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08111224000174"></a>There is no dispute between us that ensuring good quality design is a vital component of a good quality of life in our communities. People have the right to expect and to get the best. I am not convinced that explicitly placing a duty to secure good-quality design in the Bill is the most effective or appropriate way of using the planning system. There has been a chorus of support for this&#151;noble Lords around this House have been eloquent&#151;so the very least I can do is explain my reasoning. I hope that it will find sympathy, not least with those noble Lords who have great experience of local government in this House.</p>

I have referred to that before. I do not recognise the description of the planning policy statements and their effect offered by my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08111224000176"></a>Planning policy statements 1 and 3 could not be clearer or stronger. Design which is inappropriate in its context, and which fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, should not be acceptable. This is not policy wallpaper. It has been described by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, as Holy Writ in some local authorities. But the Secretary of State, when approving plans, has to be satisfied that all relevant planning policy is taken into account. Planning polices on design can act as material considerations in decisions on individual applications. Local authorities, which have had their applications turned down time and again, may have been told that they do not satisfy the criteria and that this is simply policy wallpaper, but it is not. Applications can have and are turned down on design grounds, which is the purpose of planning policy guidance. Planning bodies are required to have regard to these policies in preparing regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks.</p>

We are making progress, critically, in a progressive and sustainable way. We have been working hard with local planning authorities and PINS to make these provisions work, and we are beginning to see results. Local development frameworks, such as those for areas as different as Chelmsford, Havering and Plymouth, include clear guidance for developers on local design policies. They are embedded in local development frameworks. There is no reason why all local authorities should not include that in their local development frameworks.</p>

But the problem with the noble Lords&#146; amendment&#151;I would have thought that the Front Benches opposite would both respond to this&#151;is that it imposes a new and challenging duty on local authorities. It does so without consultation or discussion with the people who have to make it work about how best to do that. That is not how we do things. We work and consult with local authorities. We make sure that they have the resources and the skills to make something real of this. I am sure that noble Lords and RIBA have enough experience to know that this cannot and should not be done by imposition, which is what this amendment does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08111224000183"></a>Our local authorities are under great pressure. We discuss this continually in this House. They are scarce of resources. At the moment one of their priorities is to get their local development frameworks in place. We need those local development frameworks to be as broad and as sufficient as possible and to include the quality of design.

Of course local authorities can take the opportunity of their LDFs to do just what we want them to do. I hope they are listening to this debate and that they will do that. I am not offering these reasons by way of excuses. We genuinely believe that the way to deliver good design is not to add to the legislation but to ensure that existing policy works better and is applied consistently by regional and local planning bodies. We are investing in that. Our aim is genuinely to support local authorities in providing clear design strategies and policies and to advise not just local authorities but also developers. The pre-application process is as critical as anything in getting a higher standard of quality among applications. I would like to see that rather than more applications turned down on the basis of poor design. The noble Lord and I agree that we need to build the ambition, the capacity and the leadership skills so that local authorities can make it absolutely clear that they will not settle for second rate but will demand better of other people, including developers, when they are putting forward the planning applications.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08111224000186"></a>The most effective way of doing this is in partnership with key organisations in the public and the private sector. Given our debate, I am going to take the time to say what we are doing. The noble Lord, Lord Best, has alluded to some of that. We have had debates in this House about design that are focused on the need for greater skills and capacity, particularly of local planning authorities to deliver improvements. We are putting more money into training planners and making sure that design is an integral part of their training. We are also funding the Academy for Sustainable Communities and CABE to build the skills and knowledge needed to make better places. CABE is providing an increasing range of services to help local authorities with their master plans through specific scheme proposals with local design strategies. The housing and planning delivery grant helps local authorities to earn additional funding to help to finance the development of their own skills and capacities and to bring in additional skills, such as urban design expertise. The ASC has developed a leaders&#146; network, a national membership for chief executives and senior managers who lead

The CABE urban design summer school develops urban design skills for those involved in planning and regeneration in the public and private sectors, supplemented by urban design guidance.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08111224000187"></a>We have designer champions, encouraged by CABE, in place in over two-thirds of our local authorities at the strategic level. The noble Lord, Lord Best, has already addressed the issue of the CABE training programme that is seeking to develop a nationwide network of accredited assessors within local authorities to develop the expertise that will enable new housing schemes to be evaluated against the Building for Life criteria.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08111224000188"></a>We also want to promote and embed good practice and innovation through design coding. The Building for Life benchmark has already been mentioned, which provides sources of external advice on design, especially at the pre-application stage. That is very important. I should mention the recent review by RIBA on the valuable resource to be found in design panels and which highlights its positive and helpful work. We are now looking urgently at how more use can be made of these panels. We support CABE&#146;s work on the national design review. We want to see that go further, as well as the work done by regional and local panels. We are exploring with CABE and other agencies how far existing review panels are meeting the need for external advice and what more we can do to help to maximise their potential. We will look at the opportunities that the creation of the new Homes and Communities Agency will bring and we are following up the sub-national review to strengthen design review panels and other support. The HCA is now working closely with CABE to extend the resources available.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08111224000189"></a>I believe that the partnership is beginning to produce results, although I agree that we have a long way to go. We have to continue to signal that achieving good design is a key Government objective by supporting the organisations that are keen to deliver it. Above all, we must support our local authorities. Our new chief planner, who has just taken up his post, will take that forward as one of his first priorities.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08111224000190"></a>I understand that noble Lords are disappointed that it is not possible for me to accept an amendment that looks so appealing and has been explained so well by my noble friends. However, I hope that they will understand that it is not as simple as that, and that the way to achieve results is not by imposing a duty without consultation, but by working in partnership to support ambitions and recognising the challenges of building capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08111224000191"></a>My noble friend Lord Howarth concluded his eloquent speech by referring to the debates of the Victorians on the options they faced in terms of architectural style, which of course has become a sort of architectural theology. I believe that the debates we have had on design have been extremely important in that they signal to everyone in the community that it is something we in this House and the Government as a whole take very seriously.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08111224000201"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 128 takes us to the provisions in this Bill relating to appeals against determinations of planning applications in the current regime. This matter was debated at the last stage. Since then I have seen the letter which the Minister sent to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I had not, at that time, seen it. I have also had an e-mail exchange with the Minister. I have to say that I have not been reassured, although I did not expect to be reassured because there are fundamental differences of principle between us. The Government approach this as an administrative matter, &#147;this&#148; being a provision to restrict the appellant&#146;s choice of method or procedure for his appeal. The Government&#146;s assurances are that no one is disadvantaged by the proposal, and that all relevant factors will be taken into account by the Planning Inspectorate when determining the most suitable procedure. It will be for the Planning Inspectorate to take that decision, having applied criteria which I acknowledge. The Government also say that the procedure must be proportionate to the complexity of the subject matter.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08111224000202"></a>It is suggested that parties will have&#151;and currently have&#151;a free choice as to whether their appeal is determined by written representations, an informal hearing or a public inquiry. That is not the case at the moment. They can demand the opportunity to appear before and be heard by an inspector, but it is the Secretary of State&#151;or, in practice, the Planning Inspectorate&#151;who decides whether the appeal will be determined following an inquiry or an informal hearing. The current position is that parties cannot clog up the system by insisting, for instance, that a householder&#146;s extension be dealt with by an inquiry. An appellant can insist on being heard. The Planning Inspectorate will take account of the party&#146;s preferences, but can decide whether the hearing will be an informal hearing or a public inquiry. We would all expect a small household case to be dealt with by an informal hearing. The advantage of this is that parties have the opportunity to come face to face with the inspector. They can see the whites of the inspector&#146;s eyes and the inspector can see the whites of their eyes. There is great importance in this.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08111224000203"></a>The Minister recently said, in an exchange for which I have thanked her, that the Government are in no way,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000380"></a>&#147;seeking to prevent discussion or oral questioning where it is warranted&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000324"></a>but again talks about clogging up the system,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000381"></a>&#147;impacting on everyone who uses it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000325"></a>I thought to myself, &#147;Well, who is impacted on?&#148;. Yes, others will be in line to have appeals heard, but we are talking only about an appellant and the local planning authority in each case. It is not as if the third parties have rights of appeal. The world in general, in that sense, is not being prejudiced.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08111224000204"></a>Part of the Government&#146;s aim, in all that they are doing in the Bill, is to promote confidence in the planning system. We have heard quite a lot about the fact that delays undermine everyone&#146;s confidence and the system&#146;s effectiveness. Clause 191 will undermine confidence in the system. Applicants&#151;at this stage, rather, I should call them &#147;appellants&#148;&#151;will see this

<a name="08111224000205"></a><a name="81112-0005.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="81112-0005.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08111224001021"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, at one point in this argument I thought there was a difference in understanding about the issues that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has outlined. In her letter to me, the Minister suggested that the appellant could insist on an inquiry and an oral hearing. In fact, as she has made clear in her reply to the noble Baroness, the lawyer who has been involved in this says that at present parties can insist on the right to appear and be heard but the inspectorate decides whether it is to be a hearing or an inquiry. So, on that issue, there is now nothing between us.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08111224000206"></a>The difference comes down to the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was making about whether there should be an opportunity for a face-to-face discussion so that there could be oral questioning of the inspector. That is a fairly evenly balanced question. The amendment that has been tabled would take out the whole of Clause 191. I am not sure that that would be right; it would be back to the drawing board. But in these small inquiries there ought to be a right for the appellant to have the opportunity to be, as the noble Baroness put it, eyeball to eyeball with the inspector.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08111224000207"></a>This is a small matter. We are discussing, inevitably, individual householder applications; we are not talking here about big planning inquiries. It is a simply a question of a difference of view. The impression I have been left with by the correspondence and what was said in the earlier debate is that the Government are overpersuaded about the amount of time that inspectors are involved in this&#151;the number of days they allocate, and that sort of thing. Clearly anyone who is running the inspectorate has to take account of that, but in the end the planning system has to have the confidence of those who are going to use it. To tell an appellant that the whole thing has to be done by written representations and that they will not have an opportunity to see the inspector will undermine confidence in the system.</p>

<a name="81112-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08111224000208"></a>On the whole, I agree with the point the noble Baroness has put forward. It is admirable that we have eliminated what appeared to be a difference of understanding over procedure. Having done so, though, we then have to recognise the difference, and I come down on the side of the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="08111224000209"></a><a name="81112-0005.htm_spnew26"></a><b><a name="81112-0005.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="08111224001022"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, together with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has raised these issues before. As she rightly said, many of the merits of this clause have been debated in Committee. It is clear, however, that we have not provided enough reassurance and I hope in the next few minutes I will be able to provide reassurance that we have put in adequate safeguards to ensure that no one will be disadvantaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08111224000210"></a>We are introducing this measure because the existing appeals system is under severe strain and does not always serve the purposes of those who choose to appeal, or indeed those affected by an appeal, as well as it might. The system can be disproportionate in the  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_685"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 685</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way it handles cases. At the moment parties can insist on the right to appear before and be heard by an inspector by the means of either a hearing or an inquiry, regardless of the suitability of the process to the complexity of the case. This means, for example, that at the moment even the simplest cases, such as appeals relating to dormer-windows or boundary walls, can proceed via a hearing when written representations would be just as appropriate and would certainly be speedier and probably less stressful for all concerned. The use of disproportionately complex methods for appeals which do not necessarily warrant them results in inefficiencies and delays for everyone.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08111224000211"></a>I understand the view that this proposal is unnecessary because at present, even if parties choose to present their case orally, the Planning Inspectorate has the discretion to choose a hearing over the more labour-intensive and lengthy inquiry. While this is true, we should not underestimate the work involved in holding an oral hearing. Hearings may be more informal than inquiries but they still involve three days of inspector time, in contrast with an appeal dealt with by written representations, which only involves one day. The efforts that all parties put into arranging and attending a hearing process are considerable.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08111224000212"></a>We appreciate that there is a point of principle at stake here. The noble Baroness said that appellants and local planning authorities should always have the opportunity to put their case orally, even for straightforward appeal cases. We would not agree with that. We do not believe that people will be disadvantaged by having their case dealt with by written representations when it is a non-complex case which can be easily understood in writing. There is another point of principle at stake here. We should remember that this is not just about the appellant or local planning authority in any particular case; it is about serving all customers of the appeal system well.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08111224000213"></a>Opting for hearings which are unnecessary results in delays to other kinds of appeals, which may involve complex issues and merit hearings or inquiries. Furthermore, it can disadvantage third-party interests when they have to give up a day of their time and possibly travel some distance to a venue at their own cost. In many simple cases, such as those involving visual or physical impact on a neighbour, I am assured that the inspector does not learn anything that was not apparent from the written material and the site inspection. The question has to be asked: can it be right to spend more time and public money on an oral process which will take at least three times as long and lead inevitably to the delay of other cases, such as much needed housing or important infrastructure proposals, which merit a hearing or inquiry process?</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08111224000214"></a>It is important that we introduce more proportion and clarity into the appeal system so that the procedure selected better reflects the relative complexity of the issues. Ensuring that all cases are dealt with by the most appropriate appeal method will lead to quicker decisions, saving everyone time and money.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08111224000215"></a>We note that concerns have been expressed that this measure will mean that proper debate on development proposals will not take place. Let me say for the record that this is not a measure to prevent the proper  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_686"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 686</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consideration of appeals or circumvent cross-examination. What it will do is ensure that the oral debates take place where appropriate. The Government fully acknowledge that many cases are complex and need to be properly examined through oral questioning. We have no plans to stifle debate on these proposals or to push them down an appeals route which is inappropriate. There are some cases, however, which do not warrant the time and resources involved in holding a hearing and inquiry. As has already been mentioned by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, this includes most householder developments, household extensions and so on.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08111224000216"></a>It may be worth outlining the number of safeguards we have built into the process to ensure that the right procedure is selected for each case. Clause 191 would simply enable the Planning Inspectorate, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, to apply published criteria, which Ministers have approved, to determine the most appropriate procedure for appeals and call-in cases. These criteria have already been published and consulted upon in our consultation paper entitled <I>Improving the Appeals Process in the Planning System: Making it Proportionate, Customer Focused, Efficient and Well Resourced</I>, and they will be kept under review. Further consultation may be appropriate from time to time.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08111224000217"></a>The criteria will be operated in a transparent and fair way. They will ensure that any case that is complex or controversial, and thus would benefit from a hearing or inquiry, will be dealt with in this way. The criteria will also ensure that people in vulnerable groups are given a fair opportunity to put forward their case, which may mean that a hearing or inquiry is appropriate even where this would not normally be justified by the complexity of the case.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08111224000218"></a>The principal parties&#151;the applicant/appellant and local planning authority&#151;will be invited to indicate in the early stages of a case the procedure that they believe is most appropriate and why. Any representations made by the parties will be taken into account by the Planning Inspectorate when making a decision on the procedure. It is worth saying that the inspectorate has a vast depth of experience in administering and handling appeals, which it will be able to draw upon to help it when applying the criteria to determine the method. Furthermore, this decision will not be made in a vacuum and close attention will be paid to the views of the principal parties.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08111224000219"></a>In cases where there is a disagreement between the parties and the Planning Inspectorate&#146;s procedure team as to what procedure should be used, a professionally qualified inspector at assistant-director level will be called upon to make the final decision. Parties will be informed of the method that the inspectorate considers the most appropriate and why. We have every confidence that this process will work well, but are not going to take that for granted. We intend to ask the independent Advisory Panel on Standards for the Planning Inspectorate Executive Agency to look at any cases of complaint and report to us on how the system operates in practice.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08111224000220"></a>The proportionate approach that we advocate should reduce costs for everyone. For example, we should not require people to take time off work to travel to a hearing or inquiry, which could be some way from

Applicants and appellants would benefit from a reduction of time taken to determine their cases. Cases that do not need an oral hearing could be fairly and effectively handled by means of written representations with no loss of quality or equity to the process or the decision. The outcome will depend on how convincing the inspector finds the planning merits, not the method of their presentation. Case law demonstrates that the right to be heard can be satisfied by the provision of evidence through written representations.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08111224000221"></a>We are also aware that some appellants may choose an oral hearing because that process carries an option for award of costs. In tandem with this provision, we have already said that we will extend the costs regime, which currently applies to hearings and inquiries only, to the written representation procedure. This will ensure that, regardless of the procedure pursued, parties will have the opportunity to seek an award of costs in cases where unreasonable behaviour by another party has caused them unnecessary expense.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08111224000222"></a>The process will bring many benefits. The more complex cases will be dealt with by the more complex procedures, while the simpler cases will be dealt with via the simpler written representations procedure. The safeguards that I have outlined will ensure that the most appropriate procedure is used for each case, and that vulnerable people will not be disadvantaged. The process will make the system more proportionate, which in turn will make it more effective and efficient for everyone. The clause should therefore stand part of the Bill.</p>

However, the appellant can now decide whether or not to seek a hearing, as I suggest that they should continue to be able to do.

The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised the difficulties faced by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and tabled Amendment No. 432A in Committee to make the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority a local authority for the purposes of Section 237 of the Town and Country Planning Act. The Minister agreed to reflect further on the points raised.</p>

<a name="81112-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08111224000232"></a>We decided that the best way forward would be to put the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority in the same position as its predecessor, the London Fire and Civil Defence Authority, which was a precepting authority and so fell within the definition of a local authority in the TCPA, and in, by extension, the other planning Acts.</p>

As the noble Lord will know, it turns out that there has been an unintended consequence. I should perhaps apologise to all other fire and rescue authorities because the legislation that this seeks to amend seems to allow the overriding of covenants on land, which was what lay behind this. Given LFEPA&#146;s PFI programme, it now seems that not only will LFEPA not have these powers, because the section in question deals with local authorities, not local planning authorities&#151;I might have that the wrong way round&#151;but that no other fire and rescue services will have them either.</p>

I can understand that it is very difficult for the Government to be faced with this matter at this stage. However, I make a plea for it to be considered as quickly as possible and for some mechanism to be found to correct this problem. They have responded very quickly to the issue, but at that time nobody thought that it would throw up a different problem. I hope that something can quickly be tacked on to other legislation because clearly it is nonsensical not to sort this out and to enable all fire and rescue authorities to deal with covenants appropriately by placing them on the same footing as other local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08111224000241"></a>The problem arises from the classification of back gardens as brownfield sites, the emphasis on &#147;brownfield first&#148; development and high density targets being forced on local authorities. A survey of six local authorities was conducted recently comprising Bradford, Chelmsford, Nottingham, Guildford, Oxford and Tunbridge Wells, which found that a staggering 72 per cent of all brownfield site development was on gardens. Gardens are under attack as never before from planning policies  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_692"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 692</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>skewed in favour of infill, backfill and the demolition of suburban properties to increase housing density. There is currently an application to demolish two family homes in a Birmingham suburb and replace them with 71 new dwellings. This folly of the planning system actively encourages a mismatch between infrastructure and development. For example, the existing drainage system cannot cope with the extra load of housing.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08111224000242"></a>Sir Michael Pitt told the BBC that the garden grabbing surge had increased the risk of further flooding. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000382"></a>&#147;if it was just one house and one garden, this would not be an issue. It&#146;s the cumulative effect over time of many, many properties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000326"></a>It would be a great mistake to ignore Pitt and an even greater one to underestimate the strength of public feeling on the issue. This surge in garden grabbing not only puts pressure on infrastructure and increases the risk of flooding, but destroys the environment, biodiversity and places in which to relax and play safely.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08111224000243"></a>Earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, moved an amendment to protect our heritage. Are our gardens not part of that heritage? A recent survey concluded that people&#146;s health is improved by being in a green or semi-rural area, including a general feeling of well-being and a lowering of blood pressure and feelings of stress. Where has it gone wrong? I would like to be generous and say that defining gardens as brownfield land was a form of drafting that gave rise to unintended consequences. When I moved a similar amendment during the Housing and Regeneration Bill, the noble Baroness used PPS 3 and PPS 17 as her defence of existing policy. PPS 17 deals with protection and planning for open planning, sport and recreation places that communities need, but it does not mention the protection of gardens. They are brownfield sites.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08111224000244"></a>PPS 3 on housing was developed in response to recommendations in the Barker report. It talked about brownfield targets, higher densities per hectare, efficient and effective use of land and on page 15 of,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000383"></a>&#147;additional housing in established residential areas, large scale redevelopment and redesign of existing areas, expansion of existing settlements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000327"></a>That is a green light for garden grabbing: rich pickings for developers. Chris Mullin told the other place of developers flying over back gardens in his Sunderland constituency in helicopters looking for suitable sites to develop. Annex B of PPS 3 states that previously developed land is defined as,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000384"></a>&#147;land ... occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the developed land&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000328"></a>That definition specifically does not exclude gardens. It includes them within the curtilage.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08111224000245"></a>When I asked my planning officer why PPS 3 was so ineffective, he said,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000385"></a>&#147;when looking at applications, in the hierarchy of different planning considerations, meeting the Government&#146;s obsessive house building targets, the blanket imposition of density targets and the emphasis on &#145;brownfield first&#146; development, has meant that the niceties of garden preservation has been pushed way down the pecking order of considerations. And don&#146;t forget that gardens are classified as brownfield. Once the precedent has been set, it becomes increasingly difficult to refuse, so that it becomes almost impossible to mount an argument that would result in an application being turned down on appeal&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08111224000329"></a>That sums up succinctly why PPS 3 is so ineffective in protecting gardens from development. There is even a note in the House of Commons Library which says,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000386"></a>&#147;there was enough in PPS 3 to justify developers appealing with every chance of success&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000330"></a>This amendment seeks to increase protection for gardens and small urban green spaces. It does so by leaving it to local communities to decide, not to higher authorities and least of all to remote central government. It does not take away the householder&#146;s right to extend their house by permitted development. It does not prevent local authorities setting frameworks that are more permissive. But it does prevent the wishes of local people being undermined; unless in the specific case it can be shown that development is essential to achieve housing targets. Even in such cases, full consideration would have to be given to the importance of green space.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08111224000331"></a>The Government are behind the curve of public opinion, and as Chris Mullin said, they are in &#147;a state of denial&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08111224000248"></a>I am not entirely sure whether the proposed new clause as drafted is workable or how it fits in with current brownfield policies as they are expressed.

It is about our values as a society and the kind of environment and quality of life that we wish to have. Of course new housing is needed and often infill may be appropriate and should have permission. But this kind of development should not take place at any price. A civilised society does not permit developers, or even the owners of properties, to destroy gardens and urban green spaces without careful thought by decision-takers about where the public interest lies. When there is a genuine and important public interest in a development going ahead, no doubt it will do so, but it should never happen without deliberate and careful consideration. As the noble Earl said, it is the cumulative effect of small decisions that can have such devastatingly damaging consequences over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08111224000250"></a>As the noble Earl also suggested, this issue is somewhat akin to that raised in Amendment No. 64&#151;the proposed new clause on heritage&#151;which, unhappily, the Government refused to accept. That debate was about the development consent regime and this is about the town and country planning regime. In the town and country planning regime, heritage assets are indeed protected, and so also should be our heritage of gardens and green spaces. I hope that my noble friend can offer some encouragement.</p>

There are serious concerns to be addressed. Despite what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, serious issues have been raised by the amendment and the House deserves an explanation as to why we cannot accept it. We support the underlying aim of the amendment. I would not want to hear hollow laughter coming back at me from across the Chamber but it is true that we support the underlying aim of this amendment. The question is how best to stop the practice in a way that is consistent with the real pressures that face local authorities when it comes to having to build homes for people in desperate need. There is tension in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08111224000252"></a>I do not have to be persuaded how important good quality open green spaces are to the well being of people. Gardens are an extraordinarily important part of our heritage and personal joy. There is a lot on which I agree with the noble Earl, but what would placing a duty in the Bill do? What would we be doing and what would be the consequences and the unintended consequences? I shall talk about the impact that this amendment would have on planning decisions. For reasons I went into earlier, we need to be very careful about adding new statutory duties to local authorities, and we also need to be very careful indeed about identifying one aspect of the planning system as more important than others. For the planning system to work, it has to be fairly balanced. We have to make sure that we anticipate consequences because they may have a serious knock-on effect on the way the whole system works.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08111224000253"></a>I shall explain what might be some unforeseen consequences. If we were to require planning authorities to give some elements a special regard, that would imply that other elements should take second place. That would impose a level of hierarchy on the planning system that, because of the way it works, would have to be taken into consideration in decision-making, and would unbalance it. It goes against the way the system is designed to work, which is by allowing planning authorities to make judgments based on knowledge of the needs of their own area.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08111224000254"></a>Furthermore, it would unduly restrict the discretion of the Secretary of State to take account of other material considerations in the determination of appeal decisions. Appeal decisions are determined on the basis of balancing a variety of material considerations, which may include policies and guidance issued at national and regional level. This amendment would unduly restrict the Secretary of State&#146;s capacity to have regard to such guidance when considering an  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_695"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appeal against a planning authority&#146;s decision that has been made in accordance with its policies for the preservation of gardens and green spaces. We are looking at a series of unforeseen, knock-on consequences that would effectively place restrictions on the right of appeal by an individual against the decision of the local planning authority. It is not in the best interests of a fair and impartial appeal process to have the deliberations of the Secretary of State in appeal decisions restricted by requiring that such guidance be disregarded.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08111224000255"></a>As I said on the previous amendment, we would need to consult on this proposal in order to give local planning authorities and others the opportunity to put formal views on such a significant change. That is my problem with the amendment.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08111224000256"></a>I shall go into the background because the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, was very eloquent. There are real concerns about the phenomenon of garden grabbing. My argument is that this amendment will not prevent it, but that existing laws are capable of doing so. We made our policies on brownfield land areas and open spaces very clear through planning policy guidance. I shall come on to what the noble Earl said about PPS3 in a minute and especially what he quoted from his local planning officer. Planning authorities are required to take account of national policies in development plans, which provide the framework for decisions in individual planning applications. Local planning authorities are currently being encouraged to complete local development frameworks, which are designed to give clear strategic guidance about the local plan. There are statutory opportunities for local involvement in the preparation of these plans. National policies, where appropriate, can also act as material considerations in decisions on individual planning applications by planning authorities and, at appeal, by the Planning Inspectorate and the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08111224000333"></a>The history of the classification of gardens as brownfield goes back a long way and is complex. I think it goes back to 1985. Residential land has been classified as brownfield and covers all the land associated with a house or flat, including any garden as well as industrial, commercial, vacant and derelict land. The noble Earl will understand that simply to reclassify gardens so that they did not fall into the brownfield category would be extremely difficult because it would be impractical to define gardens in any way that separated the footprint of the building from the curtilage and the patios, drives or gardens that surround it. People want to do things in their gardens that may be well within their rights. Trying to separate the garden from the dwelling is extremely difficult and has serious implications for what people have a right to expect to be able to do most of the time. At the same time, it is not helpful to try to introduce blanket restrictions at national level that prevent well designed and much needed housing developments in areas where alternative land is in short supply, which applies to many boroughs in the south-east, in particular.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08111224000257"></a>The noble Earl referred to planning policy statement 3. It sounds as though his local planning authority is rather sceptical about what it can enable him to do. We had a debate on the HCA to much the same effect.  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_696"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 696</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The provision was deliberately written to try to address some of those problems. We recognise the problem of the definition that sweeps up back gardens. The provision gives local planning authorities greater flexibility on the location of housing in their areas. They can set out within their local development frameworks strong and specific local policies to protect gardens in particular areas, if that is desirable. That includes&#151;this is the way to do it&#151;setting individual brownfield targets that apply only to back gardens, effectively separating them out from derelict land and vacant sites. That gives a red light to local planning authorities.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08111224000258"></a>Many local authorities have done just that to protect against casual garden grabbing. Local authorities, especially those in areas of the country with mature residential suburbs, are under particular development pressure. They often have the choice between building out into greenfield sites or looking at what they have available that is plausible, practical, humane and fits in with what people can tolerate. They are already putting in place policies that will support them in refusing planning permission for proposals that would erode the supply of green spaces.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08111224000259"></a>I can give two examples, which are significant because they are in the south-east and are boroughs under housing pressure. The Reigate and Banstead Borough local plan contains policies to maintain and protect high-quality residential environments. The unitary development plan of the London Borough of Sutton contains policies under which the council will resist the development of back-garden land considered to be of ecological value. In PPS3, we have given local authorities the tools to make those decisions and make them work and even greater flexibility to develop policies reflecting unique circumstances. All local authorities are free to do that.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08111224000260"></a>I suggest to the noble Earl and his planning officer that they talk to some of those boroughs where they have reconciled those pressures and are using PPS3 creatively. As he said, the policy sits within a broader policy of protections for green space as a whole. He has already referred to PPG17, <I>Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation</I>, which lists what types of open space or recreational facility a planning authority may see fit to recognise as being worthy of protection within their policies. I will not repeat the list here, but it is very similar to that of the noble Earl&#146;s amendment. It also states that existing open spaces and land should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken by the local authority. That assessment must have clearly shown the open space or land to be surplus to the requirements of the local community, taking into account all the functions that open space can perform.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08111224000261"></a>We should not look to put additional legislation in place. Most of the time, this House would much rather that we proposed less legislation. The longer that I am a Minister, the more I am persuaded of that argument. We have to look for what works. We have argued consistently that making things work better should be our priority, but there is a serious problem and I am the first to acknowledge that there are concerns, not least for the reasons put forward by my noble friend Lord Howarth. Part of the problem is that, at the moment, we have only anecdotal evidence of where  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_697"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 697</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and how much garden grabbing is happening. We need better evidence. I therefore reassure noble Lords that, in the context of our 2007 White Paper commitment to review the national policy framework, we will consider how we can establish in the work that we are doing the extent of garden-grabbing and how we can strengthen and, crucially, communicate existing policies more successfully to help local planning authorities to address the problem.</p>

<a name="81112-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08111224000262"></a>We must ensure in the interim that all local authorities know that they have the tools to deliver all the improvements that we all wish to see. I mentioned that we have the happy accident of a new chief planner to adopt new priorities. I hope that he does not read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow morning, as he may be rather surprised to see himself mentioned quite so often. We can ask him to look at this and to think about how we can best communicate to local authorities what in present planning law will enable them to take positive action to protect good quality green spaces. My department does a lot of work to protect and enhance quality, not least through our green flag awards. The National Audit Office recently spoke about the enhancement of green spaces and parks, of which we are very proud. However, the noble Earl has drawn attention to a problem and we must consider what practical steps we can take to improve on what we are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08111224000271"></a>The Government have held extensive discussions with the industry over the terminology. The amendments in this group attempt to allay concerns that the Government are attempting through this legislation to introduce their previous proposals for planning gain supplement, PGS. The record will show that I was quite clear in Committee that this is not the case, but I have tabled further amendments to put to rest those concerns. These amendments delete mentions of value uplift arising from the grant of planning permission in this part of the Bill. The reference to value uplift at Clause 203(2)(b) as being something to which charging authorities should have regard would be replaced by a reference to a more general concept of the economic viability of development as a result of government Amendment No. 136B. I hope that noble Lords will recognise that this is an example of us listening closely to the industry and responding to concerns, while also making the right long-term choices for our country.

<p><a name="08111224000334"></a>This new amendment provides part of the explanation to the question of how CIL will work in London where there could be two charging authorities. I know the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, was particularly concerned about this.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08111224000272"></a>The economic viability of development will include consideration of matters such as other costs that the development is likely to face. This would include developer contributions through planning obligations or CIL contributions due to another charging authority. The independent examiner would need to assess the combined impact of both charges on development and therefore consider the impact on development viability.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08111224000273"></a>I should add that we do not envisage that the developer would be required to make two separate payments in London to two different authorities. That is clearly not efficient and we very much want to explore how a developer can make a single payment for all the CIL liability due. This would probably be to the borough, as boroughs will determine the great majority of planning applications in London, but we will consult on that. I hope that that will satisfy noble Lords.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_701"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 701</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a discount against CIL. For instance, it is suggested that where unforeseen factors were not taken into account in the setting up of the charging schedule, the imposition of CIL might render a development economically unviable.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08111224000276"></a>Our position on that was set out in our August document at paragraphs 4.18 and 4.19. This legislation will provide charging authorities with a full range of tools to ensure that CIL charges are viable. For example, the Bill requires testing of the charging schedule by an independent person and it provides us with powers to create differential rates for different circumstances&#151;paragraphs 3.61 to 3.63 of the August document&#151;such as greenfield and brownfield land.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08111224000277"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 148A and 148B propose two changes to Clause 214 to enable the charging schedule to both provide for exceptions to CIL and confer a discretionary power on a person. These amendments are supported by the industry. The changes will ensure that provision can be made to allow for exceptions and discretionary decisions within the CIL framework to be applied at the local level through the charging schedule as well as through the regulations directly. They are designed to give us the powers to ensure that CIL charging schedules are flexible local instruments. One key use of these powers could be to enable a procedure for exceptional cases, as I described earlier. We are committed to continuing what has been a very fruitful dialogue with the industry to see whether we can design something that will meet its concerns. I hope that reassures the House, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08111224000278"></a>For the record, we are not interested in designing a procedure that allows the exception to become the rule, nor a procedure in which there are protracted disputes about whether a developer can afford to pay CIL. That is not the point. Indeed, it is precisely those sorts of disputes that the industry saw as a key risk proposed by PGS. The whole purpose of CIL, and the reason the industry supports it, is to cut down on the lengthy and unpredictable negotiations which the current system is prone to and which many Members of this House are familiar with. We are trying to get away from that with this reform. We want predictability, simplicity and transparency so any procedure would need to be very carefully designed. I beg to move.</p>

Nevertheless I am grateful for the moves that the Minister has made. I draw the House&#146;s attention to the Minister&#146;s Amendment No. 153A and compare it to my Amendment No. 154A. The Minister did not say very much about her amendment; she has left that up to me.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08111224000283"></a>Amendment No. 154A is to get rid of the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007. This was a pernicious little piece of legislation, paving the way for the Planning-gain Supplement Bill which was due to come to Parliament. However, the industry rebelled so much against the Planning-gain Supplement Bill that they have moved down a level to this Planning Bill and the introduction of CIL. As long as the Planning-gain Supplement Act remains on the statute book, there is always a fear that this is what the Government really want, and when CIL fails, as it probably will in lots of areas, they can bring in the planning-gain supplement because they have this nasty little Act on the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08111224000284"></a>When I moved this amendment in Committee, the Minister responded from one of the worst briefs she has ever read out. I am delighted to see her Amendment No. 153A but why does she not go the whole hog? Why do we have to leave it for the Treasury to repeal this Act by order? Why can she not just accept my Amendment No. 154A, which repeals it now? Unless there is a very good reason, I hope the Minister will at least look at this again because there is no point in waiting for an order which we cannot discuss. We do not know when it is going to come in and we have no idea what the Treasury&#146;s thoughts are on it, whereas we can actually do the job now. If it is to be done, it is best done quickly.</p>

The Government&#146;s Amendment No. 136B represents a complete U-turn and a very welcome one for that. It is the amendment which gets away altogether from the suggestion that CIL should be charged on the increase in value as the result of a planning permission. As I said in Committee, that has been a fixation of Governments for decades, going right back to the Community Land Act 1975. At last it has now dawned

I warmly welcome that, but it leaves one with the impression that Ministers are making up this Bill as they go along.</p>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="08111224000287"></a><a name="81112-0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81112-0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08111224001037"></a>Baroness Valentine:</b> My Lords, I want to speak in particular to Amendments Nos. 129A and 136B, but the point I shall make also stands in support of government Amendment No. 135A, which is grouped separately. Taken together, these amendments are extremely welcome. They address some of the principal concerns of London First and the British property industry regarding the proposals for the community infrastructure levy. Amendment No. 129A removes the reference to &#147;land value&#148; from the Bill. I will not rehearse again my contribution in Committee save to say that, as CIL is not a tax on land value, it must not be allowed to be misconstrued as such. The amendment resolves that issue, as does Amendment No. 135A, which makes a further reference to land value in Clause 202(9).</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08111224000288"></a>Equally welcome is Amendment No. 136B, which makes it clear that a charging authority must have regard to the &#147;economic viability of development&#148; when setting the CIL. It must not be set at a level that would stop land being brought forward for development, especially in these challenging economic times.</p>

That in itself is welcome. I have some sympathy with the difficulty of my noble friend who wants a clear and clean solution to the issue of the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007. Equally, I listened to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who raised the valid point that it is a piece of legislation that has only been empowered to be brought forward. However, I understand that it was not brought forward because it had not been drafted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08111224000291"></a>I want to go back to what the Minister said about developing a system for a single payment in London to be paid through the boroughs. Again, I am grateful to hear about that. However, it may well leave the mayor in a difficult position because at the moment each London borough will be able to set a level for CIL that will have to be agreed by using a single viability test after the mayor has produced his CIL assessment. The process is fine, but I merely observe that the mayor may well not be able to set a single CIL rate; there may have to be a separate rate for each borough because each one has the right to set its own CIL rate. The viability test is on a combination of the two. That might mean that the overall London CIL rate perforce has to be varied borough by borough. It will put the mayor in a complicated situation. It is a point that the Minister may want to think about.</p>

This has required a lot of close discussion with the industry to understand its concerns, and I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I should say that I am quite happy to make U-turns if they are in the direction of common sense and the workability of legislation. It was not so much a U-turn, but that we are on a long road and we have been able to get there in the end.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08111224000294"></a>I want to speak to government Amendment No. 153A, which amends Clause 217 to allow the Treasury to repeal the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act by order, and Amendment No. 160A to Clause 232, which provides that the order would,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000388"></a>&#147;extend to each Part of the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000335"></a>In that context, I should like to address the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. We have a problem in that we are dealing with a non-existent piece of legislation in the terms of his amendment. I was conscious that we debated this issue at the very end of a rather exhausting day in Committee and that both this amendment and those that followed it suffered because we were all rather conscious of the clock. I therefore stand reproved by noble Lords who said that I had not given a full answer to the issue. This is an opportunity for me to explain our amendment and make the position clear.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08111224000295"></a>The fact is that the Act in question is an extremely short and technical piece of legislation that contains no tax-raising powers. It is purely an administrative tool. It is significant to note that in all our conversations with industry bodies, none thought it significant enough to lobby for its repeal. However, the noble Earl has asked why we do not go the whole hog on this. We believe strongly that CIL will be an effective tool for local authorities with which to raise additional funding for infrastructure, but it is sensible and proper to make sure that it works in practice on the ground before we start to unpick the steps that were taken previously just to facilitate the introduction of PGS.</p>

<a name="81112-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08111224000296"></a>Ministers at the Dispatch Box in either House are often told that the Government tend to rush in before the evidence of change actually working can be assessed. This is an instance where we think that we are right to be pragmatic and to commit to assessing the impact of CIL. There is nothing underhand or sinister about it, and it certainly does not mean that we are setting CIL up to fail so that we may return to PGS by a tortuous route. That would not make any sense. There is impressively wide consensus that CIL is the right way forward&#151;and that consensus includes Members on the Benches opposite. It has taken several years of debate and a huge amount of hard work on all sides to reach this point, so why on earth would we throw such consensus away by deliberately and not very subtly undermining a policy that everyone agrees has a good chance of success and is necessary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08111224000297"></a>The Government will want to consider a number of factors in assessing whether CIL is fully delivering its objectives, and these include the uptake of CIL by local authorities, the amounts raised for infrastructure and that the CIL process is operating at a proportionate cost for developers and local authorities. The Government want to consider those factors in the round so that we reach a balanced and sensible assessment of CIL once it has had a chance to bed in. The problem with the amendment tabled by the noble Earl&#151;a problem that has arisen consistently with this proposal&#151;is that it would not give us that ability. That is why I am afraid that I cannot accept his amendment. However, under the circumstances, I hope that he will accept in good faith our proposals.</p>

Government Amendments Nos. 129B to 129G amend the table set out in Clause 199(3). The table offers guidance to users of Part 11 about the content of the clauses. The table needs to be updated to reflect the existence of new clauses. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, may recall our discussion about a similar amendment that he tabled in Committee. I asked him to withdraw his amendment because I thought that the Public Bill Office would update the table as necessary. The Public Bill Office updated the table when the Bill was printed on its introduction to the House of Lords to reflect new clauses introduced in the other place. However, we are now advised that the table must be updated by amendment. Amendments Nos. 129B to 129G achieve that, taking on board amendments provided for new clauses which we have tabled for Report. We regret misleading the noble Earl, but can assure him that we thought the amendment of the table would simply be a formality when we discussed it in Committee.</p>

Of course, the preparatory work that a charging authority does must be robust. To this end, the amendment provides for regulations to set out how such work must be undertaken, and could set down the minimum standard such work must satisfy in order to be relied upon by the charging authority. Government Amendment No. 161A is supplemental to Amendment No. 136C and amends Clause 233 to allow the Secretary of State to commence the new provision which Amendment No. 161A would insert by order, rather than automatically on commencement of the Act, or two months later. This will allow time for the Secretary of State to prepare regulations setting out how preparatory work should be undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08111224000302"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 137A and 137B provide for regulations to put in place a sensible mechanism to rectify mistakes that may, with the best of intentions, slip into the report of the independent person examining the charging schedule or the final charging schedule approved by the charging authority. We do not want the charging authority to have to go through the entire process of revising the schedule in order to correct an error. A mechanism called the slip rule exists to correct minor errors in relation to planning decisions. This amendment allows for a similar mechanism to be provided in relation to CIL charging schedules. This provision is not about allowing the independent person belatedly to change their mind about their decision, or the charging authority to substitute their preferred decision for that of the independent examiner. Regulations could contain certain safeguards as to how this power can be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08111224000303"></a>Government Amendment No. 140B clarifies who any proceedings for judicial review of a decision on an appeal on a matter of fact under Clause 207 would be brought against. Government Amendment No. 140B specifies that the defendant would not be the individual valuer or district valuer who determined the appeal, but rather the public body that employs them, that is to say, the commissioners of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. This is not an unusual arrangement. For example, in relation to planning appeals, or appeals against the refusal of listed building consent, determined by individual planning inspectors, any claim for judicial review is against the Secretary of State, rather than the individual. This provision puts in place sensible protections for the individual decision-maker when acting in a public capacity, not least against the costs of defending a claim for judicial review, but it returns the recourse to judicial review of a decision, which is crucial for confidence in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08111224000304"></a>Government Amendment No. 146C provides that a power in Part 11 of the Bill, about the publication of, for example, the charging schedule or other document, includes the power to make provision to make it available for public inspection. This power could be used to specify that charging authorities must make copies of the charging schedule available for inspection by the public during office hours at their principal offices, for example. Clause 208(8) already contains a similar provision but is limited in its application to Clause 205(5)(a), which is about the publication of a list of the projects to be funded by CIL. It becomes redundant as a result of this amendment and government Amendment No. 142C therefore deletes it.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08111224000305"></a>The powers relating to accounting and reporting requirements in Clause 208(7)(a) and (c) only apply to charging authorities and bodies to which a charging authority might pass CIL, but Clause 209(5) allows regulations to empower or require other authorities to collect CIL charged by another authority. For instance, a London borough might collect CIL on behalf of the mayor. Therefore, government Amendment No. 143A extends the powers in Clause 208(7) to be able to impose requirements on how collecting authorities make accounts about CIL and reporting on its collection. This is so that requirements similar to those imposed on charging authorities for the purposes of transparency and accountability can be placed on them.</p>

Such provision is important if charging authorities are to collect CIL effectively. This amendment will allow regulations to set out the detail of how CIL is to be recovered in such situations. One possible model is paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 to the Business Improvement Districts Regulations 2004, which provides that, in essence, executors or administrators are liable to pay any outstanding liability out of the assets and effects of the deceased. This amendment enables CIL regulations to provide for a similar approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08111224000307"></a>Government Amendments No. 145A, 145B and 145C propose changes to Clause 211, which would ensure that the authority which collects and enforces CIL can be made subject to the compensation provisions set out in regulations under Clause 211, even if they are not the charging authority. Currently, Clause 211 on compensation provides that CIL regulations may only make provision for charging authorities. However, charging authorities might delegate the collection&#151;and therefore the enforcement&#151;of CIL to another authority. This scenario might arise through a voluntary arrangement between authorities, or regulations might require one authority to collect for another, as I have already said.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08111224000308"></a>It is sensible to ensure that we have the power to make any authority enforcing CIL liable to pay any compensation for loss or damage resulting from inappropriate enforcement activity. It is therefore vital that the Bill contains provisions to make regulations for that. It is also sensible to make provision for regulations to be able to require charging authorities to use CIL money to pay any compensation arising from CIL enforcement actions, rather than other council budgets potentially being put at risk. Government Amendment No. 145D expands Clause 211(5) to provide for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08111224000309"></a>Government Amendment No. 147A expands Clause 213 to enable the Secretary of State to give guidance to the independent examiners who will undertake the examination in public of the charging schedule. The provision could be used to provide guidance for the examiners about the conduct of the examination and the types of procedure that might be appropriate. This is not about fettering the discretion of the independent person to do what is appropriate in the circumstances of each case, but would help to ensure consistency of approach and minimum standards for examinations. I beg to move.</p>

It is simply, as the noble Lord said, a matter of fact. I do not intend to move my amendment.</p>

I shall take them in sequence. On Amendment No. 136C, I find it startling that an authority had to be given permission to consult. This is rather different from taking some other, more technical, preparatory steps. If regulations are required for an authority to consult on anything, there is something deeply wrong. On the errors amendment, the noble Lord referred to the slip rule. Here, I speak partly to Amendment No. 137A. I am glad to have confirmation that this is not intended to deal with errors of judgment. I still find it difficult to understand what &#147;error&#148; means in this context. Will he point the House towards how it is restricted in the way that he has said? Amendment No. 137A says that examiners may,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000390"></a>&#147;reconsider their decisions with a view to correcting errors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000336"></a>The term &#147;reconsider&#148; suggests something rather wider.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08111224000313"></a>My Amendment No. 143ZA is completely the opposite of an amendment that the Government have tabled. I seek to take out from Clause 209(5), regarding collection, the words &#147;or require&#148; from the wording,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08111224000373"></a>&#147;The regulations may permit or require a charging authority or other public authority to collect CIL charged by another authority&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000337"></a>Regulations not just to permit the charging authority but to require another public authority to collect CIL charged by another authority go too far. Reference has been made to the position in London. I do not oppose the right of the mayor in London to levy CIL, but it raises an awful lot of issues about the mechanisms for collection, which I am not clear have been dealt with, and the administrative burden on the boroughs. There is work to be done with the London boroughs on how that will operate, and my amendment would mean that it would be a matter of negotiation between the boroughs and the mayor.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08111224000314"></a>Amendment No. 143 would consolidate the imposition on the boroughs. I do not think that is the right way to go, and the provision is opposed by London Councils, the umbrella group for the London boroughs. For instance, can the boroughs charge an administrative fee to meet the costs of collection and enforcement? This is not just a London issue. We would support co-operation and joint working but not top-down arrangements.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08111224000315"></a>I also oppose government Amendment No. 143A because it applies Clause 208(7)(c), which says that regulations may,</p>
<ul><a name="08111224000391"></a>&#147;require a charging authority to report on actual or expected charging, collection and application of CIL&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111224000338"></a>How can a non-charging authority report on expected charging applications&#151;or indeed anything much?</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08111224000316"></a>Government Amendment No. 145A would provide for a non-charging authority to be required to pay compensation under Clause 211, as has been explained. I query whether it is right if, for instance, the charge is wrongly applied by the charging authority, as distinct from the collecting authority, for the non-charging authority to be put in the frame for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08111224000317"></a>Under government Amendment No. 145D, regulations would require a charging authority to apply CIL for expenditure on compensation. Why &#147;require&#148; rather than &#147;permit&#148;? Is it right for the Government to apply the ring-fencing that seemed to be implicit in what the Minister said?</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08111224000318"></a>I have made a number of detailed comments on this, and this is the first point at which I am speaking on CIL. I have amendments that, in the way that these things are done, will come later, in which I will seek to persuade the House that this is not the point at which to proceed with CIL in the way that the Government wish. I will not rehearse those arguments now, but my taking part in the debates on the earlier groupings should not be regarded in any way as a signal that I am putting my hands up and resiling from the view that is inherent in the amendments grouped with Amendment No. 131. Trying to be constructive, although I might not have sounded it just now with that list of questions, I think that there are issues still to be pursued.</p>

I shall respond first to her Amendment No. 143ZA, which would remove the flexibility for CIL regulations to put in place the more efficient and effective arrangements for collecting CIL. She has mentioned London, where both the mayor and the borough would be charging authorities. It is likely to be simplest and clearest for developers if the borough collects CIL rather than the mayor, because the boroughs deal with the vast majority of planning applications that CIL would relate to. We are discussing the best way forward with London authorities, and the provisions in Clause 209(5) give us the flexibility to put the most appropriate arrangements in place through CIL regulations. Any authority that undertakes work on CIL should be resourced to do so, and we are considering how best to achieve that for those authorities that regulations may require to collect CIL on behalf of others. I assure the House that we will return to that at Third Reading. I hope I have said enough to convince the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08111243000003"></a>With regard to the authority needing powers to consult, the provision is to ensure that charging authorities have the power to undertake preparatory work. The law is not clear on this, and it avoids assurance on consultation specifically. It allows for that before the CIL regulations are fully in place. In respect of the comments the noble Baroness made on the government amendments, I will write to her formally with detailed responses if she would be content with that.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08111243000025"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The first two amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 130 and 149, address the issue of whether regulations made under Part 11, dealing with CIL, should be approved by both Houses of Parliament or only by another place, which is what is proposed in the Bill. Amendment No. 130 is a paving amendment; the substantive amendment is Amendment No. 149, which we will come to eventually, but we intend to debate the issue on this amendment.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08111243000026"></a>I moved much the same amendment in Committee. At the end of a long Thursday sitting on the Bill, there were very few noble Lords in the House. Nevertheless, my amendment then had support from all parts of the House, and I was encouraged to return to the attack. In Committee, I drew attention to the important report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I am delighted to see its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his place today; it is valuable that we shall have the benefit of his advice on this. Briefly, the DPRC recommended that the power to approve CIL regulations should be the subject of control of both Houses. The Government had argued that the imposition of a charge was a matter for the financial privilege of the House of Commons. There are, however, two important arguments against this. The first is that the Committee pointed out that under earlier legislation some aspects of existing charges are subject to the procedure of both Houses. They listed national insurance, council tax, business rates, the business improvement district levy, the climate change levy and a couple of others. Why is CIL different? Why does it not follow the same pattern as those  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_711"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 711</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>earlier charges? It is not paid into the Consolidated Fund or any similar fund. It is spent by the body which raises the charge.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08111243000027"></a>The second argument is more procedural. It is not for this House, or indeed for the Government, to assert financial privilege on behalf of another place. That is a matter solely for the other place. That is clear from the first two sentences of the <I>Companion to the Standing Orders</I>. I quote paragraph 7.173:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08111243000105"></a>&#147;Each House of Parliament is guardian of its own privileges. It alone may invoke them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81112-0009.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08111243000028"></a>If Part 11 were like a Finance Bill or similar piece of legislation, we would not be entitled to table amendments; we would not be entitled to debate the Bill at all, except in a very general way. Yet we spent an entire day in Committee on CIL and we will spend most of the rest of today doing the same. If another place wishes to claim financial privilege, it is up to it. It is not the business either of the Government or of this House to do it for the other place.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08111243000029"></a>When the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, replied to the debate on October 23, she did so, if I may put it kindly, very briefly. She did not, however, attempt to reply to those two arguments but contented herself simply with reasserting the Government&#146;s views that were put to the Delegated Powers Committee. Those views were firmly rejected by the Committee in its report. I look forward to listening to the speeches of noble Lords and in particular to what we shall hear from the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I beg to move.</p>

That issue is the extent to which the House of Commons could or should reserve to itself the sole right to make regulations in connection with a levy such as CIL. I am speaking in this debate because this was an issue which, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, was considered by the Delegated Powers Committee in its 12th report. What I will say broadly reflects its conclusions.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08111243000031"></a>It may be helpful if I explain the constitutional background. As all of us know, your Lordships&#146; House has no power to intervene in the raising of taxes which go into the Consolidated Fund. This Bill contains no such provisions. Part 11 creates a framework. It confers on local authorities a power&#151;not an obligation&#151;to impose on the owners or developers of land, not on the general public, a levy which will be paid to the charging authority to help defray the cost of infrastructure needed to serve that development. As the Bill was amended in Committee to exclude the Secretary of State from the list of possible charging authorities, none of this money will go to the Government.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08111243000032"></a>It is clear from the passage in the <I>Companion to Standing Orders</I> of your Lordships&#146; House, which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, quoted, and also from <I>Erskine May</I>, that it is entirely legitimate and proper for your Lordships&#146; House to vote to amend Clause 214(2) so that it requires the approval of both Houses for regulations. If such an amendment in your Lordships&#146; House infringes the privilege of the House of Commons, the House can either insist on its privilege or waive it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08111243000033"></a>That subject is dealt with in some detail in chapters 32 and 33 of <I>Erskine May</I>. What emerges from a study of those chapters, however, is a fog. It reminds me of a story of my father&#146;s when he was lecturing at Oxford University. One of his students came to him after the lecture and said, &#147;Well, Professor Goodhart, before you lectured I was confused. Now I am still confused but at a much higher level&#148;. That is my reaction to what I have obtained from <I>Erskine May</I>. It does not provide answers to some important questions. What is the boundary between matters which give rise to privilege and those which do not? Are there any principles or precedents which guide the House of Commons as to whether it should waive privilege or not? If so, what are those principles and precedents? None of this is clear.</p>

<a name="81112-0009.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08111243000034"></a>So far as we do get guidance from <I>Erskine May</I>, the most relevant guidance is that given in two passages in chapter 33. The first of these is at page 919, where it says,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08111243000106"></a>&#147;the Commons have long included not only bills dealing with the public expenditure and revenue but also bills which deal with local revenues or charges as matters to which their privilege extends&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111243000094"></a>The second is at page 926, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08111243000107"></a>&#147;The Commons now generally waive their claim regarding amendments made to bills that they have sent to the Lords, dealing with local revenues, more especially when those amendments affect charges upon the people incidentally only and are made for the purpose of giving effect to the legislative intentions of the Commons&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111243000095"></a>Those two passages suggest to me that Clause 212 is indeed within the privileges of the House of Commons, but that it would be normal for the House of Commons to waive its privilege if requested to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08111243000035"></a>The committee took the view that Clause 214(2) should therefore be considered carefully by your Lordships&#146; House. There are many precedents here for a full waiver of privilege by the Commons, some of them in which a stronger case for waiver could be made than in this case. In the 12th report, the committee cited as charges subject to the procedure in both Houses those various forms of taxation or levy which were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Some of them are far wider in scope than CIL and several of them affect ordinary citizens, whereas CIL affects only those who carry out or profit from development.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08111243000036"></a>I do not think it would be right, therefore, for your Lordships&#146; House to accept Clause 214(2) as it stands. I can see no justification for leaving the whole of the regulation-making power in Part 11 in the hands of one House only. Even if there is&#151;as I think there is&#151;an argument for leaving it to the House of Commons to approve regulations which identify who is subject to the levy and which govern the amount of it, I can still see no serious argument for excluding your Lordships&#146; House from regulations on matters such as procedure for CIL, the method of its collection or of its enforcement.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08111243000037"></a>Not all these regulations would need the affirmative resolution procedure that they have been given in this Bill. Looking at this, the Government might consider that some of them should be lowered to the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08111243000038"></a>It is therefore my intention to vote for the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. If your Lordships&#146; House then accepts them, the House of Commons can decide, when the Bill goes back there, the action appropriate for it to take. That is a more appropriate procedure than simply excluding your Lordships&#146; House from any power to make regulations, without enabling us to express our view. The Commons can then consider whether it will exercise its powers rather than waive its privilege, and, if so, to what extent. I support Amendments Nos. 130 and 149.</p>

I knew that that was the right thing to do, and was further convinced having listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. I am also convinced that I was absolutely right to let my noble friend Lord Goodhart speak first. I know that he was speaking in his capacity as chairman of the Delegated Powers Committee, whose reports suggests that the House may wish to consider certain matters.

We are talking about regulations being put together to govern the application of a locally set, raised and applied levy. That levy is not a general tax, because it goes from a landowner or developer to pay both public and private agencies for infrastructure rendered. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, none of it goes to the Government.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08111243000042"></a>Parliament is not setting the levy. It is not even saying to what infrastructure it should contribute if it is levied at all. Parliament, which of course includes this House, merely wishes to apply its expertise to how this tax will work, as we should be doing now in the Bill and would be if Part 11 were not quite so anorexic&#151;anorexic being one stage better than skeletal, as Part 11 was until quite recently. We have been floundering around, dealing with CIL, without really being able to get to grips with the detail of how it will work in practice&#151;although, because of the expertise in this House, we have made significant progress.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08111243000043"></a>This is a planning Bill, and CIL is essentially to be a local charge on development permitted by planning permission. I hope that this House will continue to be able to apply its expertise to how the new regime will work. The Minister has mentioned several times during the passage of the Bill the fact that we have that expertise in this House. I hope that she will allow the planning system to avail itself, constructively and affirmatively, of that expertise.</p>

It is not a partisan matter. It is a matter of the position of this House, and the proper relationship of the two Houses. I simply cannot believe that, if it is considered in the cold light of day, the Government and the Commons should think it unreasonable that this House should not have a voice, at least on some parts of the regulatory framework. Even if my noble friend cannot say that she can accept the amendment today, I hope that she will make one last effort to ensure that the matter is considered again. It would be a great pity for this House if the Government, who have listened so carefully on so many aspects of the Bill, were not able to listen on this.</p>

Noble Lord will recall that government Amendment No. 149A, which we discussed in an earlier grouping, makes provision for the procedures to be used in relation to the two order-making powers in Part 11: the power in Clause 210(10) which relates to the caps on penalties for criminal offences in Clause 210(9); and the power in new Clause 217(2) which relates to the repeal of the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007 which government Amendment No. 153A introduces. Given that Amendment No. 149A makes this provision about the procedures to be followed for these order-making powers,

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08111243000051"></a>On the substance of the group and Amendments Nos. 130 and 149 of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I tried to set out in Committee why I felt that the regulation-making procedure in Part 11 should remain with the other place, as Clause 214(2) provides. We all agree that delegated legislation involving financial matters is, by a well established convention, something over which the other House has a privilege. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, did us a service by reading <I>Erskine May</I>, because there is no doubt that this is a pretty treacherous, and not just foggy, piece of procedure. It is complicated. I know that the noble Lord&#151;</p>

Therefore it would be appropriate to ask the House of Commons whether it wishes to waive its privilege, rather than dealing with a Bill that, from the beginning, says simply that all these regulations are a matter for the House of Commons.</p>

I shall proceed with my argument and address some of the issues that he raised.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08111243000054"></a>The DPRRC noted examples of where the other place has waived its privilege over financial matters. It listed regulations relating to national insurance, council tax and business rates that involved this House. However, the precedents are mixed. The other place asserted its privilege over amendments from this House to the community charge provisions in the Local Government Finance Act 1988. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said that it was a matter of custom and practice; and that custom and practice have been variable. Part of my case is that, no matter whether or not we consider it to be a local charge, it is about raising revenue.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08111243000055"></a>We have set out why the CIL clauses in Part 11 are broad and enabling. We are building on experience of standard charging; but this is a new departure for the planning system, and it will evolve as people become more familiar and comfortable with it, as happened with Section 106. One problem with getting this right is that we do not have the luxury of an annual finance Bill that we can use to tidy up planning legislation. These are much rarer animals and we need to have flexibility over time to reflect on the lessons learnt from the application of CIL in practice, and from the different arrangements in different areas. The industry agrees with that.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08111243000056"></a>We responded to the DPRRC&#146;s concerns that we should add more detail to the Bill. The most recent report, which the committee did wonderfully well to produce this morning, says that it no longer considers CIL to be skeletal. I will argue concerning future amendments that it is not even anorexic, but a fully grown and rather flourishing infant. The CIL regulations  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_716"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 716</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will contain more elements than regulations for other regimes, and those elements could have a character of a sort that the other place normally reserves to itself.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08111243000057"></a>I listened very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said about the fact that there were distinctions to be made between the sorts of regulations that might come forward. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, would provide for all CIL regulations to be subject to the affirmative resolution of that House. However, in its 13th report the DPRRC said,</p>
<ul><a name="08111243000109"></a>&#147;except in so far as the House considers that provision in Part 11 of the Bill is related to matters over which the Commons will claim financial privilege&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111243000096"></a>which seems to acknowledge implicitly that the other House might well do so for at least some of Part 11.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08111243000058"></a>Noble Lords have already made it clear that I cannot speak for the other place: I cannot determine what the other place does. If the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is accepted by this House, the other place will take a view on whether its financial privilege has been infringed, and whether it wishes to waive it. It will only do so once the Bill is again before it.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08111243000059"></a>I have listened hard, both in Committee and today. I have taken full note of the comments made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. We are still of the view that it is a financial matter and that it is appropriate that the regulation-making procedure should remain with the House of Commons.</p>

How can the other place decide whether to waive its privilege if we do not put this amendment into the Bill? It will simply go back and that will be that.

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08111243000067"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, noble Lords may ask why I have put down this Prayer against a change that is done and dusted. The GMC board is already slimmed down, appointments are made, and the regulation that sets out a proposed constitution for the General Medical Council is already in action. Earlier, we debated an order on specialist registration, which I supported.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08111243000068"></a>In essence, the order provides details of the composition of the council. From 1 January 2009, the GMC will have a revised constitution consisting of 24 members; 12 lay and 12 professional. All will be appointed by the Privy Council, but in practice the function will be delegated to the Appointments Commission. This signals the end of self-regulation. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, who apologises that she is unable to be in her place tonight, sent out a clarion call during the proceedings on the Health and Social Care Bill, when she tabled an amendment on the General Dental Council. Medicine failed to heed her warnings at the time. That is precisely why I have laid this Prayer.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08111243000069"></a>This change is hugely controversial within the medical profession. The president of the Royal College of Surgeons is shocked by the full implications of the order. The president of the Royal College of Physicians feels that the profession acquiesced too easily in the wake of Shipman. Of course, we all know that none of the changes will ever detect another Shipman. The changes have all been put in place, and the list of appointees has been on the GMC website since October. Now, we are effectively rubber stamping the details. I am not convinced that this is the right way to approach something that will fundamentally alter the relationship of the profession with its regulatory body.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08111243000070"></a>Let me briefly run through the background. The Government announced their intention to change the way in which doctors and other healthcare professionals in the UK are regulated in February 2007 in the White Paper <I>Trust, Assurance and Safety</I><I>&#151;</I><I>The Regulation of  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_719"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 719</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Health Professionals in the 21st Century</I>. Following the White Paper, the Health and Social Care Bill was introduced on 15 November 2007, and it included provisions to amend the legislation governing doctors and the other health regulatory bodies. The Bill gained Royal Assent on 21 July.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08111243000071"></a>Concern was expressed at the time by parts of the medical profession that the proposed changes, taken as a whole, would lead to a loss of professionally-led medical regulation. That has two adverse consequences for patient care. It potentially compromises doctors in their role of speaking out for their patients, and it furthers risk-averse behaviour, which promotes defensive practice. Defensive practice is not necessarily practice that is in the best interests of the patient, but it is defensive for the doctor.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08111243000072"></a>The NHS is a state-owned monopoly employer. With an appointed regulatory body, doctors could feel that their professionalism is compromised. Clinical judgment requires a synthesis of medical knowledge with the specific issues for an individual patient, aiming to achieve the best treatment for the individual patient. If professionalism is diminished and the profession is demoralised, there are consequent risks to patient care. The vast majority of doctors perform well and safely and acknowledge that it is imperative that patients are protected from the small number of cases of unsafe doctors. Therefore, any measures which promote excellence in medical practice and help to reduce instances of poor standards, negligence, or, sadly, criminality, among doctors must be supported.</p>

<a name="81112-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08111243000073"></a>I acknowledge that some improvements to the regulation of the medical profession were needed. However, during the passage of the then Health and Social Care Bill, the British Medical Association voiced doctors&#146; concerns that any reform must be workable in practice and maintain a system in which both the public and doctors can have confidence that fairness and justice will be delivered.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81112-0011.htm"/>


<a name="81112-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08111243000074"></a>The greatest protection for the public is to have a system where doctors feel able to admit to faults or failings in themselves and colleagues, confident in the knowledge that these will be dealt with in a fair, sensitive and supportive manner. The trouble is that the profession, especially the juniors, feels demoralised. Some juniors have described the GMC to me as being just there to &#147;catch you out however hard you try to do your best&#148;.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08111243000075"></a>Over recent years, the GMC has taken action to amend its constitution, reducing the size of the council. Lay members have developed a much greater involvement in its activities and the proportion of lay members has increased, improving the GMC&#146;s accountability to the public and helping the council operate more strategically.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08111243000076"></a>Reducing the size of the council to 24 certainly makes it more manageable but only 12 of its members are medical. This means that it is no longer a council for professionally led regulation, which has undermined the profession&#146;s confidence in its regulator. To help retain the profession&#146;s confidence in the regulator, should not the council be chaired by a doctor? If the chair is lay, at least it should be mandatory that the vice-chair is medical&#151;a model to be found in the Bar Standards Board. Why have such provisions not been  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_720"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 720</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>incorporated in the order? Furthermore, why do the medical members of the council have to be appointed by the Privy Council? Why are they not elected by the medical profession from a long list produced by the Appointments Commission? Such a process might ensure the credibility of the regulator with the profession that it regulates.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08111243000077"></a>To be quorate, only 14 members need to be present. There is no stipulation that at least seven of them must be medical. Why not? The council could have 12 lay and two tame medics there and could theoretically make momentous decisions that will affect the viability of the professionals. I am sure the Minister will try to reassure me about the type of decision that they will make, but in reality one may hope for the best but must plan for the worst.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08111243000078"></a>I am not simply resisting change for the sake of it, but want to record the current demoralisation of the profession. Medical practice is becoming increasingly complex, with increasingly complex science underpinning best practice. These complexities must be understood by the regulator.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08111243000079"></a>The Minister has the opportunity tonight to put some assurances on the record because they are important for the profession as a whole. In particular, I hope that she will be able to assure me that the changes to the constitution will not lead to undue Department of Health or government influence over the way in which the GMC works.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08111243000080"></a>I would also appreciate an assurance that doctors will not be compromised in their ability to use their clinical independence to get the best treatment for their individual patients, even if it means speaking out, taking risks and working outside the guidelines or even sometimes beyond the boundaries of a protocol.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08111243000081"></a>As Dr Buckman, the chairman of the BMA's council working party on the GMC, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08111243000108"></a>&#147;These far reaching changes have effectively amounted to the end of professionally led regulation.

</ul>
<p><a name="08111243000097"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply on these issues and beg to move.</p>

One of the best ways is to meet once a week to discuss all complications and deaths. These meetings are extremely useful. The key is to have a chairman who is senior and when some junior member of the staff confesses to some complication, the senior guy says that we all make mistakes and then recounts his own mistakes. People are then disarmed and compelled to be honest. That is the way to get to the bottom of what is going on. It becomes rather like the general confession and just as therapeutic.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08111243000084"></a>In a debate in your Lordships&#146; House, there was a discussion about some mistakes there had been in the Department of Health&#151;I am sure very few. I suggested  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_721"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, that, as we have both conducted these meetings, perhaps the Department of Health might like to have a weekly meeting to discuss all their mistakes of the previous week&#151;no deaths of course. That idea went down like a lead balloon.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08111243000085"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness on this business of the chairman. It looks like he could be lay or medical, but if he is the former, the balance is shifted and is no longer 50:50. The Government might suggest to the new GMC that there be a vice-chairman. If the chairman is lay, the vice-chairman could be medical and that would balance things up. I gather that is what obtains with the barristers. The chairman of their governing committee is lay, but they always have a professional barrister vice-chair. That might be one way out of it.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08111243000086"></a>Regarding the quorum, I think it is 14, which means that there could be just two doctors present and 12 lay people. That might not be a very satisfactory state of affairs. After all, medicine is becoming much more complicated and technical. One does need at least 50 per cent of the people there knowing something about the subject in some detail. I wonder whether the Government would suggest to the GMC or find some arrangement whereby that situation could be corrected. We are not trying to scupper the whole thing at this stage, but it would be well worth while if those few recommendations could be implemented.</p>

It gives me a chance to come out. I belong to a minority in the population. The vast majority of people take one look at a governing document or instrument and their eyes glaze over. I have an affliction. I am in that small minority who look at a governing document and their eyes light up. It is all to do with my professional background, working with voluntary organisations. I was absolutely delighted to sit and look at this. I have to say that I listened with great care to the arguments made by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord McColl. It would be tempting to go back through arguments which have raged in this House since the Shipman case and through the then Health and Social Care Bill. The time has now come to accept that those arguments have been had and decisions have been taken and it is time to move on. Central to the reform of the GMC is that it should become an altogether different body, which will, I hope, continue to command the respect of professionals but will be held in greater respect by lay members of the public. That would enable it to move forward in a world in which its job of regulating doctors and medical practice is changing, as has been noted.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08111243000088"></a>In that spirit I want to make a couple of points and ask a couple of questions. First, as regards the size of the GMC council, it is now accepted practice in the business world and that of charities that if you put more than 20 people into a room, you will never get sensible discussion or sensible decision-making. Therefore, reducing the size of the council is regarded&#151;there is evidence to support this view&#151;as an aid to better decision-making. However, we should remember that we are talking about a model of accountability. The GMC council&#146;s primary purpose is to be an accountable  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_722"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 722</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>body. How it goes about fulfilling its duties in respect of governance and oversight is not a matter that should be addressed in the document we are discussing because there is an infinite variety of ways in which any professional body&#151;of which the GMC is one&#151;can do that. Those matters are not set out in the document, nor confined to the parameters set out in it. My understanding is that above and beyond these legal minima, the GMC conducts a great deal of its business at its own discretion. We should not become confused about those two matters. I believe that the bulk of the work will be carried out not by the council but rather by professional bodies. However, the council remains the accountable body.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08111243000089"></a>In the presence of esteemed people such as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord McColl, I realise that it is audacious to say that doctors do not always chair meetings brilliantly. We are talking about a key role in terms of making a body work. Perhaps a doctor should undertake this role. However, some eminent lay people who undertake roles in professional bodies are extremely well thought of and command the respect of the people whom they oversee. I think that it would be in the GMC&#146;s interest to have the flexibility to appoint such people if it needed to do so. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the GMC council would not be prevented from establishing its own standing orders to enable it to set out in greater detail ways in which it might conduct its business.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08111243000090"></a>I hope that the Minister will comment on my next point to put it beyond doubt. I think that, taken together, Articles 5(m) and (n) and 6(e)&#151;the anorak in me is coming out&#151;are intended to ensure that no registrant should ever have been subject to challenge anywhere in the world as regards their fitness to practise, and if that were not the case they would not be able to be a member of the council. It would be extraordinarily helpful if she would confirm that that is the intent of those sub-paragraphs.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08111243000091"></a>The GMC is about to enter a new era in its history. None of us yet knows how successful that will be. Parliament and the profession will have to watch that matter with great care. It will be interesting to see how it is evaluated, by whom and when. However, as far as this goes as a very basic founding document, it should serve that process reasonably well.</p>

However, I know the gist of her thinking and have some sympathy with it because this order appears at least to remove the long-treasured self-regulation of the medical profession. I shall be very interested to hear my noble friend&#146;s response. I also support the point made by my noble surgical friend Lord McColl about the deputy chairman. However, we had plenty of opportunity to debate the legislation on which this order is based, the Health and Social Care Act and the miscellaneous amendments to the HCAP order&#151;I summarise that as it is too long to spell out. However, I think that we have reached a good solution. We should remember that the chairman

I respect him greatly and he is held in high regard by the profession. Although we may have lost the control seat, as a profession we may gain from our disciplinary body being seen to be broadly spread and representing the whole community.</p>

I support what the noble Lord, Lord McColl, said. Over the past three years, the Bar Standards Board has worked effectively with a lay chairman but with a QC as its vice-chairman. Having a lay chairman has proved extremely useful for many bodies. However, that needs to be balanced by having sufficient specialised members on the board about which we are speaking. I happen to be chairman of the panel that appoints Queen&#146;s Counsel, but only because the lay chairman had to retire unexpectedly. In future there will be a lay chairman of the Queen&#146;s Counsel panel, but its members comprise more lawyers than lay men. Having a deputy chairman who is a member of the medical profession would be a very useful adjunct to this new General Medical Council.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08111247000002"></a>The order is part of a programme of reform and modernisation of the regulation of the healthcare professions, which the Government are taking forward in consultation with the health professions regulators. Noble Lords will recall previous debates in which this programme, and especially the governance arrangements for the regulatory bodies, have been discussed.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08111247000003"></a>We all agree that the healthcare professions regulators must be independent and impartial in their actions if they are to protect the public interest, enhance professional standards, and deal with poor performance effectively. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, I do not intend to rehearse the arguments that we have heard previously because the House is very familiar with them. However, there has been a perception that regulators have not always acted in patients&#146; best interests. Their perceived dependence on, or attachment to, vested interests has weakened or threaten confidence in their actions. That is the background to this programme of reform.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08111247000004"></a>There is widespread agreement that the composition of regulatory body councils is central to both perception and effective regulation. Thus, the White Paper <I>Trust,</I><I>Assurance and Safety</I> set out a substantial programme of reform to the system for the regulation of healthcare professionals. This programme was debated in some detail during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act and the Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order, which was made in July. The noble Baroness correctly raised many questions during the Bill&#146;s passage through your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08111247000005"></a>Following the legislation&#146;s introduction, the Government have been working closely with the General Medical Council to develop the proposed constitution  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_724"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 724</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set out in the order currently before your Lordships&#146; House. The proposals have clear support of the GMC. The terms of office of the elected members of the current council are all due to expire at the end of December and all involved parties are now working towards the new council starting on 1 January. In many ways, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, was right: this is a different body and it ushers in a new era.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08111247000006"></a>In its <I>Proposals on Healthcare Professional Regulation</I> (published in November 2006&#151;prior to the Government&#146;s White Paper&#151;the GMC emphasised that the new regime had to command the confidence and support of all the main groups with an interest in patient safety and quality of healthcare. It proposed a smaller council with a balanced composition, which would reflect patients and the public, doctors, the NHS and other healthcare providers, the medical schools and medical royal colleges.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08111247000007"></a>The GMC&#146;s proposals included equal numbers of medical and lay council members, and acknowledged that routes to council membership had to command confidence through a fair, independent and transparent appointment process that was free from government influence.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08111247000008"></a>I turn to specific points raised by noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and my noble friend Lord Rea raised the issue of the end of professional self-regulation. It seems that professional self-regulation is not based solely on the presence of a professional majority on the council. Registrants will continue to be actively involved in many levels of the processes of professional regulation through the approval of education and training, the continuing development of standards and the involvement of independent practitioners on fitness to practise panels.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08111247000009"></a>Healthcare professionals need to acknowledge that regulation involves a partnership between the professions and public to ensure that all concerns have an equal opportunity to be heard.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08111247000010"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord McColl, raised the issue of clinical independence. I assure the House that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to inhibit clinical judgments in any way. In terms of the GMC it will be essential that the council is able to draw on clinical expertise at all levels of its organisational processes, including, for example, through the three new education boards. Medical expertise does not have to be drawn from the council.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08111247000011"></a>I turn to the appointments of the chair, which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord McColl, raised. The Government have agreed with GMC proposals that the chair of the council should be elected by the council from among the council members. There is therefore no requirement in the constitution that the chair must be a medical practitioner. It is open for the council to choose the most appropriate member to take up the post of chair. Transitional arrangements have been made in the constitution order to provide for the existing chair to continue in post for a period of six months to provide a period of continuity during the first few months of the new council.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08111247000012"></a>Likewise, there are no deputising arrangements for the chair and no standing vice-chair. That is deliberately there to ensure that there is no factionalism. We want this body to act as a strategic body for the medical profession. It is important from the start that factionalism does not emerge, which is about medical and non-medical members of the council.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08111247000013"></a>The noble Baroness asked why not allow registrants to elect the medical members of the council from a long list drawn up by the Appointments Commission. The requirement to have a fully appointed council is set out in the medical Act. It was inserted by a Section 60 order made in June this year. This constitution order cannot override the requirements in that medical Act. The move to have a fully appointed council was a major White Paper commitment and part of the reforms that the GMC brought forward.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08111247000014"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the Department of Health would be able to exercise undue influence over the way in which the GMC works. I see no reason why that would be the case. In practice, the oversight role in relation to health professional regulators is being taken on more and more by the CHRE. Appointments to the council are being carried out by the Appointments Commission, which appoints against specific criteria agreed with the regulators.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08111247000015"></a>The key principle of the White Paper, <I>Trust, A</I><I>ssurance and </I><I>S</I><I>afety</I>, is that the councils should be clearly independent of all sectorial interests, including the Government. The noble Baroness raised an issue about appointments being made before legislation was laid in Parliament. The noble Baroness will be aware that current membership of the General Medical Council will expire on 31 December 2008. In view of the short timescale, the Appointments Commission in consultation with the GMC began the recruitment process in order to be in a position to make appointments as soon as the constitutional order was made and laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08111247000016"></a>The Appointments Commission received over 160 applications from medical professions. The process of sifting and interviewing candidates prior to the completion of the consultation process of the draft order did not pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process. Following the interview process, the Appointments Commission had a pool of appropriately qualified lay and professional candidates from whom it could draw without prejudice to the final decisions about the size and composition of the council. The constitution order was made by the Privy Council on 29 September and laid before Parliament on 6 October. Final appointments to the GMC were confirmed by the Appointments Commission on 15 October.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08111247000017"></a>The issue of a quorum was raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord McColl. In 2007, Niall Dickson, the chairman of the King&#146;s Fund, chaired the national working group which had the objective of enhancing confidence in the health professionals&#146; regulatory bodies. It considered a range of issues relating to the constitution and membership of regulatory body councils. The report recommended that no group should have guaranteed places on the council and that members should include registrants  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_726"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 726</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who should only be appointed because of their experience, knowledge and judgment. The Government believe that it is the role of council members to set the overall strategy for the organisation and hold its executive to account rather than to represent any particular interest or point of view on the council. The White Paper and the national working group chaired by Niall Dickson recommended that there should be no guaranteed places for any particular group on the council. Our view is that this principle should also be applied to the quorum for the council. In other words, if one accepts that all council members are on the council because of their skills and abilities in directing an organisation, rather than because they represent a specific interest group, there is no need to ensure that there is a balance of lay and professional members present on every occasion. The constitution order does not therefore specify a minimum numbers of registrants or lay participants. A quorum of 14 reflects best practice in ensuring that the council can continue to operate should a number of its members be unable to attend a meeting.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08111247000018"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised the issue of people who have been subject to fitness-to-practise action being able to serve on the GMC. This is not automatic. The Appointments Commission is barred from appointing anyone whose appointment could be liable to undermine public confidence in the profession, but we decided that the bar should not be an automatic bar because some candidates might have faced sanctions from autocratic regimes elsewhere in the world.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08111247000019"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, also asked whether it would prevent the GMC from having standing orders. That is not the case. It has the powers under Schedule 1(e) of the medical Act to have its own standing orders and we assume that it will go ahead and do so in due course.</p>

<a name="81112-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08111247000020"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Rea for his supporting remarks, particularly those concerning Sir Graeme Catto. I endorse them wholeheartedly. I hope that I have addressed the questions raised by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, about the vice-chair.</p>

Change is always difficult and I appreciate that members of the GMC have made an enormous contribution over many years, but that particular role is coming to an end. I am confident that they will continue to find active and important roles in their professional regulation. I note that the GMC has written to a number of noble Lords calling on them to reject this Motion. It has pointed out that if Parliament were to reject this order it would not merely put a brake on the GMC&#146;s transition to a new constitution, but the council itself would cease to exist at the end of the year.</p>

I appreciate the comment from my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss about the vice-chair. I am concerned about the need to have a vice chairman in the event of the chairman suddenly becoming ill or being unable to undertake a duty, just as it is good practice in committee to have a vice-chairman who is well briefed and able to stand in.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08111247000024"></a>I completely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that a smaller council is manageable and can take sensible decisions and that previously it was too large. I reassure the House that I am not worried about those who are leaving their place on the GMC. Change will probably be a very good thing, and I embrace it. I also endorse the words of the noble Lord, Lord Rea, that Sir Graeme Catto has done an outstanding job in regaining a lot of confidence among the public who lost confidence in the medical profession because of events in Bristol, the Shipman affair, and so on. I hope that we are starting off afresh and well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08111247000025"></a>I echo the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord McColl, in relation to the quorum and wonder whether it might be wise for the GMC in its standing orders initially to suggest that to be quorate a third of its members must be medical, or to have something to address the balance to give the medical profession the message that it is not being isolated. This is not about factionism&#151;not at all; it is about expertise, and making sure that there is the right amount of expertise in the room.

It is more a case of: &#147;What do we want? CIL. When do we want it? Not until we are completely satisfied that it will work&#148;. That is perhaps not the greatest of catchphrases, but it is a serious point. I congratulate the Minister on her persistence and my noble friend Lord Goodhart and the rest of the Delegated Powers Committee. The Minister has done a sterling job, and has achieved a sterling outcome in&#151;we have used various anatomical phrases&#151;putting more flesh on the skeleton. It is certainly less emaciated. However, the fact that there were so many amendments at the previous stage and there are so many at this stage, and the amendments are not straight forward, proves my point.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08111250000005"></a>The Minister kindly arranged for me to meet officials so that they could explain the error of my ways in opposing the inclusion of this part in the Bill. I thank her and I thank them for their time. They confirmed that, as the document that the Government published in August stated, it is expected that the regulations will come into force not before spring 2009. Given how much store the Government rightly set by consultation, even if the regulations were ready now for consultation, it would be pushing it to have them in force next spring. I know that the Government have been working with stakeholders. I inquired whether it was intended that CIL would be piloted or trialled. I gather that is not the case, but that there will be so-called early adopters. I do not know whether early adoption is likely to relate to where the local authority is with its local development framework and local development documents, but how that part of the process will work and whether it will work exercises us as much as any other.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08111250000006"></a>The charging schedule will go through the examination process. Who will participate? That was an issue for me as long ago as the mid-1980s when I was chairing a local planning committee and we were going through our local plan. The people who participated were the large landowners. My note reads &#147;Thames Water&#148;. That is to remind me that in my borough it owned a lot of land and had a major interest in taking part in the process. The large supermarket chains always keep a weather eye for opportunities. Will developers who have not yet put sites together, for whom a development may hardly be a twinkle in the eye in the local process, take part? That is unlikely. Perhaps consultants will, hoping then to pick up some fees from those for whom they may keep a watching brief across the country or to whom they may be able to sell the benefit of their services. I worry whether the examination process will be the effective and inclusive process that I know that the Government want it to be.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08111250000007"></a>How long will the process take? I attribute the next piece of analysis to my noble friend Lord Greaves, who has obviously been detained over supper. As he says, the council does research, understands government guidance, holds informal consultations with appropriate developers, regional officers, and so on, prepares reports, revises them and finally gets draft proposals before the council in, say, six months. Council approval of draft consultation takes one month. Publication and the period for consultation take two months. Work on consideration of representation, informal discussions with objectors, and so on, further discussions within the authority, and preparation for revised proposals take four months. Informal discussion with the regional office takes two months. Sometimes, of course, there is a holiday period somewhere in that and further delays such as staff sicknesses and resignations; the regional office personnel may change; informal guidance may change, and all the rest of it. So add on a couple of months for all that.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08111250000008"></a>Then the revised proposal is prepared and put through the council system, which takes a month. Then there is a further period for legal objections, which may take six weeks. Then we get to the examination by the inspector. That takes&#151;what?&#151;six months or so. I have not checked my noble friend&#146;s arithmetic,  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but I think that he is right in saying that it is about 18 months minimum and probably more than two years. Revisions could be done faster, perhaps within a year.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08111250000009"></a>Another anxiety is whether local authorities will be able to cope. We all know&#151;we have discussed this many times&#151;that there is a shortage of planners and of skills in the financing arrangements that CIL will require. It is not so easy to find people to undertake that sort of work within the public sector. I believe that the Government will allow prudential borrowing for local authorities to resource themselves. Of course, borrowing is not grant, it will have to be paid for. The people will have to be found; where will they be? If they are anywhere, they will be in consultancies.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08111250000010"></a>A further area of concern is the boundary between Section 106 and, in the case of highways, Section 278, and CIL. I am told that 50 to 60 authorities, with the benefit of Section 106, are using a tariff scheme. All my instincts say: stick with that and build on it until the detail of CIL is absolutely pinned down and we can be confident in it. That is not least because, outside the big conurbations, it must be likely that local authorities will set the level at nil. Of course, it is their right to do so. The August document states that stakeholders have expressed concern that CIL could affect the level of developer contributions through planning obligations if it is not set at a sensible level&#151;a sensible level may be nil. Paragraph 5.23 of the document states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="08111250000024"></a>&#147;The Government would be interested to receive evidence which shows that CIL and planning obligations will interact in this way&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111250000021"></a>At this point, saying that they would like to receive evidence increases my belief that we are not yet ready for the provision. Paragraph 5.24 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="08111250000025"></a>&#147;The Government have put in place safeguards which aim to ensure that the introduction of CIL will not result in a reduction in the overall level of contributions secured for affordable housing&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111250000022"></a>but it does not follow that that will work.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08111250000011"></a>The answer on the nil level is, in one sense, that that is a matter for them, but there is more to it. If the local authority sets a nil charge or a very low charge, or takes a long time to set the charge, how will that affect central Government&#146;s investment decisions? We know that CIL will by no means cover all infrastructure. Will investment be skewed by the attitude that the Government have to how individual local authorities are co-operating? With the best will in the world, people, by definition, are human. It is unlikely that the Government's decisions will be unaffected by that.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08111250000012"></a>I understand that the Government anticipate zoning within local authority areas. Outside a big conurbation, I find it difficult to understand how that could operate. The charge will be set at X in that part of a district and at Y in this part of the district. I do not know how realistic that is, but I know very different attitudes will be taken in different parts of a district. A development that a local community might want could well be affected by that and driven away.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08111250000013"></a>There will be indexation if the development is not commenced immediately or, to put it more precisely, if the levy does not become payable quickly. Again, I do

In London, there is the unfinished business of the mayor and the boroughs. Earlier today, the Minister said that the boroughs would collect&#151;that does not surprise me particularly; they may have more mechanisms&#151;but that the Government are still looking at this and discussing it.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08111250000014"></a>When I mentioned the matter to my noble friend Lady Maddock, who, with me and other noble Lords, lived through the introduction of home information packs, she said what a sorry example they were of the Government introducing primary legislation but still working on developing the project. I cannot remember who it was, but someone on the government side recently told me that CIL should not push at the boundaries of viability. Too right!</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08111250000015"></a>I end by reiterating that we on these Benches would like an effective arrangement to be in place to assist the achievement of infrastructure. We seriously do not believe that the Government have got there yet, so it is not appropriate to go ahead with the legislation at this stage. Given the way in which these things come out, my amendments are shown as a whole string of amendments to take out all the separate clauses, but the first two are the most important.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08111250000016"></a>This is not a frivolous amendment, and again I should say that I appreciate how much work has gone into presenting us with something much fuller. However, the sheer effort that has had to go into getting us to this stage makes me feel that my argument is the right one. I beg to move.</p>

I call them that because they would reject the community infrastructure levy. I may say, just to encourage her, that I am less optimistic about the introduction of CIL than she is, because, if I understand matters correctly, it is supposed to become part of normal planning documentation.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08111250000018"></a>Most of the authorities of which I am aware are working on a local development plan that is already a planning document. Therefore, CIL must be part of a new local planning document if it is to be introduced. If it is, these documents are reviewed more or less quinquennially, so we are looking at CIL being introduced in the next quinquennial document. We are therefore some years down the road before CIL can be introduced as a matter of practice. If the Minister tells us that this is merely an add-on to the existing system, we are dealing with something rather different. This is a very real problem.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08111250000019"></a>There is yet another problem. Under our existing practices in this House, about which I have no complaint, we must consider these amendments before we can consider how CIL might and should properly work. The Government have tabled a whole lot of amendments that might well be helpful and may even improve on what is on the Marshalled List. However, we do not really know whether we want to reject what is before us, because we do not know what is before us, because technically speaking we have not dealt with it yet.

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08111250000020"></a>A related problem is that no one has worked out what the relationship is to be between CIL and the planning obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act. It is very difficult. Perhaps it would be easier if the Government would accept that CIL would be applicable where Section 106 would not be applicable. Everyone would then know where they stand. Historically, Section 106 is applied to large planning applications which particularly involve&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Best, will have an interest, although not a financial one&#151;social housing. You can have large sections of social housing in large planning developments, but not in small ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08111253000001"></a>The noble Baroness may reply by saying that Section 106 will be applied to applications where it is appropriate, but where Section 106 is inappropriate CIL will be applied. That might be a solution to this dilemma, but we do not have that or any suggestion that that might be a possibility. We have heard that planning obligations will still apply and that it is still expected that social housing will be largely funded by Section 106 agreements and that CIL will be over and above this obligation. CIL, because it has to be part of the planning documentation system, will take real time to introduce. For a start, all local planning authorities will have to think much more clearly, and in much greater detail than they have previously been accustomed to doing, about what the possible local infrastructure obligations might be as a result of the development for which their local development plan provides.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08111253000002"></a>This has to be a total approach&#151;about that there is no question. I see that the Minister is nodding in agreement. That is why the system will be very complicated. If there is any suggestion that there should be haste or pressure on local planning authorities and local authorities to introduce this in anything other than a wholly considered and thoroughly developed way, I would be bound to say that such pressure would be completely disgraceful. It cannot be done like that.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08111253000003"></a>I have no responsibility for introducing these proposals, but the Government have. It is an obligation for the Minister to explain exactly how she sees these proposals being developed. It would be nothing short of disgraceful if there should be the slightest hint that, because a local authority has not considered the matter thoroughly, there might be pressure on other aspects of its revenue as a consequence. I do not believe for a minute that that is what the Government intend, but we do not know and that is part of the difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08111253000004"></a>We have very real problems. I would prefer, if it were technically possible, to settle the details of how the CIL might work. Although the Government have moved a long way on many of the aspects of which we have been critical, we still have not arrived at a conclusion.

I was scurrying up from the Barry Room with two very distinguished visitors from the Canadian and Australian housing systems, who are listening to the debate in your Lordships' House. They are very interested in the concept of the community infrastructure levy.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08111253000007"></a>I hope I can assuage some of the concerns that have been articulated. In so doing I would like to draw on experience that certainly convinces me that the idea that local authorities have been doing nothing over the past year, waiting for Parliament to pass this legislation before they begin the process of preparing for the community infrastructure levy, is a bit wide of the mark.</p>

<a name="81112-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08111253000008"></a>I point to my experience with local authorities in Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and other parts of England where, in anticipation first of the planning-gain supplement and then of the community infrastructure levy, many local authorities have begun their plans and been working quite hard to think through those projects which would benefit from the community infrastructure levy and how they might go about preparing to first strike the levy and then apply it. I have no doubt that in certain circumstances local authorities will choose not to charge a community infrastructure levy. In Committee it was widely accepted after an intervention by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that for brownfield sites it would be quite inappropriate to charge a community infrastructure levy because it would render those developments unviable. That, if nothing else, speaks to the question the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised about viability and zoning. It is right for zoning to protect those areas which would not be viable if a CIL were charged, while in other areas a CIL is absolutely necessary to pre-invest in necessary infrastructure. Lots of local authorities are busily working up their proposals and plans for the community infrastructure levy in anticipation of this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08111253000009"></a>In response to the suggestion that we should call a halt to this and think again, I think we do a disservice to colleagues in local government. I hesitate to say this because I know that many noble Lords have had a distinguished career in local government and could claim to be much more expert in the workings of English local government than me, but I believe that across the country lots of councils not only are anticipating this but have donkey&#146;s years of experience in procuring infrastructure. The big counties in England are very finessed and sophisticated in terms of procuring

Although the community infrastructure levy suggests a different methodology, we have lots of expert, experienced people who know how to do this and who will adapt those skills to the new regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08111253000010"></a>Noble Lords are aware of my interests in the register. I work with lots of local authorities who are interested in investing in infrastructure. Most people expect that this legislation is coming and welcome it. Lots of projects are simply stuck at the moment for want of that final gap that would make projects viable and maintain the momentum. For those reasons I hope noble Lords resist the amendment&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08111253000012"></a>The difficulty which the noble Baroness has not answered is how you incorporate this into planning documentation. Everybody is working on approved planning documentation. As I understand the process&#151;and maybe I am incorrect&#151;you cannot just add something to an approved planning document. It has to go through the total process. It is extremely difficult because you have one approved plan and the planning documentation is reviewed on a quinquennial basis. I do not see how this system can be incorporated into the existing one without questioning the validity of the current planning documentation&#151;the Minister may be able to answer the point in her response&#151;which means that the process inevitably must take time. I see no escape from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08111253000014"></a>My final point in response to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, is that a good feature of Section 106 and the community infrastructure levy is that again it is absolutely within the expertise of local authorities to understand how to distinguish when Section 106 should be applied and when a community infrastructure levy should be applied. Certainly in the examples I have looked at, it is anticipated that the levy will be used for what I would regard as economic development, employment and infrastructure purposes rather than for social housing. I have faith that local authority colleagues will be able to distinguish between these two things and manage them through the process. I hope that this is of assistance.</p>

She rightly laid emphasis on the complexity of the system in terms of London and the metropolitan cities, but I want to consider rural areas. Specifically I refer to

As the Minister knows, a number are experiencing considerable change after a long period as two-tier administrations. Frankly, although I understand well the views expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, who says that we should trust the competence of local authorities&#151;I agree that they are quite competent to deal with changes of this sort&#151;those counties changing over to unitary status have had no time to concentrate on the changes. They have been entirely obsessed with the changes in how they will run local services&#151;rightly so; I make no complaint about that. We should make no criticism because these are difficult and complicated changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08111253000016"></a>In Part 11 we will be throwing at these authorities a very complex set of new requirements to implement over what I presume is to be a relatively short timescale. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, says about the quinquennial review process, but I do not think that that is what the Government have in mind. I suspect that they are thinking of something a great deal speedier than that. At the very least, I hope that in her response the Minister will give us very clear guidance on expectations in terms of timescale on the implementation of Part 11. Without that, all planning authorities and charging authorities are going to feel that they are being led up the garden path in terms of how this can be introduced. The Government&#146;s assurances of comparative simplicity will be shown to be entirely false.</p>

However, I could not understand the levy fully because it has not yet been fully thought out. The officials were obviously not able to tell me. It is clear that what has happened in Committee and on Report has helped the department to focus on what CIL really means. But how can we possibly consider something like this when we cannot even see the regulations? We were promised nearly a year ago that the regulations would be ready by this autumn. Of course they have not appeared yet, and they are not going to appear for some time. That is another broken promise from another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08111253000018"></a>I have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. There will be horrendous difficulties in implementing this. It is of real concern to me because, when I listen to the Minister&#146;s defence of Amendment No. 153A, it is clear that the Government&#151;or, perhaps, the Treasury, or both&#151;do not think CIL is going to work. The Minister&#146;s defence of not getting rid of PGS was that we need to assess how CIL will work. Why? Because it will not work very well, and central government will say that they have the paving Act for PGS. That is what they will then force on the local authorities, because they have not done their job properly. That is a real concern.</p>

They will prefer CIL. It is very simple and very human. Of course they will tell the Government to rush in CIL, for goodness&#146; sake, rather than PGS, because they do not want PGS. They do not really want CIL either. It is going to be very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08111253000020"></a>What happened on Amendment No. 130 is another sign of the real sadness about CIL because this House has quite deliberately been cut out of consultation on the regulations. That is very bad for Parliament and this House. I hope the Minister will confirm clearly that this will not be a precedent for future legislation. I can see this being used by Governments time and again. I remember when I stood in the Minister&#146;s place and some wonderful precedents emerged from the 1950s and the 1960s which I was happy to trot out because they helped my cause. In 10 years&#146; time I can see all of us being here and the next Minister saying, &#147;Do you remember in 2008 that the House voted and agreed that only the House of Commons should deal with this?&#148;. This is a bad day for Parliament and this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08111253000021"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ford, was in favour of zoning, as I am. I am sure she will agree that it is just another factor that will distort the planning process. It is quite obvious that developers will look at those areas that can help them a bit more. In the past, if you wished to put up a building, enterprise zones would have helped you. Now, within a local authority there will be zones and you can say that you will not build in one village because you will have to pay CIL. You will build in another village, which will really upset everything because it has no railway station and the post office has just been closed. It does not matter; you will not pay CIL and it will be a more profitable development. Of course that will happen. CIL will bring its problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08111253000022"></a>Having said all that, I have regularly been in the Minister&#146;s position, with the House against what I have been trying to introduce. We are trying to improve this. It is the Government&#146;s right to introduce their legislation; it is our job to try to make it work. It is not our job to defeat the principle. Therefore, I will not be able to support the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but I am very sad about CIL. It has not been thought out and we have not given it the consideration it needs to justify to ourselves that this House has done a good job, and justify to the rest of the country that this is a good piece of legislation.</p>

There was a point early on&#151;after Second Reading, and in the light of the strictures that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee had aimed at what it described as a purely skeleton Bill&#151;when I felt that there really was a case for persuading the Government to drop this part of the Bill altogether and reintroduce it as separate legislation after they had had a great deal more time to work out the details. Since then, the Government have tabled a large raft of amendments. As I said in Committee, I thought that perhaps in the circumstances it would not be right to try to defeat the whole of Part 11, and I withdrew the amendments that I had tabled to delete a large number of the clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08111253000024"></a>However, my noble friend Lord Caithness has said many of the things that I have been increasingly feeling about the Bill as it has emerged. What I find particularly worrying is this creation of a system where developers will be allowed to play one authority off against another because there will be different rates of CIL, different kinds of exemptions and different treatment regarding CIL and Section 106 agreements. There is no doubt that this is going to be a field day for the lawyers. Should we be creating something that leaves so much uncertainty?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08111253000025"></a>After these debates I end up a great deal more worried about this part of the Bill than when I started. At the same time I agree with my noble friend Lord Caithness that our job is to persuade the Government of how to make it work better. I am deeply disappointed that this House will have no role in any of the regulations. Due to the way the system works, as we do not have an amendment to that effect the other place cannot do anything about it. If we had passed the amendment&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made this point&#151;we would have been able to do that, but we lost it by six votes.</p>

That is the position I will take on this, but I do so with a very heavy heart. I am not a betting man, but I am prepared to bet that within two years we shall have another substantial Bill to try to correct what will be, by then, the apparent deep flaws in this legislation because it has not been properly thought through before it has been introduced. That will probably fall to the next Government. I hope I shall then be sitting behind my noble friends on the Front Bench. The last thing I shall want to say to them is, &#147;I told you so&#148;, but I will say so to the people who will then be sitting on the opposition Front Bench, along with, &#147;Look what a mess you&#146;ve left us&#148;. That is what I feel is going to happen, and I find it a deeply depressing situation. However, I fear I shall not support the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

I accept that. I have listened closely, as I always do, to the tone as well as to the content of what noble Lords have said about the difficulties that they feel the inevitable absence of detail at different stages of our discussion has caused. This House is always concerned about workability, and rightly so.

I know that, across the House, nobody is in any doubt that we need additional funding for infrastructure because we need additional houses. We need additional homes for millions of people in this

This Bill will make a significant difference to that. While I listen and take the criticisms in good part, I do have to ask noble Lords opposite what their alternative solution would be. We never said this would be easy but we do say it is necessary. We think it is fair and we know it is an improvement on what has gone before.</p>

She pointed out that there is a legacy of work already in place and that local authorities are knowledgeable and many of them are leading some of this work rather than trailing behind it. The noble Baroness has been concerned about process and it is worth putting on the record some of that process so that I can address some of the criticisms from other parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08111253000030"></a>The record shows and chapter 1 of our August document describes in detail how the CIL proposals were generated by careful analysis and diagnosis over several years. There was extremely wide discussion with stakeholders and public consultation on the best way to fund the infrastructure. We published six consultation documents to explore different proposals and in August we put out our more detailed analytical document. We have had numerous briefing events, conferences, seminars and web chats. I will not read the list I have here as it would take too long. There is widespread agreement and support for both the need for CIL and the broad approach we have taken to implementing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08111253000031"></a>The noble Baroness said in the previous debate that she agrees that this is looking less emaciated because we have been able to meet the majority of the major concerns of the DPRRC with the right level of delegation and the Committee itself says the Bill is no longer skeleton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08111253000032"></a>I would like to address the two particular points raised by the noble Lords, Lord Dixon-Smith and Lord Tyler. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that regarding the timetable and capacity, CIL is a voluntary charge. No local authority will be required or forced to do this. There is no timetable. We fully respect the changes that are going on, especially in the unitary communities. With regard to the local development plan, CIL will be driven by the vision the local authority has for its community. That vision is set out in its local development framework. CIL is a brand new document. It will accompany&#151;it does not have to be incorporated. These concerns about timetables and capacities, therefore, can be tempered a little by that reality.</p>

<a name="81112-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08111253000033"></a>Many noble Lords believe that, as the detail of how CIL will be delivered is sufficiently complex, regulations will be appropriate and sensible. We have to continue the serious discussions we began a long time ago with the many stakeholders in this field. It is not only our view; it was certainly the view of the British Property Federation and the Home Builders Federation, to name but two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08111253000034"></a>The noble Baroness raised serious issues about timing and capacity and I hope she will be comforted by what I am about to say. It is a good opportunity to turn to the matter of timing. We announced that CIL regulations would not be in place before the spring of

These are challenging economic times but, as we begin to see a return to growth, as we surely will, it will be important for communities to have the right tools to hand to provide the infrastructure that their plans have identified as necessary to guide development. CIL will have an important part to play at that time and authorities that choose to use it will want to prepare their charging schedules so that developers can plan ahead with CIL in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08111253000035"></a>I am persuaded, however, that we do need to allow time for confidence to return before this work by local authorities can properly begin and be taken forward to best effect. With that in mind, I can now say that the Government will not seek to make the regulations to implement CIL before October 2009, although we may prepare earlier regulations to facilitate preparatory work by local authorities as we are allowed by Amendment No. 136C, which my noble friend Lord Patel has already explained. We will use the time productively, to allow us extra space to work with stakeholders to develop the regulations, ensuring that we have the best, most substantial and most thoughtful possible basis to enable local authorities to implement CIL. The draft implementing regulations will be prepared for public consultation in the spring. I shall be happy to place copies in the Library for noble Lords to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08111253000036"></a>I take issue with some of the things that have been said. It is not right to say that these clauses are undercooked or that the policy is not thought through. The noble Baroness was gracious enough to pay tribute to the hard work that has been done over the summer, not least by many officials in partnership with the DPRRC. We have tried hard to work as comprehensively as possible so that this House can at least be secure about the basic architecture of how things will work. I understand why the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, spoke as he did.</p>

<a name="81112-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08111253000037"></a>I was grateful to the noble Baroness for saying that she was not against CIL in principle, and I understand why she has raised the issues as she has. However, if she divides the House, she must also think about her colleague in the other place, Mr Dan Rogerson, who said that the Liberal Democrats support anything that hands more powers to the local community, enabling their local authorities to achieve their vision for their areas. This gives local authorities greater power and scope, and I do not know how she would square her decision with the fact that Liberal Democrat councils, and all other councils that are desperate to build more housing, would look to CIL to raise essential additional funding for the schools, hospitals, roads and power stations that the communities want.</p>

<a name="81112-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08111253000038"></a>The party of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, recognises that. Jacqui Lait, the Member for Beckenham in the other place, said that they were prepared to see this levy introduced, and I have listened to what noble Lords on those Benches have said. I therefore hope that, even if the noble Lord is remotely tempted by the siren on the Liberal Democrat Benches, he will not walk away from that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08111253000039"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, who I consider a friend, to think seriously about the prospect of putting the hard work that has been done in peril. That would

The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said that we have come too far, but we have come too far in the right direction. There have been many failed attempts to raise funding for infrastructure. We have got further, because this is a sounder, fairer and more efficient proposition. I really hope that noble Lords can be persuaded of that this evening.</p>

On all sides, this has been a very thoughtful debate. I know that all noble Lords from different perspectives take the issues very seriously. I do not believe that our approach would put in peril the hard work that has been done. Our intention is not to dispose of it, but to give the opportunity to build on it. I have no problem in squaring this with my honourable friend Dan Rogerson, the Member for North Cornwall. I discussed it with him and he is quite right about enabling local communities to achieve what they want, but unless the mechanisms work, that ambition will not be fulfilled through this route, so we are entirely at one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08111253000043"></a>As far as concerns not introducing the regulations before October 2009, this rather proves my point, or goes towards proving it.

The LGA is troubled, as it often is, to ensure that local authorities are not given new tasks without the tools to do them or that they suffer from unnecessary constraints and bureaucracy imposed upon them, which diminish their autonomy and fail to shift power from central to local government&#151;something we agree we should be aiming towards. These two amendments relate to the local authority&#146;s role first in raising the community infrastructure levy and, secondly, in spending the community infrastructure levy funds.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08111256000005"></a>Amendment No. 132A would impose a duty to co-operate with the charging authority upon the partner authorities with which local authorities work. This is about requiring those partner authorities to be helpful to the local authorities, in their role as charging CIL to others.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08111256000006"></a>The local authority needs to work out what infrastructure will be needed, calculate what it will cost and then determine the levels of community infrastructure levy that it must charge. In doing that, it needs to know about all the development that is going on, not just that in the public domain. For example, it needs to know from health trusts what plans they have to produce new medical facilities. If a new medical facility of any sort is built, there are issues around roads and transport, not just moving the patients or service users, but the staff as well. Therefore, Amendment No. 132A puts a duty upon the partner authorities to co-operate&#151;that is already defined in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007&#151;with local authorities and help them in their task of calculating and levying CIL.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08111256000007"></a>The latter two amendments relate to the local authority&#146;s role in spending CIL funds. This is about the definition of infrastructure on which CIL funds can be spent. It is a plea for more flexibility and less central government rigidity in how CIL funds should be spent. Ministers have already said that the list of items for which CIL could be used is illustrative only. However, this list can be changed only by regulations in Parliament. That sounds like a slow and cumbersome process. It might well mean that some piece of infrastructure was delayed, awaiting those regulations in Parliament.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08111256000008"></a>The list in the Bill is relatively comprehensive, covering transport, flood defences, education, medical, sporting and recreational facilities and affordable housing. However, it cannot be completely comprehensive because each local authority has its own issues and local circumstances differ from place to place. The LGA has identified another list of items on which it might be entirely sensible to spend community infrastructure levy funds. For example, if you build a lot of houses, sooner or later you may need crematoria and burial grounds. Cultural and religious facilities are excluded from the list we are discussing, as are the provision of, and connections to, utilities and telecommunications. The emergency services, which are the subject of a separate amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, are excluded. Those could include coastguards in relevant areas, although I do not think that the noble Lord thought of including that. The list in the Bill can never cover all eventualities. Therefore,

</ul>
<p><a name="08111256000034"></a>I am not sure to what extent that sentence stands up to analysis because the point of the information amendment is to assist local authorities, which will have a greater burden if they are not able easily to get information. In any event, I do not think that, in the balance of things, putting an obligation on partner authorities comprises such a burden as was suggested.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08111256000011"></a>We know that the Government think that lists should be resisted. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="08111256000035"></a>I suggest that the opposite is the case. As the noble Lord, Lord Best, said, it is important to get this matter right and for it to be as wide as possible.</p>

<ul><a name="08111256000043"></a>&#147;roads, railways and other transport facilities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111256000036"></a>It will come as no great surprise to noble Lords that we should table such an amendment. We could go on debating for a very long time what should be in a list, and we have done so on many occasions. However, it seems to me that if roads are included, railways should also be included. If the list does not include roads or railways, it could refer simply to transport facilities, which would be just as good. I am not sure why the Government think it is worth specifically including roads but not railways, especially as they clearly have a policy of encouraging rail traffic and constraining road traffic. It seems rather an odd omission and I shall be pleased to hear what my noble friend has to say about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08111256000023"></a>Amendment No. 141A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Best, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, seeks to insert words into Clause 208(2) to ensure that the list of items of infrastructure is not exhaustive. I assure the noble Lord that that is already the case. Subsection (2) already states, &#147;infrastructure includes&#148;, so his amendment is unnecessary since the effect he seeks to achieve is already provided for. I would ask him therefore to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08111256000024"></a>Amendment No. 142BA seeks to delete Clause 208(3). That would prevent us from putting in practice our stated policy, which the noble Lord, Lord Best, supports, of ensuring that affordable housing remains supported by developer contributions through the current system of planning obligations, rather than CIL. If Clause 208(3) is deleted, the CIL regulations would have to provide that CIL can be applied to affordable housing in the first instance. I do not believe that the noble Lord wants that. Subsection (3) is not just about excluding affordable housing; it is also about providing clarity. We can add items of infrastructure into regulations to provide certainty to local authorities. Many of the items listed by the noble Lord, Lord Best, would already be within the meaning of Clause 202(2). I hope that that answers the question. I urge him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08111256000025"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 132A. It is very similar to an amendment tabled by the Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in Committee, but rather than focus on the preparation of the levy, this focuses on the application of the levy. However, my concerns remain the same. It would not be right to place a wide-ranging obligation on partner authorities to co-operate with charging authorities. A

For example, the duty here goes further than the duty imposed on partner authorities in relation to local government targets under Section 108 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. Where these are incorporated into local area agreements, the duty is simply to have regard to them in the exercise of their functions. The duty relates only to a partner authority where the target relates to its functions. The amendment would make it a positive duty that would be imposed on every partner authority to co-operate irrespective of what functions they have.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="0811132000006"></a>The housing associations are currently struggling to produce any affordable housing. The house-building industry is in dire straits, so fewer affordable homes are emerging from housing associations obtaining a percentage of the homes under Section 106 agreements. Where housing associations are going it alone, they are having big problems in getting the mortgages they need in the current financial banking crisis. When they do get mortgages, interest rates are much higher and they are trying to produce more family homes instead of the many one and two-bedroom flats. They are trying to achieve new environmentally sustainable standards. All those things add to costs, and the very last thing they need is a new community infrastructure levy that will impose additional costs on them.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="0811132000007"></a>In the Milton Keynes pilot, the levy was &#163;18,000 for each house. Even if the average in other places was lower&#151;say &#163;10,000 a house&#151;it is a considerable burden for the social housing providers to take on at a time when they are struggling to produce any affordable housing at all. I know that the Government agree with the sentiment behind the amendment and they have already said that the aim is to ensure that there is no reduction in the output of affordable housing. We are as one in our hopes that CIL will not lead to any reduction in the amount of affordable housing.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="0811132000008"></a>My proposal for ensuring that that happens comes in these two parts. Amendment No. 134 simply exempts all social housing from CIL. It uses the definition of social housing in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. That is nice and clear and clean. The more social housing in a development&#151;25 per cent, 35 per cent or 50 per cent&#151;the more exempt properties as far as CIL goes, and therefore the lower the amount of CIL. In effect, it would be on a sliding scale depending on how much social housing there is in the development, so there would be no encouragement for any house builder not to proceed with a scheme on the grounds that because of CIL it cannot afford to produce as much social housing and affordable housing as it could before. It removes that excuse and allows schemes to proceed. All schemes would be covered; small ones as well as larger ones covered by partnerships under Section 106 which deals with housebuilders. They would all be covered and no CIL would be payable on social housing if Amendment No. 134 is accepted.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0811132000009"></a>Amendment No. 151 comes at this from a slightly different angle. It looks at schemes where there is a deal with a developer, a Section 106 agreement. Some 74 per cent of all social housing last year was secured through this technique of piggybacking on the work done by housebuilders, although since housebuilders are now doing so much less, that figure is in decline. This amendment ensures that the percentage&#151;the quota&#151;of social housing in Section 106 agreement deals will not be reduced because CIL is being charged on the developer. It gives priority to the social housing element. If that means that the scheme does not stack up with the addition of the payment of CIL at &#163;10,000, or whatever it is, per home, the social housing does not take the hit. A reduction in CIL has to bear the consequences of that extra charge. CIL would have to be reduced, but the percentage of affordable housing would not be reduced.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0811132000010"></a>However, each site is different. The circumstances of each piece of land mean that a negotiation would be necessary to see whether CIL has tipped the scheme over the line of viability. I have dealt with sites where we have discovered methane gas, which required all kinds of extra work later on, and where we have had basements that we did not know were there, which added extra cost. I have had to deal with the great crested newt single-handedly in armed combat. There are archaeological finds all around York that hold schemes up interminably. In all those cases, the fee would go up. We can no longer afford either to produce more affordable housing or pay CIL on top of the other costs that we face.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0811132000011"></a>If my amendment is accepted, CIL would always take the strain, but it would require negotiations in each case. It is a messy arrangement. Of course, local authorities might decide, particularly in the present financial climate, not to risk losing social housing and affordable housing and not to levy CIL at all. That might be an option for them, but that could be throwing the baby out with the bathwater since CIL is there to raise money for infrastructure, and we may well need that funding. I think, but I am not sure, that local authorities could charge differential rates according to how much social housing and affordable housing is delivered; so less CIL if a developer produces 50 per cent affordable housing and more CIL if it produces only 25 per cent. Again, that does not have the advantages of a clean, clear exemption, so I prefer my first amendment which, in effect, treats all social housing as defined by Section 68 of the Housing and Regeneration Act as if it were a charitable endeavour, which it clearly is. It legally is for some, but not for all, housing associations.</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0811132000012"></a>That brings me to a critical issue and a critical question about the relationship between social housing, which is what my amendments are about, and developments by charities for charitable purposes, which the Minister has tabled an amendment to cover and which is of much interest to many other Members of your Lordships' House. Will all the provision of social housing by housing associations that are legally charities be exempt in any case, so that Amendment No. 134 is not necessary for charitable housing associations?</p>

<a name="81112-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0811132000013"></a>About 70 per cent of all housing associations are charities, although probably only 50 per cent of the output comes from those housing associations. Are we safe in relying on the charitable exemption for at least half of the housing, or are we safe for the whole lot? Will all the provision of social housing by housing associations, by those that are charitable and by those that are not registered as charities, but which are producing identical homes for exactly the same people with the same needs as charitable housing associations&#151;activity which is by definition, being used for a charitable purpose, as it is being done in the same way by charities elsewhere&#151;be covered by the exemption for charitable purposes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="0811132000014"></a>If we have to draw a distinction between housing associations that are charities and those that are not, we get into extremely murky territory.

Will local authorities trying to raise reasonable sums of CIL have to work only with the non-charitable housing associations,

Will the Government have to pay extra social housing grant to the non-charitable housing associations so that there is a level playing field between organisations doing identical things but with different constitutions? Your Lordships would not be able to distinguish between housing associations that are charities and those that are not, because it is often for purely historic reasons that they have chosen in their constitution whether to be a charity. Drawing those lines will create all kinds of difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="0811132000015"></a>Will all social housing be deemed to be outside CIL, if and when the Minister&#146;s amendments on charities and charitable purposes are carried?

Nevertheless, until I am assured that that is the case, I beg to move.</p>

I preface my remarks by assuring the noble Lord, Lord Best, that I support his plea for social housing to be exempt from CIL.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0811132000017"></a>We need to remind ourselves that Section 106&#151;which, if you listened to the noble Lord, Lord Best, you might think was devoted to social housing&#151;is in fact devoted to a much broader spectrum of infrastructure. I will list merely some of it: off-site road improvements, which may be some way away but can be of significant benefit to the community; off-site major extensions to sewage works; off-site recreational facilities in the form of playing fields; and many other things of that ilk. A Section 106 negotiation with the local authority depends very much on the balance of those facilities and how much the local authority thinks that it can, so to speak, screw out of the developer in total.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0811132000018"></a>There is an individual negotiation on every development. The local authority usually finishes up well satisfied, and the original landowner or developer usually finishes up reasonably satisfied. The balance may depend on all sorts of things. It depends on the priorities of the area at the time. Not least of the complications&#151;this is one of the great difficulties that we face&#151;is trying to assess the impact of CIL on those negotiations, which is why earlier, slightly tongue in cheek, I suggested that where Section 106 applies, perhaps CIL should not apply. If CIL is an additional factor in the negotiation&#151;we will know what the CIL factor is&#151;it will certainly absorb the proportion of benefit that is negotiable for the local community because it will be a fixed sum in the first instance. It will be there, and it will be absolute. The CIL negotiations will start after that. CIL will not be additional to the sum that can be raised; it will be a part of the sum that can be raised. We must recognise that, with CIL in place, the negotiation on Section 106 arrangements will be proportionately diminished. That may conceivably have an effect on the totality of the provision of social housing, although it is impossible to say for sure. That is the brutal reality with which we have to deal.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0811133000001"></a>This is where we get into a different sort of negotiation over the meaning of infrastructure and so on. I absolutely support in simple form the principle that the noble

I entirely agree with his amendment in so far as it states that social housing should not be eligible to be charged for CIL. That is an absolutely correct principle, but when one gets into the wider fields of what he was saying, I am afraid that when one starts to deal with Section 106, the negotiation will be quite harsh.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0811133000002"></a>The noble Lord is absolutely right to mention the enormous change in the atmosphere in which we are now discussing these proposals from the atmosphere in which the Government prepared the Bill. In that brief period, we have seen the virtual collapse of the housing industry. My understanding, as I said at an earlier stage of the Bill, is that applications for housing development have virtually disappeared from planning committee agendas, because no one knows where anything is going or indeed what the value of the assets about which they are talking might be. They might still be able to calculate their construction costs with a degree of accuracy, but no one knows what the site value is and no one can really say what the underlying value of any product might be. Until those issues are clarified, this standstill will continue.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="0811133000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, and others were absolutely right earlier in the day when they said that, for a time, most authorities will not want even a hint of CIL to be floating around as an additional charge on development, because most of them will be desperate to see the construction process recommence. If there is a hint of an additional charge, it will delay that construction. It is in no one&#146;s interests that the construction industry is at a standstill for a day longer that it has to be.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0811133000004"></a>To be honest, when I look at the Bill, I feel rather as I felt when I was in Syria a little while ago&#151;as though I am looking at historical remains that have been newly excavated and exposed, and are in perfect form to some degree, although we have been criticising it like mad. It is a little like digging out a wonderful bit of wreckage from a different era, because the change in atmosphere has been so great. So while I support the noble Lord, Lord Best, in the principle of his proposal, I do not accept the totality of his argument. We need to recognise that we are now&#151;tragically, dare I say&#151;in desperately different circumstances. To some degree, all our discussion on the community infrastructure levy is academic, which it will remain for some time until there is a reasonable recovery in the construction industry.</p>

If you ask local government officials or councillors in my part of the world&#151;the south-west of England&#151;what is the biggest problem besetting their communities and that the Government have yet to deal with, the answer will resoundingly come back that it is the lack of affordable housing, either to let or to buy. When I read the Secretary of State&#146;s Second Reading speech in the other place, indicating that the Government hope to raise &#163;500 million per annum from CIL, my first thought was, &#147;Crikey, where does that put affordable housing?&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0811133000006"></a>I was pleased when I saw that the Government intend to keep Section 106 agreements vis-Ã -vis affordable housing. They have become a tried and tested method of increasing the affordable housing that is available and are now the main weapon in the armoury of local authorities. The percentage of affordable housing started very small, but now it has increased even for quite small developments, and 30 per cent is not completely unusual. But each agreement takes account of the economics of the scheme in question. They may differ from village to village or from town to town within a local planning authority.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0811133000007"></a>The local authority would not want to kill off housing development per se. Although we need affordable housing, we need all sorts of housing development, because that makes the whole ladder. Affordable housing is the bottom rung, but people have to be able to move up from the bottom rung to make it available for the next generation and others coming along.</p>

I strongly support my noble friend, especially in his Amendment No. 134.

We are facing a very difficult situation for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. The noble Lord, Lord Best, pointed out how it is impacting on the ground. Certainly, the Government are extremely sensitive of the need to protect levels of affordable housing contributions. That is the substance of what I want to say and underlines everything. We have put in place extensive safeguards in the design of CIL to ensure that safeguarding the continued delivery of affordable housing through the use of planning obligations is embedded in the setting and operation of CIL on the ground.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0811133000012"></a>These safeguards include ensuring careful consideration of local economic viability and affordable housing needs in the setting of CIL charges, as well as a prudent backstop measure to address any potential shortfall in affordable housing contributions arising from CIL if evidence shows that that is necessary. These are two extremely important safeguards.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0811133000013"></a>As we set out in the CIL August policy document in paragraph 3.42, local planning authorities that choose to introduce a CIL will be obliged to set a charging schedule in such a way as to ensure it does not impede  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_750"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 750</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>development. That exercise will be bound to take into account the costs of meeting affordable housing requirements. CIL is going to be driven by the local vision set out in the local development plan with its ambitions for housing and affordable housing. A draft charging schedule will be tested through public consultation and independent examination. This examination will test whether the levels of CIL set out in a proposed schedule would put at risk development when taken with other costs faced by developers, such as affordable housing obligations. My noble friend Lady Ford explained on the previous amendment something of the background to the way these decisions are made. The recommendations of the independent examiner would be binding on the charging authority. The independent examiner could recommend reducing the level of CIL in a draft charging schedule if, when taken with other affordable housing costs and local economic conditions, it would prevent development proceeding. If there is an unexpected reduction in the level of developer contributions for affordable housing as a result of the introduction of CIL, we can make regulations to ensure that CIL revenue could be used to top up such a shortfall.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0811133000014"></a>The amendments seek to provide additional security for affordable housing. Amendment No. 151 would require that affordable housing contributions are calculated without regard to CIL liability. It is difficult to see how Section 106 negotiations between developers and authorities could ignore a clear and known cost in the development&#146;s finances, even if it was illegal to take those costs into account. I fear that this amendment could lead to a lot of legal dispute and confusion. I also think the development industry might be extremely alarmed by this proposal because it makes no provision for CIL charges to be adjusted to take account of Section 106 contributions. That would undermine the existing checks and balances I have already set out which we have provided for in the setting of the charging schedule. So even if it were possible for CIL to be ignored for the purposes of the Section 106 discussion, there would be a real danger that total developer contributions for Section 106 and CIL could be set too high, making development unviable and resulting in no new affordable homes being provided.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0811133000015"></a>Amendment No. 134 again seeks to ensure that the introduction of CIL does not adversely affect social housing development. I am sympathetic to the principle of this amendment in that it seeks to shield social housing explicitly from CIL liability. I regret, however, that the amendment as it stands does not look workable and could give rise to unintended consequences. For example, the amendment refers to a definition of social housing that was written for the Housing Act earlier this year and for entirely different purposes. I fear it could be manipulated for the avoidance of CIL payment. For example, shared ownership is included in the definition contemplated by the amendment. That could present a loophole whereby shared ownership accommodation could be exempted from CIL but quickly staircased out to full ownership and lost to the open market. I think the noble Lord recognises that problem. A developer could build shared ownership housing with the sole intention of qualifying for CIL exemption, but on completion the property could  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_751"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 751</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quickly convert to full private ownership. We have to ensure that there is no scope for that sort of abuse of definition. Furthermore, the amendment potentially exempts private housing on developments which are mixed and contain both social and private housing because it does not, for example, contain the words &#147;exclusively&#148; or &#147;wholly&#148;. That could lead to a serious avoidance problem.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0811133000016"></a>The intention of this amendment is to protect social housing contributions through a total CIL exemption. But social housing in itself creates the need for infrastructure and services in much the same way as other housing does. It could not be otherwise. Reflecting that, there is no general exemption for affordable housing providers from the current planning obligations regime. In its present form, therefore, I do not believe that the intended outcomes of this amendment can be guaranteed, or that unintended consequences could be avoided. I therefore propose that this important issue is better served by more detailed consideration in regulations.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0811133000017"></a>We have already taken powers in Clause 203(6)(f) which are necessary to make provision for how social housing developers are to be treated in a more considered way. I want to give the noble Lord and the whole House a firm commitment that we will explore with the social housing sector how a significantly reduced rate of CIL could be specified in regulations for affordable housing development. Indeed, I can tell the House that discussions have already started, focusing initially on the difficult issue of definition that I have mentioned.</p>

Some RSLs sell on their property and are involved in different sorts of relationships. While I can say that all RSLs which meet the charitable definitions in our amendment could be covered, I also want to be absolutely certain that I do not mislead the noble Lord or the House because of the complexity of these definitions and the situation of different housing associations. I therefore propose to write to the noble Lord, particularly after we have debated the charitable exemption as a whole, to ensure that we understand the position of RSLs.

There was little sympathy for the other amendment, and I entirely understand why. I would not wish to press it too far myself because, as both the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, pointed out, it adds complexity to complexity. The aim must be simply to try to exclude affordable housing.</p>

She hopes that they will be ready in time to be written into regulations. I would not have thought there was much difference between setting them out in regulations and putting them in the Bill, except for the added comfort of having them in legislation. However, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for undertaking to prepare these definitions in draft form and giving us a chance to look at them, particularly in the light of how they relate to the current obligations. An extraordinarily complicated addition to the mix is that of housing associations that are definitely charities and therefore covered by the next amendment, again adding complexity to complexity.

The question of liability started with everybody being liable, including roads and railways. Then, the Government&#146;s policy of continuous improvement turned &#147;who is liable&#148; in Clause 202 of the last version of the Bill to, in this section:</p>
<ul>

In other words, I thought, from a railways point of view, that the tracks would be excluded and station buildings included. I recall arguing in Committee that, under this structure, we would move from a situation where local authorities often contribute to the cost of new or refurbished stations to one where they could charge Network Rail or the train operators for the dubious benefit of spending their money on doing up the

On that basis, I tabled Amendment No. 135, seeking an exclusion from this liability for stations or buildings which do not form part of the infrastructure in which the CIL was applied. That is Amendment No. 135.</p>

<a name="81112-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="0811133000029"></a>It occurred to me, on listening to the debate on the previous grouping when noble Lords talked about charities being exempted, that perhaps we should turn Network Rail into a charity. Some noble Lords might think it is a charity already. It would be a simple way of avoiding this merry-go-round of the Government paying for it, then clawing it back and going around again. I look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say about Amendment No. 135. My worry&#151;and this will save me getting up again, which I know is not really allowed at this stage&#151;is about Amendment No. 135A, tabled by noble friend, and Amendment No. 136A which now replaces Clause 202. I am afraid I am extremely confused as to what kind of project is liable and what is not. Previously it was quite clear that buildings were liable, but I do not see &#147;buildings&#148; anywhere in these two amendments. The closest I can get to it is in lines 8 to 9 of Amendment No. 136A:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="0811133000053"></a>&#147;works or changes in use of a specified kind not to be treated as development&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="0811133000030"></a>I am sure my noble friend can explain to me what that means, because frankly I do not understand it. I would like to know what is and is not included in my noble friend&#146;s two amendments. Does it include bits and pieces on the railway, such as buildings and tracks? Have the Government gone back to including tracks? The same might apply to roads, airfields or ports. I beg to move.</p>

It is really a probing amendment to try to determine, if we can, exactly where CIL would or would not be payable.

He has mentioned the problem of railways, which clearly are not included, and railway stations which, under the Government&#146;s definition of buildings, are. What about ports?</p>

That is the problem. My own amendment is directed at trying to find out what is and is not included. My own preference would be for a clear statement in the Bill that infrastructure that is quite clearly infrastructure, whether it be a building or anything else, should not pay CIL. At the moment we have the ultimate irony that a building such as a hospital reception centre, which might be produced and funded entirely by CIL funds because of increased local demand as a result of population increase, having been funded by CIL nevertheless has to pay CIL. What are we thinking about?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="0811133000034"></a>At the other end of the scheme, we need to remember that all this infrastructure is there to serve the community. Of course, much of it provides a service for which the community pays directly; you have only to think of power generation, but the same applies to the railway service, subsidised though it may be. In the end the customer pays, whether it be through the price of his ticket or through his taxes. To the extent that we charge CIL on any of this infrastructure, we are simply churning funds, and we should not be in the business of doing so. If we are providing infrastructure for which the customer pays, and he pays in one way or another for all of it, it should not actually be liable to pay an additional charge of this nature. That is a fairly simple statement of principle that is seriously lacking in the Bill, and which seems to be lacking in the Government&#146;s thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="0811133000035"></a>This is another weakness of this part of the Bill. It has not been thought through. That is the reason for my amendment: it is partly to test the limits of the Government&#146;s thinking, if it has any limits&#151;or indeed whether they have thought at all&#151;but it is also to enable me to define the principle on which we ought to be working. If we do not accept that principle, we are in the business of churning the taxpayer&#146;s funds, which means we are churning our own funds. That is not a sensible thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="0811133000037"></a>In government Amendment No. 136A, subsections (1) and (2) repeat the provisions now in Clause 202 regarding the meaning of &#147;development&#148;. Subsection (1) defines the creation of a new building as development, but also includes,</p>
<ul><a name="0811133000055"></a>&#147;anything done to or in respect of an existing building&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811133000048"></a>The departmental officials have insisted that by &#147;buildings&#148; they intend to refer to any buildings occupied by people. However, the clause does not specify that. Accordingly, clarification is required on whether the intention is to focus on buildings occupied by people or whether it is intended that buildings occupied by farm livestock, for example, or used for grain or other crop storage should also be liable for CIL; hence the reason for my Amendment No. 136AZB.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="0811133000038"></a>Moreover, subsection (2) allows for regulations to bring specified structures into the definition of &#147;development&#148;. It is not clear where that leaves land business structures such as slurry storage facilities, which many farmers will be forced to expand in coming years to comply with the nitrate vulnerable zone regulations, wind turbines, fuel stores, pipelines, flood defence works and such other forms of works. I hope the Minister will make it absolutely clear what types of buildings and structures the Government have in mind to bring within the CIL liability regime and that he will give a clear assurance that it will consult closely with the farming and land management organisations before determining precisely what rural buildings or structures would attract CIL.</p>

This subsection would allow for such a consent regime to be brought within the CIL scope. What is the Government&#146;s justification for casting the net so wide? The provision may suit the convenience of the designers of CIL who wish to have maximum flexibility to apply a scheme whose details they have not fully thought through and are not sure will work in practice, but it does not deliver certainty or confidence about fairness to developers large or small, urban or rural. We need a good explanation from the Minister.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="0811133000043"></a>In Committee on 23 October, the Minister said, at col. 1252 of <I>Hansard</I>, that, wind-power stations would not be liable for CIL because they were not buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="0811133000044"></a>In the latest of the Minister&#146;s helpful series of explanatory loose sheets, however, which were sent to noble Lords, the following sentences appear on page 8:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="0811133000054"></a>&#147;A new railway line connecting major cities would not be liable for CIL since the development would not comprise a building. A new power station, on the other hand, could therefore be liable because of the building containing the energy supply&#148;.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="0811133000045"></a>My first question is: how confident are the Government that a wind turbine is not a building? The first definition of a building in the <I>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</I> is &#147;a thing which is built&#148;. One of the definitions given of &#147;build&#148; is,</p>
<ul><a name="0811133000057"></a>&#147;construct (a ship, vehicle, fire, road or other structure) by putting parts or materials together&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811133000049"></a>It could certainly be argued that that covers a wind turbine. It could also be argued that a wind turbine is a building which contains the energy supply which, in the Government&#146;s view, is what makes other forms of power station liable to CIL and distinguishes them from railway lines.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="0811133000046"></a>My second question is: why have they chosen the word &#147;building&#148; instead of, say, the word &#147;structure&#148;? What were they trying to exclude and why?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="0811133000047"></a>My third question is: did they deliberately seek to discriminate between different types of power station? Did they want to favour wind power-generating stations at the expense of generating stations fuelled by other means? In that case, is this an example of the Government inventing yet another form of discreet subsidy, this time at the expense of local communities, to try to push forward their wasteful and inefficient wind power programme?</p>

In view of the hour, I will be as concise as possible while, I hope, addressing some of these rather technical questions.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="08111314000002"></a>Who will be liable to pay CIL was one of two remaining issues of major concern to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that we have now been able to deal with. I shall address my own amendments first. Land ownership is a complex area and the vital importance of devising a workable solution has meant that this has involved a considerable amount of work. However, after much careful thought, we have found a practical way forward.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="08111314000003"></a>Government Amendment No. 135A removes the existing clause setting out provision about CIL liability and replaces it with a new clause. It expressly allows any person&#151;who may be the developer, landowner or other party with an interest in the land such as the bank or financer of the development&#151;to assume liability to pay CIL before development commences. It also provides for default liability to be attached to the owner or developer and enables CIL regulations to provide for liability to be assumed partially, jointly, or jointly and severally.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="08111314000004"></a>Amendment No. 144A amends Clause 210 on CIL enforcement to allow regulations to provide for the consequences of failure to assume liability. It is our intention, for instance, that where no party nominates itself to pay CIL, the benefits that it would have enjoyed would be withdrawn. We expect the vast majority of those intent on development to come forward to meet their CIL liabilities in full and on time. By allowing any party to take on liability in this way, we are providing maximum flexibility for the industry to make efficient arrangements.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="08111314000005"></a>Where liability has not been assumed, regulations will enable charging authorities to recover CIL from other parties. Subsection (4) of the proposed new clause in government Amendment No. 135A therefore requires regulations to make provision for the owner or developer of the land on which development has commenced, in reliance on planning permission, to be liable to pay CIL. Definitions for &#147;owner&#148; and &#147;developer&#148; are set out in subsection (7) of the clause inserted by government Amendment No. 136A.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="08111314000006"></a>As possible liable parties, we want the owner and developer to be fully aware of any liabilities that they may face on purchasing land or commencing development on it. Government Amendments Nos. 144B and 144D therefore enable regulations to provide for further enforcement measures for the payment of CIL. Together, they replace Clause 210(3)(c) with more detailed provisions, enabling regulations to provide for the registration or notification of actual or potential

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="08111314000007"></a>These amendments are vital to ensuring that all interested parties are fully aware of any CIL liabilities that they may face when commencing development or purchasing land. Where there is more than one owner or developer, CIL liability may need to be apportioned between them, as provided for by subsection (5)(d) of the proposed new clause in government Amendment No. 135A. Subsection (5)(d)(ii) of that proposed new clause provides for appeals relating to any apportionment, but does not specify the manner in which they may be made. Government Amendment No. 140A ensures that any regulations providing for appeals in relation to the apportionments of CIL liability under proposed new Clause 202(5)(d)(ii) may make provision about the procedure on such appeals, about fees and the award of costs, and when the right to appeal must be exercised.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="08111314000008"></a>Government Amendment No. 146A amends Clause 212 to provide that CIL regulations may make provision for the procedures to be followed in connection with actual or potential liability for CIL. Proposed new Clause 202 provides that liability may be assumed and for such liability to be transferable. This amendment ensures that the CIL regulations can set out procedures for how that is to be done. Government Amendment No. 146B enables regulations to provide for procedures to be followed in relation to exemptions from, or reductions in, paying CIL. I commend the government amendments to the House.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="08111314000009"></a>Opposition Amendments Nos. 135 and 136AZA seek to prevent CIL regulations allowing CIL to be levied on infrastructure development. Opposition Amendment No. 135 seeks to ensure that development for CIL purposes may not include anything done to, or in respect of, an existing building that forms, or forms part of, infrastructure. Opposition Amendment No. 136AZA seeks to amend subsection (1)(a) of government Amendment No. 136A to ensure that &#147;development&#148;, for CIL purposes, means anything done by way of, or for the purpose of, the creation of new buildings, excluding buildings housing infrastructure.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="08111314000010"></a>My noble friend Lord Berkeley asked where in the new amendments we define &#147;buildings&#148;. It is set out in Amendment No. 136A, where we say clearly that &#147;development&#148; means,</p>
<ul><a name="08111314000046"></a>&#147;anything done to ... an existing building&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000036"></a>In Committee, my noble friend asked why we are making this distinction and not exempting infrastructure that does not include buildings. A version of that question was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Reay. There is not much that I can add to what I said in Committee. We are trying to deal with the impact that buildings have by generating a need for infrastructure because they are usually occupied by people who create needs. We have come up with the simplest definition of &#147;buildings&#148; that we can: there is clarity there.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_758"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 758</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="08111314000011"></a>In Committee, I said that almost all development has some impact on the need for infrastructure, services and amenities: I say this also to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. For example, a school, which is infrastructure, will have significant transport impacts, particularly at 3.30 pm. A hospital, which is infrastructure, will have significant waste impacts that require waste management infrastructure. Excluding infrastructure from the types of development that may be liable to pay CIL risks causing shortfalls in CIL revenue that other types of development might have to cover through higher rates of CIL. That is why our principal starting point has been that most types of development could pay CIL. However, we have given serious thought to which types of development ought to be liable, and, as clarified by Clause 202(3), we have decided principally to define liable development as &#147;buildings&#148;. This is likely to mean that certain items of infrastructure such as phone masts, roads and railway lines would not be liable.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="08111314000012"></a>I will answer in a general way the three questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Reay. CIL is a new mechanism to help support the provision of infrastructure. Needs arise and are planned for by local authorities on the basis of people and their occupation and use of buildings. New homes, offices, shops and schools are all located to support the delivery of homes. Roads are upgraded to support new office developments. Therefore, &#147;buildings&#148; is the right definition of &#147;development&#148; for CIL purposes: it is relatively simple. As a result of defining &#147;development&#148; in this way, it is clear that some other types of development would not be CIL-liable. We include in that roads, railway lines, power lines, pylons and wind turbines.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="08111314000013"></a>Opposition Amendment No. 136AZB, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, seeks to amend the definition of &#147;development&#148; on which CIL can be charged by amending government Amendment No. 136A. This seeks to ensure that development consisting of anything done to, or in respect of, an existing building only ever gives rise to CIL liability if the building is &#147;occupied by people&#148;. I am sympathetic to the spirit of the noble Earl&#146;s amendment, which seeks to identify which developments may cause a need for infrastructure and which may not. In general, infrastructure needs arise because people are located in certain places: that is our rationale.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="08111314000014"></a>The noble Earl raised the point about consultation. As part of the work to develop CIL regulations, I wish to consult widely on how we might exercise powers under subsection (2) to define what works or changes of use to buildings will incur CIL liability. We do not want to further restrict the definition in the Bill. The amendment also raises questions. For example, how often might a building have to be occupied to be charged CIL? Is it to be continuously occupied, or would temporary occupation be sufficient? The amendment would provide plenty of scope to avoid CIL. For example, you move out of a property, develop it and move back in some time later, but you do not pay CIL because you were not in occupation when development commenced. I am sure that the noble Earl takes the point that there are degrees of complication here.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="08111314000015"></a>My advice is that many farm buildings are covered by general permitted development orders. We have said that most such developments would be exempt, and representatives of farming will be fully engaged in consultation on that point. I hope that we can pursue that point in written correspondence.</p>

<a name="81112-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="08111314000016"></a>Amendment No. 136AZC might be intended to prevent CIL regulations defining planning permission for CIL purposes as being anything other than within the meaning of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. We have been clear that we expect that most types of development will be liable to pay CIL. As I have said in previous stages of the Bill&#146;s progress, this could well extend to development consented to through regimes that are other than the town and country planning regime. For example, if an Act of Parliament consents to development, it might be appropriate for it to be liable to pay CIL. Similarly, if we conclude that it is appropriate that developments such as power stations should be subject to CIL, we would not want the largest schemes to avoid CIL by virtue of being consented to by the Infrastructure Planning Commission. The amendment would rule out those possibilities, and it is premature to do so. I hope that on that basis the noble Earl will feel able to not move his amendment.</p>

We need greater clarification. Here is an example of the frustration that we are all facing, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, found, in trying to get hold of what the Government are about; it is like trying to hold the water in a wet sponge. The moment you think you have your hand on what the Government are trying to do; it pops up in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="08111314000018"></a>The Minister contradicted herself. In the answer that she gave on Amendment No. 136AZB, she wanted it to be much more definite and she sympathised with my thought behind the amendment. However, on Amendment No. 136AZC she had no sympathy at all. But here is a ghastly, wide, catch-all phrase that is going to take into account any sort of development, whether it is town and country planning, permitted development or even exempt development. That means that the Government, having got the Bill through when it is enacted in two years&#146; time, can change their mind completely without any consultation of this House, and say, &#147;Let us have power stations and let us have Lord Berkeley&#146;s railways. Yes, we will have the whole lot now; we have it in the Bill&#148;.</p>

Will it be the relevant local authority in that area

That is the purpose. It is a local regime. There will be no question of the IPC setting CIL. However, if there is going to be some major infrastructure in the local development plan, it is reasonable that the cost of the infrastructure and the impact of that is taken into account within the assessment of what is required to be raised. I cannot anticipate what might be covered by that, but, if the noble Lord allows, I will think some more about that and try to write and give some examples.</p>

I do not know whether that was intentional, but it was very nice of her&#151;or not. I am grateful for her explanations, but am still pretty confused. The definition of a building is like yesterday&#146;s definition of a goods train&#151;a train that carries goods&#151;in that it does not take you very far. Amendment No. 136A(1) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08111312000079"></a>&#147;anything done by way of or for the purpose of the creation of a new building,&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_763"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 763</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="08111312000017"></a>I am very pleased to bring forward Amendment No. 136AA in response to many noble Lords having asked for 100 per cent exemption for charities. I emphasised during Committee that this is a highly complex area in which to legislate and achieving our objectives has required a complex amendment. I am very grateful to the Charity Tax Group and to the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, who provided invaluable advice during the process. However, there are consequently some elements of the provision which I need to explain.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="08111312000018"></a>Essentially, this new clause places a duty on the Secretary of State to provide in regulations a 100 per cent exemption from CIL for relevant charities in England and Wales in the case of developments to be used wholly or mainly for their charitable purposes. For example, it will cover many developments used by a charity in connection with its primary purpose: a hostel for the homeless, in the case of a homelessness charity, for instance, a lifeboat station or a building used only as a head office. In addition, it will allow regulations to make exemptions for other institutions established for a charitable purpose and for regulations to require charging authorities to make exemptions or reductions for such institutions.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="08111312000019"></a>We listened closely to the concerns raised in this Chamber that the duty placed on the Secretary of State to provide some sort of exemption or reduction in CIL for charities, or developments for charitable purposes, did not go far enough. We listened to the fears of noble Lords and of organisations such as the Charity Tax Group, that regulations would not provide the level of protection from being financially disadvantaged by CIL that we all know they deserve and need to ensure that they work as effectively as possible for the good of the community. We have acknowledged the inevitable confusion that some people had about the meaning of &#147;charity&#148; and &#147;charitable purpose&#148; by specifically providing definitions.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="08111312000020"></a>I believe that this amendment delivers the reassurance the charity sector has been asking for. Subsection (1) of the new clause provides a guarantee that CIL regulations must include a 100 per cent exemption from CIL where the liable party is a,</p>
<ul><a name="08111312000080"></a>&#147;relevant charity in England and Wales&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111312000050"></a>and the development is to be used wholly or mainly for its charitable purposes.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="08111312000021"></a>Our amendment also seeks to resolve any confusion on which charities and charitable purposes are covered by the exemption. Subsection (1)(b) makes it clear that the qualifying charitable purposes will be as defined in Section 2 of the Charities Act 2006, while the effect of subsection (4) is that charities registered with the Charity Commission, or which are excepted or exempt from the duty to register with the Charity Commission, will be covered by the duty in subsection (1). We have listened to the point raised by noble Lords in our previous debate on this issue that these definitions must be made explicit in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="08111312000022"></a>In addition, we have provided a power in subsection (2) for regulations to go further than the duty imposed in subsection (1). Subsection (2)(a) is intended to enable regulations to provide a CIL exemption for charities where the conditions laid out in subsection (1) do not apply. It provides a power in CIL regulations to provide  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_764"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 764</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an exemption in CIL to other institutions established for charitable purposes. Subsection (5) defines such purposes as those falling within Section 2(2) of the Charities Act 2006 and allows CIL regulations to add or remove institutions from this definition. I shall explain that a little further.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="08111312000023"></a>While the outcome of discussions with the EU over other UK charity tax exemptions remains unresolved, we need to allow regulations to be flexible enough to reflect the possible outcome that UK exemptions may need to be extended to EU equivalents of UK charities should it be necessary. We would also like to have the flexibility to include charities from Scotland and Northern Ireland which choose to develop in England and Wales. One of the effects of subsection (2)(a) is that we would be enabled to do this. Achieving this in the Bill is easier said than done, however. Definitions of charities and regulations on the sorts of activities which they may engage in are significantly different in Scotland, for example, and it is highly likely that this is the case for other EU charities as well. Therefore, we need the flexibility offered in subsection (5) to ensure that regulations could include in this exemption charities from outside England and Wales whose purposes are comparable to those in the Charities Act 2006 and exclude organisations which would not be comparable. This will require extensive discussions inside and outside Government and is a matter best left for regulations.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="08111312000024"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will want me to explain the purpose of subsection (2)(b). Under this subsection, a power is provided to require charging authorities to make arrangements for an exemption or reduction to CIL for institutions established for charitable purposes, as defined in subsection (5). This is there for a purpose but it does not dilute the commitment to 100 per cent exemption contained in the duty in subsection (1).</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="08111312000025"></a>Many noble Lords were concerned by the possibility of a reduction rather than a full exemption from CIL being offered to a charity. Indeed this goes to the heart of Amendment No. 136AF in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, which removes &#147;reduction&#148; from subsection (2) to preclude the possibility for CIL regulations to require charging authorities to provide a reduction in CIL, effectively ensuring the power in subsection (2)(b) could only be used to provide a 100 per cent exemption in every case.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="08111312000026"></a>It is essential that we allow ourselves the ability to require charging authorities to provide reductions in CIL where giving full exemptions would violate EU state aid law&#151;in particular where a full exemption would exceed the &#8364;200,000 de minimis level of state aid allowed in any three-year period. That would apply only where a charity was engaged in an economic activity, was in competition with other undertakings and was engaged in an activity where there is trade between EU member states. The provision mentions reductions because that is what we want to be in a position to provide if a full exemption is not possible. On that basis I hope the noble Lord will not press his amendment.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="08111312000027"></a>Finally, subsection (3) permits regulations to provide that an exemption or reduction under subsections (1) and (2) applies only if specified circumstances are met.  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_765"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 765</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I fully acknowledge that the language in this caveat may cause noble Lords to question why it is there. Let me put on the record that we do not intend to use this provision to find some general way out of providing an exemption of the sort specifically required under new subsection (1). Indeed we could not lawfully use the powers there to render the duty in subsection (1) meaningless or hollow. Subsection (3) is there for specific purposes and is particularly necessary given the complexity of the charity sector both within and beyond the UK. We envisage its primary use is to deal with circumstances where the exemption could be used by a non-charitable body to avoid paying CIL and to ensure all reliefs given meet the criteria set out in EU law, particularly on state aids.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="08111312000028"></a>The penalties for failing to take account of state aid law, for instance, could be dire with charities potentially being forced to repay any illegal relief they had been granted, plus the interest accrued on it. I do not wish to put charities at risk in this way. We must have this flexibility, not least because CIL does not feature in a Finance Bill and therefore cannot be amended through primary legislation as quickly as other charitable reliefs. In addition, noble Lords will know there are still aspects of CIL which need further detailing in regulations and which this exemption may need to take account of. It goes without saying that we will continue to work closely with the local government and charity communities in framing these regulations. We have listened closely and will continue to listen carefully to feedback on the proposed details of our exemption when it is consulted on as part of the draft regulations.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="08111312000029"></a>This amendment provides a response to the concerns so eloquently raised by noble Lords on the floor of this House a few weeks ago. It contains a duty to provide a 100 per cent exemption. As with so much of charity law in this very complicated area we have had to lay a complicated amendment which takes into account a range of factors. I hope that noble Lords will not allow this to detract from its central purpose.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="08111312000030"></a>I turn briefly to the amendments to my Amendment No. 136AA tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Cameron and Lord Dixon-Smith. Amendment No. 136AB would remove the words &#147;wholly or mainly&#148; from subsection (1)(b) of government Amendment No. 136AA, meaning that a 100 per cent exemption from CIL for a charity applies where a development is to be used, to an unspecified degree, for the charitable purpose of the charity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="08111316000002"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I feel that I should apologise for interrupting her flow but it was necessary as she does not know what I have to say. I should say at the start that I am grateful to her for Amendment No. 136AA because it moves the Bill forward in a helpful way and provides a substantial degree of immunity for charities. The question is whether that degree of immunity is sufficient. My amendment will enable me to explore those limits further, and I know that noble Lords will want to explore still further.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="08111316000003"></a>I remind the noble Baroness that it is a fiduciary duty of a trustee of a charity to maximise the revenue income or asset value. Not least of the problems that CIL might cause, if we accept the sort of exemption provided at the moment, is that the charity might be put into difficulty over the possibility of the future development of, say, a field that may have been left to it. It may originally have been out in the open countryside but subsequently becomes surrounded by development. The only sensible thing would be to develop it, which introduces the question of the best way for the charity to maximise the return on that development. It may be for exclusive use for charitable purposes. If it was a charitable housing operation that might be sensible but if it was a particular type of housing, perhaps like the YMCA, the charity might not be able to take up use of the whole site.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="08111316000004"></a>Taking out the words &#147;wholly&#148; or &#147;mainly&#148; would go a long way towards overcoming that. But the trustees may find that maximising the return on that asset could involve commercial development and use for a commercial purpose by providing a revenue stream for the charity. That would be likely to produce greater revenue for the charity than selling the site with a liability to CIL. The question I need to explore with the noble Baroness is whether such a &#147;commercial development&#148;, which aims to produce a revenue stream for the charity and which of course would be used for charitable purposes, is included in the exemption. As I read Amendment No. 136AA, it would not. Therefore, the possibility of the arrival of CIL puts trustees of a charity in a difficult situation vis-Ã -vis their fiduciary duty.</p>

<a name="81112-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="08111316000005"></a>That may be wild imagination at work but, in my experience, we have to deal with the wilder flights of imagination. When I was heavily involved in local government some of the most productive time we spent was considering how people might defraud the county council. We had some fairly wild flights of fancy on that trip but we saved a lot of trouble as a consequence. We were able to put in place steps that inhibited such operations happening. We need to think about these possibilities. The real question is how far this exemption goes and where its limits are. It obviously extends to developing a site exclusively for use &#147;for a charitable purpose&#148;. That is fine, but then we have this extension if it were to produce a revenue stream to support the charity. Is there a point beyond that? I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="08111316000006"></a>The noble Baroness may find these technical questions difficult to answer tonight and say that she wants time to consider them and come back at a later

First, I must thank the Minister for her efforts to overcome our concerns on this issue. I recognise that our desire to exempt charities from the potentially devastating consequences of this levy has caused her and her team some difficulty. We do not really understand that difficulty, and our resolve to get this matter right has not been diminished. She mentioned European state aid. The advice we have had from our legal side is different from hers. As I said in Committee, I strongly believe this whole thing is the UK gold-plating. After all, there are exemptions for charities from income tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty and land tax, an 80 per cent exemption for council tax and exemptions from virtually every other tax in every other member state in Europe, and they have not been challenged. I cannot see this being a problem at all. We have to stick to our amendments as we have laid them down. I shall not repeat all the reasons why charities need exemptions, as I said enough about that in Committee, but suffice it to say that charities are exempt from virtually all other taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="08111316000008"></a>The most important thing is that they deliver benefits to society at a far better rate and at far better value than government possibly can. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, it cannot be stressed enough that they are very heavily regulated by the Charity Commission or the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator in Scotland. Regulation that is good enough for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs vis-Ã -vis income tax and capital gains tax must be good enough for CIL. As the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, said in Committee, what we need is certainty, and that we do not have in the Government&#146;s amendment as currently drafted. I still have the feeling that the only people who are going to benefit from it are lawyers and accountants.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="08111316000009"></a>I shall run through our amendments to government Amendment No. 136AA, bearing in mind that we want clarity and certainty. I recognise that there is a difference between charities governed by subsection (1) of the new clause, as defined by subsection (4), and other bodies with a charitable purpose as defined in subsection (2). Dealing first with subsection (1), as I understand it, it provides a compulsory exemption from CIL for all charities as defined in subsection (4), but it seems that both subsection (1)(a) and subsection (1)(b) have to be fulfilled before that exemption is a certainty. Subsection (1)(b) restricts the exemption to buildings that are used &#147;wholly or mainly&#148;, as in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, for charitable purposes. I have no doubt that the Minister will clarify that in her response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="08111316000010"></a>On the question of charitable purposes, the Bill refers to &#147;a charitable purpose&#148;, so I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that for &#147;purpose&#148; we can also read &#147;purposes&#148; so that three of our amendments are taken care of.</p>

Being a rural person, I immediately think of a dilapidated village hall being sold for development to a developer in order to build another village hall. The hall that is being sold is not going to have a charitable purpose any more, or it could be the car park of the village hall that is being sold by the village hall trust, which would most likely be a registered charity, to reinvest in the village hall. In both cases, if CIL were payable, the developer would almost certainly charge the charity for CIL in its price, and it would thus be the equivalent of the charity paying CIL in the first place. I cannot believe that that is the Government&#146;s purpose in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"></a><a name="08111316000012"></a>In my conversations with the noble Baroness and her team, it was suggested that some of my concerns about the limits of subsection (1) could be covered under subsection (2)(a). If that is the case, that adds weight to the need for our Amendments Nos. 136AD and 136AE, because it is vital that we have the certainty of &#147;must&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148; governing subsection (2). It is also important that subsection (2)(a) stands by itself, making the word &#147;or&#148; in Amendment No. 136AE crucial. The word &#147;or&#148; is needed for another reason. The present draft is entirely unclear as to whether it is the Government who are to make the exemption, the individual charging authority, or both. Those three possibilities are a recipe for utter confusion. I hope that, following our conversations, the Government will agree to both those amendments.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="08111316000013"></a>Amendment No. 136AF is again an attempt to achieve clarity and certainty. The noble Baroness mentioned the words &#147;or reduction in&#148;. I see her point of view, but I find them undermining and unhelpful. Giving a charity a 1 per cent reduction in CIL would satisfy the terms of subsection (2)(b), but would be of no use to the charity. We need clarification of what the Government mean by a reduction&#151;or, preferably, an alteration in the subsection.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="08111316000014"></a>We come to subsection (3) of the government amendment and our Amendment No. 136AF. Everyone to whom I have spoken in the charitable sector agrees that that subsection undoes all the certainty towards which we are working in the first two subsections. The words &#147;may provide&#148; and,</p>
<ul><a name="08111316000021"></a>&#147;only if specified conditions are satisfied&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111316000019"></a>need no further comment. Frankly, they undermine the whole government amendment and render it useless. The clause has to go; that is our bottom line.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="08111316000015"></a>Our final amendment in the group is as much for clarification purposes as anything else. Why do we need the words &#147;or not to be&#148; in subsection (5)? It might give the persons drawing up the regulation or even the local planning authorities entirely the wrong idea. We would therefore prefer that phrase to be removed.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="08111316000016"></a>I will not delay the House much longer, because it is very late, but, as I said at the outset, the principle behind our amendments is that no public benefit is to be gained by taking money from charities and giving it to government agencies. Charities are rigorously scrutinised for public benefit by the Charities Commission and provide benefits for society at far better value than  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_769"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 769</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>CIL or any of its charging authorities ever could. In my view, the government amendment needs to be totally reworded to give greater certainty and clarity to cater for the grave and sensible concerns of the third sector, as I have set them out. At the very least, we need the undermining subsection, subsection (3), removed from the clause.</p>

<a name="08111316000017"></a><a name="81112-0018.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81112-0018.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111316000025"></a>Lord Howarth of Newport:</b> My Lords, what would be the application of the new clause in Amendment No. 136AA to cathedrals, such as Winchester Cathedral where, I spent a rather large part of my childhood as I was educated at the cathedral choir school,, and Norwich Cathedral, in the city where I now live? I raise that question not out of idle personal curiosity but because I have been made aware that there is uncertainty in the Church of England, and therefore some concern among custodians of cathedrals, as to the meaning of the legislation for cathedrals.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="08111316000018"></a>Not having a close knowledge of this field, I none the less have the impression that the application of charity law to cathedrals is somewhat special. That may be because many cathedrals and their educational foundations and other associated charitable undertakings were in existence some hundreds of years before the 1601 Statute of Uses, which is the fountainhead of much subsequent charity law. Be that as it may, it would be very helpful if the Minister could clarify whether and how her new clause applies to cathedrals, and in particular whether they would be exempt from the liability to pay CIL, as the new clause provides. If she cannot give me a definitive answer this evening, perhaps she will write to us in good time before Third Reading.</p>

<a name="08111314000021"></a><a name="81112-0018.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81112-0018.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08111314000058"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> My Lords, my name is on some of the amendments in the group, and I too thank the Minister for the work that she has undertaken to move towards the position that we so earnestly desired in Committee. I have listened carefully to her explanations, which were quite complex. I was reminded of Sherlock Holmes&#146;s remark in a complicated case: &#147;These are deep waters here, Watson, deep waters indeed&#148;. We are in slightly deep waters with some of the points that she was making, and they repay careful study.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="08111314000022"></a>I emphasise one or two points that arise from the amendments that we have tabled. The first is the question of &#147;or purposes&#148;, as opposed to a single purpose in the Minister&#146;s amendment. Section 2(2) of the Charities Act lists very clearly 13 different types of charitable purpose. Some of them overlap very closely. For example, paragraph (a) is,</p>
<ul><a name="08111314000047"></a>&#147;the prevention or relief of poverty&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000037"></a>and paragraph (j) is,</p>
<ul><a name="08111314000048"></a>&#147;the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000038"></a>There will be charities that have more than one, perfectly legitimate, charitable purpose. Indeed, a charity that starts out with a single charitable purpose may have to widen that purpose, as year succeeds to year, because of the changing nature of our society and because the needs that it must reflect are slightly altered.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_770"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 770</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a><a name="08111314000023"></a>I reassure the Minister that, under the amendment, all cases would have to meet the charitable purposes test and the public benefit test. The Charity Commission would look at all of it, so there would be no question of people being able to slip through the net. I hope that she will be able to address that in due course.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="08111314000024"></a>I have a word or two to say about proposed subsection (1)(b) in Amendment No. 136AA and its implications for charities. My point amplifies the point that my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith has already made, and relates to how we will get to &#147;wholly or mainly&#148; and the way in which charitable assets are used. I shall give a short example to illuminate what I am trying to get at. Let us assume that we have a successful charitable care home, which is regulated and appropriately looked after. It seeks to extend its operations, which is something profoundly to be sought. It decides that it will fund these additional rooms and facilities by a public appeal. It has that appeal and applies for planning permission. Buildings are constructed and no CIL is payable. However, let us suppose that exactly the same charity, in these difficult economic times, decides that it cannot successfully appeal but has a corner of its land that it could sell, with planning permission, for commercial development. The proceeds will be used in exactly the same way&#151;to build more rooms in the care home. In other words, they will be used for charitable purposes. Clearly the additional rooms are charitable, but the development is commercial. It is unreasonable, unhelpful and disadvantageous to charities that are rich in land assets that they cannot build in this way without having to suffer a commercial disadvantage.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="08111314000025"></a>I may have misunderstood the nature of the Government&#146;s amendment and the noble Baroness may be able to reassure me. But at the moment we seem to have a distortion arising out of the choice that the charity makes of the way in which it funds its expansion. If it realises a land asset to build a building which is charitable, from the way I read this, CIL will be payable, but if it did it by public appeal, no CIL would be payable.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="08111314000026"></a>On the words &#147;may&#148; and &#147;must&#148;, the hour is late and the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, smote this ball to the boundary very successfully. Clearly, &#147;may&#148; is a weasel word which makes a matter optional. It may mean something or it may mean nothing. As the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, says, we need clarity on this.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a><a name="08111314000027"></a>On a slightly wider point, I am not quite clear yet as to why charitable purposes, as opposed to a relevant charity, have to be dealt with separately. As the noble Baroness made clear, proposed new subsection (5) defines the purposes of proposed new subsection (2), which refer back to the definitions in the Charities Act 2006, to which I have already referred. Therefore, it seems strange that we need to deal with this in a different way. The words,</p>
<ul><a name="08111314000049"></a>&#147;to be, or not to be, treated&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000039"></a>in proposed new subsection (5) mean that the Government would start to come into conflict with what the Charity Commission is treating as a charitable purpose.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="08111314000028"></a>When we considered the then Charities Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, who is not here, and all parts of the House were keen that it  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_771"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 771</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should remain independent of all political parties. Therefore, we now appear to be getting to a position where the Government are starting to conflict with the powers of the Charity Commission to decide how and what purposes are charitable. The Charity Commission has powers in its objectives that would enable it to close the loopholes. Like the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, my concerns are further underlined by the words &#147;or reduction in&#148;, which we seek to remove under our Amendment No. 136AF. Again, there is no certainty.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="08111314000029"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 136AH would remove proposed new subsection (3). As the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, has said, this appears to drive a coach and horses through everything we have been discussing. Proposed new subsection (3) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08111314000050"></a>&#147;exception or reduction ... specified conditions are satisfied&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000040"></a>I understand that the Minister, no doubt driven by her colleagues at the Treasury, is concerned about the way in which this could be used to evade fiscal and taxation responsibility. I ask her to ask her officials to look at the Charities Act 1993, which provides for a catch-all clause to prevent the sort of evasion that I think she is concerned about. Section 36 in Part V, &#147;Charity Land&#148;, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89"></a><a name="08111314000044"></a>&#147;Subject to the following provisions of this section and section 40 below, no land held by or in trust for a charity shall be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of without an order of the court or of the Commissioners&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000041"></a>which, in this case, is the commission.</p>

<a name="81112-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="08111314000030"></a>The section goes on to lay out what has to be done and states that we have to use appropriately qualified valuers. Where connected parties are concerned, the Act lays down that the commission has to be involved. We could reassure the Minister about the dangers of proposed new subsection (3). The Government have powers, within the Charities Act 1993, to block off that loophole and the Minister could reassure her colleagues in the Treasury that there is no loophole, and that the powers and the blocking powers already exist. I hope that in this way we shall be able to make the further step forward that we all earnestly desire.</p>

The best way to tackle this is to try and grasp what Amendment No. 136AA says. Proposed new subsection (1)(a) talks about a relevant charity. This is then defined in proposed new subsection (4). I do not understand &#147;relevant&#148;. Can the noble Baroness define an irrelevant charity? If there is an irrelevant charity, I would like to know what it is. A charity is a charity, so why &#147;relevant&#148;? I am concerned as to whether anything has slipped out because of &#147;relevant&#148; being placed there. Proposed new subsection (1)(b) is about charitable purpose. That is clearly about those who have not taken the trouble or felt the need to register as a charity, but it covers what they wish to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="08111314000032"></a>Proposed new subsection (2) is where the important concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, come in as to the position with what we might describe as investment property or investment land. Is proposed new subsection (2) saying that if it is a case of investment property or land, there is the opportunity for a reduction but not a requirement? Is that what that is about?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="08111314000033"></a>Finally, because it is late, I turn to proposed new subsection (3). It has to go. This really is a case of two steps forward and three back. Proposed new subsection (1) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a><a name="08111314000045"></a>&#147;CIL regulations must provide for an exemption&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000042"></a>That is a very positive thing to say to the charities. Then proposed new subsection (3) says,</p>
<ul><a name="08111314000051"></a>&#147;that an exemption or reduction applies only if specified conditions are satisfied&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111314000043"></a>That is a very negative thing for charities. Where is the clarity in this? Either charities are not going to be paying CIL or they are. &#147;Must provide an exemption&#148; ought to be as clear as clear can be. Then lo and behold, somebody slips in proposed new subsection (3) and takes that clarity away again. That wants to be crossed out&#151;got rid of.</p>

I will not test your Lordships&#146; patience by trying to do better than noble Lords who have gone before me and articulated so well what those uncertainties are, particularly the noble Lords, Lord Dixon-Smith, Lord Cameron, and Lord Hodgson.

The question of cathedrals was to be raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham. I can reassure my noble friend that we intend to ensure that the development by the Church of England of its cathedrals will be 100 per cent exempt from CIL. We need to investigate further how that will be achieved. Our current view is that an exemption could be provided for by using the powers in subsection (2). If that is wrong, other powers to make exemptions exist to allow us to do this, for example in Clause 214(1)(c). I hope that at least gives some clarity.</p>

In raising it I declare an interest as chairman of the Royal National Institute of Blind People. I want to probe further the notion of &#147;charitable purpose&#148; that appears in government Amendment No. 136AA. It is perfectly clear that the charity would be relieved from CIL if it was undertaking a development in pursuit of its core business, such as building a school. But what if it were undertaking a development that was not so clearly an example of provision for a beneficiary group, such as refurbishing its headquarters? Obviously that would be crucial to the maintenance of the charity, but not an activity directly designed to meet the needs of beneficiaries. Would that also be exempt? I would be grateful if the Minister could include this point in her response.</p>

We now move on to a different subject and I move Amendment No. 136D. Clause 203(6)(f) rightly provides for the regulations on an amount of CIL to allow for different rates, including a nil rate or reductions. There is a strong case for buildings which are replacements for existing buildings, and which do not make any significant fresh call on local infrastructure, to be either free of CIL or subject to a low rate. Where, for example, a farm upgrades a grain store to comply with farm assurance or hygiene standards, or a livestock farmer replaces a building housing livestock with one incorporating higher welfare standards, it would be unfair for these to attract CIL.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_775"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 775</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-0019.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="08111321000024"></a>Amendment No. 136D acts as a qualification to the subsection by specifically providing for such an approach to be applicable to renewal or replacement buildings. It is appreciated that judgments will need to be made about what is a replacement building and what constitutes significant costs, but surely it is desirable to establish the principle that such buildings should in general not be heavily penalised under CIL. Detailed delivery of this principle can follow in the regulations.</p>

<a name="81112-0019.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="08111321000025"></a>There are other points that I would like to raise with the Minister. There is also the question of cumulative development. Many commercially successful businesses will, over time, extend existing buildings or create new buildings. How does the Minister propose to treat such development for CIL purposes? Does she agree that it would be unreasonable for a business that paid CIL when it first developed a building to be hit again for a second levy payment sometime later if the expansion is on a modest scale? How will CIL distinguish between significant developments which clearly make a fresh call on local infrastructure and small businesses where the infrastructure requirement is small to negligible? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="08111321000026"></a><a name="81112-0019.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81112-0019.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08111321000181"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, Amendment No. 136D seeks a power for regulations either to provide for or to require the provision of differential CIL rates for developments which renew or replace existing buildings, where those redevelopers do not incur any significant costs to provide infrastructure to support them. I understand the noble Earl&#146;s point and we have had discussions with the CBI on similar issues. I am afraid the amendment would be unworkable and I should explain that it is at odds with the approach to CIL, so I have to explain my reasoning.</p>

<a name="81112-0019.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="08111321000027"></a>The amendment includes a test whereby redevelopments would be subject to a differential CIL rate only if it could be shown that they had not imposed a significant infrastructure cost. I understand what is behind the noble Earl&#146;s amendment, but my concern is that charging authorities would, in practice, find it impossible to define and measure a test of significant infrastructure costs for redevelopments in their area without incurring significant administrative costs and invoking prolonged legal debates. We have already had reference to the fun that the lawyers will possibly have with CIL. Should significant infrastructure costs be defined relative to, for example, the costs of other developments or redevelopments in an area, or what? Without the significant cost test, which I genuinely believe is unworkable, the amendment cannot in itself be justified.</p>

<a name="81112-0019.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a><a name="08111321000028"></a>Part of the problem is that redevelopments may well impose greater infrastructure costs than a new development. For example, an old house with some land can be replaced by a block of flats. That means many more people living on the same piece of land, many of them with cars, with many more needs for infrastructure support.</p>

<a name="81112-0019.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a><a name="08111321000029"></a>More important still, this amendment is also inconsistent with the rationale that underpins CIL. It is a generalised charge; we have gone over this time and again. It is there to enable local authorities to fund the infrastructure needed to support the development of a local area. Unlike planning obligations under  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_776"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column 776</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 106, CIL loosens the relationship between an individual development and the size of its contribution to fund infrastructure, because it is an average cost distributed evenly across a number of developments. The amount of CIL to be paid in a specific case will not be calculated on the basis of the specific need for infrastructure. I think that takes care of the noble Earl&#146;s point about cumulative development as well. We are looking at a generalised assessment and a generalised charge, because CIL is a strategic undertaking. For these reasons, I must ask the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.</p>

However, I do not think she made any attempt to answer the points that I made with regard to agricultural buildings. When a farmer is forced to replace a building not through reasons of his own but to meet new hygiene or quality assurance standards, in order to stay in business he will do so, probably making no difference at all to the infrastructure. Why should that person be subject to a CIL charge?</p>

Before the Minister moves that the first statutory instrument be considered, I remind noble Lords that in the case of each statutory instrument, the Motion before the Committee will be that the Committee do consider the statutory instrument in question. I should perhaps make it clear that the Motion to approve the statutory instrument will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="08111225000002"></a>Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008</h3>

<p><a name="08111225000009"></a><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111225000152"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000010"></a>The noble Lord said: This order is part of a wider programme of work implementing the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007&#151;many Members of the Committee will have very happy memories debating that last year&#151;which gained Royal Assent in summer 2007. The order relates to the principles and rules to be followed when granting pre-release access to official statistics. The rules, along with the UK Statistics Authority&#146;s code of practice for official statistics, will be used as the authority&#146;s benchmark for its formal assessment of national statistics.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000011"></a>Pre-release access to statistics is access primarily by Ministers and officials to the final statistical data in the form in which they are to be published in advance of their release. The aim of pre-release access is to enable such Ministers at the time of release to account for the implications of the policy areas for which they are responsible. Additionally, it allows Ministers and their supporting officials to take any immediate action that might be required in the light of the statistical information being released.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000012"></a>Following careful consideration of responses to its consultation on this matter, the Government propose to tighten the rules under which pre-release access can be granted. Pre-release access will be limited to a strict maximum of 24 hours, reduced from up to five working days at present. It will be limited to the minimum necessary number of people and a minimum number of statistics. Where pre-release access is granted, it shall be done in an open and transparent manner, with details documented and published at the time of release. The need for pre-release access to a publication and the people who are to be granted access will be reviewed ahead of release of the relevant statistics. The decisions on pre-release access will be led by the head of profession  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for statistics for each government department. Each department will publish the arrangements that it has put in place to implement the pre-release regulations.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000013"></a>Access will also continue to be allowed in a limited number of special circumstances, reflecting current policy, to allow, for example, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England to make decisions about interest rates, with access to the latest up-to-date statistics, and to allow journalists to support accurate reporting and well informed debate. Details will be published of the journalists who are to be given access to statistics ahead of release. The justification for pre-release access for each person receiving it should also be available on request. Once pre-release access to a statistic in final form has been granted, it will be under embargo, which means that its contents cannot be shared with others until the point of publication.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000014"></a>Those granted pre-release access to statistical releases must, as now, not alter or attempt to alter the content or timing of these releases or the way in which they are presented, and the pre-release access period must not be used for personal gain or political advantage. Pre-release access may be removed from anyone knowingly breaching these rules.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000015"></a>Only statistics deemed by the independent UK Statistics Authority to comply with the rules in the order will be eligible to be branded as national statistics. The Government will review the new pre-release arrangements after 12 months of operation, including assessing whether they remain consistent with the broader objective of building trust in the statistical system. These rules ensure that pre-release will take place in an open, clear and transparent manner, with clear accountability and always with a due regard to the public&#146;s trust in official statistics. It represents a considerable tightening of current practice. I hope that noble Lords will support the rules and principles set out in the order, to help improve the credibility and trustworthiness of official statistics. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000016"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008. <I>27</I><I>th</I><I> report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08111225000017"></a><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08111225000153"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the order, which deals with a very important subject.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000018"></a>In the United Kingdom, according to the Royal Statistical Society&#146;s response to the Cabinet Office consultation, pre-release access to statistics has been permitted to many more people, for much longer, and for many more statistical series than it has in other advanced nations. This, in its view, potentially creates mistrust in the public&#146;s perception of the independence of official statistics and increases the risk of leaks and improper comment. Since 2000, even for the key market-moving statistics, again according to the Royal Statistical Society, Treasury Ministers have allowed something like a doubling of the number of people to whom pre-release access is granted. Leaks have shaken confidence in Treasury statistics just when confidence in the markets is so badly needed.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000019"></a>The framework for statistics established by the Government in 2000 for the first time made explicit Ministers&#146; authority to determine who shall be granted  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pre-release access. Under this framework, departmental Ministers, including the Minister responsible for the ONS, determine which individuals should have access to national statistics produced by their respective departments in advance of their release, having first consulted the National Statistician.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000020"></a>The Government have too frequently spun statistical announcements to suit their own purposes. On 12 September 2006, the Prime Minister outlined the latest unemployment figures to the TUC conference prior to the public release of that information the following day. The Royal Statistical Society commented in its response to the Government&#146;s consultation that advance access to statistics leads to,</p>
<ul><a name="08111225000139"></a>&#147;mistrust of the independence of official statistics. It is this public and journalistic perception of mistrust which is at the heart of the problem&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000021"></a>The society would prefer the United Kingdom to follow the best practice of a number of advanced countries by dispensing with pre-release access altogether. Ministers would then only see the figures at the same time as journalists and everyone else. They would then issue a statement themselves, if necessary, later the same day. I can find no response from the Government to the points raised by the society but the Minister may care to comment on this.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000022"></a>Sir Michael Scholar, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, the very body established under the Government&#146;s Statistics and Registration Service Act, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111225000140"></a>&#147;the order is a welcome step forward in that it formally restricts pre-release access for the first time. But in the view of the Statistics Authority it still leaves government departments and ministers too much latitude. A system which continues to grant pre-access to statistics to ministers and officials, but not to other people, is unlikely to further our aim of promoting public trust in the Statistical Service&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111225000127"></a>He also said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111225000133"></a>&#147;The Authority&#146;s draft Code of Practice ... promotes the principles of equality of access to statistics and the release of statistics at the earliest possible opportunity. Pre-release access sits uncomfortably alongside these principles and must be kept to the minimum&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111225000128"></a>Again, I would be most grateful for the Minister&#146;s response to these points.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000023"></a>We on these Benches have been calling for some time for truly independent statistics, so we welcomed the Statistics and Registration Service Bill when it was published, although we felt that its proposals were too weak to ensure that statistics are genuinely independent of political interference. To recapitulate, our key issues with the Bill included the lack of an obligation for anyone actually to obey the code of practice; the fact that true independence of statistics would mean that all statistical activity in different government departments, not just national statistics, be subjected to the code of practice; the blurring of the lines between the executive and scrutiny functions of the Statistics Board; the fact that the board would be more credible if it were a part of Parliament, on similar lines to the National Audit Office, reporting to a committee of both Houses; and that the rules on pre-release access should be determined by the board and should be stricter. It is worthy of note that Section 11 of the Act explicitly states that  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the code of practice may not deal with any matter relating to the granting of pre-release access to official statistics, the rules and principles for which are to be provided by order by the appropriate authority.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000024"></a>We have the following specific issues with the order. First, the definition of those who are eligible to receive pre-released information is far too broad. Secondly, it includes advisers, which could include, at least, special advisers and third-party consultants. Thirdly, there is too much subjectivity over the circumstances in which pre-release access can be extended over 24 hours. Fourthly, there is no information about the sanctions for transgression of the code; frankly, we doubt whether merely not being allowed access to future information is much of an imperative. Fifthly, Ministers have the flexibility to dribble early information of their own selection to selected journalists. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s responses to these concerns.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000025"></a>We are concerned that the Government have missed an opportunity, with the order as well as the Bill, substantially to strengthen the integrity and credibility of the system. The review in 12 months&#146; time is crucial, and we look forward to it with considerable interest.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000026"></a><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08111225000154"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I thank the Minister for his introduction to the debate and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for reminding us of the issues which remained on the table when we differed from the Government at the end of the Bill&#146;s consideration last year.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000027"></a>I have a few questions of the Minister, some narrowly related to the order and some more general. We welcome the fact that there is now a restriction on pre-release. We argued strongly at the time that 24 hours as the norm was too long. The order provides that pre-release may be granted up to 24 hours. Does that mean that the Government will in every case take 24 hours as the norm, or can the Minister envisage circumstances in which the period would be significantly shorter? The order allows a significantly shorter period; indeed, it would allow the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, which we support, to have no pre-release period. Do the Government think that it will be 24 hours in every case? Although it was nearly five days in some cases, in others the tradition has been that the pre-release period was significantly shorter.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000028"></a>The Minister referred to a review after 12 months which would, among other things, consider the extent to which the new regime had increased trust in statistics. Will the Government or the Statistics Board undertake a survey to get a feel of whether trust has increased? When we were debating the Bill, well over 70 per cent of people, when asked, said that they had no faith in any government statistic. Do the Government or the Statistics Board plan to have a time series so that we can see whether the Act is having an effect on people&#146;s perception of statistics?</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000029"></a>One of the other provisions in the Act which is not referred to in this order but is hugely significant in terms of the way that it operates relates to the fact that the management of the release of information will be through a hub in the Cabinet Office. Is that hub up and working, and are the Government satisfied that those arrangements&#151;which are literally as well as figuratively the central part of the new system&#151;are now operating satisfactorily?</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000030"></a>Can the Minister also bring us up to speed on one of the other major issues that we debated when the Bill was going through the House? I refer to the staffing problems that were arising for the UK Statistics Authority in the light of its move to Newport. Considerable concern was expressed that key economic data would not be released on time because of staff shortages. I should very much welcome an update from the Minister on how that staffing situation stands.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000031"></a>Finally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that there has been far too much leaking. However, does the Minister agree that provisions such as this have no value if those at the highest level of government feel capable of leaking the most sensitive information to senior journalists, as happened on the eve of the Government taking a major stake in the banks?</p>
<h5><a name="08111225000143"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08111225000032"></a><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08111225000155"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who contributed to this short debate. I listened with the greatest interest to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, but his contribution could have been delivered in 2006 or 2007. In fact, it was delivered in 2006 and in 2007 by those who participated in debates on the Bill. I understand that he does not feel happy about certain aspects of the order that are now being taken forward. I understand his dissatisfaction with Parliament&#146;s decisions, but he has to live with the fact that his arguments were not accepted either in this House or, much more crucially, in the other, democratically elected place. He can make promises on what he wants to change in the future, and he can certainly indicate his continued dissatisfaction if he so wishes, but he cannot expect me, at this Dispatch Box, to reiterate all the arguments that I put forward&#151;I was going to say &#147;succinctly&#148; but will change the adverb&#151;laboriously during the Bill&#146;s passage, to the point where others were eventually either convinced or ground down by the sheer weight of the rhetoric. We have made it clear that we would carry out a review of this position in 12 months&#146; time, and we can return to the issues then. But all the criticisms that the noble Lord advanced related to the Bill which became an Act in the summer of 2007.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000033"></a>Somewhat grudgingly, the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and, rather more generously, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, indicated that they welcomed the fact that pre-release was being restricted by the Act and that the time limits that obtained previously were being reduced. I have to say to noble Lords that other countries are involved in pre-release statistics, but I had the impression that it was being contended that the British Government were unique in suggesting that Ministers should be in a position to see the statistics before release. Well, I have a list of one or two minor countries, such as Germany, France, the United States, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia, which all indulge in this practice. It was roundly condemned by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, but Governments find it to be essential in equipping Ministers to cope with material which in many cases is extremely complex and needs to be analysed.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000034"></a>It was suggested that Ministers would dribble out information to their favoured journalists. I cannot think of a single occurrence of that during any  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Administration that we have had in the United Kingdom. We intend under the Act to tighten up on pre-release. There will be no time for the practice to which the noble Lord referred to occur&#151;although he did not give any illustrations of where it had happened. I emphasise the obvious and crucial fact that the legislation takes official statistics out of the hands of government and puts them into the hands of the independent authority.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000035"></a>Greater credit should therefore be given to this significant change. It is bound to take time to work through and win public confidence. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, spoke about the low degree of confidence in official statistics, but he will recognise that that the legislation sets out to address that by creating the independent authority. It will take time for the Act&#146;s success to be seen. Being, like the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, a perceptive Member of this House, he will accept that official statistics tend to be in the eye of the beholder, and the extent to which they are believed reflects public perceptions of officialdom and, in particular, government. There will be fluctuations in that from time to time; Governments are used to having their reputation fluctuate during their period in office. However, a decent length of time in which we are able to judge the operation of the Act should bring the benefits which all sides of the House thought during the passage of the Bill should develop from independence of statistics. The order deals with the relatively narrow dimension of pre-release.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked whether the Cabinet Office is the hub of statistics. It is the base in which civil servants who serve the Government on statistics are located, which is why those who are here to support me today come not from Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury, as they would have done if we had had this debate 18 months ago, but from the Cabinet Office. However, the hub of statistics is not the Cabinet Office but the Statistics Authority. That is whole point of our having relocated authority from a government department to an independent organisation.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000037"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will feel reassured that the Statistics Authority needs time to be grounded in public confidence. But it has a pretty fair wind behind it thus far. I do not think that there has been, that I have seen, in any intelligent comments on the Statistics Authority, any comment that it is doing anything else than that it is doing the job that it was set up to do&#151;which was, to be the central independent authority for government statistics and the crucial decisions thereto. Therefore, I look forward in due course to seeing the benefits of both the creation of the authority and the other dimensions of the Bill which improve public confidence in government statistics. Of course, this order is merely a small dimension of that aspect.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked why the board did not report to Parliament via the Joint Committee. I remember us having that debate at some considerable length. The best way in which I may save the Committee&#146;s time is if, perhaps, the noble Lord and I could have a gentle read through <I>Hansard</I> together, to my delight and his enlightenment over decisions taken in that area.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000039"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000041"></a>The noble Lord said: The order that the Committee is considering today seeks to do two things: to modernise the governance arrangements at Lloyd&#146;s, and to remove restrictions that impede the future development of the Lloyd&#146;s market. As the Committee will be aware, Lloyd&#146;s is one of the world&#146;s largest markets for wholesale insurance and a leading part of the London insurance market. In 2007, Lloyd&#146;s members underwrote gross written premiums of &#163;16.3 billion and achieved a profit before tax of &#163;3.8 billion.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000042"></a>When the Government&#146;s proposals were discussed at an extraordinary general meeting on 21 May, 99 per cent of those Lloyd&#146;s members on a capacity-weighted basis who voted supported the proposals. The vast majority of those who responded to the public consultation also supported the proposals. In view of this, I do not propose to detain the Committee with a lengthy explanation of each and every reform, but there are one or two general points that I would like to make.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000043"></a>The first is that the governance reforms are all about ensuring that Lloyd&#146;s has the right people in place at the right time to meet the challenges that it faces. The Lloyd&#146;s market has changed enormously since 1982, and the Government believe that the rules now need to be updated to reflect modern standards and to ensure the governance arrangements are as effective as possible. The market-related reforms are also geared to ensuring that Lloyd&#146;s is able to retain its competitive position, reflected in the figures that I quoted earlier. Removing the rule that gives Lloyd&#146;s brokers near-exclusive rights of access to the Lloyd&#146;s market will give managing agents greater freedom to seek new routes to reach clients around the world and to bring business to the market, as well as supporting efforts that the market is already making to maximise efficiencies and drive down operating costs.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000044"></a>The changes to the ways in which conflicts of interest are managed are intended to provide more effective protection for policy holders and to complement initiatives already being undertaken by the Financial Services Authority in pursuance of its principles-based approach to regulation. It is of course right that we should be cautious in making these changes, and I might able to anticipate some concerns of the Committee.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000045"></a>In consultation, it was suggested that removing the restriction regarding market access could allow poor-quality business into Lloyd&#146;s and that the move to a more principles-based approach to managing conflicts of interests would remove an important protection for investors. I understand those concerns, but the Government do not believe that they are well founded, as we made clear in the explanatory document laid with the order we are considering today.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000046"></a>As far as market access is concerned, Lloyd&#146;s has made it clear that it will introduce a by-law to ensure that all brokers accessing Lloyd&#146;s are subject to the  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>same prudential controls as currently apply to Lloyd&#146;s brokers. In addition, managing agents are already required by FSA rules to monitor and assess their sources of business and distribution mechanisms. This means that all brokers bringing business to Lloyd&#146;s will be treated equally and there will be no drop in standards.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000047"></a>On conflicts of interest, we need to remember that the current rules are not completely effective, because they are limited to prohibiting certain associations between managing agents and Lloyd&#146;s brokers. It is possible for them to be circumvented and they would not apply to associations between managing agents and non-Lloyd&#146;s brokers. In a world where non-Lloyd&#146;s brokers have access to the market, they will not be able to achieve their aim.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000048"></a>In that context, the Government believe that a principles-based approach will provide a more transparent and therefore more effective method of enabling the Financial Services Authority to monitor associations between managing agents and intermediaries. That will work better than the current rules and provide better protection for investors.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000049"></a>As befits this situation, the Government&#146;s proposals have a very practical focus. They aim to reduce burdens on Lloyd&#146;s resulting from the Lloyd&#146;s Act 1982 by removing restrictions and unnecessary bureaucracy. They are not intended to change the more fundamental or constitutional aspects of Lloyd&#146;s governance arrangements. This is not because we seek to forestall discussion of such changes but merely because they are, quite rightly, outside the scope of the instrument before the Committee today.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000050"></a>The Committee will recognise that Lloyd&#146;s is a great British success story. It has been so throughout its 300-year history and it is in our national interest that it remains so for the future. This order is intended to support the excellent work that Lloyd&#146;s is doing and I commend it to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000052"></a><a name="81112-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111225000157"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I thank the Minister for that introduction to the order. The document produced by the Treasury was a model of clarity and comprehensiveness. I found it, for those of us who do not live our lives worrying about the minutiae of the way in which Lloyd's operates, a particularly helpful document. Given that I spent some time criticising the Treasury for not telling us what it was up to, it is only fair to say that this is a particularly useful piece of work.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000053"></a>The governance proposals in the order seem to be perfectly sensible second-order changes and I have no comment on them. The two more significant changes are those in Articles 9 and 10. I can absolutely see the competition arguments for the Article 9 changes, expanding the number of people who can place business at Lloyd's. I am reassured by Lloyd's intent to require that additional people involved in the market have the same prudential standards as those  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Lloyd's brokers. I hope that those standards will be in place when the order takes effect and be rigorously policed.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000054"></a>I have rather more concerns about the second substantive change, removing the prohibition on associations between managing agents and Lloyd&#146;s brokers. This provision, which is now being repealed, was introduced for a good reason, as there was a broadly perceived conflict of interest in the same organisation being able to undertake both functions. Once the changes have been made in Article 9, I can absolutely see why the changes in Article10 follow on, but there is a real danger that the same conflicts of interest as applied before will rear their heads again.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000055"></a>I have received very detailed representations from an individual who felt&#151;so far as I can see, quite fairly&#151;that he lost out significantly as a result of those conflicts of interest being in operation before the change that we are now repealing. He is very concerned that, once this goes through, the regulatory regime will not be strong enough in practice to stop conflicts of interest re-emerging to the detriment of those doing business through Lloyd&#146;s. I know that that concern was expressed by at least one of the people who made representations in the consultation process.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000056"></a>How is this conflict of interest to be avoided in future? The answer is that Lloyd&#146;s is putting some rules in place and the FSA will also be keeping an eagle eye on how the new system operates. I am concerned about whether the FSA&#146;s eagle eye will be sharp enough and whether its oversight will be sustained sufficiently from the start to avoid the likely conflict of interest that will emerge. If it were possible for the happy situation to arise in which the FSA&#146;s oversight was effective, I would absolutely be able to see why, from a competitive market position, Lloyd&#146;s would benefit from this change, but I remain concerned that the FSA will not be able to undertake that oversight as effectively as we would like. There is no way, a priori, of knowing whether that will be the case, but I hope that the Treasury will keep a very close watch on matters and that the FSA will report regularly on how it is exercising its oversight in that area. There was a major scandal in this area in the past and we do not want another one.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000057"></a><a name="81112-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08111225000158"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and I very much appreciate his anxiety in relation to his last point. On his earlier point concerning how soon the controls will be in place, there will be a slight delay following the passage of this order before the mechanism is in place, but I assure him that it will be very short and that it should not give cause for concern. Lloyd&#146;s has published its draft by-law imposing the standards. It is intended that it will be in force in the new year, so all the work has been done and it will follow very rapidly on the passing of this order.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000058"></a>I turn to the question of whether the new system will provide sufficient protections, and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that this is absolutely critical. The new rules will require additional disclosure from managing agents, so more information will be available. They will have to reveal any broker associations in their syndicate business plans and say how they intend  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to manage them. They will also have to report regularly to Lloyd&#146;s and to syndicate members the proportion of business that they have done with associated brokers, so that information will be provided. Most of those who responded to the document to which the noble Lord referred thought that this protection would be adequate and, indeed, that it was likely to prove better than the existing system.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000059"></a>On effectiveness, the FSA raises its head, and I am conscious that the noble Lord and I have debated such issues in a wider context in recent months. The FSA has rules on conflict of interest in financial services and has been operating these for a number of years. I recognise the pressure on the FSA with regard to crucial issues with the banking system in recent months and over the past year or so. But it has not been suggested that the FSA has failed to enforce the conflict of interest regulations. Our proposers will ensure that the FSA, Lloyd&#146;s and syndicate members have much greater information at their disposal, which will ensure that the actions of managing agents are subject to monitoring at all three levels, assisting enforcement in this area. That point has been considered. The initial information and the necessary protection which the noble Lord has identified is a crucial aspect of the order with regard to the governance of Lloyd&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000060"></a>To end on a most unexpected note, I believe I heard&#151;although I may have misheard&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Newby, offering some praise to the Treasury. This is a rare event.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000064"></a><a name="81112-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08111225000161"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the National Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Social Welfare and Other Fields) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000065"></a>The noble Lord said: This order, which relates to safeguarding and promoting the well-being of children and young people in Wales, will confer legislative competence on the National Assembly for Wales under Section 95 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. The Order in Council process created by the 2006 Act provides an enhanced mechanism to enable the Assembly to achieve its legislative priorities. The order is subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses and to the approval of the National Assembly. It was considered in the other place earlier today.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000066"></a>The powers being sought in the draft order will enable the Welsh Assembly Government to deliver on their aspirations for children and young people in Wales and to place greater emphasis on supporting those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged. While the Welsh Assembly Government have had wide-ranging executive powers in respect of children and young people for many years, those powers have proved insufficient for them to achieve their aims. That is why they have sought legislative competence for the Assembly, so that primary legislation relating to Wales can be reformed.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000067"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s principal aim is to consolidate and reform the law in relation to the safeguarding and welfare of all children and young people in Wales; to strengthen preventative measures; and to tackle child poverty. For some time there has been a growing difference of approach between England and Wales in the policy, planning and delivery structures for children&#146;s services. Wales, for example, does not have children&#146;s trusts. Children&#146;s services in Wales are based on agencies working in partnership, with the director of social services and chief education officer responsible for the welfare of vulnerable and disadvantaged children and their families.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000068"></a>The view of the Welsh Assembly Government is that the current restrictions in the law on child welfare limits them, in developing policies, to tackle Welsh solutions to child poverty and their agenda to strengthen support to vulnerable children and families. For this reason the draft order before you will insert a number of matters into Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006, principally in the field of social welfare. These matters concern the provision of social care services, the making of arrangements and planning to help both vulnerable children and children and young people more generally, and those who care for children. The matters also cover adoption, fostering and the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales. The draft order also inserts matters into the education and training and sport and recreation fields, ensuring that any Assembly legislation relating to children and young people can also cover aspects important to their welfare, such as play facilities and pre-school activities for children.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000069"></a>Taken together, these matters will enable the Assembly to legislate to consolidate and reform the law relating to the safeguarding and welfare of all children and young people in Wales, consistent with the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s policy aims. On 15 July, the National Assembly considered and unanimously agreed the draft order before the Committee. Prior to that, the Constitution Committee of this House considered the proposed order and confirmed that it raised no issues of constitutional principle. It was also scrutinised by the Welsh Affairs Committee and a committee of the National Assembly for Wales. The Government are grateful to all those who worked so hard to examine the issues in the order prior to its presentation today.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000070"></a>The process of scrutiny was rigorous and provided members of the committees, along with interested parties and stakeholders, with an opportunity to comment on, question and propose amendments to the proposed order. This led to significant improvements being made.  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I am pleased to say the committees supported the proposed order in principle. All recommendations arising from their scrutiny have been considered very carefully, and the draft order before the Committee reflects the outcome of those considerations.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000071"></a>The Welsh Affairs Committee sought assurance that the order did not provide competence to allow the National Assembly for Wales to remove the defence of &#147;reasonable chastisement&#148; relating to the punishment of children. I recognise that that is a point of some controversy and debate in Wales, as it is in England. I make it absolutely clear that the draft order before us today does not provide scope to allow the Welsh Assembly Government to legislate to prohibit smacking. Following pre-legislative scrutiny, this order&#146;s accompanying Explanatory Memorandum has been amended to make this point crystal clear.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000072"></a>The Welsh Affairs Committee also recommended the inclusion of the UK Border Agency and the Welsh fire and rescue services in the list of bodies upon whom the Assembly could place a duty of co-operation to safeguard and promote the well-being of children and young people. I can confirm that the fire and rescue services are included by virtue of matter 15.2. The Draft (partial) Immigration and Citizenship Bill published in July, subject of course to widespread consultation, places this duty on the UK Borders agency as regards its activities across the UK. I am sure that the Committee would agree that it would be inappropriate and presumptive for this order to pre-empt that legislation by including the UKBA within the scope of the draft order, when a Bill is out for consultation, which both Houses will scrutinise with the greatest care in the usual manner in due course.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000073"></a>The Welsh Affairs Committee recommended making it clear that the draft order did nothing to weaken the Children&#146;s Commissioner&#146;s powers in relation to whistleblowing. The Welsh Assembly Government fully agree that whistleblowing is an essential safeguard, but they wish to ensure that the Assembly can legislate on all aspects of the commissioner&#146;s role and are concerned that making specific reference to whistleblowing could restrict its ability to do so.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000074"></a>The draft order will enable the development in Wales of distinct legislation on child welfare, an area which has been devolved for many years. It will enable the Welsh Assembly Government to improve the lives of and outcomes for some of Wales&#146; most vulnerable children and families. It will enable the National Assembly to pass Assembly measures to ensure the welfare of all children and young people in Wales, to tackle poverty and social exclusion, to better define public bodies&#146; role in contributing to ending child poverty and to rationalise and consolidate the statute book on vulnerable children. This is sensible and worthwhile legislation and I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

I seem fairly regularly to be sitting opposite him; first it was on sport, then on gold, and now, of all things, on Wales, and children in particular, which is one of the most important issues in the order.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000077"></a>In principle, my party and I support the order, so we are not at loggerheads or fighting about it in any one way. The Explanatory Memorandum comprehensively sets out the policy background to the proposed order and includes the worrying statistic that some 28 per cent of children in Wales live in poverty, in households with incomes below the 60 per cent median. I say to the Bill team that I found the notes for the order comprehensive. They put me into the picture pretty quickly, which is a significant advance on notes to previous legislation associated with Wales. As I think everybody knows, there are 13 different ways of legislating for Wales. It has been complicated, but if the notes are an example of the way we are to go, it is clear that it is getting simpler.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000078"></a>I draw the Government&#146;s attention to the report of the Welsh Select Committee&#151;HC 576, published on 26 June 2008&#151;and its conclusions and recommendations. I shall not read them all out, but paragraph 1 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111225000134"></a>&#147;We do not believe that the process for the scrutiny of this proposed Order has been satisfactory&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111225000129"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Roberts will expand on that. Paragraph 8 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111225000135"></a>&#147;We note with concern the Deputy Children&#146;s Commissioner&#146;s evidence that the split in responsibilities between England and Wales for safeguarding and promoting the well-being of children and young people has resulted in vulnerable children not receiving the services they need&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111225000130"></a>The report makes quite clear what she found and quotes what she said. I would like an undertaking from the Minister that the Government have taken it on board and are moving to remove the gap into which those poor young people are liable to fall.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000079"></a>A number of other matters arise from the report on which I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s observations. First, although the evidence of the deputy commissioner to the Select Committee contended that there were legislative constraints on the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s ability to legislate in the proposed area, as a consequence of which enhanced legislation and competence were sought, those constraints were not made overwhelmingly clear. We still wonder what they actually are. A reference was made by the witnesses to the need for a Wales approach, but that in itself did not take things much further. What I am saying now is similar to what would have been heard by those listening in the House of Commons, because my honourable friend David Jones was there. He was ill this morning, so I have not had time to put my head together with his, but I have some of his script so that we are on the same line.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000080"></a>The Select Committee recommended that in future it would be helpful if, when existing legislative constraint is cited as a reason for applying for an order, a comprehensive explanation of that constraint were included in the Explanatory Memorandum. Can the Minister confirm that the Wales Office accepts the   


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recommendation of the Select Committee and that, in future, explanation of legislative constraints will be given in Explanatory Memoranda? Furthermore can he confirm that, in future, orders addressing a specific subject will be narrowly focused and his department will resist the temptation to widen the brief and go off into the countryside?</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000081"></a>Perhaps most importantly, the Select Committee noted with concern the evidence received from the Deputy Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, which I have already mentioned, and the split in responsibilities between England and Wales for safeguarding and promoting the well-being of children and young people. Interestingly, the evidence from the deputy commissioner was extremely disturbing; she noted the gap that I have already mentioned and went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111225000136"></a>&#147;To sit here and say it objectively is one thing, but when you are meeting these children and seeing the impact on them, you would not believe that these things are happening in the UK and there is not an organisation there which is able or empowered to properly champion their rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111225000082"></a>I hope the Minister and the rest of the Government will quickly find a way in which to put that right.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000083"></a>Most worryingly, perhaps, is that the deputy commissioner believes that in the aftermath of the LCO, after this order is passed, the cross-border problems could actually increase. Can the Minister assure me that that will not happen&#151;and I do not mean may not happen, but will not happen&#151;because of government action? Will he indicate whether the Government are already taking steps to put in place an overarching framework that will cover those things mentioned by the deputy commissioner in her evidence?</p>

<p><a name="08111225000084"></a>Finally, there was a recommendation from the Select Committee that the proposed order be amended to make it clear that nothing in it would weaken the Children&#146;s Commissioner&#146;s existing powers in relation to whistleblowing, which the commissioner described as one of his essential safeguards. The Minister gave that undertaking in his opening remarks, but it would be nice to hear it substantiated. Notwithstanding that recommendation, no provision appears to have been inserted into the draft order before us, so I welcome the Minister&#146;s explanation for why nothing in the order substantiates the powers of the Children&#146;s Commissioner.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000085"></a>I have pointed out some of those very important areas that still need work done by the Government. I hope that noble Lords and the Government will agree with most of what I have said, because I do not believe it to be contentious. I believe it to be caring and of interest to the families of children and others in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000087"></a>Certain things were not tackled properly and there are grey areas&#151;for instance, the relationship of the health service in Wales with health facilities on the other side of the border. I know how much we in north Wales have used and have been able to praise 100 per cent the Alder Hey children&#146;s hospital on the other side of the border, where our children receive some incredible treatment. Yet, these are grey areas that have yet to be resolved.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000088"></a>An order in council shows that our children&#146;s issues are paramount in the thinking of the people of Wales. They are always of real concern. We might not have children&#146;s trusts, but we were the first to have a Children&#146;s Commissioner. That became the model for the rest of the United Kingdom. We would like to be seen as ahead in proposing initiatives with which the other countries of the UK follow suit.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000089"></a>We welcome any new powers that come from an order in council, but as the new powers are devolved, there is need for further scrutiny. I wonder whether a 60-Member Assembly is sufficient to scrutinise effectively the additional powers devolved to it. Many county councils in Wales have more than 60 members. If only we had been listened to when we debated the Government of Wales Bill, we would have an 80-Member Assembly, as the Richard commission recommended. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000090"></a>We welcome this order and the opportunity for co-ordination. We see in the order a recommendation allowing a better understanding between the various areas of concern regarding children in Wales. There will be co-ordinated efforts to eradicate poverty. When one considers that so many children in Wales, some 28 per cent, are brought up in relative poverty and that places such as Merthyr Tydfil have the worst record in the United Kingdom, a great deal needs to be done to ensure that poverty belongs to the past and that the well-being of every child in Wales is safeguarded.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000091"></a>We look forward to further discussion and, who knows, there may one day be a senate or a parliament in Wales with the same powers as those enjoyed by the people of Scotland.</p>

The measure is very much in the mainstream of powers that were transferred in an administrative capacity to the Welsh Assembly and which were previously enjoyed by the Welsh Office before the creation of the Assembly. Therefore, the powers are very much near the heart, core and kernel of functions which have for some time been administered at an executive level in Wales.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000093"></a>More importantly, as noble Lords have suggested, the powers represent a specific Welsh approach to these matters. Such matters are, of course, common to every part of Britain, but there are many Welsh aspects that are dealt with in a particularly Welsh way. Members of the Committee have pointed out that there are no specific directors of children&#146;s affairs in Wales. Indeed, the work is done through the agency of the children and young people&#146;s partnerships. Those are controlled  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the 22 local authorities, which are coterminous with the 22 local health authorities in Wales. The system seems to be working well. The draft order therefore builds on what has already been shown to be a progressive, adventurous and fresh development for Wales.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000094"></a>I should like to make two brief points. First, the order does not, of itself, create any legislative authority for Wales. It creates a potential, nothing else. Very often I am asked by people in Wales how Part 3 of the 2006 Act operates. I try to explain it in this way: the general field&#151;think of it in physical terms&#151;has already been designated under the term &#147;field&#148; in Schedule 5 to the Act. The signs are up there, designating it as a field where generally the Welsh Assembly can operate. The effect of an Order in Council, such as we are dealing with here in draft, is that it designates, as it were, a building plot within that field. It does not create anything, but designates an area within whose boundaries something can be built. What can be built, of course, is an Assembly measure which essentially is exactly the same as an Act of Parliament as far as Wales is concerned. So we have the field, the plot, and, ultimately, one hopes, the structure that is specifically built upon it.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000095"></a>My second point is also very obvious. The Government of Wales Act 1998 was not meant to be a static picture. It created a dynamic system, a system of devolution. Indeed, one could say that it had been commenced with the creation of the office of Secretary of State for Wales in 1964. It speeded and made more efficient and transparent a development which had long been in train. The 2006 Act accelerated that process.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000096"></a>I take the point as far as Part 3 is concerned. This has been in operation for some two and a half years. We have seen a trickle of such instruments as we are dealing with this afternoon. I make no criticism of the speed with which these have been coming through because it is obvious that it needs a very long time to build up a core&#151;indeed, a whole body of expertise&#151;in relation to this. It cannot be done overnight. I appreciate that it will probably be a long time before the Welsh Assembly Government have all the resources that they need to be able to do this. But I would like to see the process speeded up somewhat.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000097"></a>Part 3 is essential as part of that dynamic process of devolution. It is also essential as a bridge to Part 4, as touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno. Part 4 gives the Welsh people the opportunity of deciding in a referendum, once that referendum is supported by two-thirds of the members of the Welsh Assembly, whether Part 4 shall be incorporated into law and become essentially a domestic Parliament, on lines not dissimilar to Northern Ireland or Scotland.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000098"></a>There are to my mind immense benefits arising from such a development, although not everybody here would agree with that. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, made the point, touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that there are restrictions&#151;some well known, some partly hidden&#151;in all manner of statutes and statutory instruments. It is, indeed, a terrifying task for a Welsh lawyer to have to go through this legislative maze to discover whether there is a specific description. Devolution in Northern  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ireland and Scotland has been entirely different. The legislation has been introduced en bloc over a whole area of jurisdiction, save such exceptions as have been specifically spelt out. In Wales, the situation is totally different, as it comes from hundreds of different sources which have emanated over the years through devolution.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000099"></a>I very much hope that there will be more and more of these orders. They will give the Welsh people confidence in their ability to deal with specific problems in a specific Welsh way, and indeed I also hope that they will lead ultimately, and before very long, to the creation of a Welsh parliament. For those reasons, I greatly welcome the order.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000100"></a><a name="81112-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08111225000165"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> I think that at this time we are all particularly conscious of the special care needed for vulnerable children, to whom the order applies, because of the dreadful fate and very tragic end of the 17 month-old baby boy at Haringey. That is still very much in the news and on our minds.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000101"></a>The order, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, enables the Assembly Government in Wales to pass Assembly measures, has been very closely examined by the Welsh Affairs Committee. I want to refer to only one major procedural point where I find myself in very strong agreement with the committee. Its first conclusion on page 27 of its fifth report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111225000137"></a>&#147;We do not believe that the process for the scrutiny of this proposed Order has been satisfactory, or that it has worked as intended. We would again urge the Welsh Assembly Government to synchronise the publication and referral of a proposed Oder to an Assembly Committee with its referral to Parliament by the Secretary of State. Failure to do so represents the single biggest obstacle to the effective scrutiny of proposed Orders and, coming as it does at the very beginning of the process, it adversely affects all subsequent arrangements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111225000131"></a>That is a very important paragraph. What appears to have happened is that the first draft of the order was reported on by the Assembly committee before it had been cleared with other relevant Whitehall departments. The rest of the story is recounted in paragraph 6 and the following paragraphs on page 8 of the report. Paragraph 6 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111225000138"></a>&#147;The process of Whitehall clearance had led to some substantial revision of the proposed Order as first published and laid before the Assembly ... Effectively, this meant that the Assembly Committee had undertaken considerable work in scrutinising and reporting on a very different proposed Order to that which was referred to the Welsh Affairs Committee. It also substantially reduced opportunities for formal joint working between the two committees, something which each committee decides on a case-by-case basis. On this occasion we decided not to conduct formal joint working, as the Assembly Committee had completed its investigations and published its Report&#151;almost two months before the revised proposed Order was referred to us&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000102"></a>This was a very serious situation. The proposed order in its revised form has therefore not been scrutinised by the Assembly committee, as that committee acknowledged in its second report. I am abbreviating this account, but it makes certain key points. This unsatisfactory situation could have been avoided had the proposed order first been cleared with Whitehall departments before being published and been laid simultaneously before the Assembly and before Parliament. That would have helped to facilitate complementary working by the two committees.</p>

It is important that there should have been scrutiny and an agreement by the relevant body of the Welsh Assembly before the matter came here. I ask him, however, to accept that the situation is to some extent ameliorated in this way. Over the past six years, four comprehensive statements of policy, very helpfully set out in the Explanatory Memorandum, have been published in relation to children and young persons generally and to vulnerable children and children in poverty. I believe I am right in saying that there is no proposal in any part of this draft order which is not specifically a proposal contained in one or more of those papers. Although it can fairly be said, and has very properly been said by the noble Lord, that there has not been scrutiny by the Welsh Assembly, this paper nevertheless contains nothing other than what the Welsh Assembly has set out, from time to time, in relation to these matters.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000104"></a><a name="81112-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08111225000167"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> I accept a great deal of what the noble Lord says about policy papers produced by the Assembly over the years. Of course, to a certain degree, this is the outcome of those papers. Nevertheless, here we are dealing with some very specific detail. I think he would agree that it would have been better had there been scrutiny of this order by the committee. I agree wholeheartedly with the Welsh Affairs Committee&#146;s conclusion and hope that the Government will somehow ensure that this sort of wasteful muddle does not occur again. By now there should be an established procedure, both in the National Assembly and here at Westminster, so that time and effort are not wasted, as on this occasion, and that proper scrutiny is carried out. Personally, I would like to see as much joint scrutiny as possible, with the relevant Assembly committee and the Welsh Affairs Committee collaborating closely. I still believe that we have a lot to learn from each other. Surely that is the way to a harmonious relationship between the National Assembly and Westminster.</p>

I want to concentrate on one paragraph in the <I>Fifth Report of Session 2007-08</I> of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. I concentrate on that paragraph because this order will set precedents and hurdles for the future. My concern is that paragraph 10 of that report sets out the principles which guide the committee in its examination of the order. The first question is whether the order is within the spirit and scope of the devolution settlement; secondly, whether there is a demand for the legislation that will follow the order; and, thirdly, whether the LCO is more appropriate than the use of framework powers in a Westminster Bill.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000106"></a>I speak with great respect for the work of the Welsh Affairs Committee and its members, but I am troubled by the criteria in paragraph 10. On the first criteria, on the spirit and the scope of the devolution settlement, I have been rereading the Second Reading debate on the   


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government of Wales Bill in 2006. Unless I have missed the point, and without having officials to correct me on this, that phrase is nowhere defined. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, may recall, because he took part in the debates in this House, that when the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, introduced the Bill, he spoke of this procedure as being the development of the devolution settlement. That remark can be found in vol. 680 of the <I>Official Report</I>, in col. 265. In the Commons, in vol. 441 of the <I>Official Report</I>, the Secretary of State said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111225000141"></a>&#147;the provisions represent a development of the current settlement&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 9/1/06; col. 32.]</ul>
<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000107"></a>In the past 15 years, Welsh devolution has been seen as a process. My noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan felt that it was a dynamic process, but it is a process or development. The report asks whether the provisions were within the process, as if it were a separate matter. I hope that we are not abandoning the vision of a process or development. I do not know whether the Minister can tell us whether he can place in the Library a note explaining the meaning of the phrase &#147;within the scope of the Act&#148;.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000108"></a>As for the second and third criteria, on whether there is a demand for the legislation and whether the LCO is the most appropriate procedure, I see no reference whatever to those criteria in the debates on this Bill in 2006. They appear to be novel and brand new. Surely those two matters are for the judgment and initiative of the Assembly; surely we can trust it.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000109"></a>I come to the second point that concerns me. I may not be expressing a general view, but it concerns me. The Explanatory Memorandum which went to the Welsh Affairs Committee seems to be acquiring a huge importance&#151;far more than some of us envisaged when the debate on the Bill took place in 2006. I am sure that the Welsh Assembly Ministers and civil servants will take note of that. My fear is that unless we are careful we may be coming to a stage where Parliament will require the Explanatory Memorandum to set out full and detailed particulars of the substance of the order which is to follow the Bill. In my view, that would not be a helpful development.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000110"></a>Apart from those few words of caution, I strongly support the order. I am sure that it will give the Assembly a means of providing better facilities for the children and young people of Wales. But, picking up on a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, I am beginning to think that there may be too few Members to undertake effective scrutiny of the Assembly measures which will follow this and other orders.</p>

<p><a name="08111225000111"></a><a name="81112-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08111225000169"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate. I hope that I have identified the key issues and that I will be able to respond to them. I had anticipated there would be some considerable debate about the policy areas of the proposal but we have been concerned rather more with process and how the devolution settlement is working. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, combined two concepts, which then became the subject of fairly intensive debate by the Committee. He said, first, that  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the order might have been handled differently and better; and, secondly, he raised issues, which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, also developed, about what the order meant in relationship to powers. That brought forth from my noble friends two definitions: first, their concept of devolution and how it should evolve; and, secondly, whether the order fitted within that framework.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was supported by his noble friend, as I would expect, but they are both pushing at an open door when they say that it would have been better if this order had been considered at the same time by the relevant committee. That is what we intend to do in future. It is unfortunate when decisions appear to have a pre-emptive quality imposed on them by whoever is first into the field. I emphasise that I agree with the representations of noble Lords that that would have been a better way of doing this. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said that the process might benefit from joint consultation and he went on to develop the point. But the Welsh Affairs Committee makes its own rules; the Government do not dictate to the committee its rules or procedures. We have learnt from this exercise that we would do better in the future to make sure that the process is carried on, if not through joint consultation, then at exactly the same time, and that there is no pre-emptive quality to it.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000113"></a>On the more general issue, I agree with my noble friends that the whole concept of the Government of Wales Act was to introduce a dynamic and a process of devolution. The Government of Wales Act set up a broad framework within which the National Assembly may seek to put forward orders extending its powers and seek the agreement of this Parliament to that position. That is exactly what this order does.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, refining the position of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, indicated that there may be constructive ways in which the process could be developed further. The whole point of an order is to explain its scope and content; it does not set out to explain where it fits in with the constitution of the Government of Wales Act and the process of devolutionary development. If it did, every order that came before us would be&#151;to put it mildly&#151;extensive and we would have debates that went beyond the order&#146;s framework and covered the whole process of devolution. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that the order has been carefully devised and is confined to the powers being sought, which is its proper role.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000115"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, indicated that he wanted reassurance on certain aspects of the order. I reassure him fully that we intend to protect the position on whistleblowing. He asked whether future orders could be narrowly focused. That depends on what one means by &#147;narrow&#148;.</p>

I emphasise again that we intend to lay the proposed orders before Parliament at the same time so that both bodies can see the orders at the same time, as is advisable. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, emphasised the possibility of joint working. It did not happen on this occasion, leading to the disadvantages that the noble Lords identified.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000119"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, also emphasised that orders should be narrowly focused. The orders have to be within the framework of the Government of Wales Act, as pieces of the devolution settlement; and the orders must have a clearly defined role, as the Act lays down. The Welsh Assembly is under a duty to ensure that the process is accurate. There may be wider issues which the Assembly thinks need to be addressed in policy, but it is for the Assembly to propose. If it agrees, it is then for this Parliament to make the decision whether, within the framework of the Government of Wales Act, the proposal before Parliament is acceptable. That is how we tackle such matters. I do not think that this proposal is unnecessarily wide. After all, the policy which it covers is quite discrete in terms of the care of children and young people.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111225000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that there were difficulties with the commissions and their operation between England and Wales. There are some difficulties, but however well legislation is framed, it still depends on how effectively people work within it. There will occasionally be possible difficulties but that is common to all legislation; in no way, shape or form is it a reflection of any failure of function in the orders put forward or in the powers of the Assembly in relation to the United Kingdom Parliament&#151;it is more what happens on the ground.</p>

I would like stronger reassurance that the Government will focus and take some action, whatever it may be and regardless of whether it is at administrative level and, therefore, below legislative level. If the Government and the department focus on that with both commissioners and their officials, I feel that the gap could be addressed.</p>

There is a genuine difficulty here, because under devolved legislation, the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales can deal with individual cases, but he cannot deal with the more general policy issues, because that relates to the criminal justice system, which is not devolved. So there will always be some differences and difficulties in respect of the powers and the relationship between the two commissioners. That has come up in our previous debates on these matters. It is a classic case of where the limits of devolved legislation produce different powers in relationship to the work of a devolved officer. I take on board that the noble Lord,

<h3 align="center"><a name="08111238000001"></a>Social Security (Lone Parents and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2008</h3>
<h5><a name="08111238000020"></a>5.33 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08111238000002"></a><a name="81112-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0004.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08111238000021"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Social Security (Lone Parents and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000003"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the regulations is to implement new arrangements for lone parents with older children who can currently claim income support solely on grounds of being a lone parent. It is a requirement that I confirm to the Committee that the provisions of the regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am happy to do so.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000004"></a>The new arrangements will mean that instead of continuing to receive income support until their youngest child turns 16, those who are able to undertake paid work may claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance when their youngest child reaches the age of seven, and will be required, with support and assistance, to look for paid work that is appropriate to their individual situation. Lone parents who have a disability or health-related condition  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that limits their capability to work may be able to claim employment and support allowance. To support these lone parents we have included amendments to the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations so that eligible claimants receive the work-related activity component from the start of their claim.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000005"></a>The decision to place the age threshold at seven was based on the principle that, by this age, these children would be settled in an established education routine and any disruption caused by the lone parent entering employment would be minimised. We propose to introduce the change initially for lone parents making a new or repeat claim who have a youngest child aged 12. The changes to existing claims will be phased in to ensure a smooth transition, starting with lone parents with a youngest child aged 14 from March 2009. The phasing will affect lone parents with a youngest child aged 10 from October 2009, and those with a youngest child aged seven from October 2010. This stepped approach will allow Jobcentre Plus to provide more support in helping lone parents make the transition between benefits and a move into employment.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000006"></a>The measures are consistent with the Government&#146;s approach that people should make full use of the support that is available to them and from which they can benefit to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. On this basis, the Government are committed to the principle that, once children are older, lone parents who are able to do so and are claiming benefits should be expected to look for paid work. These regulations are intended to help lone parents move into paid employment. The Government believe that these measures are a balance between providing financial and other assistance to support families and the wider responsibilities to lift individuals and children out of poverty.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000007"></a>The Government have consulted widely on these regulations, and after careful consideration of the views put forward by individual respondents and lone parent voluntary organisations and the views of Social Security Advisory Committee, have decided to lay the proposed legislation before Parliament, with clear provisions and safeguards to ensure that vulnerable lone parents are protected. The Government&#146;s proposals do not apply to those lone parents who are entitled to income support on other grounds. For example, lone parents who are in receipt of carers allowance, those who are fostering and lone parents who have a child for whom the middle or highest rate care component of disability living allowance is payable will remain eligible for income support.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000008"></a>The proposals will, however, apply to lone parents claiming income support and educating their children at home. The Government recognise the right of a parent to choose to home educate their children but do not provide them with the funding to do so. Lone parents who are currently claiming income support receive their benefit solely based on their status as lone parents, not as home educators.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000009"></a>To make sure that the welfare of children is not compromised by these changes, the regulations also make lone parents a vulnerable group, so the jobseeker&#146;s allowance hardship regime may apply in certain  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>circumstances. Although we want to apply sanctions only when absolutely necessary, sometimes it is necessary to use compulsion to encourage people to acknowledge their responsibilities and make sure that those who can work do not opt out. Provided that lone parents meet the conditions of eligibility for jobseeker&#146;s allowance they will not be sanctioned. When a sanction is applied, no lone parent who is entitled to a hardship payment will be subject to a sanction of more than 40 per cent of their personal benefit allowance.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000010"></a>The regulations will include transitional protection for lone parents who receive income support and who are full-time students, undertaking a full-time course of training on the new deal for lone parents, or on an approved scheme which meets the objectives of the new deal for lone parents. We propose that lone parents in these circumstances will remain entitled to income support until their youngest child reaches the relevant age in force at the time they commence their studies, or the end of the course, whichever is the sooner. Currently, lone parents claiming income support are required to attend a work-focused interview at six-monthly intervals. To provide opportunities to prepare and support lone parents for the change in their last year of eligibility for income support, the regulations include the introduction of mandatory work-focused interviews on a quarterly basis.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000011"></a>The changes form part of the Government&#146;s ongoing package of welfare reform and strategy to eradicate child poverty. In Budget 2008, the Government invested an extra &#163;950 million in measures to continue to tackle child poverty. More than one-third of children in lone-parent households live in poverty. Fifty-eight per cent of children in workless lone-parent households live in poverty. This figure decreases to 19 per cent when the lone parent works part time, and to 7 per cent if the lone parent works full time.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000012"></a>The Government believe that the regulations create the right balance between providing financial and other assistance to support families, and their wider responsibilities to lift individuals, families and children out of poverty. To delay implementation, as some have suggested, would mean that lone parents who can undertake paid work may not take up the assistance available to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. Of course, in addition to the financial return, paid work provides far-reaching social, health and personal benefits for both the lone parent and the children in their household. The regulations are intended to open the opportunities of paid work to more lone parents and support them to have a better standard of living for themselves and their families.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000013"></a>We know that some of our customers face greater barriers in obtaining paid work than others, especially parents who may have extra challenges because of their children&#146;s needs. To recognise this, the Government have provided extra support to lone parents to assist them to find and keep a job and to progress once they have settled into employment. Support to help lone parents find work includes the New Deal for Lone Parents, which offers access to a specialist Jobcentre Plus personal adviser and a range of additional services such as extra financial support and access to training.  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Since its introduction in 1998, the New Deal for Lone Parents has helped more than half a million lone parents to find work.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000014"></a>In-work credit is now available nationally to help lone parents make the transition into employment, as well as help sustainability and progression in work. This is an additional payment of &#163;40 a week&#151;or &#163;60 in London&#151;for 52 weeks to lone parents who leave benefits for work of at least 16 hours a week. Lone parents are also able to access help when they are settling into their job. Jobcentre Plus can provide financial help to overcome any unexpected financial barriers which might otherwise prevent them remaining in paid work. Lone parents can also access in-work advisory support provided by Jobcentre Plus Advisers to help resolve any difficulties and guide individuals towards any support needed, such as skills and training.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000015"></a>Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the availability of childcare. We have substantially improved childcare options for working families. More than &#163;3.5 million a day supports lower and middle-income families with their childcare costs through the tax credit system. We have more than doubled the availability of childcare provision in England since 1997, with the stock approaching 1.3 million places. As a devolved issue, the Scottish and Welsh Governments have in place childcare strategies which aim to extend access to high-quality, affordable and flexible childcare. The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on local authorities in England and Wales to secure, so far as reasonably practicable, sufficient childcare to meet the requirements of parents in their area who require childcare in order to work or to undertake training or education to prepare for work. A key element of this in England is extended schools, offering affordable, school-based childcare on weekdays between 8 am and 6 pm, all year round. More than 14,230 schools are already offering the core extended services.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000016"></a>We recognise that lone parents who do not have the support of a partner may require extra help in balancing the needs of their families and looking for paid work. The regulations give Jobcentre Plus staff additional flexibility to help and support lone parents who are actively seeking work while often facing challenging circumstances. Importantly<I>,</I><I></I>Jobcentre Plus staff must consider whether it was unreasonable for the person to stay in a job or to take up a job because appropriate affordable childcare was not available. That may help lone parents facing particular circumstances, such as those who educate their children at home.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000017"></a>It is clear that the current global economic climate means that we shall face challenging times. It is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of previous slowdowns and allow people to slip into long-term inactivity. This is bad for the individual and their families, trapping them into dependence and poverty. The labour market is dynamic, with millions of moves between employment and unemployment every year. Job opportunities will continue to become available; for example, there are around 600,000 job vacancies in the economy. Our active labour market policies will ensure that lone parents do not become further detached from the labour market and are well placed to benefit from current jobs and other opportunities as the economy picks up.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111238000018"></a>I firmly believe that the regulations will result in more people obtaining a better life for themselves and their families and will lift more children out of poverty. The regulations will make sure that the right help and support will be available for lone parent customers who are able to undertake paid work but often face challenges to do so. At the same time, we will ensure that those customers for whom work is not an option are supported in a way that best suits their circumstances. The Government believe that the additional flexibilities to jobseeker&#146;s allowance contained in the regulations, along with the operational safeguards and Jobcentre Plus guidance and training, offer protection for all lone parents, particularly the most vulnerable. I commend the regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<h5><a name="08111245000118"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08111245000002"></a><a name="81112-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111245000124"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The Grand Committee will be most grateful to the Minister for his careful explanation of these regulations. So careful was it that I was tempted to think that the noble Lord did protest too much, but perhaps that would be unfair to him. I am grateful also for the letter that he sent me explaining briefly&#151;very briefly indeed in comparison with the speech he has just made&#151;the regulations before us today. I was slightly less pleased that I received the letter only after Questions today. I know it is not the Minister&#146;s fault, but somewhere in the system something has clearly gone wrong.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000003"></a>The Minister will be pleased to know that I find the second set of regulations that we are discussing this week quite a different cup of tea from the first. That said, like the Government, we believe that the best way out of poverty, and often ill health, is work. I therefore have no difficulty with the policy behind the regulations. There is no logic in continuing to pay income support to lone parents with school-age children until their youngest child passes compulsory school age.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000004"></a>However, the Minister will have read, as I have, the Social Security Advisory Committee&#146;s comment that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111245000114"></a>&#147;Overall, we have considerable reservations about the proposals, both in terms of their potentially negative impacts and their potential to improve the situation of lone parents and their families and to reduce child poverty&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111245000110"></a>Although I do not agree with that committee in total, it is right when it says that success in getting lone parents into work depends on the availability of out of school activities, whether in conventional childcare or in school activities out of school hours, especially in the holidays. We do not want to end up with an increasing number of latch-key kids or children wandering the streets in gangs and getting up to all kinds of trouble.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000005"></a>There is also the potential for the breakdown of family relationships. This will be particularly important when we get to the post-October 2010 period, when income support will remain only for lone parents whose youngest child is less than seven years old. It is  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about the seven to 10 year-old age group that I am most worried. Naturally I read the report of the discussion of this order in another place and observed that the Minister&#146;s colleague agreed with the point that I have just made, saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111245000116"></a>&#147;the crucial point is that the whole system depends on appropriate child care being available&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Sixth Delegated Legislation Committee, 30/10/08; col. 18.]</ul>
<p><a name="08111245000111"></a>She had said earlier that the Government had,</p>
<ul><a name="08111245000117"></a>&#147;more than doubled the availability of child care provision in England since 1997, with the stock approaching 1.3 million places&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Sixth Delegated Legislation Committee, 30/10/08; col. 5.]</ul>
<p><a name="08111245000112"></a>The Minister has just repeated that figure.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000006"></a>My questions on this are twofold. Are these places currently filled? Will they cope with the extra number of children that these regulations will bring into the need for childcare? Are these places evenly spread around the country, especially in rural areas? Is every primary and secondary school open in the school holidays? I observe that page 4 of the SSAC document says, in paragraph 21, that services are increasingly available. That does not strike me as a satisfactory answer to those questions, nor does it help lone parents very much.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000007"></a>According to the Minister&#146;s colleague, the figures are quite large, with 58,000 lone parents apparently having a youngest child aged 12 or over, 32,000 a youngest child of 11 or over, 38,000 a youngest child of 10 or over and 83,000 a youngest child of seven or older. Can the Minister say how many children all those people have? Doubtless it will average out at more than one.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000008"></a>There are other points of concern on which I should question the Minister. First, there will be a gap in lone parents&#146; income when they are automatically transferred from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, or employment support allowance, as the case may be. These individuals are, by definition, among the poorest in the country and an absence of income, if only for a week or two, will make them temporarily poorer still. &#147;Oh well, they can get a temporary loan from the Social Fund&#148;, I have heard Ministers say. That may be so if the local Social Fund has enough money in its coffers. Will the fund get an increase in subvention to cope with the undoubted calls upon it? In addition, is it wise to place lone parents into debt&#151;perhaps even further into debt? Is it really not possible to speed up the transfer process and pay the money over immediately, and then to get the jobseeker&#146;s agreement form signed later or even make the single parents come into the jobcentre and complete the whole process then and there? Only if they do not come should there be a gap in their benefit income; in other words, it would be an extra sanction to the ones the Minister mentioned.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000009"></a>I noted on page 5 of the SSAC report that arrangements had been put in place between the DWP and HMRC to encourage lone parents to claim child tax credit at least six months before the date on which they would lose their entitlement to income support. I do not pretend to be an expert or, indeed, to have any knowledge whatever about child tax credit, but the fact that it has the words &#147;tax&#148; and &#147;credit&#148; in its title  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must mean that at some point during the year the lone parents in question must have been paying tax&#151;otherwise, they could not get a tax credit.</p>

In that case, I shall have the answer in due course. I know that those credits go on for a full year. Nevertheless, many of those lone parents will have been out of work for some considerable time&#151;I would guess at least seven years, and probably seven years plus maternity pay, possibly even longer. Some will never have worked at all.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000013"></a>The subject of jobcentres brings me to the training of officials, who are particularly stretched at the moment by a reduction in numbers at a time when unemployment is on the increase&#151;to 1.82 million&#151;and only 589,000 jobs are available. I noted that the Minister&#146;s figures on that particular item drifted a little between Question Time today and the speech that he has just made. There was a difference of 2,000. That is a tease that I could not resist. One wonders how long this will last, with small and medium enterprises failing at the rate of 50 a day, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. What extra training have officials been given to cope with the extra demands being placed on them by this order? How much will they know, and inform parents, about what childcare is available locally, for example? Presumably, the parents will be expected to pay something towards the childcare that their children receive; if so, to what extent does the Minister expect lone parents to be better off when paid the minimum wage?</p>

<p><a name="08111245000014"></a>Lastly, and on a more general point, I said at the beginning of my speech that the Official Opposition believe that the policy of getting more people into work, whether lone parents or others, is the right one. I did not, however, say how pleased we are that the Government have adopted a fair proportion of our welfare to work policies, as shown by their acceptance of the Freud report. However, the way in which the Government are going about it makes me ponder. Do they have any intention at present of doing away with jobseeker&#146;s allowance altogether in favour of the lower rate of ESA? Although I see a certain logic in that, now would not be the time to do it. Nor am I certain that, at a time of deepening recession, now is the time to move lone parents with children aged between 10 and 16 from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Will the Minister tell us why the Government have introduced this order now, with unemployment rising as fast as it is?</p>

I am reminded of the story that Frank Field used to tell about visiting a school in Birkenhead. He asked a 10 year-old what he was going to do when he grew up, and that 10 year-old said, &#147;I&#146;m going to get my benefit&#148;. That image of children living in a home in which two or three generations have not

I suspect that none of us in this Room doubts the need to encourage lone parents, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, rightly said, to remain attached to the labour market and to help them to prepare for that by investment in training so that they do not permanently bump along at the bottom on the minimum wage, relying on tax credits to improve their income. Therefore, the move from IS to JSA is fine. I hope that ultimately this will be one of the most effective levers with which to address child poverty, which is what matters above all.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000016"></a>I wish to raise a couple of points, the first of which concerns language. Throughout the document, lone parents are referred to as &#147;he&#148;. I understand that in law &#147;he&#148; includes &#147;she&#148;. It would be quite nice, given that 95 per cent of lone parents are female, for &#147;she&#148; to include &#147;he&#148; on occasion. There is no linguistic reason why that should not be the case. I do not know whether the blokes in the Room have noticed this, but it does rather hit one.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000017"></a>The substantial point is to give assurances about the nature of the conditionality of JSA and the conditionality attached to resuming JSA, should one lose a job. Those are the areas that we are concerned about, some of which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has mentioned.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000018"></a>[<I>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.56 to 6.06 pm.</I>]</p>

Perhaps I could now explore conditionality, which is the core of this. I am sure that my noble friend will be able to give us the reassurances that we need to feel entirely comfortable about this policy.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000020"></a>On the conditionality of JSA, my noble friend was very sensitive about the different situation faced by lone parents juggling childcare compared with the average people on JSA who tend to be younger, single people, three-quarters of whom are on JSA for less than six months and who will move very quickly into the labour market. That will not be the case for many lone parents who have had many years away from the labour market, particularly as they face limitations which the younger, single people on JSA will not face. The first is the suitability of a job. Jobs between the hours of 9.30 am and 2.30 pm are like gold dust. In my experience, they seldom exist, unless you are lucky enough to have a very supportive employer. Increasingly, lone parents take jobs which, in previous years, we used to call &#147;unsocial hours&#148; jobs. They are in catering or cleaning, retailing on a Saturday, or working Friday evening in the newsagents, the chip shop or the launderette. Suitable formal childcare is not available with such jobs. So there is a problem about the availability of suitable jobs with the backing of childcare.</p>

<p><a name="08111245000021"></a>Secondly, lone parents, particularly in rural areas, may have a very real problem with juggling transport. Most lone parents are not able to afford a private car and public transport will be weak. A lone parent has to juggle taking a child to school or to the childminder or wherever, along with getting herself to work. All that will bite into the time available for part-time  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work, and hence the wage, which will affect both the conditionality of JSA interviews and the ability to hold down a job under pressure.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000022"></a>There is also the problem of reclaiming JSA if a job folds for whatever reason. Conventionally, you do not easily reacquire JSA if you have voluntarily left a job. That is understandable in most circumstances, but not here. If your child is sick and cannot go to school and the childminder will not look after him as he may infect other children, as the child&#146;s carer&#151;the European Court has already established what that would mean&#151;you cannot work. That is understandably inconvenient for the employer and, therefore, the job may fold, as a result of which there may be a question about reaccessing a JSA claim as it could be perceived that you have voluntarily left the job because you were not able to fulfil the perfectly reasonable requirements of the employer. There will be conflicts here in which both sides are right, and that will require sensitive negotiation.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000023"></a>The problems of reclaiming JSA will be at least as hard for many lone parents as they would be if they were going from JSA into the labour market. Alongside that will be the ability to reclaim housing benefit, which often takes weeks and weeks. I suspect that something like the linking rules that currently apply to disabled people will need to be applied to lone parents who have no income and are reliant on JSA&#151;if they have been able to reclaim it&#151;as part of the New Deal framework. That would be necessary to smooth the transition and avoid finding not just the lone parent but, even more importantly in my view, the child exposed to serious poverty.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000024"></a>Lone parents&#146; advisers who are handling the New Deal have a wonderful track record in acting as sheepdogs for their sheep, taking the lone parent to job interviews and helping them to buy clothes and so on. Will the task of encouraging lone parents to go not only on to JSA but into the labour market be entrusted to those self-same lone parent New Deal advisers? If not, what additional training will be given to what are often young single men who are well intentioned, I do not doubt, but have no experience whatever of trying to juggle difficult issues where there is absolutely no financial margin with which to play?</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000025"></a>I would be much more comfortable with the regulations if we had already securely banked the right to ask for flexible working for parents with children over the age of six. The Government are intending to introduce that but it appears to have been deferred at the moment. I would also feel much more comfortable if I knew that we could support the childcare of choice of most lone parents, which is that provided by grandparents. Twenty-six per cent of all childcare provided for women in work comes from grandparents. That is even more important in rural areas and for lone parents who work unsocial hours. Whatever the JSA regulations say, lone parents will often feel guilty about going into the labour market unless they have childcare they trust, and the childcare they trust is the sort that they themselves give the child, which is very often that provided by their own mother. They know that that childcare means that the child will be taken to the doctor if he is feeling poorly or be hugged if necessary,  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and it will be available if the mother is running late because the trains are late or the bus is not running, or whatever.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000026"></a>I am delighted that from 2010 we shall be giving carers of older people a national insurance credit if they care for 20 hours a week. I understand the argument that going for a childcare tax credit for grandparents in their fifties to pay for the childcare that would otherwise go to a childminder may produce a dead-weight loss. However, if a grandparent enables a lone parent to work, that lone parent, who would have been entitled to HRP, will not be claiming it but will be paying their own NI credits instead. Therefore, in a sense, it amounts to a transfer of the NI credit. I hope that my noble friend can take that away and look at it, because that would be one way of making the system easier. A lone parent would feel more guilt-free about entering the labour market and sustaining a job&#151;which, after all, is the point of JSA&#151;if she had childcare which she trusted, was stable and would strengthen family bonds. That can be provided by a grandparent. If we decide that we cannot afford to pay for it, we can at least ensure that that grandparent in their fifties is not penalised by losing access to their pension.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000027"></a>We should remember the problem that we had with tax credits. From the latest statistics that I saw, the core problem was that 50 per cent of lone parents experienced more than 10 changes of circumstance in any one year. As a result, the computer system toppled&#151;it simply could not keep up with the continuously changing circumstances. For lone parents, the job contours may have changed or they may have a new partner in their life. But the primary cause of the changes of circumstances which toppled over the tax credit computer system was changes in childcare.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000028"></a>I have no confidence that we have fully addressed that problem. We may provide after-hours care, but if the child is tired, the child wants to go home and does not necessarily want to stay at school until 6 o&#146;clock when the mother can come. That applies to weekends, if the mother has to work in Debenhams, for example, on a Saturday, and to holidays. Unless we can ensure that there is childcare that is stable and reliable which the mother trusts, the lone parent will be in a revolving door situation between JSA and work, JSA and work. Every time the childcare collapses, which, from the tax credits records appears to be once a month on average, that lone parent will be out of the labour market. At that point, the employer will understandably get increasingly pressured, particularly in small firms, and lone parents will find themselves back on JSA again.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000029"></a>I am not confident that we have fully taken on board the ramifications of what that means. Having said that, I remain supportive of the policy. The most important thing we can do to address child poverty is to encourage the lone parent, as soon as is possible, back into the labour market, without having her fray under the pressure we put on her.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000030"></a>I hope that my noble friend can give me the assurances I seek on suitability of jobs, issues of transport and, above all, supporting the childcare the lone parent most needs to have available to her, which is probably that provided by her own mother.</p>

She is an expert in these matters and I concur with just about everything that she said. I, too, have no rooted principled objection to these orders, but it is worth remembering that the Social Security Advisory Committee recommended that the Government did not proceed with the regulations for a variety of operational and administrative reasons, rather than those of principle.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000032"></a>I pay tribute to the Merits Committee for its work on these regulations; it has helped the work of the Grand Committee considerably. The same applies to the Social Security Advisory Committee, whose report is instructive and informative. The Government&#146;s Explanatory Memorandum is also a very useful document. As the department develops its policy, documents of that kind and in such detail help us all get a framework within which these changes can be judged.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000033"></a>I will try to be brief; I could talk all night about this subject, but I will resist that temptation. I want to talk about the philosophy and about operational capacity in the department; and then add requests for assurances to those that the noble Baroness has just made.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000034"></a>I detect that these regulations take us quite a few more steps along the road of the &#147;responsibility&#148; agenda. Work first is a condition of benefit in the new active labour market proposals. In a normal, stable environment, when this policy was first put together&#151;some months ago, if not years&#151;there was a case for saying to people, &#147;It doesn&#146;t matter if you&#146;re better off, your responsibility is to take work and then trade your way out of that with help&#148;. I acknowledge that there has been a lot of support. It is contained at some length in the Explanatory Memorandum; it is useful to have it all set out in one place again.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000035"></a>We have to be very careful, in the ugly financial circumstances that we will be facing in the next 18 months to two years, of saying that this is a work-first agenda and that people have a responsibility, if they are claiming benefits, to seek work even if that does not mean that they are financially better off. There are some circumstances in which that can happen.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000036"></a>Lone parents are in a unique position because they have to balance family responsibilities in a way that perhaps other claimants do not. That puts them in a unique dilemma. While the work-first agenda may have to be deployed, we have to deploy it with real care if we are talking about lone parents.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000037"></a>The first thing I would really like to do&#151;I think that I know the answer to this, or at least I hope I do&#151;lies in a quote from Mr Peter Hain, when he was the Secretary of State, in a speech that he made to Barnardo&#146;s on 29 November 2007, which is on the departmental website. He said, in talking about the development of this policy:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111245000115"></a>&#147;There will be lone parents for whom work is simply not an option and I will ensure that they will be protected&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111245000113"></a>I think that that is still the Government&#146;s policy, but I would prefer it to be said by someone more current than the previous Secretary of State, and I should like it to be said on the record, in the House. That would   


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>give some reassurance to people. If my understanding of this slight shift in policy and development of policy is right, it would be good to know where we were on that question.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000038"></a>I could develop the following point at much greater length, but I shall not. We should start thinking about children in terms of dependency ratios and the demographic change that we face in this country over the next 50 years, not the next two or five years. Children will have to carry a much heavier load. Economists talk about the human capital and developing the human potential. I do not want to suggest for a moment that we should start thinking about children as economic units, particularly, but with the combination of the change in the demographic, with people living longer, and the reductions in fertility rates that we are now experiencing, it is staring us in the face that children will have to carry a much heavier burden of wealth creation in future, if we are to make progress as a nation. We can see that now. The child poverty agenda is so important, but we need more than that agenda. When we talk about active labour markets, we should always be conscious of the fact that this is not just about domestic family income for people in distressed conditions, but about developing the capacity and potential of the children in those households. Generally, the Government&#146;s agenda does not give enough time to that, but maybe, in the short term, they have other problems on their minds, which I understand.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000039"></a>On the philosophy behind this, all my experience suggests to me that lone parents are desperate to work. The survey evidence says that nine out of 10 suggest that if the opportunities were there and they could get the support and if all the other circumstances were to hand, you could not keep them at home. Therefore, we need to be careful about moving in a sanctions direction, as we might be going against the grain because there is a willingness to work that we are not tapping into properly.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000040"></a>I absolutely support some of the new proposals that the Government have put in place. The Explanatory Memorandum refers to that. There is a lot here, but it is all new. There is the in-work credit from April 2008, the in-work credit and retention, the in-work advisory support from Jobcentre Plus advisors and the in-work emergency discretion fund. That is all brand new, and we do not know how effective it is going to be. That is why the SSAC has asked why we cannot just hold our horses before implementing these regulations to see how that works.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000041"></a>I cannot do the figures because I do not have all the data, but the success that the Government have had since 1997, with a 12.5 per cent increase in lone parent participation in labour markets to something like 57.5 per cent, represents a real change. A lot of that is because the economy has been good, because of the tax credit regime and because of the changes that the Government have introduced with the New Deal for Lone Parents. There is a success and a momentum that could be built on. If we could only find a way of retaining the jobs that lone parents win, we would get to the 70 per cent target by 2010 quicker and with the grain of the lone parent client group that we are trying to deal with.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000042"></a>There is a sense that the department thinks that lone parents lead an orderly lifestyle, and it may be that 80 per cent of them do, but 20 per cent lead very difficult, incoherent lifestyles in which they drop in and out of work, benefit and childcare. For all those reasons, they need additional support. If I were the Minister, I would be thinking about looking at that 20 per cent, working with them, trying to sustain them in work, and trying to deploy all the department&#146;s resources in that direction, rather than going down the route of sanctions and the rest of the proposals in the regulations.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000043"></a>I want to move on quickly. I notice from the Explanatory Memorandum that the Government think that these proposals are easily done and that Jobcentre Plus will implement them at a canter. I have to tell them that the department&#146;s annual report for last year revealed that only three out of the six key priorities were achieved. Last year was an easy year. If the Government think that Jobcentre Plus will improve on that record in the next 12 months, they are blind, deaf and dumb. I seriously think that given the job cuts that the department is experiencing and the tight Comprehensive Spending Review targets&#151;I bore on about this, for which I apologise, but it is a very important point&#151;the footfall after Christmas in Jobcentre Plus offices will skyrocket, which will put pressure on all the staff and certainly on the personal advisers. What sort of caseload will they have? Will that interfere with the training which they will need to develop this sensitive advisory service for lone parents who are coming into this regime for the first time? Is there time to train anyone in Jobcentre Plus these days? The realignment payment suggestion of a crisis loan from the social fund is just a joke; the social fund is up to its armpits in backlogs and delays. We know about that because we have debates in this House about it.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000044"></a>The Government suggest, &#147;Oh well, people can apply for a crisis loan&#148;. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was right to mention that, as was the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. The social fund entitlement of the cohort of people that we are talking about in this client group is already exhausted. Special provisions will have to be made if crisis loans are to be made for realignment for that group of people. That is guaranteed to go wrong.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000045"></a>If you bring child tax credit and HMRC into the equation, you will have a really nice mix of things that will all work sweetly, everything will be hunky dory, and by next spring, everything will be fine. I just do not think so, and nothing that I have heard, seen or read in the Explanatory Memorandum or anything else convinces me otherwise. I could talk at great length about that, too, but I shall not.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000046"></a>I shall finish on the need for assurances that have not yet been required because all of us who have contributed so far are on the same page as the Minister as regards policy development. However, there are serious concerns, and I concur with everything that has been said. I shall not repeat the concerns about the childcare wraparound provisions mentioned by both colleagues earlier, but I certainly have concerns about Scotland, because the Government have no idea what is going on there and they have no control of the  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policy delivery of wraparound care in Scotland. It is an entirely different jurisdiction, with a different policy envelope. I need reassurance about that and the rural areas.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000047"></a>In terms of home education, the department is heading straight for a judicial review. Home education used to be a lifestyle choice by people with a kind of hippy way of life. It is not any more. It is worrying that the department does not know how many people this measure will apply to, but I would put money on the fact that the provisions in the regulations will be challenged in the courts by those who home educate. I would support them in doing that because someone needs to test the fairness of the regulations as they currently stand.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000048"></a>I accept that there has been a concession in regard to disabled children, but the provision, which leaves people with children in the lottery of the DLA component, trying to find childcare and to fit into the regulations, is not fair. There was no need to leave lower-care component DLA children in that category. The Government should think again about that. There is nothing like enough consideration of domestic violence and breakdown. It was alluded to earlier and needs to be looked at as well.</p>
<h5><a name="08111245000120"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000049"></a>I understand that lone parents will not continue to go from New Deal for Lone Parents into flexible New Deal after the gateway. Stage 5 of flexible New Deal is workfare. I know that a Bill is coming, and that we will need to think about these matters again, but I have great concern about how lone parents put on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance will come out the other end. We know that Jobcentre Plus will look after them in the first year and that they will go into the private sector for specialist providers in the second. If they are still unemployed, they will go on to workfare.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000050"></a>I am not happy about the lone parent client group that the regulations cover being turfed into workfare at stage 5 of flexible New Deal. If that is where they are heading, the Government should think about it very carefully indeed when the Bill comes before the House. I am in the same place as the two Members of the Committee who have spoken earlier. We need more assurances. The philosophy is entirely defensible, but the operational and administrative constructs that try to support the policy are very shaky and suspect. I hope that the Government will think about it carefully and give us some assurances before we take the plunge with the regulations, which after all start next week. There is not a lot of time to work these things out and make sure that we avoid the pitfalls into which we are concerned we might fall if we are not careful.</p>

<p><a name="08111245000052"></a>I am sorry if the letter did not reach the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, until late today&#151;it certainly was not intended. He raised a range of questions. He asked  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>why now. It is clear that we face challenging times, as I said in my opening remarks, but we have reasons to be confident about the economy&#146;s prospects once we get through this difficult period. However, it is vital that we continue to focus on keeping people in touch with the labour market. I do not want to overstress a perhaps political point, but one of the problems we still face with incapacity benefit is that people were dumped on it in the past without support, and the longer that people are on benefits, the more difficult we know it is for them to engage. That is why we are introducing the measures now.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000053"></a>The noble Lord asked also about training. Jobcentre Plus has comprehensive plans in place to make all staff aware of the changes in income support for lone parents before 24 November. All Jobcentre Plus staff will receive awareness training and process-and-scenario walkthroughs prior to the changes going live on 24 November. Staff training for dealing with the changes to JSA will be phased in line with the profile of lone parents leaving income support each month. Our training delivery started on 13 October. We plan to train sufficient staff ahead of go-live for new and repeat claims on 24 November. I have more detail on that if the noble Lord wishes to follow it up after the debate.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and my noble friend Lady Hollis asked about childcare and affordability. As I said in my opening remarks, we are investing a huge amount of money in childcare provision. The upper limits under the childcare element of tax credits are &#163;175 for families with one child, and &#163;300 for families with two or more children. The childcare element of working tax credit currently benefits around 449,000 lower- and middle-income families. Of those working families, around 287,000 are lone parents and 162,000 are couples.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000055"></a>The noble Lord asked what happens if wraparound childcare is not fully in place. Childcare is available for the large majority of parents who want it. To put this in perspective, in the next two years we expect about 18,000 additional lone parents to move into work as a result of these changes. The <I>Childcare and Early Years Providers</I><I> Survey 2007</I> reported 460,000 vacancies in childcare and early years provision in England alone.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000056"></a>The noble Lord asked what happens if suitable childcare is not available, a point also pressed by my noble friend Lady Hollis. Advisers will be required to take into account both the availability and suitability of childcare when they consider whether a parent&#146;s childcare responsibilities make it unreasonable for him or her to stay in employment, to take up paid employment or to carry out a jobseeker&#146;s direction. Advisers must also consider any necessary childcare expenses where they represent an unreasonable amount of that person&#146;s earnings. A lone parent who is claiming JSA will not be penalised if she or he has just cause for leaving a job or good cause for not taking up a job.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000057"></a>The noble Lord and my noble friend focused on what is suitable childcare and the range of circumstances that lone parents can face. Jobcentre Plus personal advisers will work with parents and the childcare partnership manager to identify and access appropriate childcare provision. They will not dictate to parents the type of childcare or which providers they must

A lone parent who considers that he or she cannot take up a job to which they are referred by a personal adviser because appropriate and affordable childcare is not available will need to demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to secure such care. If they are able to justify that, sanctions would not apply.</p>

<p><a name="08111245000058"></a>The noble Lord asked about childcare places in England and Wales, and in Scotland in particular, for children aged 11 to 14. In England, another concern of the noble Lord, we will ensure that by 2008 a third of all secondary schools will be extended schools; they will be open from 8 am to 6 pm and offer activities for both children in the school and the surrounding area.</p>

<p><a name="08111245000059"></a><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111245000132"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Does that include school holidays? It is important.</p>

It is meant to be year round. By 2010 all secondary schools will open up on weekdays between 8 am and 6 pm all year round, offering a range of activities such as music and sport. Extended schools do not apply in Scotland&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, raised this point&#151;however, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly Government have in place childcare strategies which aim to extend access to high-quality, affordable and flexible childcare. We have been working with them on those issues.</p>

<p><a name="08111245000061"></a><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08111245000134"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I do not know whether my noble friend is staying with the issue of childcare but perhaps I may press him on one point. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is absolutely right to ask about the holidays, but the area I am concerned about is that increasingly the only jobs available to unskilled women who have been out of the labour market for a period of time are unsocial hour jobs&#151;early morning and late night cleaning and catering, weekend retailing and so on&#151;and no formal childcare, whether child minders, wraparound, schools or anything else, can meet their needs. How does my noble friend envisage childcare being available for such women?</p>

<p><a name="08111245000062"></a><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08111245000135"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> There is flexibility in the system, specifically in the agreement which an individual lone parent would have to reach with the jobcentre adviser. That could lead to a requirement to work for only 16 hours a week and would obviously seek to focus on a job that is suitable for that individual. However, if the job that is suitable and available for that individual is not consistent with childcare being available on an affordable basis, then clearly that person could not be subject to sanctions. So it is not only a generic availability; it has to be available in the specific circumstances of the individual involved. I am looking for support from the Box on that and I see a few nodding heads. I hope that helps my noble friend.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about funding. I shall leave aside the tax credit issue at the moment but lone parent transition loans will be paid out under crisis loan legislation. The crisis loan funding comes from the amount allocated annually for budgeting and crisis loans. The lone parent  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transition loans will be funded from that budget and, in 2007-08, &#163;511 million was paid in budgeting loans and &#163;121.2 million in crisis loans.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000064"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis raised a number of challenging points. On the use of the language, I entirely take the point that my noble friend has made. Whatever the conventions, it seems to me that we are dealing with a group of people who are overwhelmingly likely to be women rather than men. It is not beyond the wit of parliamentary draftsmen or draftswomen to get that right.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000065"></a>My noble friend asked about sanctions and how they would apply. In this order we are amending the JSA regulations in connection with good and just cause. The decision-maker must consider whether a parent&#146;s childcare responsibilities make it unreasonable for her to stay in employment, to take up paid employment or to carry out a jobseeker&#146;s direction. We propose that the decision-maker must specifically consider the availability and suitability of childcare. In addition, we propose that decision-makers must consider any necessary childcare expenses where they represent an unreasonable amount of a person&#146;s earnings.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000066"></a>My noble friend again raised issues of flexible working. No decisions have been made on this or on any other forthcoming regulations but it is only right that the Government look afresh at the costs and benefits of new regulations in the light of the global economic downturn. The Government are determined to do all they can to help both employers and employees in tough economic times and flexible working can give both employers and employees mutually beneficial flexibility, helping to keep businesses profitable and to keep people in work. The business benefits of flexible working in tougher economic times are well documented and it can make workplaces more efficient, with improved productivity and reduced absenteeism. That is looking at it from a business point of view but it can also provide a real link for the individual to good-quality employment.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000067"></a>My noble friend asked how lone parents will be treated if their children become ill. As now, Jobcentre Plus advisers will be able to take that into account when deciding whether there should be a sanction. Advisers have to consider whether it would be unreasonable for a person to stay in a job if they have to look after a child who is ill. If it is unreasonable, they will not be penalised. That applies also to attendance at interviews.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000068"></a>My noble friend also asked about travel times, particularly in relation to rural areas. The JSA policy stipulates that travel time of up to an hour each way within the first 13 weeks of a JSA claim and one and a half hours each way thereafter is appropriate. Jobcentre Plus staff would also consider whether travel time to a job is reasonable, taking health or caring responsibilities into account, and would include any reasonable time required to drop off and pick up children from school or childcare.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, raised a number of issues. He stressed the point that in many ways lone parents are in a unique position and that we need to address these issues in a sensitive and balanced way. I entirely agree. I believe these regulations seek to do  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that. He asked me about Peter Hain&#146;s comments and what our position is on that. Peter was reported as saying that work is simply not an option for some people and we agree. Some people will remain on income support and some will go on to the employment and support allowance and may end up in a support group. I think it is already recognised that we are not saying that absolutely everyone must work because we know that is not appropriate for everyone. This is about helping those people who can work to move towards the labour market.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000070"></a>The noble Lord said that lone parents can be quite desperate for work. That is generally right&#151;indeed, it is possibly overwhelmingly right&#151;which is why I believe that we are pushing at an open door with these policies. It does not preclude a regime of sanctions; if used sparingly and in clearly defined circumstances the evidence shows that they can have a beneficial impact.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000071"></a>The noble Lord asked what would happen if a lone parent&#146;s child was disabled. Under the new proposals, any lone parent who receives carers&#146; allowance for disabled children or who is caring for others will be able to continue to claim income support. So they will not be under the JSA regime. The Government considered an exemption for lone parents with a child for whom the lower rate care component of DLA is payable. However, it is our view that such a child, by definition, would not require the amount of care that precluded the parent from paid work, particularly given the flexibilities which we are building in to these arrangements.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000072"></a>The noble Lord asked what evidence we had that sanctions work.</p>

Most JSA sanctions are for young men who do not get out of bed of a morning and do not turn up at interviews and so on and no one would dispute that they need to be brought back into real-life situations. But there are so many concerns here&#151;such as lone parents with disabled children and those who may have to travel an hour and a half as well as dropping their children off with childminders and so one&#151;that we need to know how many sanctions are imposed, to whom and under what circumstances It would help us if my noble friend could tell us that, 12 months on, there will be a letter, if not a formal report&#151;one does not have to be too bureaucratic&#151;making sure that we know how many sanctions have been applied and on what grounds. We could then see whether his assurances, which I am absolutely sure are given in good faith, are being interpreted appropriately in jobcentres.</p>

I am sure that there is some way and I promise to take that back to the department to see how we can do it effectively. Next year&#146;s welfare reform Bill, which will take forward some of these broad concepts, will be another opportunity for detailed scrutiny of that issue.</p>

<p><a name="08111245000075"></a>The noble Lord asked about the evidence on sanctioning lone parents.

<p><a name="08111245000080"></a><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08111245000140"></a>Baroness Thornton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Medical Profession (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000081"></a>The noble Baroness said: This draft order is the third in a series of affirmative resolution orders and is part of the process of implementing the recommendations made in the White Paper, <I>Trust, Assurance and Safety</I>. It makes what are, in effect, three sets of changes to the framework legislation for the regulation of doctors.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000082"></a>The first set of changes relates to medical education. The order will transfer the statutory functions for the oversight of medical education from the Education Committee of the GMC to the council. This will allow the GMC to bring together all four of its interlocking statutory functions under the auspices of the council. In doing so, the GMC will be able to demonstrate that its responsibilities for medical education are central to, and not isolated from, its other regulatory functions. The order will also remove the residual role of the Privy Council in relation to the first year of postgraduate medical education.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000083"></a>The second set of changes relates to the introduction of licences to practise. Amendments were made to the Medical Act in 2002 to create a new system whereby all practising doctors would need not only to be registered with the GMC but also to hold a licence to practise. In due course, doctors will be allowed to keep their licences to practise only if they go through a process known as revalidation, which will be a periodic re-evaluation of a doctor&#146;s fitness to practise. The introduction of licences to practise is therefore an important preparatory step towards revalidation of all doctors.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000084"></a>Plans for the development and introduction of revalidation have been in place for some time now, but none of this has yet been commenced, and thinking  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about how revalidation should take place has now evolved. The order amends some of the provisions already in place to bring them in line with the White Paper.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000085"></a>The White Paper indicated that revalidation is now expected to have two components: relicensing, which will apply to all doctors; and recertification, which will apply to specialist doctors. No provision for recertification was included in the 2002 legislation, and so this order makes the necessary changes that will include it.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000086"></a>Other changes to the licensing system address important issues such as the handling of adverse information about a doctor which is discovered in the course of revalidation and additional powers to ensure that, in all cases where fitness to practise concerns are identified, these can be referred through the GMC&#146;s existing fitness to practise procedures.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000087"></a>The third set of changes relates to specialist registration and will, in due course, have a knock-on effect for recertification. The order enables the GMC to allow senior consultants who did not apply for inclusion in the specialist register between January 1997, when it was established, and September 2005, when the current arrangements for access to the register were introduced, to make a late application for entry. This reinstates the powers that the GMC had prior to September 2005.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000088"></a>The current situation, where some long-standing consultants are not on the specialist register, means that there is the potential for a small number of consultants to avoid recertification. Providing a quick and easy route on to the register is a first step in correcting this anomaly.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000089"></a>These reforms will help to raise standards of medical practice and improve the patient experience. The measures will, in the longer term, help to ensure that doctors meet the very high standards that we and they expect. All the measures are supported by the GMC and I commend them to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000090"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Medical Profession (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2008. <I>2</I><I>8</I><I>th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Baroness Thornton</I>.)</p>

At the moment, as the Minister made clear, the Education Committee of the GMC has the statutory function of overseeing medical education. I accept the arguments that she outlined for transferring those functions to the council of the GMC.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000092"></a>One question that arises from that is whether, in the process of that transfer, anything of value will be lost. I am sure that the Minister will confidently assure me that the answer to that is no, but, to play devil&#146;s advocate for a moment, one advantage of having a separate committee to oversee medical education and nothing but medical education has been its focus. We have had a group of people who have developed experience and specialist expertise in this important area and, although I accept the argument that the council itself should operate in a way that places education at the centre of its deliberations, it could still have done that without the Education Committee  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being done away with. It is arguable that there may be at least a temporary loss of corporate knowledge and expertise by dint of the transfer and possibly a temporary loss of focus and progress. How is that issue to be dealt with?</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000093"></a>As we have heard, the amendments to the 2003 order will allow the GMC to provide a mechanism to enable senior consultants who did apply for inclusion in the specialist register at the time it was established to make a late application to the GMC. This will reinstate the powers that the GMC had prior to September 2005. Again this provision appears sensible. However, I have two queries. As I understand the position, if a consultant is not on the register, he or she is not eligible for recertification and can therefore escape that whole process. Once the order comes into force, I do not understand what is to oblige a consultant who is not registered to apply to have their name entered on the register, beyond simply the terms of the consultant&#146;s contract.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000094"></a>Secondly, perhaps the Minister can assure me that there is no suggestion that the changes proposed in this statutory instrument may have the effect of unintentionally slowing down the recertification procedure for consultants. How many consultants are thought to want to avail themselves of the ability to make a late application? Is the GMC resourced properly to meet the likely demand on top of all its other administrative responsibilities?</p>

I wish to raise only a few questions because I have no great objection to it in principle. First, on the issue of the transfer of statutory oversight of medical education to the GMC, I understand&#151;it has been well debated in the House&#151;that the Government&#146;s intention and that of the GMC is to place medical education at the heart of what the GMC does. However, I echo some of the concerns raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. How will this change be evaluated and by whom? What would happen if the quality of medical education were to decline or deteriorate? What would happen if the oversight of the quality of medical education were to decline? Those are the questions which arise from what is, in essence, a technical change to the way in which the GMC conducts its business.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000096"></a>I make no comment of any substance on the proposals for licences to practise simply because this is not about the details of revalidation, which is the primary concern voiced by noble Lords during the passage of the Bill. There is still as yet no detail and to raise questions at this point would be continuing to grapple with shadows. However, I wish to refer to the issue of senior consultants who did not apply for inclusion on the specialists register and the reinstated provision for them to make a late application. I understand why that should be done&#151;it is desirable that all specialist consultants within the NHS should be on the specialist register; I understand from the Explanatory Memorandum and from the GMC briefing how the situation has arisen in which a small number of people have not been included in the specialist register; and I understand from comments  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made by Mr Ben Bradshaw in another place yesterday that we are talking about 200 people or fewer. But no one has explained why these people have not registered when registration of this kind is an essential requirement for an NHS consultant and has been so for over a decade; it is not new.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000097"></a>I would therefore like to know what has caused this other than, I guess, bloody-mindedness on the part of some people. The figure of James Robertson Justice leaps to mind. It is obvious that this is an integral part of the contract that a specialist must have for an NHS consultant&#146;s post&#151;and such a post is a desirable thing to have. I may be being slightly flippant, but I am just intrigued about why this has happened. If it has happened in a situation which has gone on for over a decade, what assurance will there be that that will change as a result of reinstating this concession?</p>

<p><a name="08111245000098"></a><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0006.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="08111245000143"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I welcome Schedule 2, and thank the noble Baroness. I have to declare an interest: I am one of those doctors. My specialty came into being late and when, having trained in general practice, I contacted the GMC and said, &#147;I&#146;m down on your general practice list. I should be on the consultants&#146; list&#148;, they said, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. It&#146;s fine&#151;you&#146;re on the register&#148;. I wrote to the GMC and was reassured that I did not need to change anything. So when everything changed and I missed the boat, I spent some time waiting for my contract to be terminated. I am delighted, as are others in my specialty, that the small number of us will be able to rectify this situation in retrospect. It was not wilful; it was simply the way the specialties evolved. I hope that that answers the question&#151;and I hope that the GMC will let me register.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000099"></a>I hope that the GMC will now send out a very simple form to consultants&#151;I presume that it needs to go to the trust as well to verify that they are bona fide and practising as consultants&#151;and that everything happens quite quickly. In that way, there will be 100 per cent recording in the appropriate parts of the register. We are all on the register; we are just in the wrong parts.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000100"></a>I also have a concern about orphan specialties. There are a few with very small numbers, such as breast physicians. The specialty will determine the recertification process, so it will be important that there is enough flexibility and the categories are broad enough to ensure that somebody who is practising in a narrow area gets recertified in that area and is not forced to go through a load of hoops that no longer apply to the way they practise medicine.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000101"></a>I have a warning regarding recertification and revalidation. Attitude is the biggest problem, and it is the hardest to assess. Communication skills can be assessed, but that is a bit fuzzy. My department has been doing it for some years and we have developed a toolkit for when people run into problems. Factual knowledge in isolation is the easiest to assess. The trouble is, it is the synthesis of all aspects&#151;skills, competencies, attitudes, communications, scientific knowledge&#151;that makes a good doctor. It seems from the research that one of the most sensitive ways to  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>find out who is a good doctor and who is not is to ask other doctors to rate them and ask whether they would allow themselves or their nearest and dearest to be treated by them. The 360-degree appraisal type of approach is probably the best assessment in the long term, but it has to be meaningful. If it happens too often, it becomes ritualistic and a tick-box exercise. I give that as a slight warning but greatly welcome my personal change in status.</p>

The aim of the reforms is to enhance confidence in the system of professional regulation.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000103"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, both asked whether we need a separate committee for medical education. As I said in my opening remarks, we want this to be core to the GMC&#146;s other statutory functions. Removing the Education Committee as a separate statutory committee does not signal a diminution of the importance of education; instead, it highlights its crucial importance in all the regulatory functions carried out by the GMC.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81112-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000104"></a>The GMC is proposing a three-board model to improve co-ordination of medical education and training&#151;a graduate board, a postgraduate board and a continuing professional education board. While the Education Committee will no longer be a separate statutory committee, the council will have three boards to provide advice on all stages of medical education.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000105"></a>That brings me to the other point that noble Lords raised concerning continuing expertise and the potential loss of expertise. It seems very likely that many of those who have served on, and been involved with, the Education Committee will move on to the new committees and therefore their expertise will not be lost.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000106"></a>I turn to the subject of specialist consultants. Again, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, for informing the Committee and answering questions for me. I am always very grateful for her interventions. The vast majority of the 200 consultants are long-established and, for one reason or another, have not registered. However, we hope that the carrot of free registration will encourage those who have not done so to register. In future, those who do not do so may find recertification difficult if they do not co-operate. We hope that this carrot means that a stick will not have to be used at this point.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000107"></a>Finally, I turn to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in relation to standards and orphan specialties. We intend that standards will be developed for each area of specialist recertification by the appropriate medical royal college or specialist association. We expect the academy and individual colleges to work closely together to develop these standards. Therefore, although there are differences in practice, we have to ensure that there are consistent standards but with the flexibility that the noble Baroness mentioned.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111245000108"></a>If I have missed any points, I shall pick them up and write to noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="08111248000004"></a><a name="81112-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111248000051"></a>Baroness Thornton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Amendment of List of Responders) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000005"></a>The noble Baroness said: This order amends the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 to ensure that NHS trusts that provide ambulance services remain as category 1 responders if they attain NHS foundation trust status.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000006"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the Civil Contingencies Act imposes a series of duties on local bodies, such as the police, fire brigades and local authorities, which are known as category 1 responders. Schedule 1 to the Act classifies NHS trusts as category 1 responders if they provide ambulance services, hospital accommodation and services in relation to accidents and emergencies, or public health services in Wales.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000007"></a>NHS foundation trusts, first established in England in 2004, have a status that is different from that of NHS trusts. Established as independent public benefit corporations, they are free from central government control and accountable to their local population. The Act classifies NHS foundation trusts as category 1 responders only if they provide,</p>
<ul><a name="08111248000047"></a>&#147;hospital accommodation and services in relation to accidents and emergencies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111248000044"></a>It does not take account of the potential for foundation trusts to provide ambulance services.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000008"></a>In June 2007, my predecessor announced that NHS trusts that provide ambulance services would be able to apply for foundation trust status from April 2009. In other words, none is in existence at the moment. Therefore, an amendment to Schedule 1 is required. This order serves to maintain the status quo should an ambulance trust become a foundation trust, ensuring that it will continue to be subject to the duties and responsibilities of category 1 responders.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000009"></a>As I am sure the Committee can appreciate, failing to amend the Act could, in the event of ambulance trusts attaining foundation trust status, result in these trusts no longer being legally responsible for the duties set out in the Civil Contingencies Act, and this, in turn, could have serious implications for patient safety and, indeed, the nation&#146;s ability to respond to a national emergency. As such, I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>

In broad terms, I take no issue with it. However, a few questions arise. Two of the defining features of a foundation trust are the greater degree of autonomy that it enjoys, as compared with a non-foundation trust, and the fact that it is not performance-managed  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by a strategic health authority. Given that these features apply, I am not clear about what drivers will exist to ensure that the care of patients who have been looked after by an ambulance foundation trust and then passed across to the A&amp;E department of an acute NHS trust will be seamless and of a uniformly high standard.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000012"></a>I appreciate that foundation trusts have a duty of co-operation with the wider NHS, but that does not seem to be sufficient to guarantee that the interaction between an ambulance foundation trust and an acute trust will make the quality of the whole patient journey something that the ambulance trust makes one of its specific priorities. What matters to a foundation trust in terms of demonstrating that it has performed well is that it has met certain benchmarks relating to the care that it delivers. Whether or not it has facilitated good care delivered by another provider is not central to its mission.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000013"></a>On the other hand, what matters to a badly injured patient is not just the length of initial response time by the ambulance, or whether he is well looked after en route to A&amp;E, but how long it takes him to access high-dependency care in hospital. Not for a minute do I wish to sound critical of ambulance crews, whose professionalism and dedication are not in question. I am just a little concerned that the systems and structures that we are setting up may not always work to the maximum extent possible in favour of good patient care, and that the greater insularity of an ambulance foundation trust may, in practice, not be wholly conducive to the delivery of optimum patient care along the entire patient pathway.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000014"></a>On a different issue, one of the other distinguishing features of foundation trusts is that they are fully subject to the tariff system. What progress is being made to apply a workable and credible tariff system to ambulance trusts, and how will this operate? Is it anticipated that there will be any change in target response times for ambulances, if and when ambulance trusts are overseen by Monitor? On a factual point, I should be glad to know how many ambulance trusts have indicated a wish to apply for foundation status.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000015"></a>Reverting to the content of the order, what steps are being taken to ensure that disaster preparedness training is being extended to these trusts, so that staff remain fully briefed and prepared for the worst? Will these civil contingencies duties be built into the functions of ambulance foundation trusts?</p>

<p><a name="08111248000016"></a><a name="81112-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08111248000053"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order and I, too, wish to home in on some of the same concerns as those expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I, too, am concerned about the fractured nature of the planning and management of emergency response that might arise from the granting of foundation trust status. For that reason, I want to ask the Minister the following question. It is right and sensible that foundation trusts and ambulance trusts should be an integral part of civil contingencies. Will this function be a factor upon which an application by an ambulance trust to be a foundation trust is assessed? Whether it is or not, will the preparedness and performance of an

We spent a considerable amount of the early part of this year discussing the work of Monitor and the CQC. We commended Monitor for the admirable way in which it goes about its business and the way in which it ensures that foundation trusts carry out the job that they are supposed to do. That is what it and the CQC would do for ambulance foundation trusts. They would be under the same regulatory regime as other foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000018"></a>The noble Earl asked about payment for results. Payment for results in the sector is not a pre-requisite for the introduction of foundation trust status. On civil contingencies, that will be part of their terms and conditions of authorisation. It will be monitored and will be part of the granting of foundation trust status. They all intend to apply.

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000023"></a>The noble Lord said: The order has a simple purpose, which is to amend the service discipline Acts&#151;the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957&#151;to remove the constraint that the prosecuting authority for each service must be an officer of that service. Rather than an officer, the amendment permits a person to be appointed to be the prosecuting authority in the future. This amendment will allow Her Majesty the Queen to appoint Bruce Houlder QC, the current Director of Service Prosecutions, or DSP as he is more usually known, to be the prosecuting authority for each of the three services.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000024"></a>Our intention is that his appointment should take effect from 1 January 2009. I am pleased to say that this date is consistent with the original target we set for the DSP to begin work as the single prosecutor for all three Armed Forces. It is the date that was discussed with Bruce Houlder when he was appointed to be the DSP, and I know that he is keen to take up his duties as a prosecutor on the date that was originally planned.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000025"></a>The reason for the amendment, for which the Government are today seeking approval, is that the legislation under which the post of DSP was created&#151;the Armed Forces Act 2006&#151;is not now going to be implemented in its original timescale. The Act received Royal Assent in November 2006. Since then, work has been underway to implement it. That work has involved developing the detailed policy, drafting the secondary legislation, writing the manuals and preparing the training that will be needed to enable the Armed Forces to move to the new single system of service law.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000026"></a>The target date for implementation had, for some time, been established as 1 January 2009. However, during the summer, it became clear that some changes had taken place which meant the original target date might no longer be achievable. Those changes were connected to the very significant amount of secondary legislation being produced under the Act, not least the transitional provisions which will govern the move from the three current systems of service law to the single system under the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000027"></a>The work on the secondary legislation and the main transitionals order proved to be much more complex and time-consuming than had been anticipated. With regard to the transitionals order, an assessment of quite how complex the work would be could not be made until the extensive policy instructions were finalised and drafting begun. That is not altogether surprising when you consider that we are moving to a single new system from three separate Acts of Parliament, which date back to the 1950s and which have been amended and updated periodically over the intervening decades.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000028"></a>Taken overall, it is vital that we get the transitional regime right. It is central to the interests of our Armed Forces that we ensure the transition to the new system of service law is as smooth as possible. As a result, it was announced by Written Statement on 7 October that implementation of the Armed Forces Act 2006 was to be postponed until October 2009. As the DSP was due to get his statutory powers from the Armed Forces Act 2006, the delay to its implementation means that he will not in fact be able to assume those powers when he had expected.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000029"></a>Fundamentally, that would have prevented him taking full responsibility for service prosecutions until October 2009. Given that he would have been in post for more than 16 months by then, we therefore looked at how we might remedy the situation. We decided that the most suitable course would be to bring before Parliament legislation to amend the service discipline Acts, thus allowing Her Majesty the Queen to appoint Bruce Houlder as the prosecuting authority for each of the services. He will assume full powers as the DSP when the Armed Forces Act 2006 is implemented in October 2009. He has already laid out the plans for a new organisation which will bring together the staff of the current prosecuting authorities from 1 January 2009, and he has put in train what promises to be an extensive training programme for prosecuting officers.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000030"></a>When the legislation was considered in 2006, there was concern in some quarters that the person appointed to be the DSP might not have a service background. Defence Ministers at the time said that the main priority was to appoint the right person for the job. We  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>12 Nov 2008 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believe that Bruce Houlder is that person; he brings impeccable legal credentials, credibility and charisma to the post. We said to Parliament that any person who was appointed to be the DSP and who did not have a service background would undergo a period of induction. The aim of that induction would be to give them a good understanding of how the Armed Forces operate. Speaking at Report on 31 October 2006, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, said that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="08111248000048"></a>&#147;essential that the director has a knowledge of how each of the services operates and of the needs and the working of the service system of justice and discipline&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 31/10/06; col. 240.]</ul>
<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000031"></a>Having started shortly after the DSP took up post in May, I am pleased to report that his induction has gone well and is now drawing to a close. As part of his induction, he has visited all the court martial venues and witnessed several trials in progress. He has also visited the service police and the Military Corrective Training Centre at Colchester. More widely, he has seen the Armed Forces working in command headquarters; he has seen them going about their day-to-day business at bases, units and stations in the UK and Germany; and he has seen them in the most difficult circumstances, on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In sum, he has travelled far and wide to develop a knowledge of the Armed Forces and what they do at home and overseas. This induction has given him a good understanding of the Armed Forces and, in particular, of how the service justice system operates. It will stand him in good stead as he takes on the important role of the first ever Director of Service Prosecutions.</p>

<p><a name="08111248000032"></a>It is regrettable that there has been a delay in implementing the 2006 Act, but I am pleased that we have been able to maintain the momentum towards implementation by keeping to the original timetable for the DSP taking up his prosecuting function. I assure the House that the Government will spare no effort to ensure that the work gets done on time and the 2006 Act is implemented next October. I am very clear that we must be able to move in an orderly fashion to the new single system of service law that the Armed Forces want. I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

Originally, we were told that there would be 65 statutory instruments under the Armed Forces Act 2006, but that has now increased by 15 to 80 during the past 12 months. I would be grateful if the Minister could say why that should be; is there a level of complexity that was not foreseen or is it simply a lack of foresight? We understand that full implementation hinges on a transitional order that will be laid this summer. Why has there been this delay in introducing such a fundamental measure?</p>

However, I was comforted by what the noble Lord said in his opening remarks. Can he provide information about whether he anticipates that the effect of the change to a single system of discipline will result in a more swift delivery of justice? There continues to be a wide disparity in the time that it takes for a case to arrive at court martial. Last year, for example, that took an average of 267 days in the Royal Air Force and 74 days in the Royal Navy. Will the Minister explain how the order will address this?</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000036"></a>Our attitude to the legislation has throughout been constructive but realistic. It still contains wisps of the doctrinaire, as to which we remain unhappy. However, it is evident that the order is a necessary step and we do not oppose it.</p>

<p><a name="08111248000037"></a><a name="81112-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="81112-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08111248000058"></a>Lord Lee of Trafford:</b> We support the order, which provides for the appointment of a qualified officer to be the prosecuting authority for the relevant service, be it Army, Air Force or Navy. We recall the debates on the Armed Forces Bill 2006, now an Act, when my sadly missed noble friend Lord Garden tabled an amendment to ensure that the director of service prosecutions could be appointed only if he had at least two years&#146; regular or four years&#146; reserve military experience in the previous 10 years. Sadly, the Liberal Democrat Front Bench was not successful in getting the amendment into the Bill. Although the order does not address that specific point, the clarification that it makes to the definition of a prosecuting authority goes some way to alleviating our concerns about the relevant provision of the 2006 Act. Thus we are content.</p>

The number of orders has risen, as stated, from 65 to almost 80. That some existing statutory instruments require updating to be brought into line with the terminology of the Armed Forces Act 2006 is the reason for the majority of the extra orders.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked the reason for the delay. I have some personal experience of large projects and they are extraordinarily difficult to estimate. I do not think that we would be served by much more analysis of the delay. Frequently, the complexity comes only when you get into the detail. I am sure that the noble Lord will agree that this is a process that we all saw as having to be thorough. We did not want to go into it with any glitches, and we wanted the Armed Forces to go into it with the right people and the right training. The delay will allow for that. When a project is delayed, one has a choice: &#147;Do I do it slowly and thoroughly, or a bit more quickly to achieve timetable?&#148; This is an area where slowly&#151;or, rather, with all due speed&#151;and thoroughly is right.</p>

<a name="81112-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08111248000040"></a>I was asked whether the order will result in more swift delivery of justice. I do not yet have a note on that, so I shall write to noble Lords.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111248000046"></a>&#147;The induction that I have received over the last 6 months culminating in a visit to Afghanistan and Iraq has been most valuable. In the course of these months, alongside the work I have been doing towards setting up the new overarching prosecuting authority, I have seen just about every aspect of service life that will be relevant to my role, and responsibility towards discipline and prosecutions. ... All three services have offered me the greatest help and support towards gaining an understanding of the clear context in which I will be taking future decisions. These will bear not only on the lives of servicemen and their families, but also of the victims where criminal offences occur. ... I have tried to reassure COs wherever I have gone, that whilst I clearly have my job to do, I am also here to support the operational effectiveness of HM Armed Forces. ... This requires me to understand the context in which actions and decisions are performed and made&#148;.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08111231000009"></a>The death of Baby P in Haringey is a very tragic case that will have shocked and appalled the country. It makes all of us question how someone could do such a terrible thing to a child and set out to deceive the very people trying to help.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08111231000010"></a>Safeguarding children is the Government&#146;s top priority and we expect it to be the top priority for local agencies too. In response to Lord Laming&#146;s report following the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; we introduced fundamental reforms to help keep children safe. Local areas are also now required to review every case where a child is harmed or killed, and neglect or abuse is suspected. We will be considering carefully the serious case review in this case and whether there needs to be a further investigation of child protection procedures and practices among local agencies in Haringey.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08111231000011"></a>The reforms put in place by the Government in response to Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations set a very clear direction and have significantly strengthened the framework for safeguarding children. In order to ensure that these reforms are being implemented systematically, I have asked Lord Laming to prepare an independent report of progress being made, identifying any barriers to effective, consistent implementation, and recommending whether additional action is needed to overcome them. Lord Laming expects to submit his findings early next year.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08111231000012"></a>Safeguarding children is the responsibility of us all. It is vital that we strive for the best possible practice so that vulnerable children receive the protection they need. The Government are determined to strengthen the system for safeguarding and we look forward to Lord Laming&#146;s report and his recommendations.</p>

Ministers worked towards agreement of a common platform for member states when engaging with the US, based on a French presidency paper that could be shared with the incoming US Administration.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08111231000045"></a>Last autumn the Government announced details of the biggest sustained programme of capital investment in schools for over 50 years. Annual capital investment in schools was just under &#163;700 million in 1996-97. By 2011 it is set to rise to &#163;8.2 billion, representing a sevenfold real-terms increase. This unprecedented investment has helped address a significant backlog of work going back over many decades as well as supporting hundreds of new-build schools, including 740 primary schools.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08111231000046"></a>In recent years the emphasis has shifted towards a strategic approach which requires local authorities to consider their whole schools estate and take a long-term view about how capital investment can support wider transformation of teaching and learning, starting with those most in need. Building Schools for the Future was launched in 2004 with the long-term aim of rebuilding or refurbishing all secondary schools. The first completed new-built schools came on stream in 2007-08.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08111231000047"></a>Plans for an equally transformational approach to capital investment in primary schools were first announced in 2005. Following an overwhelmingly positive response to consultation in March 2006, the programme got under way with 23 pathfinder authorities in 2007. It will be rolled out nationally to all local authorities from 1 April 2009.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08111231000048"></a>The primary capital programme challenges local authorities to think long-term and strategically about teaching and learning in primary schools in the 21st century and how capital investment can support wider transformation. It commits to renewing at least half of all primary school buildings by 2022-23, creating primary schools that are equipped for 21st-century learning, at the heart of their communities, with children&#146;s services in reach of every family.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08111231000049"></a>This marks the start of a &#163;7 billion programme of investment in primary schools. It will be kick-started by &#163;1.75 billion of new capital investment from April 2009. This represents a major injection of new capital investment that will not only benefit children and families but will also provide a welcome boost for the construction industry and local businesses, which will be crucial to delivering the new and refurbished primary schools.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08111231000050"></a>Local authorities were advised by the department last autumn of their indicative share of this funding. To access funding, they were required to prepare and agree with the department a primary strategy for change. The department issued comprehensive guidance on the content of these strategic plans in December 2007.</p>

<a name="81112-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08111231000051"></a>All strategies have now been rigorously assessed against the detailed requirements set out in the guidance. The overall picture is encouragingly positive, giving confidence that the transformational objectives of the programme will be delivered. Collectively, local authorities are planning to start projects at more than 1,500 schools over the next three years. Following assessment, local authorities were placed in one of three categories:</p>

To release future upkeep plans could enable deductions to be made that could be prejudicial to the capability, effectiveness and security of the Royal Navy. The time each Type 22 or Type 23 frigate and Type 42 destroyer spends in refit depends on a number of factors, including the material state and operational deployment of the vessel, but is generally in excess of one year. The time between refits is generally in excess of four years. The first of the Type 45 destroyers is due to enter service in 2010.</p>

The Government believe that no significant benefit would be gained by duplicating the existing requirement introduced in 2004 and on which the Health and Safety Executive has issued guidance.</p>

Costs for which the grant can be used to fund include:</p>
those required for the direct delivery of diplomas including additional costs of teaching and materials incurred by institutions in planning and delivering the curriculum; andadditional costs associated with the provision of diplomas for pupils in sparsely populated areas including transport between providers within a diploma consortium.

Introduced in 2002, it is the Government's main mechanism for encouraging renewable electricity generation. It is not a direct subsidy but an obligation placed on electricity suppliers to source a specific and annually increasing percentage of the electricity sales from renewable sources. Generators are issued with 1 ROC for each MWh of generation which they can then sell to suppliers. Suppliers used the ROCs to demonstrate compliance with the obligation or pay a buyout price into a fund. Money from the buyout fund is recycled to suppliers who met their obligation from ROCs on a pro rata basis. The ROC price is therefore set by the market but a nominal value of the ROC to the supplier can be calculated by adding the buyout price to the recycled buyout fund attributable to each ROC. On this basis the level of support through the RO in the UK between 2002 and 2007 is set out below:</p>

This is valued at &#163;300.4 million out of a total budget of &#163;1,691.6 million weighted to 2008 economic conditions. The deployment and operational phase which follows will see the Galileo programme achieve full operational capability (FOC) and is now being procured by ESA on behalf of the European Commission through an open tender competition in six work packages. A number of UK companies have been down-selected to compete in all but the launch provider work package of this tender competition. This process is on-going and it is too early to say which work packages could be won by UK companies.</p>

Total cumulative benefits from 2013, when Galileo is expected to be in service, to 2025 are estimated to be &#163;14.2 billion.</p>

This amounts to a total UK investment of &#163;168.05 million. The next phase of the Galileo programme&#151;the deployment and operation of the system (2010-13)&#151;and all future funding for Galileo will be paid for wholly from the EU budget.

The European Commission estimates a further &#163;6 billion will be needed for operation and maintenance costs from 2013-30. In terms of the EU contribution, the position is that EU member states contribute to the Community budget as a whole and not to individual programmes within it. The UK contributes around 17 per cent of the Community budget or 12.6 per cent after abatement. There is therefore no specific United Kingdom contribution to this phase of Galileo.</p>
