<A NAME = "70213-01_head0"></A><H3><center>EU: Visits by Foreign Secretary</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Hooson </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the recently announced intention of the Foreign Secretary to make a series of speeches in countries of the European Union to explain directly to the electorate of those countries the Government's policy on the further development of the EU and the reasons therefore is to be reciprocated by an invitation by Her Majesty's Government to the Foreign Secretaries of other EU governments to explain directly to the United Kingdom electorate their governments' policies on the development of the EU.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, representatives of other European Union governments are welcome to speak in the United Kingdom about their governments' policies on the development of the European Union.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Foreign Secretary's statement that he intended to appeal to the electorate of Europe over the heads of governments is a departure from the convention, often repeated by the Government, of the sovereignty of the other nation states as represented by their democratically elected governments? I believe that it is a welcome departure; but does the Minister agree that invitations should be extended to the foreign ministers of other countries to come here and give to our electorate the benefit of their views as the Foreign Secretary considers that their electorate would benefit from his views?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, there is no question of the Foreign Secretary going over the heads of governments. Each of his visits includes meetings with political counterparts, as well as discussions with students, young people and groups of ordinary voters. Of course, during the past two years we have had the opportunity to listen to Klaus Kinkel, Werner Hoyer, Wim Kok and to Jacques Chirac, who spoke to both Houses of Parliament. It is a two way process. We believe in free speech; we should be able to speak there and they here.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, when the Foreign Secretary meets other foreign secretaries, will he take advantage of the opportunity to point out to them that the obligation under the Rome Treaty to harmonise all the laws of 15 nations with 11 different languages and several types of legal systems has become a chaotic task <P>


<a name="column_322"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which can scarcely be properly fulfilled and that that therefore the Rome Treaty should be revised accordingly?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend knows, I have much sympathy with him in the complexity of 15 nations looking at their own systems in parallel. That has been one of the reasons why we have firmly supported flexibility. We wish to avoid the imposition of burdensome obligations which build up resentment on any particular country. Flexibility will allow the European Union to harness the wide range of diversity that it embraces and that will help us to avoid the issues which are not in the best interests of the British people.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I would very much agree with government policy--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew5"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I would if I knew what it was! I assume that it is the policy which the Foreign Secretary is espousing around Europe; that the Government are in favour of keeping open the option on the single currency and not in favour of pulling out of a European Union. However, will the Minister confirm reports that a fellow Cabinet Minister--namely, the Chairman of the Conservative Party--has sent letters to parliamentary candidates telling them how they can best say how they disagree with the Government in that they would never, in any circumstances, support a single currency?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord summed up the policy precisely. That is exactly what the Foreign Secretary has said. We shall see what is in the best interest of Britain, and I am delighted that the noble Lord agrees with that. As regards the Chairman of the Conservative Party, I believe that no such letters have gone out. However, the noble Lord knows only too well from his time at the Treasury that rumours are halfway round the world before the truth has a chance of coming out.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may take my noble friend closer to the Question on the Order Paper. Is she aware that last year, as is my custom these days, I attended the Labour Party conference and I observed large video screens upon which appeared a number of continental politicians imploring us all to vote Labour? Is not that a rather sharper interference in our affairs than a discussion about European policy in the capitals of Europe?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, what the Labour Party gets up to at its conferences is always an eye opener to us all, but I am grateful to my noble friend. The important point about the Question and my noble friend's supplementary question is that they illustrate the difference in attitude. We are prepared to have free speech and to go through each and every aspect of the European Community to see what is and <P>


<a name="column_323"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what is not in our interests. It is clear from our discussions and from the report of the Irish presidency that there is a great deal of support for UK ideas in important areas. When we started to talk about those issues, we were told that we should be quiet because no one would support us. Many are now supporting us on the importance of national parliaments and in reviewing European legislation; and many others are working with us in opposing some of the suggested changes which have taken the headlines in recent months.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, apparently Mr. Rifkind is embarking on the 20th century equivalent of the Grand Tour. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House whether Mr. Rifkind's views on Europe are the same as Mr. Portillo's; whether those of Mr. Portillo are the same as Mr. Clarke; and whether those of Mr. Clarke are the same as those of Mr. Howard. Following what my noble friend said, perhaps the Minister will tell the House what the Foreign Secretary is telling the electorates of Europe about the fact that apparently some 150 Conservatives have said that they will put in their election address a pledge that they are totally against a single currency, in spite of the fact that the Leader of the Conservative Party, the Prime Minister, is in favour of a wait-and-see policy on monetary union.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I assure the noble Baroness that all Members of the Cabinet are in favour of waiting to see exactly what is the situation on a single currency before any decision is taken. If that is then recommended and the Houses of Parliament accept it, there will be a referendum for the people.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-01_para0"></a>To turn to the Foreign Secretary's visit to a number of capital cities, his aim is to spell out our policy of the modern vision of the European Union as a partnership of nations for the very reasons that my noble friend Lord Renton mentioned. The European Union must be more than a free trade area but co-operation must be in a form with which people are comfortable. We must balance supranational action where that is needed with intergovernmental action in more sensitive areas. The day that one hears that the Labour Party might even consider that is perhaps the day it will have more credibility regarding a policy on Europe.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, are Her Majesty's Government aware that the visits by the counterparts of our own Foreign Secretary in the member states are very welcome indeed? Surely the Government will agree that the more exposed those statesmen are to the predominant views in Britain on this matter, the better it will be. But will the Minister bear in mind also that the British public do not like periodic political interventions by members of the European Commission?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the way in which Europe works needs very careful examination. The Foreign Secretary and his colleagues are doing that. If Foreign Ministers of other countries visit this country, it is important that they should explain their integrationist vision, which they hold very sincerely but which we do <P>


<a name="column_324"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not believe to be in the interests of a partnership of nations. Those advocates of integration must explain its limits. They must explain the difference between their vision of a common currency, common defence, employment, immigration, social policy and majority voting, because people are genuinely anxious about the constant process of change. That is why the Foreign Secretary has spelt out so clearly and with great acceptance exactly what we mean by a partnership of nations, and exactly how we can overcome the complexities of being currently a 15-nation European Union, but also possibly a larger one in a few years' time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that her original Answer to my noble friend's original Question was a little disingenuous since the Foreign Secretary made it clear that he was seeking to appeal to public opinion in countries on the mainland of Europe over the heads of governments? Is not the Government's real purpose to swing the opinion of voters in Europe or voters in this country by the back door?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970213/text/70213-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the Foreign Secretary's purpose is to achieve a sensible outcome of the IGC in June, and to make sure that Europe continues on a sound path for the benefit of all the peoples of Europe.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why they are opposed to setting up a parliamentary Select Committee to scrutinise treaty-making on behalf of the United Kingdom.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, it is for both Houses to consider whether to set up a parliamentary Select Committee. However, we do not consider that it is necessary to introduce additional measures to scrutinise treaty-making.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that Answer. Is she aware that there is widespread welcome of the fact that the Government have recently changed their practice to provide more information to both Houses before they ratify international treaties? Is she aware also that that pleasure is marred by disappointment that the Government are unwilling to set up specialised scrutiny machinery of the kind established so successfully in, for example, Australia through a joint parliamentary committee and of the kind which exists so successfully in this House to scrutinise European legislation and treaty-making under the third pillar? Is the Government's position obdurate or will they remain open-minded on the subject to improve parliamentary accountability?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the Government are in no way obdurate on this matter. <P>


<a name="column_325"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 325</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As the noble Lord knows, we have opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny. The noble Lord brought forward a Bill which we debated. It was eventually withdrawn because we decided on a policy of bringing forward explanatory memoranda about treaties before those treaties came into effect. The noble Lord will know that in the House of Lords, it is for the Procedure Committee to decide whether additional scrutiny mechanisms are appropriate. I refer the noble Lord to the House of Lords Select Committee report on the committee work of the House of February 1992 which, at paragraph 123.1 decided, on balance, at the time, not to recommend the appointment of a committee which could have done that sort of work although the steering committee might review the proposal from time to time. We do not believe that it is necessary to move in the way that Australia has; indeed, our own procedures are closely mirrored by the Australian reforms introduced last year. I believe that we have a good system which is now coming into effect. The first of the explanatory memoranda under the system is due in a few weeks' time. Let us at least see how that innovation works before suggesting that we move to the next change.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   My Lords, is not the noble Lord, Lord Lester, right to suggest that we need a more methodical way of examining foreign treaties which the Government submit to the House for approval? While the new method which the noble Baroness has introduced with the explanatory memoranda is extremely welcome, will she recognise, on reflection, that our present method of examining such documents is really rather perfunctory in that they appear listed in the daily Minutes of Proceedings of the House but are not subjected to any form of corrective examination? Will the Minister be so kind as to reconsider the matter with a view to discussions taking place in the Procedure Liaison Committee in due course? I should make it clear that I am not suggesting that we need a full-blown Select Committee on foreign relations. I concur entirely with the recent judgment of the Select Committee on the matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I know of the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, in the matter. Of course the whole question was examined during the procedures of the Committee on the Bill which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, proposed. I believe that it would be sensible to see how the new explanatory memoranda system works. It is a supplement to the Ponsonby Rule; it came into operation only on 1st January this year. It will provide an efficient and a workable method of bringing to the attention of Parliament the main features of treaties without the need for additional machinery.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-02_para0"></a>However, if the Procedure Committee in this or another place decides that there should be greater scrutiny, that can be done. It is a matter for both Houses to decide. At present we are just embarking on a new process. Let us at least see first whether that works before moving on to <P>


<a name="column_326"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>some other procedure which may not be necessary and which may waste the valuable time of your Lordships and Members of another place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, in view of the extremely vigorous defence of our belief in free speech and in parliamentary accountability given by the Minister in answer to the previous Question today, perhaps I may add my voice to the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. As the Minister will be aware, the Government's own position in either welcoming or discouraging such a move is very important as regards the proceedings of the Procedure Committee and possibly the Liaison Committee. Given the fact that several European parliaments have the right to discuss treaties on the basis of committee findings, and in view of the fact that the European Parliament itself has such a right, can the Minister say, on reflection, whether she will consider that this ancient House of Parliament should at least have the same right as other parliaments in the European Union?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, each parliament has to do what is right for that parliament. The explanatory memoranda system is in line with openness. That is one thing I believe we should try. However, as the noble Baroness will undoubtedly know, parliamentary legislative action may be required before a treaty is ratified for certain specific classes of treaty--for example, those which require modification of existing law or taxation; those that require new and additional powers for the Crown; and those that increase the powers of the European Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-02_para1"></a>Let us live with what we have at present. If that does not work satisfactorily, I am quite certain that the Procedure Committees of both Houses will be willing to re-examine the matter. We are taking one step forward. Let us at least give it a try and not dismiss it as unworkable before we have even started.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, as I believe the Minister is aware, we on this side of the House welcome the Government's response to the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Lester. I confirm that we accept that there is a case for trying out the new system. The noble Baroness is absolutely right to say that it is a matter for both Houses of Parliament as to whether or not we set up a Select Committee. However, does she not agree that if we want to see greater transparency and accountability, there is a case for coming back and considering whether we need a Select Committee once the new system has been tried?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her acceptance of my response. I simply say, yes; I agree with her. Let us see how it works. The Procedure Committees in both Houses can return to the matter if it is not seen to be working in the way in which I certainly intend it to work; namely, with a policy of openness, assisted by the explanatory memoranda, on all treaties before they are ratified.

<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they expect remand or convicted prisoners to be placed in police cells because of overcrowding in the prison system.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, government policy is that police cells should not be used to relieve overcrowding except as a last resort. The Prison Service will continue to make every effort to accommodate the prison population without the use of police cells.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister's assurance. However, did the noble Baroness hear the speech of the Director General of the Prison Service in Manchester earlier this week in which he estimated that the 135 prison establishments would be full by mid-March and that, thereafter, police cells would have to be used at a cost of &#163;300 per night? He also said that that would mean the removal of police officers from their proper duties and would thereby turn them into gaolers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-02_para2"></a>Can the Minister confirm, on present policies, what the director general also said; namely, that 6,000 extra prisoners would need to be housed by the year 2000 and that, if the provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Bill were to go forward (as suggested in the Explanatory Memorandum), there would be a need for a further 12,000 places over a period of 12 years? Can the Minister say where those prisons will come from and how much they will cost? If they retained power, would this Government ever implement the provisions of that Bill or are we wasting the rest of the day on an election gimmick?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, we will not be wasting the rest of the day on an election gimmick; indeed, we shall spend most of today defending the right of the victim to be properly protected against criminals who commit burglary, who commit violent offences and who deal in Class A drugs. However, to answer the noble Lord's question specifically, I should tell him that I am aware of the speech made by the Director General of the Prison Service. I can also tell him that by March 1997--that is, this year--there will be 720 places in open and low-security prisons. By March 1998 there will be 1,900 places in three new prisons and by September 1998 there will be 3,200 new house-block places, plus 350 reclaimed places at existing prisons. Moreover, by March 2000 there will be three more new prisons which will provide 2,400 places. In addition, we have a robust refurbishment programme. I should like to pose a question to the noble Lord and anyone who wishes to support him: who would the noble Lord not put into prison if he believes that some of these people should not receive custodial sentences?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Minister only answered one half of the question; <P>


<a name="column_328"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indeed, she only gave one half of the equation in answer. She told us how many additional prison places will be available, but she did not comment upon or give any proper governmental response to the considered judgment of the Director General of the Prison Service who said that despite the number of extra places we would still run out of accommodation. If, as the director general said, we are to have prisoners housed in police cells from March 1997, can the Minister say, on present trends, how long it will be before the current availability of prison cells runs out and what will happen then?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is the convention of the House that the Minister replies to two questions. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked at least five of which I was conscious--possibly even more. I answered him very specifically as regards the number of planned places that will be in place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-03_para0"></a>However, in defence of the director general, I have to say that he is right to refer to the tensions in the system. It is true that the courts are dispensing more custodial sentences and it is true to say that accommodation must be provided. I have said that police cells will be used as a positive last resort. I have given all the details of places that are coming on stream.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-03_para1"></a>One of the questions asked by the noble Lord I did not answer, but I am happy to do so now. For 1996-97 &#163;120 million has been provided, &#163;86 million of which will be used to finance an increased prison population; &#163;34 million will be used to improve security. There are plans for a further &#163;692 million over the next three years. We are committed to building six new prisons under the private finance initiative which must, of course, be subject to planning considerations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, is the Director General of the Prison Service right or wrong?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Director General of the Prison Service was right to point to the tension. The Director General of the Prison Service does not know that police cells will be needed. What he is saying is that if these places do not come on stream--they are planned to come on stream--there could be a danger that police cells may be needed. That is what he addressed at the conference.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right to draw attention to the conventions of the House, one of which is that members of the Government do not ask questions of members of the Opposition. Is she aware that the director general, the chief official responsible for people in Her Majesty's prisons, has indicated quite clearly that by next month there will be prisoners in police cells? The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has asked: is he right or is he wrong? That has nothing to do with tensions in the prison system, although, heaven knows, we are all well aware of that. We are asking the simple question: do the <P>


<a name="column_329"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government accept the judgment of their director general that by next month we shall have prisoners in police cells, thus taking police officers off the streets?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I shall answer the noble Lord's question if he will give me a verbatim account of what the director general said in his speech. He rightly referred to the tensions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew6"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I have read the speech. I have seen the verbatim account.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew8"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Is it in the brief?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   No, my Lords, I do not have it in my brief. However, I have read the speech and I know what he said. He is absolutely right to refer to the tension and to the possibility that if the timing slips in any way there is a possibility that police cells will be used. I have made it quite clear it is our policy that should be done as a positive last resort and in an emergency only. As for posing questions to the Opposition, I posed a rhetorical question for the following reason. Noble Lords on the opposite side of this House have consistently brought me to the Dispatch Box to comment on there being too many people in prisons and the fact that more prisoners who have received custodial sentences should be free in the community. I ask a rhetorical question of those people who make that point. They should be telling the country, not me the Minister, which prisoners convicted of crimes they would have walking free in the streets who should be serving custodial sentences.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, if the figures of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, are correct, is the Minister aware that the numbers and the timescale involved indicate a building programme of 12 prisons with at least the holding capacity of the Strangeways gaol in Manchester? If the Government by any chance win the next election are they committed to a building programme on that scale?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, we are certainly committed to making sure that the public are protected and that we have the prison cells available to house those who commit crimes in the community. The noble Lord was not correct. We shall have 8,600 new places by the turn of the century. We are expecting a rise of about 6,000 or 7,000 in the system at this moment. In addition, about 10,800 places will be needed to accommodate the provisions of the crime Bill which is before the House. The financial memorandum makes it clear that the Government will supply those places. There is a robust building programme, much of which I have referred to in the detail of this Question.

<FONT SIZE=3>Probation Service. Is the Minister aware that there is a class of prisoner whom many people think should not be in prison; namely, fine defaulters?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to respond to the question of the noble Baroness. I have specific responsibility for the Probation Service. It is interesting to note that in the course of a year more people are put in the charge of the Probation Service than serve custodial sentences. Our record on bringing fine defaulters out of prison is quite a remarkable one. In 1995 there were 20,100 fine defaulters in prison; today the figure is below 8,000.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, the question that could rightly be put to this Government is: how has this problem arisen? Is this one of those circumstances where the Government will seek to blame the Opposition? How have the Government allowed a situation to arise where police cells may be filled with prisoners next month? Is the Minister aware that often police cells are already filled by people whom, for their own safety, the police keep in custody overnight and who ought to be in psychiatric establishments, which the Government have closed down?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I simply do not accept that point. I have not conceded that police cells will be used in anything other than an emergency or as a last resort. We have not used police cells as prison cells since 1995. As regards the other point the noble Baroness made, it is, of course, the case that police cells are used to house people overnight where the police make arrests, where drunken people are admitted, for example drink drivers and people who are incapable of finding their way home. All sorts of people are taken into custody as a result of the police doing their job and addressing crime in the community. If the noble Baroness is present later today, as I suspect she will be as she is an assiduous attender of this House, she will hear that we are making the courts more responsive to those mentally disordered people who commit crimes in the community and who will be better provided for under the provisions of the crime Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for the answers that she has given. Does she not agree that the cost of the prisons that have to be built--that will be about &#163;1 billion--might be better spent on the Probation Service, on rehabilitation and on the prevention of crime? I apologise for asking so many questions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to respond to the single question that the noble Lord has asked. As I have already said, it is important to remember that more people who commit crimes are put in the charge of the Probation Service than serve custodial sentences. There is a lower reconviction rate among people who serve custodial sentences--it is only a marginal figure--than among those who do not. The noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, shakes his head. He ought to look at the facts. About 50 per cent. of those people who <P>


<a name="column_331"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commit crimes and who serve custodial sentences commit further crime within two years of their release. The figure for those who serve community sentences is about 52 or 53 per cent. As I have said, the difference is marginal. What is important is that those people who serve custodial sentences are given the facilities to address their offending behaviour. We are continuing to strengthen the effectiveness of community sentences to make them as effective as possible.

(a) relate to any of the offences or to the offender; and

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 1 I speak also to the consequential amendments, Amendments Nos. 4, 18, 20, 26 and 28. As usual, I take the first few moments to allow noble Lords to leave the Chamber in an orderly but not too slow manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para9"></a>As I said in the debate at Second Reading, mandatory determinate sentences are at the heart of the Bill. It is therefore essential that Members of the Committees should get this matter right as we embark on the Committee proceedings. The starting point for our consideration of the amendments must be the statement of the Home Secretary at the Conservative Party Conference in 1995. It has been referred to on a number of occasions. When announcing the plan for mandatory minimum sentences, the Home Secretary made no exceptions whatsoever. That was the pledge he gave to his party: that there would be mandatory minimum <P>


<a name="column_333"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sentences; and that people would be locked up on a basis to be determined by Parliament rather than by the judges without any provision for discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para10"></a>Last year he produced a White Paper. That White Paper contained for the first time an exception. It said that there could be judicial discretion under genuinely exceptional circumstances. In November last, the Bill was produced . The Bill no longer refers to "genuinely exceptional circumstances", if indeed that phrase ever meant anything. It now refers to "exceptional circumstances". If anyone talks about U-turns, let us be clear that the U-turn was that committed by the Home Secretary in resiling from his pledge to the Conservative Party Conference and introducing a Bill which provided for the first time for judicial discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para11"></a>When the Bill was before another place, my colleagues in the Commons, and other Members from all parts of the House, spent a great deal of time seeking to discover what "exceptional" meant. We failed even to gain examples, let alone a definition, of what it meant. The only example that I can find was given by the Home Secretary at Second Reading. He seemed to think that a police informer might be an exceptional circumstance which would deserve other than the minimum sentence. I find that curious because other suggestions have been that "exceptional" would be unforeseen circumstances; and the fact that a defendant is a police informer is not unforeseen. The Conservative chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee in the Commons thought that this was bad law because it was unclear. It is still unclear; and it is still bad law.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para12"></a>The amendments which we have set down today follow our probing in the Commons and represent our determination to provide a workable definition of judicial discretion. Mr. Douglas Hurd in his speech, to which I have already referred at Second Reading, said that it was important to get the phrasing right. Indeed it is. It is important that we should try our very best to do that today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para13"></a>The independent legal watchdog Justice--I am sorry not to see the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, in his place today--described the effect of our amendments as being,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to ensure that judicial discretion is preserved while retaining a presumption in favour of mandatory sentences". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para14"></a>I accept that definition. Under that definition it cannot be said that these are wrecking amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para15"></a>Why is it essential to clarify the Bill at this stage and in this way? It is essential because if judges cannot make the Bill work there are no answers to the serious questions which I and other noble Lords raised at Second Reading. If there is inadequate discretion, and if the Bill is bad because it is unclear, how can we be sure that in the appropriate circumstances the Crown Prosecution Service will prosecute? How can we be sure that juries will convict? How can we be sure that witnesses, in particular family witnesses, will give evidence? How can we be sure that there will not be an increase in not guilty cases of people who feel that they have nothing to lose by pleading not guilty because if they plead guilty there is a mandatory minimum sentence which cannot be varied in any way. There has <P>


<a name="column_334"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been reference in particular to the danger of not guilty pleas in rape cases where cross-examination of the victim can be such a painful process. How can we be sure that there will not be effects on the prison population--we have already referred to that issue at Question Time--and on prison conditions, rehabilitation, education and training? We have to be clear: the Bill has to be clear: and these amendments seek to make it clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para16"></a>The other amendments in the group are strictly consequential on the statement of principle in Amendment No. 1. Amendments to Clauses 1 to 3 allow judges to have regard to either or any of the offences and to the offender. The issue was discussed at Second Reading and it was made clear that it was necessary to have that provision to allow judges to be secure of their discretion. I believe that the phrase "acceptable" in Clause 1 is acceptable. As I said at Second Reading, in that case the judge sets the tariff and the Parole Board sets the release date. However, for those Members of the Committee who disagree with that judgment, there will be an opportunity in debate on Amendment No. 3 to discuss an alternative point of view.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para17"></a>In Clauses 2 and 3, where "exceptional" is particularly obscure, the word is removed and replaced by the words that the court shall have regard to the specific circumstances which,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) relate to any of the offences or to the offender; and </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<BR>

<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para18"></a>In a letter to my honourable friend Jack Straw, the Home Secretary said only yesterday,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"tough and effective action to deal with serious criminals like professional burglars and drug dealers", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para19"></a>is necessary. We agree entirely. Judges will award much tougher sentences to professionals. For example, sentences of 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for professional Class A drug dealers are quite common now even on the first offence. But we have to accept that the kind of offences that come under the categories of burglary and Class A drug dealing are very varied. Many burglars are pathetic losers; many small drug dealers are themselves addicts who need treatment rather than lengthy prison sentences. The effect of the "three strikes and you're out" policy in California as first applied--I do not claim that that is what is provided in the Bill--is very well known. In the past month, a man convicted under that policy, given 25 years to life for stealing a slice of pizza, had his sentence reduced to two years on appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para20"></a>In case there is any doubt that judges would operate these clauses fairly but firmly, which may be an argument that the Government will use, my Amendments Nos. 8, 21, 29 and 32 clarify and secure the power of the Attorney-General to appeal against leniency for any of the offences in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-04_para21"></a>This morning on the "Today" programme the Home Secretary said three or four times that these amendments would drive a coach and horses through the Bill. At the same time he refused to hold the kind of constructive talks requested by Jack Straw which took place to such good effect on the Police Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="70213-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I rise to support these amendments to which I have put my name, and I know where the Committee resiles from my still confirmed view that I am against mandatory sentences as such. I am against them for the very good reason that I believe that the role of the legislature, the role of Parliament, is to provide the sentencing framework within which judges should pass sentence. I believe that judges should always be free to fit a particular punishment to a particular crime. May I dare to say to the Minister that I share the view of the Government expressed as recently as February 1990 that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Courts will properly continue to have the wide discretion they need if they are to deal justly with the great variety of crimes which come before them. The Government rejects a rigid statutory framework on the lines of those introduced in the United States or a system of minimum or mandatory sentences for certain offences". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para0"></a>That was the view of the Government as recently as 1990. I still share that view. I have heard nothing during the course of debates in this Chamber to persuade me to understand why the Government have apparently changed in the way that they have.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para1"></a>If we are, nevertheless, to go down the road of mandatory sentences, as appears the case, and if at the same time we are to avoid injustice in individual cases, it is essential that we have a discretion that will allow the courts to sentence other than by means of mandatory sentences when they believe, given all the circumstances of a case, that it is unjust to impose such a sentence. I cannot see how we advance the cause of justice, or confidence in justice, by requiring judges to impose sentences that they believe to be unjust. I cannot see how we advance the cause of justice by sentences that clearly are unjust, as will happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para2"></a>I agree with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in moving the amendment. I am not in any way against severe sentences. It is not a matter of being tough or not being tough on crime. It is a matter of providing sufficient discretion to allow justice to take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para3"></a>There is enormous variety in the cases that appear before the courts. I turn immediately to the provision in Clause 3 of the Bill relating to burglary. Burglars divide between, on the one hand, the professional, who perhaps breaks into a house at night and strips it of valuable property, and on whom I am sure the whole Committee would wish to see a serious penalty imposed, to, more commonly, the young, often opportunist burglar acting on impulse, often entering a house that is unoccupied. Those two ends of the spectrum cannot be dealt with by one simple system of mandatory sentencing.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para4"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said, the Bill provides that there shall be an exception; namely, if there are "exceptional circumstances". With the greatest <P>


<a name="column_336"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 336</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>respect, I believe that provision to be totally inadequate. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice has pointed out in this House and other places, the term "exceptional circumstances" has always been construed by the courts extremely narrowly. I wish to make it clear that, not only has it been construed extremely narrowly; it is clearly the intention of the Government that it shall continue to be construed extremely narrowly. In another place on 15th January Mr David Maclean, the Minister of State, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is the Lord Chief Justice's view, which I believe to be correct, that the term 'exceptional circumstances' will be construed very narrowly. I believe and hope that that is the correct interpretation".--[Official Report, Commons, 15/1/97; col. 395.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para5"></a>Later he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is the Government's intention that the courts should interpret 'exceptional circumstances' in exactly the same way as they have been in other legislation over the past five years".--[col. 396.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para6"></a>What does that mean? It means that it is accepted by the Government that the exclusion that they are attempting to put into the Bill is to be construed narrowly. As the noble Lord said in opening, the only example given in another place by any Minister was the suggestion of the Home Secretary that the provision could apply to someone who had given exceptional assistance to the police.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para7"></a>What we do know--and there is clear authority for this--is that exceptional circumstances do not include good character, youth, an early plea of guilty or contrition, whether taken separately or in combination. It is essential that if the Bill is not to be found in practice to cause injustice, during this Committee stage we should replace the provision of "exceptional circumstances" and, as these amendments attempt to do, introduce the idea that a court need not pass a mandatory sentence if it is satisfied that it is unjust in all the circumstances. With respect, I should have thought that that was not a difficult concept but one behind which all sides of the Committee might unite. Surely it cannot be said that Parliament wishes to see courts being required to pass sentences which they believe to be unjust.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para8"></a>Having read the debate that took place in this House on Second Reading, I wish to attempt to answer some of the points made. My noble friend Lady Young said that under the Bill there would be stiffer minimum sentences for persistent house burglars who had committed serious offences. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I find it difficult to believe that that includes stealing a milk bottle. It would make a mockery of the whole situation if that were the case".--[Official Report, 27/1/97; col. 1005.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para9"></a>I have to tell the House that, according to the Minister in another place, that is apparently the case. The very issue was put during the Committee stage in another place. Mr. Maclean, the Minister, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whether someone is charged with theft of milk bottles or with burglary is a question of fact and law. If the Crown Prosecution Service decide to charge burglary, not theft, the person is so charged. It is up to the court to determine whether the offence is burglary. I have no sympathy for a third time burglar whose excuse is, 'It wasn't a proper burglary. I only reached in the window to steal a milk bottle'. In the honourable gentleman's view, it would be more serious if the person had reached in and grabbed a purse from a woman. <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I do not intend to pontificate on whether that burglary would be more or less serious. If a person is charged with a set of circumstances which, in the court's view, constitute domestic burglary, and he is found guilty, I am content for the provisions of the clause to apply to him".--[Official Report, Commons, Standing Committee A, 21/11/96; col. 146.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para10"></a>It is clear that as the Bill stands it would cover the very case which my noble friend Lady Young said would make a mockery of the whole Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para11"></a>I turn to another matter. Both my noble friends Lady Seccombe and Lady Anelay referred to their situation as magistrates. I wish to remind the House of what the Magistrates' Association said in its considered submission to the Home Office:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Magistrates' Association considers that domestic burglary is a singularly unsuitable offence for a mandatory sentence. While we acknowledge that burglary can be a very serious offence, e.g. night-time burglary with ransacking, soiling and damage, nevertheless the scope of the offence is so wide that the criminal justice system could be brought into disrepute if courts had to impose mandatory three year sentence for, say, the theft of a bottle of milk through an open window. Moreover, we see great problems in defining 'genuinely exceptional circumstances' at the time of the mode of trial decision, resulting in all cases being referred to the Crown Court". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para12"></a>I believe that the Magistrates' Association was absolutely right in its view.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para13"></a>The point I wish to make to the House is different. I ask my noble friends who are magistrates a question. One of the principles on which the White Paper is based is the claim that on the third offence of domestic burglary half the cases are dealt with in the magistrates' court and that some 64 per cent. of those convicted are not sentenced to prison. Those who are get an average of four months. My question is this: is it really to be suggested that magistrates sitting in court are so out of touch with the community they represent that it is to be argued that all those cases which make up the 64 per cent. who, in the magistrates' view, should not go to prison at all, are instead to receive a mandatory three-year sentence? Indeed, rather more. If we take into account the effect of honesty in sentencing, it is now a sentence of four-and-a-half years. I ask magistrates to reflect: are they saying of themselves and their colleagues that they have got it so wrong that in 64 per cent. of the cases that do not go to prison at all the court should instead be required to impose a sentence of three-and-a-half to four years' imprisonment? I believe that the message to be drawn is not that the magistrates have it wrong, but that it shows the wide variety of incidents that amount to domestic burglary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para14"></a>Finally, like the mover of the amendment, I was frankly amazed to hear the suggestion by the Home Secretary that the amendment would drive a coach and horses through the Bill. Is it really considered that to say that a court should not be required to pass a sentence which it believes unjust drives a coach and horses through the Bill? If it does, then all I can say is that it shows the total injustice of the Bill with which we are dealing.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para15"></a>It has also been suggested that if the amendment were passed it would be a wrecking amendment because it would leave the situation as the status quo. With respect, that is totally untrue. I wish to remind the House of what <P>


<a name="column_338"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would happen if the amendment were to pass. Instead of half the cases today being dealt with in the magistrates' court, under the terms of the Bill every third case of domestic burglary would have to go to the Crown Court. When those cases reached the Crown Court there would be a presumption that the defendant would serve the mandatory sentence of three years because the Bill says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court shall impose [such] a sentence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para16"></a>The defendant would have the burden of satisfying the judge that it was unjust in the circumstances to do so. On top of that the judge then has to state in open court his reasons for coming to that conclusion.

<A NAME = "70213-05_para17"></a>I do not believe that sentencing should be a matter for party political debate. Judges are appointed from practising lawyers without question as to their political allegiance. Magistrates are chosen to represent the areas and communities in which they live. Surely, we should attempt to provide a system of justice and sentencing which is agreed across the political divide. I believe that I am the only person on this side of the House who at the moment sits as a recorder and tries and sentences people. I realise that my noble friend Lord Renton did so with distinction for many years. I know that, across the Chamber, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, is also a recorder, as is the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu. We sit on different Benches in this House but I am sure that we will all vote the same way on this amendment. We will do so because we all believe that sentencing should not be a matter of party politics. It should be a matter of doing justice between the individual and the state.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-05_para18"></a>I apologise for going on so long. Finally, I believe it is tragic that the Government appear to be in total conflict with the judiciary over the matter. I have absolutely no doubt that the overwhelming majority of those who sit in the criminal courts, whether they be High Court judges, circuit judges, recorders or assistant recorders, are totally opposed to the effect of mandatory sentences unless there is a sensible exclusion clause. I find it extraordinary that apparently the Government do not heed the advice of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the two previous Lord Chief Justices who sit in the House today. I hope desperately that we can come to an agreement to find a set of words which will allow the Bill to proceed but to proceed in a way that will do justice. If the Minister feels herself unable to accept the amendment, then all I can say is that I hope that it will be carried by the House.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="70213-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps I may make one comment. I admit that I am not qualified in any way. However, the guidance given to magistrates is that the magistrates' court is not the right place to hear the offence of burglary of a dwelling house because the sentence that a magistrates' court can impose is not severe enough. I am amazed to hear the figures given by the noble Lord and that so many such cases appear to be dealt with in the magistrates' courts. I understand they would not hear them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I took the figures from the White Paper--that was my justification. They are to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>be found on page 52 of the White Paper. Figure 11 shows the number of convictions and average sentence lengths for burglary of a dwelling for, I believe, 1994. The table shows that 305 of them were given in the Crown Court, and 277 in the magistrates' court. Of those 277, 36 per cent. were sent to prison and the average length of sentence was four months.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para0"></a> My noble friend is right. Under the Bill, magistrates will no longer have the power to deal with a third offence of domestic burglary. There will rightly be a requirement to commit, because higher sentences than those should be considered. My point was that it seems an extraordinary jump from saying in those days that 64 per cent. of such offenders do not go to prison at all to saying that we should enact a Bill which requires every one of them to be sent to prison for at least three years.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Can my noble friend make it clear whether the figures given in the White Paper relate to first, second or third convictions?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   The figures I gave related to third convictions. That was my point. Figures are also given for first and second convictions. I shall not bore the Committee by reading them out but I can assure noble Lords that such is the case. I shall hand the White Paper to my noble friend.

<A NAME="70213-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   It is a privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, who spoke so powerfully in favour of the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para1"></a>The Committee will know that for many years the noble Lord has been chairman of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. In that capacity he has been involved in the problems that affect victims. I had the privilege of serving on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board under the chairmanship of the noble Lord and previously under Sir Michael Ogden for a period of about eight years. Every member of that board has passing before him every year something in the region of 2,000 files of victims of violent crime, and day by day and week by week the members of that board are concerned to see what happens to people who suffer from violent crime. Members are provided with medical reports. They see what follows. The overwhelming impression that one receives as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board is that victims must be protected.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para2"></a>So when the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, and I speak, I hope that we do not speak from the point of view of recorders or part-time judges. We do not represent a trade union. We speak because we have practical experience of the effects of crime upon people. We are anxious to ensure that the limited resources available for dealing with crime in this country are spent properly in the prevention of crime and not simply in the containment of people for longer and longer periods. If those resources have to be spent upon people who are in prison, then they should be spent on rehabilitation, to enable prisoners, who are still human beings and not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>statistics, to come out of prison and take a rightful place as fruitful and, it is to be hoped, more honest and less violent members of our society. That is the point from which we come when we address the issues that are now before the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para3"></a>I ask the Committee to ponder for a moment on what we are seeing; namely, a most extraordinary attack upon the judiciary. Its discretion is to be taken away and limited by statutory restraints as set out in the Bill at the very time when, as the Committee heard earlier today, the gaols are full. There are 62,000 people in prison today. The judges who are so failing in their duty to society have succeeded in filling every cell, doubling up in some cells and perhaps tripling up in others, in gaols which have been made available by the state for punishing people.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para4"></a>There is a paradox which I am sure the Committee must comprehend. How can the judges of this country be said to be failing in their duty and a soft touch all of a sudden, as we approach an election, and be accused of not doing their duty, when all the gaols are full? The practical experience of those who have been involved in the criminal law for a period of time is that over the past 20 or 30 years the Crown Courts, the circuit judges and High Court judges have become tougher and tougher in their response to an increasing crime wave.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para5"></a>I refer to an increasing crime wave because over the period that the Conservative Government have been in power, since 1979--I do not, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, said, want to make a political point; it is merely a fact--crimes of violence have doubled and the judges have responded. They have increased the sentences. But it is not right to interfere in the balance between the judiciary and Parliament (the executive), by taking away from judges the discretion which for centuries they have exercised in sentencing matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para6"></a>I support the amendment, although I am not completely happy with it--our amendment will be discussed later--but as the noble Lord said, the issue in the amendment is the question of exceptional circumstances. What is an exceptional circumstance? Is it exceptional that a wife who has been battered by her husband takes a knife to him, or, in a case which I recall, that a wife should strike her husband on the head with a hammer and kill him? Is that exceptional? It is not. It happens all the time. I am afraid that it is a fact. There is nothing exceptional about circumstances of that sort which come before the courts. There is nothing exceptional about the manner in which burglaries take place: young people break into premises, steal on a whim and under the influence of alcohol or drugs. There are people who come from a rough background and who have had no chance in life. Those are everyday matters with which the courts have to deal and there is nothing exceptional about them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para7"></a>A judge tries to listen to what an individual criminal has done--what his crime is--and consider its circumstances. He balances it against all the other circumstances of which he has learned throughout his career and asks how that appears in the scale. Against that he sets the mitigating circumstances relating to that particular individual in front of him. Having carried out <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>that exercise, he passes a sentence which he considers from his experience is just. Are politicians to interfere in that? Is the Home Secretary to come along and say, "Well, I know better. I am responding to a wave of feeling in the country, expressed through the tabloid press"? Or is it better that we should rely upon the instincts, the training and the just feeling of the individual judge who tries a case? I ask those noble Lords who may be thinking of voting against the amendment seriously to consider what they will be doing to the constitution of this country.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-06_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Dudley: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, does he not agree that the issue before the Committee this afternoon is not whether judges are too soft, but whether the law is too soft?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford:  </B>   The law, in all the offences set out in the first clause of the Bill, permits a life sentence to be passed; therefore, it cannot be said that the law is soft. In the first clause the law allows judges to pass condign sentences, and they frequently do. I am not aware in my experience of a person who has raped for the second time not receiving life imprisonment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bingham of Cornhill: </B>   I find myself in such complete agreement with the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, that, perhaps uncharacteristically, I can be very brief. I hope I shall be forgiven for stating the obvious by reminding the Committee that for one citizen, whatever office he holds, to pass sentence on another is a solemn and serious task. However deserving of punishment a defendant may be, it is always a difficult and anxious task to measure that punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para8"></a>Judges do their best. They weigh what they perceive to be all the relevant factors: the interests of the public; the legitimate interests of the victim; the protection of other potential victims; and the interests of the defendant himself. They are not always right. I make no claim for infallibility. Judges alone among mortals are not so gifted. If they pass sentences which are excessively severe, then a Court of Appeal exists to correct those sentences. If they pass sentences that are unduly lenient, then the Attorney General has power to refer those sentences to the court for review. Members of the Committee will not hear me resist a request for an extension of the Attorney General's power. It is a power which, since it was introduced, has been exercised--to the best of my belief--with great responsibility and discretion. I have no fears that it would be misused if extended.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-06_para9"></a>No doubt our sentencing system is imperfect; any human system of the kind must necessarily be so. But I invite Members of the Committee to search the world for any system that is less imperfect. Rules of thumb do not provide an answer to these problems because the passing of a sentence is not a mechanical task. Nowhere in the world does one find evidence that logarithmic tables or mechanical rules of thumb yield better answers than the courts of this country.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   I rise with a little diffidence after so many noble and learned Lords have expressed their views on this amendment and on the Bill in general. My concern is with what seems to be a major misunderstanding in relation to the purpose of this section of the Bill. I was particularly concerned that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice should express his total support for my noble friend Lord Carlisle.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para0"></a> My noble friend talked of young, and implicitly innocent, burglars who might suffer as a result of the Bill. But they are young burglars with three previous convictions, after cautions, warnings and anything else that may have gone before. The noble Lord talked also of their good character. Can a man have a good character after three convictions? Surely, this is a Bill which is dealing with a confirmed and persistent criminal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para1"></a>Members of the British public are the victims, and they have scarcely been mentioned in discussion on the Bill. The early parts of the Bill talk of sexual offences, drugs and burglary. If the Bill can help to reduce the incidence of those crimes, it will be worth while. The Bill emphasises the persistence of offending more than the seriousness of the offence. A later amendment seeks to take manslaughter out of the Bill. But three instances of manslaughter or grievous bodily harm must indicate that something is wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para2"></a>It is clear that judges fail to understand the deep concern felt in this country about crimes of this sort. Even so, under the Bill judges will retain the right not to use the sentencing policy in "exceptional circumstances". The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice stated, quite correctly, that he and the Attorney General have the right to appeal if it is felt that sentencing in any specific case has gone wrong; but, after three convictions, a custodial sentence of some severity is unlikely to be wrong. It may be, in exceptional circumstances, and the Bill deals with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para3"></a>When discussing the firearms Bill, we were told that the public demanded it; and the Bill was passed this week in this Chamber. Members of the public have to face few Members of the Committee, including myself--whether or not they are noble and learned. The Bill addresses the major anxieties of those members of the public, who see these offences being committed around them all the time; they want just a little peace and quiet. G.K. Chesterton was right when he said:

<A NAME="70213-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   When I listened to the indignant observations of the Home Secretary on the radio this morning, I realised yet again that I am but a child in these political matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para6"></a>The amendment seeks to achieve merely that a judge is given a discretion to match the punishment to the crime. I shall submit that Members of the Government Benches can, with a wholly clear conscience, support it. What it seeks to achieve was sought by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. He thought he had achieved it; but in fact he failed to achieve it because of his misunderstanding of at least the English meaning in the forensic context of "exceptional circumstances". Let me make that good.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para7"></a>The subject matter with which we are concerned is justice: justice in the administration of the criminal law and justice in relation to the imposition of sentences of imprisonment. The Lord Chancellor, by virtue of his great office, is deeply concerned that Parliament does not legislate in such a way as to prevent a judge doing justice or, worse still, to oblige him to do an injustice. That was the concern of the Lord Chancellor, who initially baulked at this legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para8"></a>What happened? I can tell your Lordships by reference to an interview which my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor gave early in November and which was the subject matter of an article in The Times on 5th November. I have given the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, notice that I would refer to this article. I have taken the precaution of speaking to the law correspondent to ensure that what she wrote was not the subject matter of any correction. Indeed, I have learnt that the interview was recorded in the Lord Chancellor's Department and a transcript of that recording was provided very helpfully to the legal correspondent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para9"></a>The article is headed:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para13"></a>A little later on, referring to exceptional circumstances, the article states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Lord Mackay said he had ensured that this phrase was included so judges could escape what they saw as a restriction on their ability to match punishment and crime. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>'I expressed the view that one needed to consider that and the Home Secretary obviously did have that under consideration and this is the result of it,' he said. 'I think it enables them to deal justly with particular cases, while at the same time giving very clear warning to anyone who's contemplating a crime of this kind what the result will be, unless there are exceptional circumstances.'" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para14"></a>It is absolutely nothing to the point--certainly nothing to the point that I seek to make--that the Lord Chancellor was in error in his construction of "exceptional circumstances". The point which I want to make, and which I submit is of vital importance to your Lordships, is that the head of the judiciary, a very senior member of the Cabinet, recognised the paramount importance of the judge having sufficient discretion to enable him to match punishment with crime, an elementary requirement of justice. He thought, sadly wrongly, that he had achieved that by persuading the Home Secretary to put in just the simple words "exceptional circumstances".
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para15"></a>That is why I have said that Members on the Government Benches can with a clear conscience support this amendment, because clearly it seeks to achieve that which my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor sought to achieve; namely, a sufficient discretion in the judiciary to enable them, and I quote again the words from the article,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to match punishment and crime". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para16"></a>As it stands at the moment, they cannot do so; as it stands at the moment, there will be occasions when they are prevented from doing justice; as it stands at the moment, there will be occasions when they will be obliged to do injustice. For those reasons, I firmly support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dean of Harptree: </B>   I rise as a non-lawyer and I take a somewhat different approach to these amendments from those noble Lords who have spoken in favour of them. I think it is generally agreed in the country that there is a strong feeling that the state is not doing enough to protect innocent victims from persistent and serious criminals. It is the main duty of any government to do their utmost to strengthen law and order and to ensure as far as they possibly can that citizens can go about their business without let or hindrance. In the circumstances we now face, the Government would have been failing in their duty had they not reacted to the increasingly serious situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para17"></a>It is well known that it is a cardinal principle of British justice that an accused person is innocent until he is proved guilty. We all respect that principle and expect the courts to uphold it. At the same time, in a debate of this kind it is very appropriate--indeed essential--to stress the plight of innocent victims. As your Lordships know, the amendments we are debating deal with repeat offenders who have been convicted of serious crimes which cause great injury and distress to innocent victims. I remind your Lordships that a person has to be convicted for a second time. In Clause 1 of <P>


<a name="column_345"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Bill, the serious crimes which are specified are sexual crimes, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape or serious wounding. One has only to mention these very serious crimes to realise the immense damage and harm they do to innocent victims and the fear they spread throughout the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para18"></a>In the case of Clause 2, the minimum sentence laid down is again for people convicted of a second offence for trafficking in hard drugs. How many promising young lives are blighted, sometimes for life, by this evil trade? In the case of Clause 3, the minimum sentence is for people who again have been convicted a second time for domestic burglary. All your Lordships know the mess and the misery caused by burglary to innocent victims who often have little prospect of recovering treasured heirlooms. In all these cases, as has already been pointed out, there is the important saving phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless ... there are exceptional circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para19"></a>Edmund Burke, in a famous speech to his constituents in Bristol many years ago, said that a Member of Parliament is not a delegate or an acoustitude for his constituents. He is a representative and owes them his judgment. That means that he must not be over-borne by public opinion. But Edmund Burke also said--and this was long before universal suffrage was introduced--that a Member of Parliament must take very careful note of public opinion. Indeed, this is an essential element in the parliamentary and democratic system upon which we pride ourselves. It is all the more important when we are dealing with intensely serious matters of this kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-07_para20"></a>I believe that this Bill is necessary to respond to the present situation. It seems to me that the amendments would greatly weaken the essential principle of the Bill. For that reason, I shall vote against the amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="70213-08_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I listened with great care to the noble Lords, Lord Burnham and Lord Dean of Harptree. Except for the last two sentences of the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Harptree, I do not believe that I need to join issue with anything they said. I wish to draw attention to what they did not say. I believe they have illustrated a confusion which has been at the heart of our debate from the beginning of Second Reading. What we have heard from the other side of the Chamber from the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Warwick and the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is a case for longer sentences in response to a public concern. I hear that message. What we have not heard from the other side of the Chamber is any specific principle defence of the mandatory sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para0"></a>They are not the same issue. It is my view that a mandatory sentence must be unjust whatever its length because as I understand the word "justice" it must involve passing an individual judgment--as this amendment spells it out--both on the offence and on the offender. Many of us here have had the task of disciplining our children. I do not believe that many of us have disciplined them according to a flat tariff regardless of the circumstances, mood and the conditions of the offence. I believe that most of us would have thought that that was unjust because it would not have been making the punishment fit the <P>


<a name="column_346"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>crime. That is a vital objective. When the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, referred to this approach to a mandatory sentence and treating sentencing as a mechanical task, he hit the nail on the head. As W.S. Gilbert had it, "Five crimes at half-a-crown, that is exactly 12s 6d".
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para1"></a>I hear the argument that has been made about exceptional circumstances but, as I understand it, any sentence which is not based on a specific consideration of the circumstances is necessarily unjust. So if we accept the exceptional circumstances formula we are saying that only in exceptional circumstances can justice be done. That is completely unacceptable. All successful amendments are compromises: this amendment is a compromise. If I live with it, I, like the Home Secretary, will have to make sacrifices of principle. But in the real world one must reach compromise. This is a compromise with which I, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, am prepared to live. I hope that the Home Secretary may be able to say the same.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   The noble Earl, Lord Russell, and others have addressed the question of principle which lies behind the Bill and these amendments. There are two questions of principle and a number of questions about practice which follow. The one which has bulked large in earlier speeches and in the minds of many of us is whether or not it is proper in principle for Parliament to tell the judges what to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para2"></a>In the days of King James we rightly resisted the view that the judges were "lions under the throne". Since then ultimate power in this country has been drawn into the Crown in Parliament. Historically, the Crown has always acceded to the wish of Parliament. Therefore, it is in no way a breach of principle if Parliament is to tell the judges what to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para3"></a>The question then arises of what it may tell the judges to do and the authority that it has to do so. Reference has been frequently made to the opinion of the public. We are not an elected Chamber; our knowledge of public opinion is accidental and private. The knowledge of the other place of public opinion is professional and deliberate. Therefore, in this Chamber we are in a sense the jury in a contest between the judges on the one hand and the other place led by the government on the other. I remind the Committee that the judges may be lions under Parliament, but they are not lions under the government. It is not for Her Majesty's Government as the executive to tell the judiciary what to do, but it is for Parliament to interpret what the nation wants the judges to do for its protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para4"></a>Let us not forget that a principal duty of any government and any judiciary is the preservation of the Queen's peace, and that is what we are discussing. It is said that the Queen's peace is being unacceptably destroyed by the threat posed to innocent and often defenceless citizens by breakers of the law who may or may not be innocent young people in other respects but who have broken the law and therefore the Queen's peace and must be brought to justice. If the Government were to say that in every such instance and regardless <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of the innocence or otherwise in other respects of every offender, then first offenders in any of the categories should be subject to a mandatory sentence. I submit that that would be an unacceptable proposition. But that is not what is proposed. I had an elegant paragraph rehearsed, although I should probably have forgotten it. But it was so well put by my noble friend, Lord Burnham. I merely ask the Committee to remember the catalogue of offences and re-offences which he read out which would not qualify for this treatment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para5"></a>Where a really grave crime such as a violent or sexual crime--the list is long, extending from murder, through rape, to intercourse with a girl under the age of 13, none of which can be brushed off lightly or undertaken unintentionally--is a second offence it stretches the imagination a little that there should be extenuating circumstances which make it worthy of less than an extreme penalty. Those circumstances would have to be exceptional and there is provision for exceptional circumstances in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para6"></a>The same argument applies a fortiori to the other less serious cases because they are to be subject to a mandatory sentence, not on the second but on the third offence. The third accidental burglary? The third forgivable class A drugs trafficking ruining hundreds of lives? It seemed to me that at the outset noble and learned Lords and their allies appeared to build an impregnable fortress for their position, to which I was strongly drawn because I am one of those people who has spent much time trying to soften the impact of punishment on young people. But that was as regards the first offence. What one needs with the first offence is the certainty--not the possibility or the fear but the certainty--of what the punishment will be on the second offence and, a fortiori, on the third offence. Justice requires reliability. Young people in particular want to know where they are and this Bill meets that demand. If my noble friend makes the speech I expect in reply to the amendment, I shall vote for her.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I rise to make two points which have not so far been made but which I believe to be of relevance and importance. First, the joint effect of the amendments would be to restore judicial discretion completely, as for first and second offences at present. There is no doubt that that would be their effect. Indeed, the last words of Amendment No. 1 state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would make the prescribed custodial sentence unjust in all the circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para7"></a>That takes us back to square one. That is the position in which the judiciary operates at present. Various other provisions relate to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the offences or to the offender", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para8"></a>and to "specific circumstances" and so on. So, the various matters that arise when the courts are considering sentencing will be considered as a result of the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para9"></a>Secondly, the amendments conflict completely with Clauses 1, 2 and 3 and the movers and supporters of the amendments might just as well have suggested omitting <P>


<a name="column_348"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 348</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those three clauses from the Bill. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, said--I agree with him because I have often operated in this way myself in various circumstances--"Let us compromise if we can". Yes, by all means let us compromise, but these amendments are not a compromise; they are an obliteration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St. Johns: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, argued earlier that, when sentencing, judges ought to be able to take each and every circumstance into account with each and every particular offence. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice referred to the fact that if the judges at first instance get the decision wrong, we can nevertheless rest easy because we have the formality of the Attorney-General's reference and the Court of Appeal can look at the matter afresh and come to another decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para10"></a> As a layman looking at the practice, I was somewhat intrigued because the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said earlier that the reference power was a power that has been exercised with great responsibility and discretion. However, I understand that over the years the Court of Appeal has evolved a policy of double jeopardy which it applies when carrying out its duties. That is not a power which appears in the Criminal Justice Act 1988, but it means that the Court of Appeal takes into account the fact that when an offender appears before it, he or she is being sentenced on a second occasion. Therefore, the sentence which might properly be imposed by the Court of Appeal would be reduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para11"></a>Perhaps I may give your Lordships a fairly recent example of that, as reported in The Times on 27th January this year (with the Attorney-General's Reference No. 28 of 1996). A sentence of four years' imprisonment had been passed by a High Court judge in a case of the rape of a prostitute where the offender had insisted on intercourse without protection although she did not so consent. The Lord Chief Justice ruled that the sentence was unduly lenient and that the shortest sentence which the trial judge could properly have imposed was eight years but, taking into account double jeopardy, the court substituted a period of just six years' imprisonment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-08_para12"></a>I chose that example because it is the most recent that I have to hand, although I have several others. As a layman and a member of the public, I know that there are people who perhaps would not have confidence in extending the powers of the Attorney-General's reference or leaving all sentencing in the hands of the Court of Appeal when policies such as double jeopardy have evolved which appear to result in the offender not receiving the sentence which even the Court of Appeal says should have been passed at the court of first instance.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I should like to make two brief points. The first arises out of the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, when he said that it was no breach of principle to tell the judges what to do. I should like to emphasise that to my recollection no judge in this House has ever suggested that the judges <P>


<a name="column_349"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 349</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do contest the right of Parliament to tell them what to do. Indeed, I know that the Lord Chief Justice has made that absolutely clear. It is Parliament's constitutional right to do that. But there is a world of difference between having the right to do that and doing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para0"></a>However, even the noble Lord, Lord Elton, seemed to balk at the idea that Parliament should tell the judges that they should impose a particular sentence for every first offence. That would not be a breach of principle; it would be a monstrous thing to do, but that is something quite different. I hope that we shall not be told again that the judges are in some way obstructing the will of Parliament. They are advising that what the Government propose is wholly wrong and that it would involve them in being asked to do things which they believe to be wholly unjust.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Renton, said that the amendment takes us back to square one. With respect, I disagree. It gives the judges a discretion which they badly need. But it is a discretion that is exercised against a background. At the moment, there is no background except the maximum sentence. The amendment would substitute a different background. It would be saying, "This is the sentence"--whether mandatory or minimum--"which in the view of Parliament is the norm". Indeed, it would be the minimum norm because there is nothing to stop judges going above it. It would be saying, "This is the norm in terms of minima, but if you, the judges, find that there are circumstances in which the norm would be unjust, you will be free to depart from it". That is something quite different from the wide-ranging discretion which judges have at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para2"></a>I hope that when the Minister replies--and no doubt relies upon "exceptional circumstances"--she will think for a moment in terms of percentages. In my book and, I suggest, in the book of most judges, an exceptional circumstance would be a fraction of 1 per cent. of all cases, yet we know that many of the cases which have been mentioned--the young inadequate drug addict and the opportunist young burglar who has been tempted--are not to be counted at under 1 per cent., still less at a fraction of 1 per cent. Large categories fall into what many people would regard as "exceptional circumstances" which the judges could not conscientiously regard as "exceptional circumstances" in the light of the meaning which judges have always given to those words.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew1"></A><B> The Marquess of Hertford: </B>   May I ask my noble friend the Minister whether there is any truth at all in the rumour that the Home Office is considering in a few years' time hiring ships to house the number of prisoners for whom there may be no room in our existing gaols or even in the gaols which are now being built? If that rumour is true, I feel some anxiety that we are going back to the days when Charles Dickens was a young man and prisoners were housed in hulks on the Thames Estuary, when an ex-convict could say with perfect truth that he might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb. It follows that ex-convicts who are <P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   In view of the time, I shall not elaborate on why I support the amendment. But I wonder whether the Minister could kindly indicate in her reply whether any other country in the civilised world, apart from the United States of America, imposes mandatory minimum sentences in the way that this Bill proposes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   The pendulum has swung too far in favour of the criminal in the mechanism of defence, the length of sentence and early release from prison. I am delighted that the pendulum is swinging back with this Bill and others like it. There are too many cases where people who have been released from prison have gone straight back to crime. A murder was committed near my home by someone who had just come out of prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para3"></a>I very much support higher sentences, but I do not believe that the Bill as it stands will be effective. The Bill removes the decision from judges and places it in the hands of the CPS. The CPS will decide whether or not it wants a life sentence to be imposed and bring the appropriate charge. It must be wrong to place that decision in the hands of the CPS, which is what this Bill seeks to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para4"></a>I do not believe that an amendment of this nature weakens the Bill. It strengthens it. Without it burglars will know that if they are caught on a third occasion they will be subject to a life sentence. Therefore, they must go out to murder because that is the only way they can avoid a life sentence.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I believe that my noble friend has misread the Bill. There is no question of imposing a life sentence for burglary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   However, there are other crimes that carry such a sentence. I do not believe that juries will dispense justice because they will not want very long sentences to be imposed. Therefore, they will not bring in verdicts of guilty when such verdicts are justified. Having sat as a magistrate, I know that there is no doubt that each case is different. Discretion is vital. For example, a 20 year-old may commit three crimes one after the other and render himself liable to a long sentence. Although it is very inconvenient, the fact is that such people grow out of it. Some discretion must be allowed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para5"></a>I believe that as it stands the Bill is little short of grotesque. I do not necessarily support this amendment, but I hope that my noble friend will come back with something that improves the present position.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The proposed new clause standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, relates to the circumstances in which courts should have discretion to set aside the mandatory <P>


<a name="column_351"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>penalties prescribed in Clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill. That is inconsistent with the position adopted by the noble Lord's honourable friends in another place. They abstained from voting on an amendment which would have had exactly the same effect as this amendment would have on Clauses 2 and 3. It would have the effect of removing the test of exceptional circumstances and replacing it with the test of injustice or justice--whichever word one wants to use.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para6"></a>As far as concerns Clauses 2 and 3, burglars and drug dealers will rejoice at these amendments. They set aside exceptional circumstances and substitute the court's view of what is unjust in all the circumstances, as is the case at the present time. That was evidenced by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls--who has not spoken in today's debate-- at Second Reading. If the amendment were passed it would have the following effect. For example, having already disposed of special circumstances in Clauses 2 and 3, if a third time burglar or drug dealer came before the court for an offence which would have attracted a much lower penalty in the mind of the judge but for Clauses 2 and 3, under this amendment the court could take the view that the circumstances were such that a mandatory penalty would be unjust.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para7"></a>There would be nothing to prevent the court from taking that view in a high percentage of cases, if not all cases, because there would no longer be a requirement to prove exceptional circumstances. Your Lordships must tell that to the thousands of victims of burglary, the thousands of people who are at the receiving end of the activities of drugs dealers and the community at large who have lost confidence in the willingness of the courts to punish persistent offenders. I shall return to that matter when I deal with court records.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para8"></a>The Bill as it stands provides that the court may set aside the automatic life sentence if it considers that there are exceptional circumstances which justify doing so. As I understand it, the effect of the amendment to Clause 1 would be to stipulate on the face of the Bill that the circumstances in question must relate to either of the two qualifying offences or to the offender. But it is not clear whether the circumstances would have to be exceptional because that word does not appear anywhere in the new clause. However, it appears in Clause 1 of the Bill. As far as one can tell, the new clause does not change that. Although I have listened to the supporters of the amendment, the issue is still far from clear. Therefore, in this context I invite the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, when he rises to respond to the debate on this amendment to make clear to the Committee what his attitude will be when Amendment No. 3 is debated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para9"></a>The court should be able to consider any exceptional circumstances of the qualifying offences or the offender, but I do not believe that it is either necessary or helpful to specify it in the Bill. I believe that it would have the effect of fettering the discretion of the courts. Section 22 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 similarly provides that a court may suspend a prison sentence if that can be justified by the exceptional circumstances of <P>


<a name="column_352"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the case. Courts have interpreted that as extending to the circumstances of the offence and the offender and to any other background circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-09_para10"></a>The amendment could have the effect of limiting the court's discretion because by stipulating that the exceptional circumstances must relate to either the qualifying offences or the offender the court could be precluded from taking account of other background circumstances. For those reasons, while I do not disagree with the view that the circumstances of the qualifying offences and of the offender may be relevant and exceptional--they are subsumed in the Bill as it now stands--I do not believe that it is either necessary or helpful to specify this on the face of the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but before she leaves the point can she tell the Committee to what other exceptional background circumstances she is referring?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   There is a body of evidence that results from statute and court practice. I shall give the noble Lord an example. I have in mind a case involving a policeman where the court exercised its right to suspend sentence. Perhaps I may refer to another case. An appellant pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding. He was a taxi driver and the victim was a passenger in the taxi who disputed the fare requested at the end of the journey. As the appellant drove away the victim kicked the back of the taxi and caused damage. The appellant stopped, got out and chased the victim. When he heard the victim call to his wife to bring him a crowbar the appellant took a chisel from a toolbox in the taxi and struck the victim a number of blows to the head and face. The victim suffered several lacerations that required stitches, bruising and swelling to the face and a suspected fracture to the orbit of the left eye. The appellant was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentencer stated that he considered the offence so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified for the offender, and that he imposed a shorter sentence in view of the mitigating circumstances--the appellant's good record, the fact that his wife and mother-in-law were dependent on him and his remorse. In the view of the court, there was no error in the sentencer's decision that the offence was so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified. The court would not accede to the submission that the sentence should be suspended. In that case the court was not allowed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para0"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the other case, because the noble Lord wants an example. The appellant had been a serving police officer for almost 20 years and had lived in a police house. His wife had become seriously disabled and could walk inside the house only with the aid of a stick. Outside the house she required a wheelchair. The appellant had been advised to have building works done to the house to make life easier for her and had been under the impression that he would receive a grant for the whole of the cost of the necessary work. When the work was started and the appellant was committed for the whole sum, he discovered that only 75 per cent. of the cost could be covered by the grant and he fell into financial difficulties as a result.
<P>


<a name="column_353"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para1"></a>As a result of the offences--which were that he was stealing money from the police station--the appellant had lost his employment and his house and the work that had been done to it still had to be paid for. His pension was frozen and would not be payable until he was 60. He had made two attempts at suicide and had been under psychiatric care for reactive depression, partly arising from the stress and anxiety of the offence before his arrest. A medical report described him as devastated by the charges and indicated that he was in need of continuing psychiatric care.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para2"></a>The decision was that the mitigating circumstances should not be allowed to obscure the fact that this was an exceedingly serious breach of trust committed by a police officer in the course of his responsibilities for the administration of justice. Although the largest sum in any one of the counts was just over &#163;500 and the next largest &#163;360, there could be no question that each such offence, whether taken individually or in combination with any one such offence, was so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified. It was not suggested that the sentences of three months were not commensurate with the seriousness of the offences, as was required by Section 2(2)(a). The court had been invited to treat the case as one in which there were exceptional circumstances so as to justify the court in suspending the sentence under the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para3"></a>I am not saying that that is an example of what will happen in this case. But there are surrounding circumstances which can be taken into account. We are saying simply that we should not fetter the discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para4"></a>Perhaps I may continue, because I believe that the noble Lord is artfully taking me away from the thrust of what I want to say about the importance of the debate--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   The Minister has been led astray!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord has a vested interest in doing just that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para5"></a>The effect of the proposed new clause, combined with the other amendments to Clauses 2 and 3, is quite a different matter. The effect would be to replace the "exceptional circumstances" test altogether. Instead, the court would have the discretion to set aside the mandatory penalty where there are specific, not exceptional, circumstances which relate to the offence or the offender and which would make the mandatory sentence unjust in all the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para6"></a>This is a wrecking amendment. It would quite simply drive a coach and horses through the provisions in these clauses. They are designed to protect the public from persistent and serious offenders and to ensure that punishment takes proper account of the persistence of the offending. The changes proposed by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, would seriously undermine these important objectives. No longer would the circumstance have to be exceptional; it would simply have to be specific. Any judge could exercise any judgment whatever--as indeed judges do now--that it was unjust, and against no test at all.
<P>


<a name="column_354"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 354</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para7"></a>We have accepted that the court needs to have some discretion to set aside the mandatory penalties. However, any such discretion should not be so wide as to allow that mandatory penalties will not be imposed perhaps in the majority of cases of serious persistent offending. We believe that exceptional circumstances should be just that--exceptional--determined by the court and explained clearly in open court.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para8"></a>I should like to examine the differences between the "exceptional circumstances" test and the alternative which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has put forward. The new test differs from the "exceptional circumstances" test in three respects. First, the circumstances must be specific. Specific to what? Secondly, they must relate to any of the qualifying offences or to the offender. I have already discussed this point in relation to Clause 1 and will not therefore say any more about it. Thirdly, and most important, they must be such as to make the mandatory sentence unjust in all the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has suggested that the words "specific circumstances" would serve to narrow the test of unjust in all the circumstances. His colleague in another place, Mr. Michael, did not agree with that view. But to my mind they do not. It seems to me that they simply mean any circumstances that can be clearly defined and spelt out as specific. This of course is what courts are already asked to do under the Bill when explaining what the exceptional circumstances are.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para10"></a>The phrase "unjust in all the circumstances" goes to the heart of these amendments. In relation to this aspect of the amendments, my concern is that the discretion to set aside the mandatory penalty would be too wide. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, has said that the courts interpret "exceptional circumstances" to mean very unusual at the very least. I make no apology for saying that that is exactly what we want to achieve. The whole essence of mandatory penalties is that they should be imposed as a matter of course in the generality of cases. If they are not, then mandatory penalties will not have the effect which we intend and expect that they should. My noble friend Lord Elton gave the most elegant justification of why it is important to have the near certainty, except for exceptional circumstances, that those mandatory sentences will apply if people are persistently burgling, dealing in Class A drugs and repeating violent offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, also said that a test based on the trial judge's view of whether or not the mandatory sentence was unjust would enable the judge to avoid imposing the mandatory sentence in any case where he considered it simply anomalous to do so. That is the effect of the amendments to Clauses 2 and 3, not to Clause 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para12"></a>The amendments would negate the purpose of mandatory sentences and would allow the judge to set aside the mandatory penalty in any case where he would otherwise have been minded to impose a different penalty. And that would make nonsense out of the whole concept and purpose of mandatory penalties.
<P>


<a name="column_355"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para13"></a>This is a wrecking amendment and would destroy the essential point of statutory minimum sentences for persistent burglars and drug dealers by allowing such a wide discretion to the courts which would lead us back to where we are now.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para14"></a>Mandatory penalties will not lead to injustices. On the contrary, I would contend that without mandatory penalties justice is not being done to the wider community. Perhaps I could remind the Committee of the figures. A recent sample showed that the average sentence imposed by the Crown Court on offenders convicted of domestic burglary for the first time is 16.2 months. After three or more convictions, the average rose to only 18.9 months, and after seven or more convictions to 10.4 months. And 28 per cent. of offenders in the Crown Court with seven or more convictions for domestic burglary were not sent to prison at all. Where is the justice in that? Is it any wonder that the public have lost confidence?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para15"></a>We believe that where the stringent qualifying conditions set out in Clauses 2 and 3 are met mandatory sentences should be imposed as a matter of course in most cases. There is no injustice involved in Parliament saying that persistent offenders who continue to offend should go to prison for a period not less than that stated in the Bill or that dangerous offenders should not be released without a risk assessment being carried out first.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para16"></a>There may be occasional cases where the mandatory penalty would be unnecessary or inappropriate. That is why the Bill provides discretion for the court to set aside the mandatory penalty in exceptional circumstances. In my view, this strikes the right balance. Deliberately widening the scope to set aside the mandatory sentence would seriously undermine it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to the USA. This is not American-style justice. In the United States, if somebody commits any crime, however serious or trivial, on three occasions, he receives a sentence of 25 years. These are narrowly focused propositions set out in the Bill. I stand by that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para18"></a>My noble friend Lord Carlisle referred to the sovereignty of Parliament. I must say to my noble friend that Parliament is sovereign in these matters. If it should take the view that mandatory penalties should apply for certain categories of crime, then it is for the courts to implement the will of Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para19"></a>My noble friend referred to the fact that many senior members of the judiciary support his proposals. I speak for the man on the top of the bus. There is another group of people whose views are paramount in these matters, not just senior judiciary. I am talking about the victims of crime and the public who look to Parliament for the right degree of protection set out in a framework to be implemented by the courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-10_para20"></a>My noble friend appears to suggest--and I find this almost offensive--that stealing valuable items from people who have such items should be taken more seriously than the persistent burglar who daily terrorises people who are much less fortunate by stealing items of lower value such as a bottle of milk, 50 pence from a <P>

<A NAME="70213-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   That is a parody of what I was arguing. There is a distinction between the persistent, professional burglar on the one hand and the small opportunist burglar on the other. Of course I believe that persistent and professional burglars should go to prison for a long time. However, I give one example. A man commits two offences at the age of 16 and then, at the age of 30 or 35 in totally different circumstances, when he is married, with a job and family and having done nothing wrong in the intervening years, on the spur of the moment he commits a burglary of the type mentioned by the Minister. Perhaps he steals a bottle of milk or something of that nature. Is she really saying that a sentence of three years should automatically follow? I do not believe that that is just.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I have not advocated an automatic sentence of three years for anybody. I am simply saying that I support the proposals set out in the Bill. If somebody burgles persistently, whether he steals a loaf of bread, a pint of milk or 50 pence from a purse, he should receive a sentence of at least three years. It is just possible--and I do not wish to suggest that it is--that the case outlined by my noble friend could be a special circumstance to be considered by the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para0"></a>My noble friend said also that mandatory penalties mean that the same sentence follows for the same crime. That is simply not true.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para1"></a>I have some statistics in relation to burglars receiving sentences of more than three years and sentences of more than five years, given that the maximum sentence is 14 years for burglary. I have the 1995 figures. Of 4,400 offenders sentenced for domestic burglary at Crown Courts, 179--only 4 per cent.--received a sentence of more than three years when the maximum was 14 years. Moreover, only 18 received sentences of more than five years. Nobody received the maximum sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para2"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that courts impose long, determinate sentences for violent crimes. But when the offender has served his sentence he must be released, even if there is every reason to believe that he will commit a further serious offence. That is the point being missed by the noble Lord. That is exactly what happens in a significant proportion of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para3"></a>I give the Committee an example. A rapist was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court. He already had two previous convictions for rape, including a conviction for rape of a child. Because he was not given a life sentence on those occasions, he had to be released at the end of each sentence. Under Clause 1, he would automatically have received a life sentence on his second conviction and would not have been free to rape on that third occasion. Such offenders will no longer be released automatically into the community.
<P>


<a name="column_357"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 357</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para4"></a>The noble Lord does not know of a single case where a life sentence has not been given for the second offence. Perhaps I may refer him to paragraph 10.4 on page 46 of the White Paper. He will see the statistic that in 1994, 434 offenders were convicted of rape or attempted rape but only 12 were sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1994, 217 offenders were convicted of a second serious violent or sexual offence which included rape but only 10 received a discretionary life sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para5"></a>The noble Lord referred to overcrowding and an increase in doubling and trebling of prisoners in cells. The practice of three prisoners to a cell for one has been completely eliminated. As regards the practice of two prisoners in a cell designed for one person, 27 per cent. of prisoners were in that situation in 1987 and that figure has now fallen to 17 per cent. It is our policy to continue to reduce that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para6"></a>Perhaps I may defend my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor who was prayed in aid by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I confirm that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor believes that the courts should have discretion to set aside mandatory penalties in exceptional circumstances, as does my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, and I too believe that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para7"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, that at this moment no one can say whether the figure for the use of exceptional circumstances will be 0.5 per cent., 1 per cent., 1.5 per cent. or 2 per cent. This is a new set of propositions. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said that we must not compare this with driving offences or other offences. This is a new set of proposals. It is a matter for the courts to use them. There is an appeal system which serves both the defendant and the Attorney-General and that can be used to determine what is just in all cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para8"></a>The proposals are narrowly focused. I believe that they are a proper response to public concern. I ask noble Lords who will be voting in a few moments whether it is not reasonable that except in exceptional circumstances, a person who has committed repeated violent crimes should receive a sentence which ensures that he is released only when it is safe to do so. Is it not reasonable also that there should be power to recall such offenders if they display further violent behaviour? Is it not reasonable for persistent dealers in Class A drugs who have been convicted not once, twice but three times to receive a sentence of not less than seven years? Thirdly, is it not reasonable to say that persistent domestic burglars who are convicted not once, twice but three times, and possibly on the back of many multiple burglaries, should receive a sentence of not less than three years?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para9"></a>I believe that these proposals are supported by the public. This Bill arrived in this House with a majority of 200 from another place. Should the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, seek the opinion of the House, on behalf of those who suffer daily from the activities of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>violent offenders and persistent burglars and drug dealers I invite the Committee to join me in the Division Lobby to vote against the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   I intervene with great reluctance from these Benches after the Minister has sat down. I do so with great reluctance because I am concerned about the penal policy of this Government, my Government. On a number of occasions during this debate, Members of the Committee on these Benches referred to these amendments as wrecking amendments. But I am concerned that this Bill is wrecking the established penal policy of this Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para10"></a>My noble friends sitting beside me clearly are not aware of the Government's penal policy and have not read the Government White Papers on penal policy. It was clearly established in the 1990 White Paper. As with the latest White Paper, there was a concern about crime and a concern about the need for tougher sentences. It is all in that document. It is all in that White Paper. I have it with me. I shall read from it again, especially for the benefit of my noble friends on this side of the Committee. They should remind themselves of it. I quote from paragraph 2.16 of Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The legislation will be in general terms. It is not the Government's intention that Parliament should bind the courts with strict legislative guidelines. The courts will properly continue to have the wide discretion they need if they are to deal justly with the great variety of crimes which come before them. The Government rejects a rigid statutory framework ... or a system of minimum or mandatory sentences for certain offences. This would make it more difficult to sentence justly in exceptional circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para11"></a>That is why I have a continuing concern. I hope that more of my noble friends on this side of the Committee will share that concern and that they will remind themselves of the established penal policy of this Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Members of the Committee will be grateful for the passionate intervention of the noble Lord. I believe that we would do ourselves credit if we ignored phrases like, "Burglars and drug dealers will rejoice on behalf of those who suffer daily", "Tell that to the victims" or "Speaking on behalf of the man on the top of the bus". Let us remind ourselves of what we have agreed upon. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, reminded us, we agree that it is right and proper that Parliament should tell the judges what to do. But, having said that, it is also right and proper that Parliament should be circumspect and wise in what it tells the judges to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para12"></a>We are not discussing an issue of longer sentences. If we were, then the Government would be accepting our amendments about the power of the Attorney-General to appeal against the leniency of sentences. No one is saying that there should not be maximum sentences for hardened drug dealers or hardened burglars; indeed, we have all made it clear that we agree with the Home Secretary about the penalties which should be imposed upon professional burglars and drug dealers.
<P>


<a name="column_359"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 359</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-11_para13"></a>As I said, we are not discussing the issue of longer sentences; we are discussing the mandatory minimum sentence. The amendments say that that mandatory minimum sentence should be tempered where appropriate in the interests of justice by a measure of judicial discretion. It is no good saying again and again that these are wrecking amendments. They are--again these are not my words but the words of the independent body, Justice--an attempt to ensure that judicial discretion is preserved while retaining a presumption in favour of mandatory sentences. I recommend that view and these amendments to the Committee.

It is important to reaffirm that the amendment that has been carried has not driven a coach and horses through the Bill; mandatory minimum sentences are still there. This amendment is still relevant in the light of what the Minister has said. However, it is an established principle of sentencing practice that youth, and the consequent immaturity of an offender, is a mitigating circumstance which, other things being equal, could justify a less severe sentence than would be imposed on an adult in similar circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-12_para3"></a>I hope I shall not be accused of any coach and horses tactics here. This amendment states that someone who has committed an offence at the age of 16 or under, and who might commit a further offence 10, 20, 30 or 40 years later, should not have that youthful indiscretion held against him under the mandatory minimum sentencing procedures. I do not know what the figures are. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell me; that would be most helpful. She is indicating that she will be able to do so. I do not know whether this measure will affect a significant number of offenders. I do not really mind very much. What I seek to achieve is that people who are little more than children should not be trapped into the progression of sentencing which is proposed under the mandatory minimum sentencing procedures. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="70213-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This is an extraordinary group of amendments. It is proposed that crimes of violence, crimes of burglary and crimes of dealing in hard drugs which are committed by young people up to the age of 17, and who are tried and convicted in court, will not count as qualifying offences in relation to the mandatory penalties set out in Clauses 1, 2 and 3. The Bill as it stands provides that convictions for relevant offences may count as qualifying convictions irrespective of the age of the offender at the time he committed the offence in question. However, none of the mandatory penalties can be imposed unless the offender was over 18 when he or she committed the final qualifying offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para0"></a>Let us consider the implications of this in relation to the various mandatory penalties. Clause 1 covers serious violent and sex offences such as attempted murder, manslaughter, the most serious woundings, rape and attempted rape. The Government do not propose that an automatic life sentence should be imposed on a juvenile offender. However, if a juvenile offender rapes as a 16 year-old and then rapes again as a 19 or 20 year-old, we believe that an automatic life sentence should indeed be imposed. The purpose of Clause 1 is not to punish offenders for what they did as juveniles; it is to ensure that adults who have been convicted for at least the second time of a serious violent or sex offence are not released from custody until the Parole Board is satisfied <P>


<a name="column_363"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that it is safe to do so. On that basis it seems to me that the age when the first offence was committed is beside the point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para1"></a>It is fair to say that only a small proportion of those convicted of serious violent or sex offences, or trafficking in Class A drugs, were under the age of 17 when they committed the offence in question. However, the picture is different in the case of burglars. Eighteen per cent. of offenders convicted of domestic burglary in 1995 were under the age of 17 at the time of the conviction. And we should not forget that many young people are cautioned, not prosecuted, when they first offend. In 1995 42 per cent. of 10 to 16 year-old boys and 67 per cent. of girls who committed domestic burglary were cautioned. So when a juvenile is convicted of burglary it is likely to be a serious offence, and quite possibly involves second, third or multiple burglaries. Allowing those who offend as young people and then as adults in effect to get away with or ignore their earlier offending behaviour will simply encourage that behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para2"></a>There is a good deal of evidence that domestic burglars are highly persistent offenders and that many begin to offend when they are very young. Research shows that the great majority of offenders with multiple convictions for domestic burglary were first convicted of that offence when they were a juvenile. Three fifths of a sample of domestic burglars indicted in 1993 and 1994 who would have been eligible for the mandatory penalty under Clause 3 of the Bill had it been in force, were first convicted of domestic burglary before the age of 17. In other words, many offenders who are first convicted of burglary at the age of 15 or 16 do not grow out of it after a few years. What they are more likely to do--it is even more likely under these amendments--is to embark on a long criminal career.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para3"></a>Why should convictions for offences committed under the age of 17 be disregarded once the offender has become an adult? Where an 18 year-old already has two or more previous convictions for burglary, why should the public have to wait until he gets another three before he is taken out of circulation?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para4"></a>We should remember that the offences covered by Clauses 1, 2, and 3 are all serious offences, whether they are committed by a juvenile or an adult. From the victim's point of view, being raped, burgled or seriously wounded is every bit as serious whether the offender is 16 or 26. It has long been recognised that long sentences may be appropriate and necessary where juveniles commit serious crimes. Section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 provides that courts may impose sentences up to the adult maximum on juveniles convicted of serious offences, including all those covered by Clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, on behalf of his colleagues in the Labour Party, wants to disregard those crimes for the purposes of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para5"></a>The purpose of Clause 1 is to protect the public against serious repeat violent or sex offenders. The purpose of Clauses 2 and 3 is to ensure that stiff minimum sentences are imposed on persistent burglars and drug dealers. In no case will mandatory penalties <P>


<a name="column_364"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 364</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ever be imposed for an offence committed when the offender was under the age of 18. But I have to say that I can see no reason whatsoever why serious offences committed under the age of 17 should simply be ignored if the offender continues to commit similar offences as an adult. To do so would send a very strange message to the public and offenders alike.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para6"></a>We have substantially widened the exceptional circumstances test. The noble Lord can rest in his bed. Sadly, victims will not be able to rest in their beds. The noble Lord gave an example of a long period of time elapsing between the juvenile up to the age of 17 committing a crime and the third qualifying crime not being committed until many years later. Under our proposal at least the test would have been "exceptional circumstances". However, having set aside completely "exceptional circumstances" for burglary, and "special circumstances" for drug dealing in Class A drugs, replacing those words with "in the interests of justice", if we accept Amendment No. 3., the noble Lord need not worry about that circumstance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para7"></a>I have given the figures of people who are committing crimes at the ages of 15, 16 and 17, causing deep distress and anxiety to the community. I cannot think of any justification whatsoever for disregarding those crimes as qualifying offences.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   The noble Baroness asked two rhetorical questions. Perhaps I may answer them briefly. She asked why the public should have to wait for a burglar to commit three offences above the age of 16 before he is sent to prison for three years. The answer is that they do not. If the circumstances justify it, he will be sent to prison for that period. The noble Baroness speaks as though the amendment were seeking to impose maximum sentences. It is not.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para8"></a>Perhaps I may answer the second question. Why should the offences committed at the age of 16 or below be ignored? They are not ignored. They are taken into account by the courts but they do not trigger mandatory or minimum sentences.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps I may say, first, to the noble and learned Lord that if he could give me some evidence that the courts are giving sentences of over three years I should be impressed with the point he makes. I have given the figure that shows how reluctant the courts are even to reach the minimum sentence of three years that we suggest in the Bill, and their almost total reluctance to go beyond five or 10 years. The rationale of the Bill is the record of reluctance of the courts to impose even the minimum sentences. A young burglar almost never goes to prison for three years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-13_para9"></a>On the related matters, I entirely take the noble and learned Lord's points. The courts are indeed free to pass sentences on young people not just of three years but up to 14 years. But it never happens. We are simply saying that because it does not happen those offences committed by 14, 15, and 16 year-olds should count as qualifying offences if someone is a persistent burglar, a persistent drug dealer, or a repeat violent offender.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   At one point the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, implied that the distance <P>


<a name="column_365"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of time was relevant, and asked why a person who had committed an offence 15, 16 or 20 years ago should have that taken into consideration. Am I not right in saying that in a recently reported case a respectable married gentleman--he had been married for over 20 years--committed a violent sexual assault very nearly killing his subject and, I think, being killed himself in the process? It appeared that way down the perspective of time, long before, he had committed a similar offence. It seems to me, therefore, that the distance between two offences is not relevant. The age at the time of the offence may be relevant. That is being discussed. But I do not think that we should consider the distance in time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-13_spnew4"></A><B> The Marquess of Hertford: </B>   Does the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act apply to this Act? If so, am I not right in saying that if someone committed two offences as a juvenile and then went straight for 20 years the previous offences would have been taken out of the record in any case?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   We shall later discuss an amendment linked with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. But the purpose of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act is to allow people to return to the community, to get back into work, and to be treated as people who have spent convictions. In other words, a period of time elapses, and the period is different for different crimes. But for the purposes of qualifying as a persistent offender and for the purposes of Clauses 1, 2 and 3, we do not ignore spent convictions. If someone has been violent in his lifetime, and is repeatedly violent, or has burgled once, twice and three times, or dealt in Class A drugs once, twice, three times or more, we simply say that they should qualify for the purpose of consistency which is established by the measures in the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   It is quite clear from what the noble Baroness said that the Government have no confidence in the judges imposing the appropriate sentence in serious cases. If the Government have no confidence in the judges, then I must take it that the noble Baroness has no confidence in the Attorney General. It is the Attorney General's function to bring to the attention of the Court of Appeal in serious cases sentences which are inadequate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para0"></a>There has been a consistent reference to 207 cases of offenders convicted on a second serious violent or sexual offence in 1994, only 10 of them receiving a discretionary life sentence. The Attorney-General referred only two of the 207 cases, and he did not seek a life sentence in either.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para1"></a>I do not know whether the noble Baroness has had time (I can well understand it if she has not) to read the reference in The Times on Tuesday, 11th February to the obligations of the Attorney-General to defend the public interest. The article ends with this quotation:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Judges are now very aware what is the proper range within which they should sentence. They are thinking about it more carefully than ten years ago". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para2"></a>The position is that the Government are 10 years out of date in their attack on the judiciary; and even then, the current attack is excessive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Perhaps I may follow a point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. The Minister has constantly clung to the three-year sentence as though it were handed down on tablets of stone. Why is that the right sentence? Why not four years, or five years? Why not two?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para3"></a>As the noble and learned Lord said, judges have for a long time been subject to training during which sentencing problems are discussed and they receive lectures from academics, social workers and psychiatrists. Coming together as they do, they have ample opportunity to discuss levels of sentencing all over the country. They are also engaged in the practical work of the courts throughout their working lives. Why is the collective opinion of judges wrong and the Home Secretary right? If the sentences for the sort of offences referred to by the Minister do not reach three years, that is the collective wisdom of the whole judiciary. Why is it wrong?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, referred constantly to "the Government" in relation to these issues. I suggest that what we are doing as a government on behalf of the people is reflecting the anxiety of the public on these matters that in certain circumstances sentences should not be--I did not say, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, suggested, that they should be three years--less than three years for persistent burglary and less than seven years for persistent dealing in hard drugs for at least three convictions, or less than a life sentence for repeated violent offences. I do not advocate any particular sentence. It is possible that one of the previous qualifying offences could have been very serious and beyond the minimum mandatory sentence that we suggest.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para4"></a>It is entirely proper and legitimate for the Government to pick up substantial disquiet on the part of the community about these matters. As I want to keep repeating, we are simply saying that there should be a floor on the sentencing of people who persistently commit these crimes which are offensive to the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, mentioned the Attorney-General referring cases to the Court of Appeal. As he knows, the Attorney-General can refer cases to the Court of Appeal only if the sentences fall within the narrow definitions of being unduly lenient compared to the levels currently imposed in the generality of cases. But longer term sentences are frequently imposed on serious violent and sexual offenders--a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford--which cannot be challenged as unduly lenient.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para6"></a>The point that has been missed throughout this debate by senior noble and learned Lords as well as others is that the offender must be released irrespective of the risk of reoffending. What is most disquieting to the public is to see somebody whom the police, prison officers and the Probation Service know is dangerous but who at the automatic release date must be released into the <P>


<a name="column_367"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>community. The most dangerous offenders, who would normally be refused parole, are released into the community with the least amount of supervision--and again, they are released at the automatic release point without any regard to the danger that they pose to the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para7"></a>Turning to burglary, I return to the record of the courts. The average sentence on a third conviction for burglary is 18.9 months in the Crown Court and four months in a magistrates' court. If an offender receives a custodial sentence at all in a magistrates' court, the three-year minimum (that is, not less than three years) will therefore represent a step change, and we intend that it should.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I intervene only to correct the noble Baroness. The fact that, at the end of a determinate sentence, a person who is thought still to pose a risk has to be released has not been overlooked by the judiciary at all. We have said in terms that there is a lacuna. We have respectfully drawn the Home Secretary's attention to the fact that his predecessor, some 25 years ago, recognised this and produced a report which provided a remedy; namely, a reviewable sentence. In a recent debate I said that that was preferable to the false label of life imprisonment--because such persons are not intended, except in a tiny percentage of cases, to stay in prison all their life--and that it should apply to the first time offender; it need not apply to a second time offender.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para8"></a>I also drew attention to the point that if this were described properly as a reviewable sentence, the danger referred to on many occasions with the false label of the life sentence--of the victim being done in, dispatched, killed in order to avoid detection and then life imprisonment--would not arise. The suggestion that we have overlooked this position is, with great respect, totally unmade-out. Why has not the Home Secretary taken advantage of the wisdom of his predecessor contained in the report to which I referred and which has been gathering dust on the shelves of the Home Office?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble and learned Lord makes an interesting point. I can tell him that many hours were given over to consideration of that option. In many respects, the proposal in Clause 1 is not so different--there is a significant difference to which I shall turn in a moment--in the way that a reviewable sentence would work and the way the automatic life sentence would work.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para9"></a>In the proposals set out in Clause 1 the person would receive an automatic life sentence; the tariff to be served would be set in open court by the judge, taking into account all the circumstances surrounding the case. At least at that point the person serving the sentence would know what the tariff was and would know that at the end of that period, if he or she did not pose a risk, they would be released subject to the agreement of the Parole Board; but if they continued to pose a risk, the sentence could be continued. The significant difference lies in the words, "beyond <P>


<a name="column_368"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>release". Beyond release, such people remain life prisoners. If they continue to display the kind of behaviour which gave rise to the offence in the first place, there is a facility for recall. We believe that the facility for recall for violent offenders is very real.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para10"></a>Sadly, we read all too often in our newspapers of cases where someone who has automatically been released from prison goes straight out and commits another violent crime. We wish to put a measure on the statute book that addresses the same lacuna as those to which the noble and learned Lord referred, but at least it has two important safeguards for the community. One is that the person is released only on the basis of a proper assessment of risk. The second is that he can be recalled if he repeats or starts to display the violent behaviour and can be taken into custody again.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   As one would expect, both those safeguards were featured in Lord Butler's carefully drawn report: the fact that the release could only be allowed after an expert view that the person was no longer a danger; and that release would be on the most stringent terms with regard to recall and other such matters. How one can advise honesty in sentencing with a false label we must explore further. 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I must come back on that because there is no transparency about the noble and learned Lord's proposition. At least in the case of the second offence, the person knows immediately that he will receive a life sentence. The reviewable life sentence does not apply particularly to the first, second, third or fourth offence, it would be in the judgment of the court whether it should be applied. The offender would know that. He would also know the period to be served, because it would be set by the trial judge in court on the day. He would also know that his release depended upon the risk assessment, which would have to be approved by the Parole Board. He would also know that his release for life would be conditional upon his not repeating that behaviour.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I wish to say something to the Committee about what I propose to do during the rest of the Bill. I do not propose to personalise issues as the Minister has just done. I do not propose to ask her whether she will sleep easily in her bed in comparison with whether a victim will sleep easily in his bed. I do not believe that that kind of comment is appropriate for this Chamber and it is a pity that it was made.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para11"></a>The amendments are not about longer sentences nor about determinate sentences. They are about triggering offences for mandatory minimum sentences. Much of the interesting and useful debate that has taken place between the Minister and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, has concerned the Butler Report and reviewable sentences. It had nothing to do with the amendments. I am sorry, because I very much agreed with the noble and learned Lord and I regret that I have not paid enough attention to reviewable sentences in the amendments that I put down to the <P>


<a name="column_369"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill. Perhaps I shall have to correct that at the Report stage, because it is a valid point which ought to be considered in the context of a crime (sentences) Bill. But that is my fault and I shall have to think again about my position on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para12"></a>However, we are not debating longer sentences. The courts have the power to allocate and award as long sentences as they think fit within the existing statutes about maximum sentences. The Minister keeps on mentioning disregarding offences committed at the age of 16 or younger. They are not disregarded, they are convictions; such people have been punished for them. They are not getting away with it, as the Minister said. I wrote it down because it has nothing to do with the argument. Nor has it anything to do with special circumstances. The word "special" does not occur anywhere in the Bill. In resisting the amendments, the Minister is saying that offences committed and convictions which have been awarded to someone under the age of 17 should count towards a mandatory minimum sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-14_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elton, thought that distance in time had nothing to do with it. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 says that it does have something to do with it. We shall come to consider spent convictions.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene. I believe I am right in saying that the purpose of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act is to apply not to the delivery of justice but to obtaining a job. When someone comes into court, I do not believe that that protection exists.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We shall come to consider amendments which the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, has tabled about the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act and we shall see whether it comes within the scope of the Bill. I believe that it does and most of us would feel that an offence committed by someone under the age of 17 is rather different in kind from an offence committed as an adult. It is not that he should not be punished; there is nothing in the amendments that suggests that he should not be punished. It is that it should not necessarily count towards a mandatory minimum sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para0"></a>I repeat that this is not about longer sentences or determinate sentences. It is about the provision which already exists in sentencing practice that offences committed by juveniles are treated differently from offences committed by adults. The Home Secretary says--and we agree with him--that professional burglars and professional drug dealers should be treated harshly. It must be rare for professional burglars and professional drug dealers to be under the age of 17. I am not saying that it is impossible, but it must be rare. Under those circumstances, I should have thought it reasonable that we should make this minor exception to the provisions of the Bill. I shall test the opinion of the Committee on Amendment No. 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Baroness Serota): </B>  In calling the next amendment, I must point out to the Committee that, if the amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendment No. 4.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow </B>   had given notice of his intention to move Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 17, leave out from ("unless") to end of line 18 and insert ("it would be in the interests of justice to impose another sentence.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In view of the fact that there is to be a debate on whether the clause shall stand part, I shall not move the amendment at this stage, so as to have the opportunity to reflect on what the Minister may say in that debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para4"></a>[Amendment No. 3 not moved.]
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 17, at end insert ("relating to either of the offences or to the offender").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment was spoken to with Amendment No. 1. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para6"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 18, at end insert ("or, where the offence is an offence under section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, the court is of the opinion that it would be in the interests of justice to impose another sentence").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment relates simply to the definition of the offence under Section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. As is known, the offence is one of the triggering offences in Clause 1; that is to say, a conviction in respect of Section 18 "wounding", if it is the second offence of the wide range of offences contained in Clause 1, requires the court to impose a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para8"></a>It seems to us that wounding under Section 18 is of such a variable nature that it ought not to be a triggering mandatory offence. Section 18 relates not only to wounding but also to causing grievous bodily harm. I shall concentrate my brief remarks on the question of wounding.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para9"></a>As is well known, in law a "wound" simply means the breaking of the skin. So it can be a very trivial physical consequence indeed. That is quite different from grievous bodily harm, which is, most judges direct juries, some really serious physical injury. A wound is in a different category.
<P>


<a name="column_373"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para10"></a>As drafted, the amendment refers to Clause 1(5)(d):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"wounding, or causing grievous bodily harm, with intent". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para11"></a>But for understandable reasons, the intent is not there specified. According to the 1861 Act, the intent may be the intention to cause grievous bodily harm, but it may be simply resisting or preventing the lawful apprehension or detainment of any person. So one can quite easily have the following circumstances: a youngish man may have had sexual intercourse with a girl who is almost 13 years of age, which is one triggering offence. Many years later, he may throw a stone at a British Transport policeman on a train because he does not want his friend to be arrested. The stone breaks the skin--that is wounding--and the intent is quite plainly there because he shouted out--I remove the expletives--"Leave my friend alone".
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para12"></a>One of the vices of this type of legislation is that one has a ragbag of triggering offences. I move the amendment to draw the Committee's attention to that characteristic of the catalogue of offences, some of which are serious indeed and some of which, as in the example I gave, are not.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para13"></a>On a number of occasions the Minister has said--I join her, as I made perfectly plain when we had our extensive discussion on Second Reading--that serious crime needs to be put down with serious sentences. One does not achieve that desired consequence by including offences which may be as trivial as the one that I described. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_time2"></A><H5>6.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, partly because it means that I shall not have to move my own amendment with a similar intention which comes later on the Marshalled List. I appreciate that Clause 1 is different to Clauses 2 and 3. While it contains a mandatory provision, the aim of that provision is different to the aims of the provisions in Clauses 2 and 3. It seeks to deal with the future supervision and control of the offender rather than the length of sentence he serves. For that purpose therefore it is different and the arguments in its favour are in many ways much stronger.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-15_para14"></a>It does not benefit the clause to include Section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act, for the reason put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn. That is, as one knows from experience, such a wide offence that one will come across cases which could not possibly require or need a life sentence being caught by it. The clause should be limited to offences such as rape, attempted rape and sexual offences where I accept there is sound need for such a measure.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   In attempting to illustrate the principle outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, it is not my intention to say anything which may in any way injure the privileges of another place. I speak of an occasion after the Bill's Second Reading. I had had lunch with a guest in Strangers. I was ushering out the guest, who was on crutches, and attempting to hold open the door for her when a Member of another place came <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through in a great hurry. I will not speculate on whether or not there was any mens rea, both for reasons of privilege and because I genuinely do not know. But the door swung back on my hand and shed blood. My noble friend Lord Meston inspected my hand and said that, in his opinion, the injury would come within the meaning of Section 18.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para0"></a>It would be an absolute travesty of the intentions of Parliament if the Member of another place involved should have committed a triggering offence for a mandatory sentence under this Bill. The Minister shakes her head; I am glad to see it. But I shall listen with great interest to her explanation as to why that would not be a triggering offence. It is a familiar maxim that hard cases make bad law; but it is also true that hard law makes bad cases and this would have been one of them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Bad examples make bad cases. It was a wound but there was no intent. The Minister was about to say that and I thought I would help.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   We must bear in mind that wounding can involve a mere scratch that breaks the skin; it can also involve maiming a person for life. If it is a mere scratch of the kind mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, that would come under "exceptional circumstances". If not, then I do not know what "exceptional circumstances" can be interpreted to mean.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   As a magistrate my understanding is that if it is a minor wound it would be a Section 47 offence. There is also Section 20 before one reaches the serious matter of Section 18. That is very much the guidance that we are given.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St. Johns: </B>   I will not rehearse again the speech I made at Second Reading with regard to the variable aspects of Section 18 cases. Whatever offence one refers to, it is easy to pick out the exceptions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para1"></a>My noble friend Lady Seccombe said--I agree with her--that a case such as the one referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, would not be a Section 18 offence; it would be properly charged as assault occasioning actual bodily harm under Section 47 or perhaps be a matter for no charge at all. If one has faith in the Crown Prosecution Service properly to bring a charge, then one would hope that it would reserve Section 18 for those cases which deserve it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para2"></a>As I have said before, we are talking about an injury caused with intent. Evidence must be adduced which could found a conviction for murder. The situation must be taken that seriously when the CPS brings such a case. In this context we are talking of people facing a second conviction for a serious matter. Surely the public should be protected from those who are convicted a second time of such a serious matter until an assessment is made as to whether or not they may be released back into the public domain. I hope that the amendment fails.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   This is one of the instances where plea bargaining would take place. <P>


<a name="column_375"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Section 18 offences can be so variable, as the noble Baroness said, that they require the same intent as that for murder yet can be just a breaking of the skin. It is in precisely those circumstances, where a person is likely to be facing life imprisonment, that, first, the CPS would be unlikely to bring the charge except where the victim was near death. Secondly, if defence counsel had his wits about him he would be telling the jury that a conviction in that case meant life imprisonment for his client. Thirdly, it is the sort of case where the defendant would plead guilty to Section 20 in order to avoid a life sentence whatever the state of the evidence against him. He may have a good case, but rather than face a Section 18 conviction which results in a life sentence he would plead guilty to the lesser offence. That is exactly the problem that mandatory sentences produce.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   A further matter must be borne in mind. The Criminal Justice Act 1991 contained some sensible clauses; it also contained some foolish ones which placed a judge in a strait-jacket when sentencing and forbade him from taking into account previous convictions, outstanding offences, cases to be taken into consideration, reaction to previous non-custodial sentences and so forth. It produced occasions in which the court had to say, "I should send you to prison because I have been told of your previous record; I must ignore it. I should send you to prison because I know that there are a number of outstanding offences against you. I should send you to prison because you have asked me to take into consideration further offences"--and so forth--"but I cannot do so. Parliament has obliged me to impose the totally unrealistic sentence of community service". As a result, the Government were humiliated into tabling amendments in the 1993 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para3"></a>Exactly the same situation can arise here. We have the heavy sentence of imprisonment for life. We were told, in the debate on the White Paper introduced as a result of the initiative of my noble and learned friend Lord Taylor of Gosforth--I am delighted to see him with us today--by the Lord Chancellor:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government believe that the public and offenders should know that a court's sentence means what it says".--[Official Report, 23/5/96; col. 1072.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said that the Labour Party believes that the courts should spell out the reality of the sentence at the time of passing it. We can take the example of a boy of 16 who indulges in sexual experimentation with a girl of 12. That is a qualifying offence. Then, 30 years later, he is involved in a fight outside a public house and pushes not a broken glass but a glass into the face of someone who has severely provoked him. The judge will say something of this kind, I hope, because I think the judiciary is becoming a little weary of being castigated quite unfairly by the media. "Parliament has required me, John Smith, to impose upon you a sentence of life imprisonment. Parliament has also required me, and I would do so in any event, to spell out the reality of the sentence at the time of passing it. I do so now. Parliament has obliged me to impose upon you a sentence of life. Now the reality. Life does not mean life. Life in this case is to <P>


<a name="column_376"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be properly described as follows. I am obliged to specify what is known as the tariff, which is the length of time which I think you should serve in prison by way of punishment, by way of retribution and deterrence. In all the circumstances, I think, having regard to the mitigation, that 18 months is the right period. So that you are under no misapprehension, life means 18 months. On the other hand, I should go on to tell you that at the expiration of the 18 months' sentence you will be up before a parole board which will have to be satisfied that you do not pose a danger to society. I cannot tell you what the parole board will decide, but I can, and I think should, say this. I have heard not the slightest piece of evidence that you represent a danger to society. I have heard evidence to the contrary. In all the circumstances, then, I state what is the tariff, and I have already been in touch with the chairman of the parole board and arranged with it that your case is considered 18 months hence". That makes a farce of the imprisonment under these terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para5"></a>I am much supported by the observations made in the Second Reading debate by the noble Lord, Lord Williams:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The sentencing regime for which we contend should, as many noble Lords have said, be open and transparent; but it is nonsensical to invite a High Court judge to say, 'I am sentencing you to life imprisonment. By the way, you can expect to serve 18 months'. That is a perversion of the system. It will bring the whole system into disrepute. If it brings it into disrepute on that basis, it will have brought it rightly into disrepute on that basis".--[Official Report, 27/1/97; col. 1063.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para6"></a>One has to be very careful in regard to the qualifying offences. That has been recognised in an amendment soon to be discussed. The same applies to manslaughter where there need be no intent to do any personal injury. But if personal injury is done unlawfully, and the person dies, that is manslaughter. I support the wisdom of this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_time0"></A><H5>6.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps I may say this to the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I do not mean to be frivolous about the point I want to make, but someone pushing open a door and catching someone's finger would not only not be a Section 18 offence, which is with intent--the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, is right--but I would find it preposterous that anyone--a policeman or Crown prosecutor--would prosecute such a case as a crime. I find that such an absurd example for the purpose of speaking to this amendment that I am at a loss to take it seriously.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was scathing about the way in which I have been accused of mistrusting the judiciary. I am not sure that the Crown Prosecution Service will be too happy with what he has been suggesting. He was almost suggesting that it could act improperly to circumvent the will of Parliament. That is really what the noble Lord was saying.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para8"></a>The maximum penalty for offences under Section 18 is already life imprisonment and in my view it would be quite inappropriate for such offences not to attract the automatic life sentence. Section 18 is used to prosecute the most appalling assaults committed by dangerous and <P>


<a name="column_377"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>violent criminals. It requires proof of intent, which typically means that the offender went out equipped with a weapon which he fully intended to use. It is exactly those kinds of people the public need protection from and against whom they will be better protected by the automatic life sentence. Criminals who persist in committing violent and premeditated assaults need to know that they will face a life sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para9"></a>We do not want very minor assaults to attract the automatic life sentence, and that is not what the Bill provides. For lesser offences against the person, lesser charges can be brought. My noble friends Lady Anelay and Lady Seccombe made the point very well. Section 20 of the 1861 Act, wounding without intent to do grievous bodily harm, or Section 47, as my noble friend Lady Seccombe said, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, can also be used. The maximum penalty on conviction under Section 20 is five years. Furthermore, the clause already provides a suitable means of imposing a sentence other than life imprisonment where the life sentence would be wholly inappropriate. So the court may decline to impose a life sentence where there are exceptional circumstances. Now that that has disappeared--except that at this moment it has not: we are not sure now what will happen about Amendment No. 3, which was to have removed "exceptional circumstances" from Clause 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para10"></a>It will be for the courts themselves to determine the interpretations of "exceptional circumstances". But it is perfectly possible that they would consider, for example, that two very minor examples of qualifying offences committed in the face of provocation would amount to exceptional circumstances justifying setting aside the automatic life sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para11"></a>We expect such circumstances would be very unusual indeed. We must not lose sight of the fact that those convicted of offences under Section 18 and facing an automatic life sentence will tend to be those who have committed very violent attacks with intent to do grievous bodily harm and, what is more, have shown a pattern of serious offending.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-16_para12"></a>Wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent is always a serious crime and it is right that the automatic life sentence provisions should extend to them, except, of course, where there are exceptional circumstances. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made an extraordinary point. He suggested that the defence would tell the jury about previous convictions. I hardly think it likely that the defence would tell the jury that the accused had previous convictions for similar offences. How would that assist in achieving an acquittal, which was the suggestion? If it did--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

I shall finish the point and then the noble Lord can come back on it. If it did, I am not by any means sure that the jury would think the accused <P>


<a name="column_378"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deserving of sympathetic treatment by virtue of the fact that he had admitted that there were previous similar offences, and particularly if it emerged that at the previous trial the defendant had disputed his guilt, as he does in the current trial under the example given by the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Perhaps I may answer the noble Baroness. Circumstances arise in different cases when of course the previous convictions of the defendant are disclosed. It may be to the advantage of the defendant to do so. One such circumstance is that referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I would not hesitate to tell a jury in the circumstances outlined by the noble and learned Lord that many, many years ago an offence had been committed and that the effect of its verdict would be that the defendant would go to prison on a life imprisonment sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-17_para0"></a>Perhaps I may add one other point. I learnt my prosecution ethics at the feet of the noble Lord, Lord Hooson. I had to get down a very long way to do it, but I did. Thirty years ago he had a very straightforward ethic for prosecuting, which was to be tough but fair. Those who prosecute are human beings and they would reduce a charge, as I would, if I thought that injustice would follow if I did not do so. I would not fail to do that because of what some long-gone Home Secretary or government had decided.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I hope the noble Lord will also include the caveat that it would be tough and fair, but consistent with the law of the land.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My noble friend said in the course of her comments that the normal wounding with intent case usually involved a man who went out armed intending to do injury. With the greatest respect to my noble friend, I do not believe that that is the normal case at all. On the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board we must see more of these cases than any High Court judge or anyone else. Invariably these woundings occur not with people setting out armed intending to cause injury, but as a result of a flare-up in a public house, usually on a Friday night, when somebody bashes another person with a glass. To my knowledge, both as a barrister and chairman of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, that is a far more common example than someone going out armed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-17_para1"></a>We must face the realities of what actually happens. Whereas that person clearly needs severe punishment for an individual offence, is there any benefit to be gained by giving that person a life sentence and then saying, "Incidentally, I mean it to be only four years"? I do not think that there is any benefit. I suggest that this Bill would be better if we accepted that that kind of case does not fit in easily with the grave matters of rape, attempted rape and attempted murder which occur in this clause.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   There is such a gulf between myself as the Minister with responsibility for this Bill and my noble friend. I have to say to him that if <P>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 379</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>somebody takes a glass in a pub brawl and causes injury to another person with intent deliberately to do so, that person should jolly well be caught by this Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   I had not intended to intervene in this debate except that I would like to tell Members of the Committee this personal story. A man I know well had one, if not two, previous convictions for thumping people. He got involved in a punch-up in Guildford. He ended up by hitting someone who had hit him 20 minutes before with a cricket stump. He faced very serious charges. He came to see me and I gave him the following advice which, in the end, I believe turned out to be correct. I said to him, "All you must do is to go into overtime grovel, plead guilty, co-operate with the police and promise that you will never do it again and say that you are really, genuinely sorry". That is exactly what the man did. He was sentenced to community service. I do not believe for one moment that sentencing that man--who is hardworking, intelligent, has just got married and has contributed to the community--to prison would have done any good whatsoever, let alone sentencing him to life imprisonment. It is in relation to that kind of specific case that I have grave doubts about the moral correctness of mandatory sentences.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The point made by my noble friend is an interesting one. The particular type of crime that my noble friend spoke about, I take it, was completely out of character for that man. My noble friend has said that he was not a violent person.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   I am saying exactly the opposite. It was at least his second offence and that is the point I am making. He had got to the stage of growing up. Had he been sent to prison it would have ruined his life, cost the taxpayer a lot of money and done no good to the community at all. Of course, if it ever happens again he will go down for a very long time, and justifiably so. I genuinely believe that this man has been saved by not going to prison. Under this Act he would have been forced to plead not guilty and that would have been a bad thing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Perhaps I may offer a footnote to the exchange between the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford. The noble Baroness thought it extremely unlikely that a jury might be moved to acquit by the disclosure that a person had previous convictions and therefore might face a mandatory sentence. I know that the best guide to this is what happened when we last had mandatory sentences before the penal reforms of the 1820s. In those cases, as I pointed out at Second Reading, juries very frequently did perversely acquit. The noble Baroness has talked quite rightly about public opinion on crime. What she has not taken into account is that the public's attitude to crime in general is not always identical to its attitude towards an individual, live criminal about whom it has heard evidence in detail. That point is vital.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   Perhaps I may make a second attempt to pose the question. Perhaps I was the <P>


<a name="column_380"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>only one who did not understand. I make the observation that in the case of a person who commits an offence which, at the second or third instance, could incur a mandatory sentence, the records of the court hearing will have to be preserved for the rest of that person's life. Therefore, the circumstances of the first and second offence will be known to the court and taken into account. Am I right in believing that the records of such trials are normally destroyed after three years?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   That is not the case. Records are kept.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-17_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   When we discussed the Police Bill and an amendment had been successfully carried, the Minister described the then state of the Bill as a "dog's dinner". I have a dog myself and I do not believe that she would look twice at the sort of dinner that we are being presented with at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-17_para2"></a>On a number of occasions the Minister referred--and I sympathise because she is in the unhappy position in which many of us, as practising lawyers, have found ourselves in the past of trying to sustain an unarguable case--to those who commit a series of similar offences. That is not the scheme of the Bill. There is nothing similar about having sex with a girl who is nearly 13 years of age and murder. There is nothing similar at all. So let us put the shibboleth of a long series of similar offences to one side. There is a case for putting that in context, but it is not the context of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-17_para3"></a>I endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, said about the general run of Section 18 grievous bodily harm cases. It is very rare indeed for practitioners to come across someone who has deliberately gone out with a weapon. Incidentally, as we are dealing with people who go out deliberately with weapons, if one looks at Clause 1, as I did in the long wastes of our earlier debate when the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, was not speaking--this is the party of brotherly love--robbery, which is a curse on society, is only a triggering offence if it is committed when the robber is in possession of a firearm or imitation firearm. Go out dressed in a balaclava and, with a machete or a chainsaw, terrorise the neighbourhood and your victim--and that is not a triggering offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-17_para4"></a>There is no coherent thought behind the Bill. The examples given cannot be disputed. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said that it is easy to pick out exceptions. Of course it is; that is why we have judges to deal with exceptional, differing circumstances which vary so enormously across the spectrum of human activity.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-17_para5"></a>It is said that the Crown Prosecution Service has been impugned by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. The noble Lord has done no such thing; he has simply pointed out the fact that, things being what they are, the Crown Prosecution Service charges down--not least for the reason offered by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow: so that it will get a plea of guilty. The example given by the noble Earl is a classic illustration of what is wrong with the Bill. My amendment is a modest--I would say that it is a drowning and despairing--attempt to try to improve what is virtually incapable of being saved in its <P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-18_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Tenby </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government to what extent they have taken into account the impact of wind farms on the rural environment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para2"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I am delighted that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford is to take part in this short debate. I am sure that we all look forward with great interest to what he has to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para3"></a>I declare an interest at the outset as the president of a county branch of the CPRE, but one that has no wind farms within its area. In any event, the views expressed by me this evening are entirely my own. I come with no lance for tilting purposes, and on foot, having left my donkey at home. My purpose in tabling this Unstarred Question is to give the subject an airing--an appropriate word to use in this context--and it would seem that there are so many noble Lords who share that view that I now rather regret not having gone for a debate. Perhaps we may be able to rectify my omission later this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para4"></a>It is a subject on which there are strongly held opinions on both sides and it seems to me that the arguments and statistics quoted depend very largely upon the side one takes. Accordingly, my intention to hold the ring, as it were, may well end up with my being under attack from both sides, but an intermediary's role has never been a bed of roses.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para5"></a>I suppose that my interest in the subject was fired by making a journey, as I frequently do, through the heartland of rural Wales, the country in the UK with the largest number of wind turbines--Llandinam has 103, Carno Tranhon Moor 56, Cemmaes 24, rising to 32, Bryn Titli 22, and so on. There is a smaller wind farm at Trysglwyn in Anglesey on land farmed by the noble Lord, Lord Stanley of Alderley, with whom I have often enjoyed working in the past on various unrelated matters, as I am sure that the noble Earl the Minister will fondly recall. We very much look forward to the noble Lord's knowledgeable contribution later.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para6"></a>Anyone undertaking such a journey will immediately be struck by the number of wind turbines dominating the upland landscape and I remember thinking on that first occasion, "I hope it's all worth it". To have such thoughts--"airy-fairy thoughts", the unusual alliance of Greens and dedicated businessmen might call them--<P>


<a name="column_382"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not in any way question the desirability of wind power and the part that it and other sources of renewable energy might play in meeting part of our future energy requirements, but we must, I believe, come to a decision before long on the price we are prepared to pay to go down this road.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para7"></a>First, we must assess the environmental implications. Because they are wind power stations, they must be sited where there is the best chance of maximum wind supply and this will usually mean in upland areas of outstanding natural beauty. So much is obvious and inevitable. In addition, the most favoured areas will be the most popular ones for developers, with the consequent risk of overcrowding bringing in its wake the danger of "intervisibility", as it is called--that is, a situation where one site is visible from another. That is particularly the case in parts of Montgomeryshire, for example.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para8"></a>Despite surveys which have been conducted at Delabole in Cornwall and at Cemmaes, both before and after commissioning, which record substantial support for the structures from local residents, there is nevertheless considerable opposition from countryfolk generally. The degree of noise (which to a large extent depends on the type of equipment involved and its age) emanating from the gearbox and drive mechanism; the noise from the blades themselves (obviously greater in a high wind); the amount of flicker experienced in the surrounding countryside; and the amount by which the local economy benefits through spending on employment--these are all matters of contention between the opposing groups. It is also right to add on the environmental aspect that there are other factors to be taken into consideration besides the opinions of immediate residents. The impact on the tourist trade is also of considerable importance, particularly in Wales, and it is doubtful whether those who pay good money to see incomparable scenery wish to see it to the accompaniment of flailing arms, seemingly pointing in all directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para9"></a>To many, any damage to the environment is more than paid for by the reduction, however small, in pollution levels caused by fossil fuels. One cannot help noting, however, that some of the movers and shakers in the wind farm stakes have other interests too and that those promoting Rookhope, for example, in County Durham, a projected site with 55 turbines 300 feet high, also have plans for an orimulsion plant in Pembroke at the other end of the UK. It also cannot be ignored that the conversion to gas-fired power stations in coming years will inevitably constitute the largest single contribution to a reduction in pollution levels, far exceeding anything from the renewable energy sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para10"></a>Secondly, there is the question of viability. Planning Policy Guidenote 22, issued by the Department of the Environment in 1993, declares that government policy is being pursued through a continuing programme of research and development and by allowing renewable energy promoters to compete equitably in the market with providers of conventional sources of energy. Because of the high initial capital cost of establishing a wind farm, this can be achieved only by the use of NFFO subsidies, but it is only right to add that all wind <P>


<a name="column_383"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>energy developments throughout the world receive subsidies in one form or another. In fact, some of the 17,000 or so wind turbines in California have been scrapped or shut down because of the withdrawal of subsidy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para11"></a>Although wind power is infinite, it is also variable. Turbines cannot cope with too little wind or too much, and the farm at Cemmaes, for example, was severely damaged by storms some years ago. It is also claimed by some that output has not always lived up to expectations. In the case of Cemmaes, there has been real output of 25 per cent. against a projection of 43 per cent. when the project started. That is the downside. On the upside, there is the progress being made in the development of ever-more efficient and powerful turbines. Both these factors, however, in their different ways make accurate forecasting of the future output of the industry doubtful, to put it as mildly as I can.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para12"></a>The Government have said that they will seek 25 per cent. of their total energy requirements from renewable technologies by 2025. It has further been calculated that it would take anything between 20,000 and 38,000 of the smaller turbines and 10,000 of the larger 1.5 megawatt turbines, depending on which side you take, to supply 10 per cent. of the UK energy market. At present there are some 550 turbines (representing 40 farms) in the UK, their presence eliciting opposition in many quarters. One quails at the thought of the unease which would ensue once we were to get anywhere near realising that government calculation for future years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para13"></a>Thirdly, we must consider planning. PPG 22 says that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plans of an area and must then take into account environmental concerns, the effect on wildlife and so on. Particular care, it continues, must be taken in assessing development in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, SSSIs and the Broads. It is hardly surprising that, given those criteria, many applications are rejected. Indeed, I believe that it may be true to say that no application has been successful within the past 12 months, which indicates that planning officers are rightly applying the highest standards in their assessments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para14"></a>Irrespective of the merits or demerits of wind farms, we do not want to be so bedazzled by the new technology and our fear of the greenhouse effect that we repeat the mistakes of 150 years ago in allowing the new factories of the industrial revolution to proliferate without control. Clearly, every application should have an environmental impact assessment and, furthermore, should be in harmony with whatever the development plans may be for the particular area. Surely, to this there should be no exceptions. I would welcome the assurance of the Minister on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para15"></a>It would be wrong to diminish the need for, and use of, renewable energy, be it solar, water or wind. We must all hope that research and development in these areas will increase as the years pass for our future may well depend on it. Who knows? We may yet see the Severn Bore harnessed. Wind farms will undoubtedly <P>


<a name="column_384"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have an important role to play as well but they must always be sensitively sited and strictly controlled. There should be greater emphasis on offshore development. I particularly welcome the Scroby Sands development. However, the greatest contribution to reducing the earth's pollution can be made only by reducing our energy requirements across the board. This mammoth task is dependent on something that no government since the war have seen fit to give us: a rational and co-ordinated transport policy with emphasis on, and wholehearted support for, public transport. Until that challenge is accepted we shall only be tinkering with the problem, wind farms or no wind farms.

<A NAME="70213-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, since the passing of the 1988 Act I have been trying to follow the Government's advice given on 15th June 1989. On that occasion my noble friend Lady Hooper said that renewable generators could always look to the future with optimism. That was reinforced by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, on 19th June 1990. He said that noble Lords opposite did not believe that the Government had shown enough enthusiasm for renewable sources of energy. He particularly had in mind wind power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para16"></a>After an eight-year struggle, in May 1996 14 turbines became operational on my wife's farm, the nearest being within 200 metres of our house. I invite any noble Lord to visit them and understand that, first, they are not noisy; secondly, they do not disturb wild life; thirdly, they do not pollute; fourthly, they have improved immeasurably the farm both economically and environmentally; and, fifthly, they are a tourist attraction. I am sorry to argue with the noble Viscount. They are dramatically beautiful. Eighty per cent. of my visitors say so, as does the noble Viscount's first cousin who lives in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para17"></a>Further, they subsidise the regional electricity companies. They fully comply with PPG22, the planning document referred to by the noble Viscount. That was instigated by my noble friend Lady Blatch. I trust that all noble Lords who are to speak have studied it carefully. For all those reasons, I hope that my noble friend Lord Ferrers will confirm that the Government's proposals take full account of the impact of wind farms on the environment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, for this opportunity to speak, however briefly, on the subject of wind farms. It is rather difficult to develop any arguments but I will do my best. Global warming is a reality. We cannot prevent it happening because it has gone too far for that. All we can do is try not to make it any worse by the things we do and to avoid reaching a point where life becomes intolerable for our children and grandchildren. That means reducing harmful emissions across the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para18"></a>Wind farms are part of that exercise. But if we are not to destroy our most cherished landscape we must be very careful where we put them. I agree with the noble <P>


<a name="column_385"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 385</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Stanley. I, too, find them beautiful but not when they are stretched across a scene I once loved. I refer to a mountain in Wales. I do not know whether the noble Lord's wind farm is sited on a mountain in Wales. I find that very unattractive. However, I like to see wind farms in action. I do not find them noisy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para19"></a>I make a special plea on behalf of the national parks--I speak as a vice-president of the Council for National Parks--which contain our most precious and valued landscapes. I believe that they are a special case and must be treated differently in the context of the installation of wind farms. They are our most valued areas for recreation and spiritual renewal. I speak not only of national parks but for example of mountains in Wales which are not within national parks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para20"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, referred to PPG22. I believe that that must be amended to give greater emphasis to environmental considerations. It goes some way but not far enough. No application for a wind farm should be approved without a full environmental impact assessment that takes into account the visual impact and the cumulative effect to which the noble Viscount referred. Further, decommissioning and the restoration that inevitably follows should be built into the initial planning requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para21"></a>Above all, the Government must lead a new campaign for energy conservation. Support for the Energy Saving Trust must be maintained. All of us as individuals must play our part. It seems trivial to say that we must switch off unnecessary lights and appliances but, with 13 million homes in the country, that could make a considerable impact on electricity demand. Building regulations could and should demand higher levels of insulation. There is much more that can be done to reduce the demand for ever more energy production. It would be encouraging to know that this philosophy had spread through all government departments.

<P>
<A NAME="70213-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, on tabling this Unstarred Question. It is a shame that we are limited to 60 minutes. I live in a beautiful part of Montgomeryshire which has the two largest wind farms in Europe. It also has the first such wind farm at Cemmaes which has already been referred to. My initial reaction was one of qualified support because of the renewable energy implications. It brought to some farmers much needed income at a time when life was very difficult in the farming community. I am bound to say that nearly a decade later my reaction is that enough is enough. On some sites they are a desecration of the countryside and an unacceptable visual intrusion, especially when very large wind farms are situated on exposed hillsides and so forth. I entirely agree that there should be very much tighter planning controls with a right of appeal on both sides and that very strict rules should be applied. One must remember just how much pressure local planning committees are subjected to by vested interests in this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para22"></a>There is also unacceptable noise pollution in some places. I know of places in Montgomeryshire where close to the windmills there is virtually no noise, and <P>


<a name="column_386"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>yet half a mile away or even further people complain of incessant noise. The experience in California, where there are very much larger wind farms and turbines, is that as the years go by noise pollution becomes greater and greater.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para23"></a>I also now doubt the whole economic case for these ventures as the main contribution to renewable energy installation. My noble friend Lord Geraint--who because of the limited time will not speak but has left the matter to me--pointed out to me earlier that a hydro-electric scheme was within 100 yards of the nearest wind turbine on a new farm in Cardiganshire. That hydro-electric scheme produces in two hours per day more than all the wind farms in this country. If we are to have anything like 10 per cent. of our energy supplied by wind farms we are looking at an increase of about 40 to 50 per cent. during the next few years.

<A NAME="70213-18_spnew5"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, we must all be agreed on the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is right to look at all forms of non-fossil fuel power generation including wind power. It is important that we should keep abreast of this particular technology and find places where it may be appropriately used. It is good that we now have extensive experience of wind power stations. They are not farms; they are huge industrial installations. Despite their inefficiency and high cost, they are every bit as much power stations as Didcot or Drax.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para25"></a>The question is whether wind power on an industrial scale is the right policy for us, in a crowded island where there are limited areas of sustained high wind speed and where lonely and beautiful landscape is particularly precious. I therefore warmly welcome this timely debate, and am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, for introducing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para26"></a>There are no wind power stations in the diocese of Hereford, but I have been personally involved in two proposed schemes. One is on the Black Hill, in the far west of the diocese, where the long outline of the Black Mountains is famously visible from countless places in the county. The other is on Reeves Hill, where the Shropshire Hills area of outstanding natural beauty meets the edge of Radnorshire. Both are extremely sensitive sites and are visible from a great distance. These proposals caused much anxiety, anger and deep divisions in local communities, fear for the landscape itself, and worry about the highly intrusive noise of wind turbines. As the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, said, that noise can vary enormously. I stood beneath the turbines at Llandinan and heard practically nothing. However, a mile away the noise can be most unpleasant. There was very strong opposition and neither scheme has been carried out. We have been fortunate--others have not.

<A NAME = "70213-18_para27"></a>On Monday afternoon I was returning to Hereford from mid-Wales on the mountain road from Machynlleth to Llanidloes, climbing to over 1,600 feet into a lonely, wild and desolately beautiful landscape. After a stormy day the rain had stopped and a crescent moon appeared between the scudding clouds. I thought of the words of Gerard Manley-Hopkins:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The world is charged with the grandeur of God". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para28"></a>Then I saw them: row upon row of enormous wind turbines, 56 altogether, pale intruders into that elemental landscape, with the relentless movement of the turbine blades, five miles away but very obtrusive. As the road descended to the valley, I saw even more; the horizon fenced in with the 103 Llandinan turbines, strung out along the crest of the ridge for more than three miles.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para29"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, that enough is enough. What we have done to that incomparable landscape is deeply regrettable. How does Hopkins go on?

It must be a rare test for any Member of your Lordships' House to have to make a maiden speech in three minutes--a test he passed with flying colours: it taught me more than has many an eight or nine-minute speech. Those in his diocese are extremely lucky: they can devote a relatively short time to attending his services and can receive considerable enlightenment. We look forward to hearing him frequently.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para31"></a>I declare an interest as chairman of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. I am glad that the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, has introduced this important subject. We need much longer to give proper attention to a subject which is becoming increasingly important. There is no doubt that there is something attractive about wind farms; there is always something attractive about something for nothing. That is the feeling one derives from the use of wind power. Equally, one feels that one is doing a good thing because one is doing something which is non-polluting. Those are attractive features of wind power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para32"></a>However, the use of wind power as a means of fighting the threat of global warming has become an expensive piece of tokenism in two respects. First, the subsidies are not inconsiderable. I understand that well over &#163;150 million of public money has been spent on subsidising wind power, with the prospect of a further &#163;112 million over the next 15 years. Those are considerable sums, but perhaps more to the point is the cost to the environment and the countryside. I am sure <P>


<a name="column_388"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that wind farms are acceptable in many parts of the world but in other parts they are not. In Britain and elsewhere, the beauty of the countryside has been given by God and we have no right to lose it. We must hand it down as beautiful as we found it and therefore we must oppose some such development more rigorously. We need government help to do that through the redrafting of PPG22, which should be made much firmer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para33"></a>In my opinion the real future for non-fossil fuel resources is nuclear power. Provided that we can solve the three problems of the safe reactor, disposal of the waste and eventual decommissioning, nuclear power offers infinitely more opportunity of providing in an environmentally acceptable way the energy which our civilisation needs without intrusion upon our beautiful countryside.

<A NAME="70213-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may first declare an interest, in that six of the 103 wind turbines that make up the Penrhyddlan and Llidiartywaen wind farms in mid-Wales are on my land and I enjoy some economic benefit from that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para34"></a>Wind farms arouse strong emotions; there are those who simply loathe them. There is nothing that can be said in favour of wind farms that is likely to change that view. There is no doubt that, when one is close to wind turbines--say, within five miles--they tend to dominate the landscape. However, I find that many of the arguments used against wind farms by those who have decided that they do not like them are extravagant in the extreme.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para35"></a>There is no doubt that wind farms bring considerable benefits as well as making a worthwhile but small start on reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Our local wind farm was until recently the largest outside North America. It pays around &#163;180,000 a year in rent which is divided between 19 landowners who are mostly working farmers. About &#163;35,000 to &#163;45,000 a year is paid to the council in rates. The maintenance employs eight staff locally and a four-man full-time maintenance crew. It generates enough electricity on average for about 21,600 homes, the approximate number of homes in the old county of Montgomeryshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para36"></a>I spent much of last Saturday among the wind turbines. From there, one can see Hay Bluff, some 50 miles to the south, and Snowdonia, the same to the north. It was possible to see three other wind farms, including Carno, some 10 miles away. As has been mentioned, that has taken over as the largest in terms of generating capacity. But they certainly did not affect the enjoyment of that magnificent view or in any way dominate the scenery. Claims that wind farms destroy beauty and tranquillity even when 20 or 30 miles away remind me of the old Punch cartoon when bathing in the sea became fashionable. When a visitor to a house that overlooked the sea was told that the view was spoiled by the bathers, he protested that they could hardly be seen at that distance. There came the reply, "Ah, but the telescope".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para37"></a>The claim is made that wind farms are noisy. It is certainly true that they make some noise, although in my experience it is of a similar order to the noise of the wind in the trees and in any event, that is being addressed successfully in the new designs, which are even quieter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para38"></a>The claim is made that they are inefficient and need subsidy. But the subsidy required is becoming less as each batch of contracts is let, reducing from about 7 pence per unit four years ago to about 2 pence per unit in the latest round, due mainly to improvements in design and technology.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para39"></a>The recent Carno turbines have twice the capacity, at 600 megawatts, of the turbines constructed four years ago and the capital cost of new installed megawatt capacity continues to fall. Once installed, there is no air pollution, no generation of greenhouse gases and very little running cost. Perhaps most important, they are at no risk of catastrophic failure which might harm the public or the environment, compared with most other forms of power generation, particularly nuclear power. They can be removed almost without trace when their useful life is finished.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para40"></a>However, they must be carefully sited, and kept out of national parks. It would be much better if their siting were part of an overall plan, rather than subject to the present piecemeal planning decisions made on a one-off basis by the present multitude of planning authorities.

<P>
<A NAME="70213-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, I intervene to make two brief points. First, as regards economics, industry reports--and the noble Lord, Lord Davies, confirmed this--suggest that wind energy will be price-competitive by the year 2000. The Government are entitled to take some credit for that because they have successfully jump-started energy renewables. But it has been expensive. I have a figure of &#163;99 million from the Electricity Association for 1995 alone for not very much electricity, and that figure is likely to rise in the future. That should be contrasted with the modest &#163;25 million allocation to the Energy Savings Trust, an amount which is scheduled to fall substantially in the future. Yet energy efficiency schemes have a far better return than wind energy--typically, &#163;5 of benefit for every &#163;1 invested and (and I emphasise this) at no environmental cost. Therefore, there is a strong case for discontinuing the NFFO wind subsidy after round 4.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para41"></a>I turn to my second point; namely, planning issues. That is a big subject and I have time to touch only on the important question of designated areas such as AONBs. The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, dealt with national parks. The Government say that there is no presumption in favour of wind farms in such areas. That is true. But if the words "outstanding natural beauty" are to have any meaning, the presumption should be firmly against those large industrial structures. The Countryside Commission has clearly shown that there is no shortage of other sites. Yet it has shown also that, by 1995, 17 sites with 141 machines were in or adjacent to AONBs. And recently, as my noble friend Lord Tenby said: we have heard of a huge new proposal in County Durham. That is just in AONBs.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para42"></a>Moreover, if the Government's aim of a 10 per cent. contribution to natural electricity supply, which has been referred to already, is to be realised, we are talking of more than 1,000 sites involving 12,000 mega-turbines, each about the size of Big Ben or something like double that if they are the current size of turbine. In landscape terms, that is not acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para43"></a>The Government claim that the advice in PPG22 is "robust". It is not. Moreover, it is quite inconsistent with PPG7, which says that policies and development controlling decisions affecting AONBs should:

<A NAME="70213-18_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, perhaps I may first declare an interest as a vice president of the Council of National Parks. We believe that renewable energy technologies must be as favourable in terms of their location, scale, appearance and sensitivity to local conditions as they are in their method of energy generation. We maintain that there is ample scope for Britain to adopt a more environmentally favourable energy policy which reconciles the interests of those seeking to reduce pollution from conventional fuel sources and those working to protect the purposes for which national parks were designated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para47"></a>The introduction of renewable energies need not be at the expense of protecting the integrity of our finest, wilder landscapes. National parks are designated for the beauty of their landscapes, which are living and working, rather than wilderness, landscapes. Those qualities are eroded by the presence of vertical, man-made features like pylons or wind turbines. It is only too easy to destroy the integrity of a wide, open landscape by the presence of an industrial development, however worthy its purpose in reducing the need for burning more fossil fuels.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para48"></a>In national parks, we are trying to sustain and enhance beautiful landscapes for future generations. There are lessons here for sustainable development of the whole countryside--a role given to national parks in government guidance. National parks set standards for the countryside as a whole and require landscape considerations to be brought centrally on to the sustainable development agenda.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para49"></a>The most fundamental consideration this evening is to avoid the need for those industrial installations in the first place by energy conservation.

<A NAME="70213-18_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Wyatt of Weeford: </B>   My Lords, I have a substantial stake in a family wind farm. It was not started for altruistic reasons; we hoped to make some money from it. But, nevertheless, we are greatly improving the nearby landscape. It is on the Goonhilly Downs on the Lizard and it is in an area of outstanding natural beauty--well, it was not when I was a child because in the First World War the Royal Flying Corps had built enormous barracks, air hangars and God knows what else on the down and we could never afford to remove them after the war was over.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para51"></a>Likewise, in the Second World War the military were at it again, setting up enormous bogus barrage balloons and goodness knows what else to act as decoys for the enemy. Again, we could not afford to put the land straight again. But now we have been able to plant wild flowers all over that area of outstanding natural beauty. We have been able to protect too the tombs of ancient Cornish kings. We have 14 very beautiful, very elegant windmills, and artists are now beginning to come to paint them because they are so attractive. You cannot hear the noise that they make if the wind is blowing hard, and if the wind is not blowing hard you cannot hear any noise either. Therefore, it is a lot of rubbish to talk about the noise that wind farms make.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para52"></a>The wind farm is adjacent to what is called Telstar, not far from where Marconi sent his first radio messages across the Atlantic. To begin with, Telstar rather objected to our windmills, saying that they might disturb the balance of the messages from America. We overcame that and now Telstar includes our wind farm as part of its sightseeing tour. It is very popular. It is now very popular in the district. There were protests originally but now you can see those lovely windmills from Mullion, where we supply the electricity. To begin with, I thought that they might not be very attractive but they are in fact extremely attractive. As they continue to develop they will become smoother and more Rolls-Royce like in their manner and there will certainly be no noise at all anywhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para53"></a>I have heard about gears. There is nothing wrong with them, but I have never heard a gear noise on our wind farm.

What would the reaction be? I suggest that it would be shock, horror and outrage that the beauty of the place that we know and love so well had been desecrated in the pursuit of economy. Those of us who appreciate the beauty and peacefulness of the wide open spaces in the countryside feel just the same emotions when faced with the euphemistically named "wind farms".
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para54"></a>As many noble Lords already know, I come from Wales. As can be seen from the number of Welsh faces in the Chamber this evening among those who are taking part in the debate, it is a question which affects Wales far more than England. Perhaps I may give your Lordships a statistic. The total consumption of electricity in Wales in 1994 was 18 million megawatts. The total generated by all wind power stations in the United Kingdom was just 1.67 megawatts--that is, 1 per cent. of what Wales requires. If we are to produce 10 per cent. by the year 2,000, that is 10 times what we already have. We just do not have enough hillsides.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para55"></a>I should like briefly to address the question of noise. In this modern industrial society we have to accept the intrusion of noise, be it from roads, airports, industrial estates, discotheques or just day-to-day life. We learn to live with much of it and our planners do their best to regulate the levels, but in the countryside the intrusion is much more noticeable. Whereas in a town a specific noise might not be noticeable more than 100 yards or so away, that same noise in the countryside can be heard several miles away. The Welsh Affairs Select Committee in another place recognised the particular circumstances in the countryside and recommended that very stringent noise levels be set up to 1&#189; kilometres from a windmill. Industrial sites are the places for industrial noises; the hills and valleys of Wales are not.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para56"></a>It is self-evident but, nevertheless, worth pointing out that the demand for power comes from the urban and industrial areas of the country. Why not address the problems there? As my noble friend Lord Addison said, investment in energy conservation is the only answer in the long run. Naturally, because it is not in the interests of the generating companies which want to sell more and more electricity, it would have to be funded by central government. But it is the only way that we will be able to leave this earth in good order for the next generation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-18_para57"></a>I know that it is not the right thing to do to acknowledge a maiden speech, except for the speaker who speaks immediately afterwards. However, I, too, <P>

First, this country committed itself at Rio to a sustainable future. The direct and unavoidable consequence of this is that we must learn to live on renewable energy. Dependence on fossil fuels is not sustainable. Nuclear power is not acceptable for reasons outside the scope of tonight's debate but which were largely dealt with in the proviso that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, outlined in his speech. To make ourselves totally dependent on renewable energy would be expensive in conventional economic terms and it will take a long time, but it must be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para0"></a>Secondly, the appearance of the countryside does matter. We shall not be able to preserve it as it is, nor should we wish to. Our countryside is man, as well as God, made and as we move from classical to ecological economics it will reflect that movement. But it is our duty to see that what appeals to most of us as beauty is not unnecessarily marred. Thirdly, the level of decision-making should be local. The people who live near wind farms should have much more say than even the best-intentioned national pressure groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para1"></a>The corollary of all this is that we must have an industry which cares and a planning system which works. I submit that we have both of these, even if the industry cares because it must and the planning system works despite the difficulties sometimes faced in the way of local authorities. The proof of the pudding is that surveys show overwhelming local support by those who live near wind farms. My conclusion and that of my party is that the Government should be putting more money into wind energy, not less. We hope that they will do so.

<a name="column_394"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of this country in the future. We are fortunate in being on the north-west fringe of Europe, having 40 per cent. of the potential wind energy in this country, of which at present we exploit only 1 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para2"></a>It is of course important that wind farms are sited sensitively and that they do not despoil those areas of the country which we have set aside as national parks. However, I find electricity pylons much more offensive, and we have allowed them to march across many of our valley landscapes. It seems that some people are particularly sentimental about hills and they sometimes take less notice of beautiful river valleys which we have already despoiled.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para3"></a>It is important for us to have an overall energy strategy which includes energy saving. It is estimated that 20 per cent. could be saved through better insulation and technology. In that regard, perhaps I may repeat what I said yesterday. It is disgraceful that the Government took &#163;31 million off the home energy efficiency scheme last year. However, part of that strategy should be the use of renewable energy, not just wind farms. We should also be subsidising the exploration of wave power. Tidal energy, of course, creates all sorts of ecological problems for river estuaries and is not necessarily an alternative solution to wind power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para4"></a>Perhaps I may briefly outline what was said in the most recent report in January of the Government's round table on sustainable development. The Government are urged to develop a strategic energy policy which promotes energy efficiency and conservation, incorporates costs relating to climatic factors in energy prices and provides continuing support for non-fossil fuel sources of energy. I believe that we should continue to explore all possible ways of developing non-polluting, non-greenhouse-effect-making sources of energy. I am enthusiastic about wind farms but I feel that they need to be sensitively placed and that local planning arrangements are extremely important.

It was bad luck to have to make a maiden speech in three minutes but he did it with great aplomb and great success. We look forward to hearing from him on many occasions when he will possibly not be restricted to three minutes and will be given a little more licence than he had today.

<A NAME = "70213-19_para6"></a>Wind farms are always a controversial subject. The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, said that he would try to hold the ring between opposing views. I am bound to say that I thought that that was what I was supposed to do. I shall do my best. It is difficult for your Lordships to make speeches in three minutes. I feel slightly privileged in having rather longer than that. I hope that I shall not abuse the privilege. I would add that it sharpens the mind enormously if one has to express one's views in three minutes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para7"></a>The noble Viscount, in his Question, asks to what extent the Government have taken into account the impact of wind farms on the rural environment. It is not for the Government to be, as it were, for or against wind farms. As your Lordships have pointed out only too graphically, there is a variety of views about them and different arguments on both sides. Some people feel that they are a total desecration of the countryside--the view of those with whom I slot the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford--and should not possibly ever be erected. I believe my noble friend Lord Marlesford also falls into that category. He said he would rather have a nuclear power station. I am not sure that that is particularly agreeable. I was slightly surprised to hear the chairman of the Council for the Protection of Rural England say that. However, everyone has his views.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para8"></a>By the nature of things, wind farms tend to be in the country, usually in a quiet setting, which, say their opponents, should not be spoilt by having a whole host of propellers whirling round, although some noble Lords feel that to be peaceful and agreeable. Wind farms are a means of producing a clean, permanent and non-polluting source of power, as has been pointed out. Of course, unlike a coal-fired or nuclear powered station, they can be removed leaving no scars or pollution. They also bring a source of revenue to the countryside. As some noble Lords have said, they have been beneficiaries of that. All that is good.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para9"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, says that wind farms are closing down in the United States. I believe that the picture varies across the world. Many new wind farms are being built, for example in Europe. As regards the Government's policy, we want to stimulate the development of new and renewable energy technologies where they have the prospect of being economically attractive and environmentally acceptable. Therein of course lies progress. That is good, particularly if it contributes to a variety of energy supplies and to a reduction in the emission of pollutants.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para10"></a>One of the most serious problems which faces not just this country but the whole world at present is climate change. Climate change--the raising of the world's temperature--might have a major effect, much of which would be unwelcome, in this country. This morning I went to the Hadley meteorological centre at Bracknell where, with the aid of a &#163;10 million computer, people are trying to predict what the climate will do over the next half century or so. The prediction in a nutshell--one cannot put these things into a nutshell easily--is that the increase in carbon dioxide will result in the climate becoming warmer and the greenhouse effect becoming greater. The problem is how we balance our <P>


<a name="column_396"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>needs for energy, industry and agriculture with the problems which are caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, which are produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Wind farms, of course, produce no carbon dioxide, no sulphur dioxide and no oxides of nitrogen. Therefore they do not contribute either to global warming or to acid rain. Therein they have an advantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para11"></a>There is nothing particularly new about the harnessing of wind for man's purposes. It has gone on for years with windmills helping to grind corn and to lift water. What is new is the type of windmills, the number of them in any location, and their purpose. The Government want to promote the development of wind energy generation but, at the same time, we want to try to conserve the country and the countryside. That involves a delicate balancing act. If one thinks of England, one conjures up pictures of green fields, lush meadows, mooing cows, bustling farms and quiet villages clustered around church spires. That is a countryside worth preserving. In that respect it would have the approval of my noble friend Lord Marlesford. That is part of what we are. However, if the countryside is to be maintained it must be industrious and efficient. It must be more than just something nice to look at. There have to be jobs, homes and workplaces too.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, was right when he said that the countryside is made by God and also by man. There is nothing wrong in that. As there are these difficulties, we have a planning policy. The planning policy is operated through national guidance and through local development plans. The policy is to try to allow appropriate development in the right place which will enable the countryside to thrive without destroying what is unique to it. Last year my department issued for consultation a draft revision of our main planning guidance note on the countryside, Planning Policy Guidance Note 7. It attracted over 400 written responses which we have now analysed. I hope that we shall be able to publish a revised note shortly which will reflect the aims I have just tried to outline.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para13"></a>My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Wales and for Scotland have each issued guidance on renewable energy for their local planning authorities to take into account. For England, this is Planning Policy Guidance Note 22. My noble friend Lord Marlesford said he wanted it redrafted. So too, I think, did the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, and the noble Lord, Lord Chorley. The Government believe that Planning Policy Guidance Note 22--it was produced as recently as 1993--already provides pretty comprehensive and relevant advice on planning and renewable energy but, like all planning policy guidance, the relevance of its advice is kept under continuous review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para14"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, were concerned about the note. In the recent past the Government have amended the environment assessment regulations to include wind farms. Hence planning applications which are likely to have a significant impact on the environment have to be accompanied by an environmental statement. The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, the right reverend Prelate the <P>


<a name="column_397"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 397</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bishop of Hereford and other noble Lords were concerned about noise. Noise produced by wind turbines can be regarded by some people as a nuisance. But noise can be taken into account by local planning authorities when they consider planning applications for wind turbines.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para15"></a>My noble friend Lord Marlesford referred to the non-fossil fuel obligation. Its purpose is to encourage the development of energy which, without that encouragement, might never come about. The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, said that there should be a presumption against wind farms in sensitive areas. If an applicant proposes something which is clearly in conflict with a development plan he will need to produce convincing reasons why the plan should not prevail. Each local authority has to produce a development plan. Planning applications for renewable energy projects have to be determined in accordance with the development plan. Development plans have to recognise that energy which comes from a renewable source can usually be developed only where it occurs. And development plans have to include policies about conserving wildlife and its habitats, and the natural beauty and amenity of the land; improving the physical environment; and taking account of the Government's policy for renewable energy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, referred to energy efficiency. The Government recognise the importance of that. They have for example the energy savings trust and the home energy efficiency scheme. I can assure your Lordships that the planning system does not give any special presumption in favour of the development of wind farms. The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, was concerned about national parks. I can assure her that in areas protected by international and national designation, such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, special considerations apply. The same is true of other areas such as The Broads, areas of archaeological or historic importance, and sites on the coast.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para17"></a>Wind farm developments should be permitted only where they do not have a detrimental effect on the landscape or where they will not cause unnecessary noise or interference. They should not be permitted in areas which are sensitive to wildlife or if they interfere, for example, with the flight paths of migratory birds.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para18"></a>If there were the possibility of an adverse impact on the countryside, the Secretary of State would expect an environmental assessment to be made. The present guidance indicates that a formal environmental assessment should be required where the proposed development exceeds 10 turbines or if the generating capacity exceeds five megawatts. It is possible, though, that an environmental assessment could be required for smaller developments--if, for example, the proposed development were to be in a sensitive location.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para19"></a>Any proposal for a wind farm has to be considered not only in the context of planning policy but also in the context of our policy on renewable energy, our sustainable development strategy, and of the undertakings which we gave at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-19_para20"></a>Planning Policy Guidance Note 22 makes clear that the local authority has to balance the benefits of developing a clean and renewable energy source against any impact which that might have on the environment. There is no evidence that local planning authorities are giving less weight at present to the environmental impact of wind farms than they are to the important contribution they can make to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Each proposal has been, and is, considered on its planning merits. That is quite correct. Our planning system is designed to protect the rural environment but at the same time to enable the development of properly sited, well designed and efficient wind turbines.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 18, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The court shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the offender or his legal representative, obtain and consider a pre-sentence report before forming an opinion as to the existence or otherwise of exceptional circumstances.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 6 standing in my name and in the name of my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for the convenience of the Committee I speak also to Amendments Nos. 19 and 27.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para4"></a>The amendment is straightforward. It is utterly meritorious and doubtless will secure immediate acquiescence from the Government. It deals with the question of exceptional circumstances and upon what basis a sentencing judge should proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para5"></a>Each amendment relates to the introduction on a mandatory basis--if I may use the word "mandatory" without intruding into private grief this evening--of obtaining and considering a pre-sentence report. It is perfectly straightforward. I do not think that anyone present who sentenced an offender in difficult circumstances did not feel the need in most cases for a pre-sentence report. That is the principle underlying the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para6"></a>I say "in most cases" because that explains the presence of the caveat: that if the offender being legally represented, or his legal representative, agrees in writing that a pre-sentence report in some cases may simply not be necessary, that is a saver to the general rule. There are occasions when an offender wishes to know as soon possible what the sentence will be. The delay of some weeks to obtain a pre-sentence report is unnecessary provided that the defendant is legally represented and advised, and the consent is given in writing. We suggest <P>


<a name="column_399"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 399</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that that is a suitable safeguard to a defendant facing a mandatory sentence. That is the principle underlying the amendments. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I question the purpose of the amendment. It seems to be rather unnecessary. As I understand it, the Bill states that the court shall give a life sentence. It is then required to give the tariff order unless it considers that there are exceptional circumstances. The pre-sentence reports with which the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, and I deal relate to character and various other matters. I cannot see that such a report is likely to be necessary on the issue of whether or not there are exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para7"></a>The provision would probably mean that a report would be asked for in every case and the poor defendant would have to wait another week or two deciding what his fate would be. I should have thought, frankly, that the amendment was unnecessary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, would require a court to obtain a pre-sentence report in every case falling to be sentenced under Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill unless the offender or his legal representative agreed that such a report was unnecessary. I believe that the intended purpose of this requirement is to help the court come to an opinion as to whether there are exceptional circumstances which justify not imposing the mandatory sentences provided for in Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para8"></a>However, like my noble friend Lord Carlisle, I see no reason at all why a court should not obtain a pre-sentence report when sentencing under Clauses 1, 2 or 3 of the Bill if it judged that it would be helpful to do so. And, there is nothing in the Bill, or in any other legislation, which would prevent the court from doing so. However, I am not persuaded that it is either necessary or desirable to require the courts to obtain a pre-sentence report in every case in order to determine whether there are exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para9"></a> Courts are not compelled to obtain a pre-sentence report in any other circumstances. Indeed, there is no requirement for a court to obtain a pre-sentence report to ascertain whether there are exceptional circumstances that justify suspending a prison sentence. I see no reason to take a different approach in respect of Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill. I find the suggestion odd that a court should be required to seek the agreement of the offender if it decides not to ask for a pre-sentence report.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para10"></a>Pre-sentence reports may provide information which is relevant to the question of whether there are exceptional circumstances which would justify setting aside the mandatory penalties. But that is not their purpose. The purpose of a pre-sentence report, as set out in the 1991 Criminal Justice Act, is to help the courts to decide such matters as: the seriousness of the offence; the risk posed by the offender and the need to protect the public from further offending; and, in respect of certain community penalties, the suitability of the offender for such a penalty. The information is intended to help the <P>


<a name="column_400"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 400</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>court decide whether custody is the appropriate sentence, how long that custodial sentence should be or the appropriate community penalty.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para11"></a>In practice, it is very likely that any exceptional circumstances will anyway become apparent during the course of the trial or hearing. Obtaining a pre-sentence report may, therefore, be of little value to the court or the offender. A requirement on the court to obtain a report in every case may simply cause unnecessary delay in sentencing which would benefit no one, least of all the defendant.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para12"></a>If the court considers that a pre-sentence report is necessary it can obtain a report. If it does not, the court should not, in my view, be compelled against its judgment to obtain one. The court is best placed to make the judgment as to what information it needs and should not have to seek the consent of the offender to the court's decision. I hope the amendment will not be pressed.

<P>
<A NAME="70213-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, I see all the criticisms that can be made in regard to Amendment No. 19. However, it seems to me that Clause 2 illustrates the total dilemma that could confront a judge in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para13"></a>For example, a youth of 18 who sells an Ecstasy tablet at a street corner commits an offence of Class A drug trafficking. Let us suppose that he has two previous offences, one at the age of 16 and one at age 17, but the police say of him that he is not normally a drug trafficker and that those were casual offences--this is the kind of street corner offence that is often committed in Manchester or parts of London by the casual offender.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para14"></a>As I read this clause, if he is caught in the act, the fact that he is from a deprived area and has a difficult background would not qualify, were it to be in a report, as an exceptional circumstance, because such experience would be common to hundreds of thousands of other offenders. Therefore the learned judge would have no option other than to send him for seven years' custody to one of those universities of crime which the Home Secretary seems so keen to endow these days. I merely seek the Minister's help in this regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para15"></a>Let us contrast such a case with that of the drug dealer who is eventually discovered, with years of crime behind him, and is convicted, possibly at the same court, on six counts and an indictment and they are merely specimen charges covering a period of years. No mandatory sentence can be conferred on him because he has no previous conviction. In the latter case the judge can do his duty--and, thank goodness, I have great faith that British judges would impose the right kind of sentence on him--but what puzzles the judiciary is how the right and just sentence can be imposed on the youth I first described.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para16"></a>The amendment is an attempt to remedy that situation. I do not believe it is a successful attempt. However, does the Minister agree that the circumstances <P>


<a name="column_401"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which I outlined, even though the police might be very anxious to help the young man, could not possibly qualify as "exceptional circumstances"?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am not a lawyer; that must have been pretty obvious as I have operated from the Dispatch Box. However, my understanding is that the defendant and/or the defendant's legal representative would make jolly sure to place before the court all possible pieces of information that could be put before it both to acquit the client and to mitigate any consideration of the kind of sentence that he might receive.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para17"></a>If the client is before the court for a second qualifying offence under Clause 1 or a third qualifying offence under Clauses 2 and 3, a number of things would happen. Either the defendant himself would make known to the court those circumstances which he hoped would be taken into account in coming to a view as to whether "exceptional circumstances" should apply--although we are talking slightly in a vacuum following the amendment passed earlier--or the legal representative would submit to the court information that he or she believed was pertinent and should be taken into account by the trial judge in coming to that view. Alternatively, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the judge, if he believes it helpful to have yet another dimension of the defendant's character added to the body of information that he has as a result of hearing the case, simply calling for a pre-sentence report. In cases where enough information has emerged during the course of the trial, why should such a requirement be placed upon the judge when he believes additional information to be otiose?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-20_para18"></a>That is the only difference between us. As the Minister responsible for the Probation Service, I know how helpful pre-sentence reports can be to the court. But, if a judge decides that he does not need such a report, I do not see why he should be required to call for one.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   The Minister does not quite meet my point. Does she agree that in the theoretical case I outlined there should be a means which would give a judge a discretion with regard to mitigating circumstances? None of the circumstances I outlined seem to me to be "exceptional circumstances". That is what troubles me about this requirement. No distinction is made in this case. The example of a drug offence illustrates the problem that the Government have got themselves into in regard to the mandatory sentence. It does not distinguish in any way between the casual offender and the hard-bitten drug dealer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Whether we are talking about the Bill as it was earlier this afternoon, or as it is now as a result of the amendment, if an offence is a third, or second, qualifying offence--in other words, the likelihood is that, if "exceptional circumstances" does not apply, or under the new amendment "specific circumstances" does not apply either to the offence or the offender--then the defendant, the defendant's representative and the trial judge will know that the <P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>judge has a power under the Bill to consider setting the mandatory sentence aside. Given that, the judge will want all the information that he needs at his fingertips in order to reach a view as to whether the mandatory sentence should be applied, or the mandatory sentence plus whatever sentence he wishes to impose, or whether there is a good case for setting it aside. If he takes the view that it is borderline and that he does not have enough information--that is, there is another aspect of the person's character that can be accessed only by means of a pre-sentence report from a probation officer who has some knowledge of the person--he is entirely free to ask for a pre-sentence report.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para0"></a>The difference between us is whether we should go beyond that and require in every single case, unless there is an agreement that he should not, that a judge, whether he wants it or not, should unnecessarily delay the case by calling for a pre-sentence report.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Perhaps the Minister does not appreciate--I am sure she does--that the pre-sentence report comes from an independent source. She referred to the defence advocate or an unrepresented defendant putting forward circumstances himself which a judge may take with a pinch of salt. Before the judge reaches the point of giving some form of mandatory sentence such as is proposed in the Bill, it is vital that he have that information unless, as the amendment proposes, it is agreed by counsel for the defendant or the defendant himself that he does not want one. So instead of leaving it to the judge to decide, in effect it is left to the defendant to decide whether he feels that a report on him would be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para1"></a>Perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will forgive me if I illustrate the point made by my noble friend Lord Hooson. Last Monday afternoon I appeared in the Chester Crown Court, the court of Sir Robin David, who is an experienced and distinguished judge. As I was waiting for my case to come on, two drugs cases were called, one after the other. The first involved a man who had about 6.5 kilograms of heroin in his car boot when he was stopped on the motorway. That case was adjourned for reports, and I have no doubt that in due course something condign will happen to that person. Chester Crown Court is top of the league for heavy sentencing, and there is likely to be an application to move it elsewhere. The case that followed was of a person who was selling Ecstasy tablets to his friends at a party. The learned judge sentenced the defendant in that case, without a report, to 120 hours' community service. It is a Class A drug; he was trafficking; he pleaded guilty to trafficking. The difference between the two offences is enormous. Yet the same two offences appear as a qualifying offence in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para2"></a>With the greatest respect to the ladies and gentlemen in the Box assisting the Minister, it is the lack of practical knowledge of the courts behind these Home Office proposals as embodied in the Bill, the lack of knowledge of how the Crown Courts work, that makes the Bill so bad. We are not speaking, or at least I am <P>


<a name="column_403"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>not speaking, from on high, condemning from a high position in the judiciary. I speak as a practitioner at the coalface. I know that the Bill will not work.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   On the first example that the noble Lord gave, I am surprised that reports needed to be called for--although it had to be a matter for the judge's discretion--as the defendant had two previous convictions from dealing in Class A drugs and as the haul that he was carrying in the car boot was substantial.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para3"></a>In the second case, the noble Lord did not say whether a pre-sentence report had been called for. I suspect that if there was a community service sentence, the likelihood is that a report would have been called for, if only to discuss with the probation service the nature of the community sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para4"></a>For the second time today I am on the side of the judges because I believe that they are people who can be trusted about whether they have a sufficient body of information coming through the trial hearings, with or without the involvement of the probation service, to make a judgment as to whether they need the one last piece of information--the pre-sentence report.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para5"></a>The difference between us is not that the reports are not helpful, nor that pre-sentence reports do not provide illuminating evidence that has an influence on the judge at the time. I simply say that it should be a matter for the judge. Where the judge blatantly, with all the matters that he has had to consider, decides that he does not need a pre-sentence report and believes that he has all the information necessary for him to come to a judgment about the defendant, why should we, in the terms of this amendment, require him unnecessarily to delay proceedings?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   Is not the answer to the noble Baroness's question that, if you are to impose so serious a sentence as life imprisonment, you should not rely on the judge's hunch as to whether there is some information that could bring the accused inside the class of special circumstances? If you are automatically to impose sentences as horrific as these, then the judge should be provided with all the information which is available and not just the information which he thinks, rightly or wrongly, may still exist. It is as simple as that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   It is indeed as simple as that. The Minister said that she was on the side of the judges. I hope that that will not be fully printed in Hansard because she will be in subversive company these days.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   As the Minister described the nature and function of a pre-sentence report, I became more and more convinced that she was about to accept my amendment because it would deal with such relevant matters as the background of the offender, perhaps the circumstances of the offending and all the basic material that a judge needs.

<A NAME = "70213-21_para6"></a>It is idle to suggest that the stage of the contest in the court at which the prosecution seeks conviction and the defendant seeks acquittal has anything necessarily pertinent to do with the information that the judge needs in the sentencing exercise. As the noble and learned Lord said, if the Bill ever became law, it would impose duties upon judges which they would be able to discharge consonant with their oath only on the fullest possible information. Where is the information to come from?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para7"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, pointed out, assertion by the defence advocate is normally taken with at least two buckets of salt. There is always someone who has offered the defendant a job, starting, strangely, next Monday, on paper not headed, not typed and with a signature which is difficult to decipher. No sensible judge pays any attention to that. What he does pay attention to is an independent, informed view from a non-partisan source; that is to say, the person who produces the pre-sentence report.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para8"></a>The Minister said that the judge will want all the information required. Precisely. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, indicated that without a pre-sentence report, unless one raises one's finger in the air, having first spat on it, one does not know precisely what information may be available. Again the Minister asked a rhetorical question, so nobly I offer the answer. Why should the defendant's consent be required? It is because the defendant is represented and in rare circumstances is advised, after proper legal assistance and advice, that a report will not be needed. That was a commonplace, for example, when a probation order was being considered as an alternative. The judge would ask the defending advocate: "Do you want such-and-such a report or such-and-such other report?". We are dealing with an extremely draconian system which the judges will be obliged loyally to put into effect. The amendment offers them the tools to do the job which the Government seek to impose upon them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para9"></a>I am on the side of the judges and believe that they ought to have every opportunity to sentence justly. I shall not press the amendment, but the point remains. I beg leave to withdraw it.

(" ( ) Where a court has made a statement under subsection (3), Part IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 shall apply to the sentence which has been imposed by the court.").

<A NAME = "70213-21_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: I am becoming recidivist. In speaking to Amendment No. 8, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 21, 29 and 32.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para13"></a>The amendments are based on the necessity and desire that the public should be properly protected against over-lenient sentences. There are gaps in the ability the present Attorney-General has to maintain and launch appeals to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) because of over-lenient sentences. I give one example. It was not very long ago that a fraudster on an enormous scale (many millions of pounds), <P>


<a name="column_405"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Roger Levitt, was sentenced by Mr. Justice Laws for gross defalcations running into many millions of pounds to the condign sentence--to use a phrase that I have heard before this evening--of 100 hours community service. There was not a single member of the public who did not regard that as preposterous. We raised in your Lordships' House the question of whether the Attorney intended to appeal to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). The answer came back, "No, he has no present power in law to do so." We believe that to be a significant gap.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para14"></a>There may be occasions in the new regime--I stress again, if the Bill ever becomes law--when a judge has come to a conclusion which the Attorney, on sensible reflection, after representations from the Crown Prosecution Service, will conclude has been unduly lenient. Therefore the scheme which is variously described in Amendments Nos. 8, 21, 29 and 32 gives power to the Attorney to launch appeals against over-lenient sentences. Therefore, Amendment No. 8:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a court has made a statement under subsection (3), Part IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 shall apply to the sentence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para15"></a>The relevant section in Part IV of the earlier Act is Section 36, which states that, if the Attorney comes to the conclusion
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the sentencing of a person in a proceeding in the Crown Court has been unduly lenient ... he may, with the leave of the Court of Appeal, refer the case to them ... to reviewing the sentencing". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para16"></a>Therefore, Amendment No. 8 is a protection from the public against over-lenient sentencing specifically in the context of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para17"></a>I turn quite shortly to Amendment No. 21, which is in the same category:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Part IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1988"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para18"></a>to which I referred--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall apply to any sentence which is imposed by the court ... whether or not it is the prescribed minimum sentence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para19"></a>Again, that is a protection for the public. The same is true for Amendment No. 29.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para20"></a>Amendment No. 32 concerns a wider point to deal with rogues and criminals such as Mr. Levitt, I believe last seen photographed drinking champagne--I dare say it was a toast to absent friends; namely, those with whom he might reasonably have expected to share a cell, but did not do so. The amendment entitles the Secretary of State to broaden that category of offence which the Attorney may use in circumstances in which sentences have been too lenient.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para21"></a>I cannot see any present rational, sustainable objection to this amendment. Therefore I sit down in the happy and confident belief that the Government will accept it. I beg to move.

Many Members of the Committee have argued that the right way to approach over-lenient sentences is not to impose mandatory sentences in all <P>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances but to give a widened power to the Attorney General to appeal against over-lenient sentences. I understand that to be the purpose of the first three of these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para22"></a>The Attorney General himself was recently reported in an article in, I believe, The Times as saying what a success the power had been, how it had been used effectively and that in 89 per cent. of the cases that he had taken to the Court of Appeal the sentence had been increased. I have no doubt that it will help in raising the level of sentences, of which the Minister has complained, to a level which she believes the public would consider more acceptable, if the Attorney General had the power to appeal against over-lenient sentences in cases such as burglaries. That would give the Court of Appeal the opportunity to lay down an appropriate sentencing policy and a guideline case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-21_para23"></a>I hope that the Minister will realise that this is intended to be a constructive amendment, to meet in part the damage which she believes some of us have done--I do not accept that--to the earlier part of the Bill. It is a constructive attempt to deal with over-lenient sentences. I certainly hope that she will take away the amendment and look at it in the context of the amendment on which the Government was defeated earlier this evening.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   As a layman, I am afraid that I did not understand Amendment No. 8 and the consequential amendments to it until the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, explained them. Now that he has done so, they seem to me to be quite admirable, not least in that they balance the amendment that was rightly carried earlier this afternoon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I agree that these are constructive amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, wins some and loses some, but I must also explain why we do not need the first three of these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para0"></a>The amendments are intended to ensure that the Attorney General may refer to the Court of Appeal any case for which sentence is imposed under Clauses 1, 2 or 3 of the Bill if he thinks that the sentence is unduly lenient or if the mandatory penalty has not been imposed. I entirely agree that the Attorney General should be able to refer such cases to the Court of Appeal. In fact, the Bill provides for that. It may be helpful to the Committee if I explain why and how.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para1"></a>The Attorney General's powers to refer cases to the Court of Appeal are set out in Sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Section 35(3) of the 1988 Act specifies that the Attorney's power applies to any case in which sentence is passed on a person for an offence triable only on indictment. All offences covered by Clause 1 of the Bill are triable only on indictment. Although not all offences covered by Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill would normally be tried only on indictment, we have expressly provided that this should be so when the offence is to be dealt with under those clauses. Clauses 2(4) and 3(4) specify that an offence dealt with under Clauses 2 or 3 shall be triable only on indictment. The effect of Section 35(3) of the 1988 Act is, therefore, <P>


<a name="column_407"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to include all cases dealt with under Clauses 1, 2 or 3 within the scope of the Attorney General's power to refer, whether the sentence imposed is the mandatory minimum sentence or a sentence greater than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para2"></a>To make absolutely certain that any case dealt with under these clauses can be referred, we have also amended Section 36(2) of the 1988 Act. That provides that the Attorney may also refer a case if it appears to him that the judge erred in law as to his powers of sentencing. Paragraph 13 of Schedule 4 of the Bill amends this provision to make clear that the Attorney may also refer a case which is dealt with under Clauses 1, 2 or 3 of the Bill and in which the court has used its discretion not to impose the mandatory minimum sentence required by those clauses. So, if, for example, a third time burglar is given a sentence of two years rather than three years, because the court considers that there are exceptional circumstances, the Attorney General may, if he takes a different view, refer the case to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para3"></a>The amendments proposed by the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh and Lord Williams, would achieve the same outcome as that I have described. I hope therefore that, in the light of my explanation, they feel reassured on those points.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para4"></a>Turning to the proposed new clause, Amendment No. 32, which has also been moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, this would require the Secretary of State to extend, by order, the Attorney General's powers of reference to include all triable either-way offences. As Members of the Committee will be aware, at present these powers are limited to sentences passed in respect of indictable-only offences, together with certain triable either-way offences which have been specified by order.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para5"></a>The Government welcome the current enthusiasm of the Opposition for this power of reference, which was introduced in 1988, despite their opposition at the time. The provision was introduced on the basis that, while sentencing is a matter for the courts and not the prosecutor, we wished to provide a remedy in those serious cases where the sentencing judge erred on the side of leniency to such an extent as to undermine confidence in the administration of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para6"></a>Since the introduction of this measure, we have taken measured steps to extend it. In 1994 it was extended to include sentences passed for offences of indecent assault, threats to kill and cruelty to a child, together with attempts to commit or incite the commission of those offences. These powers of reference were extended again in 1995 to include sentences passed in serious fraud cases, which helps the noble Lord in his reference to the Levitt case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para7"></a>The comments from all sides on this issue illustrate that the present system works well. That is a tribute to the present Attorney-General and Solicitor General and their predecessors. But while I note the noble Lord's concerns to ensure consistency in sentencing, I am afraid that it would just not be practical to widen the Attorney-General's powers in the way proposed by the new clause. In fact, I would go further and say that it would be impossible.
<P>


<a name="column_408"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para8"></a>Both the Attorney-General and the Solicitor General personally have to consider every case. They have to see the papers, read them, consider them and execute a decision if they wish to take the case to the Appeal Court. To extend the powers of referral to include all triable either-way offences would vastly increase the pool of cases subject to those powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para9"></a>Each year the Crown Court sentences in the order of 80,000 offenders. It would therefore not be practical for Law Officers to continue their personal scrutiny of such cases if the powers of reference were to be widened to the extent proposed by the noble Lord. The new clause does not provide for the removal of the Attorney-General's personal role and it is questionable whether that would be wise.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para10"></a>In addition, such an extension of the powers of reference would impact on both the prosecution and the Court of Appeal, leading to delays generally in appeals against both conviction and sentence. Thus the practical effect of the amendment would be to make the present highly effective scheme unworkable. As I said at the outset, we have no difficulty with the principle of the system. We introduced the principle; it is working well and has been responsible for remedying some of the decisions of the courts. But for the practical reasons I have given and also for the inevitable consequence that would arise from accepting the amendment that something would have to be done to remove the personal involvement of the Attorney-General, I hope the amendment will not be pressed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with, as she rightly said, amendments that fall into two categories: Amendments Nos 8, 21 and 29 fall into one category and Amendment No. 32 falls into another. The Minister has now done what we wished to establish; namely, clarified absolutely that the Attorney-General's power in respect of over-lenient sentences in Clauses 1, 2 and 3 will stand.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para11"></a>As the Minister rightly observed, Amendment No. 32 is different. I find it difficult to accept arguments of bureaucratic convenience when one is dealing with the protection of the public. There are undoubtedly some sentences which are over-lenient and which fall into the category of offences triable either way. One looks at the practicalities. I concur with what the Minister says--that the Attorney's or Solicitor's personal involvement is essential. However, everyone knows that in practice a relatively small body of cases are presented to the Attorney and the Solicitor. They are always pre-filtered by the Crown Prosecution Service at a fairly senior level. It is not simply a press campaign of the moment that causes the CPS to put the cases forward to the Attorney.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para12"></a>I am disappointed and saddened that when one is considering matters of public protection and public security, the Government will not agree with a moderate amendment which will allow the Attorney to appeal in cases where sentences are undoubtedly too lenient. But that is the Government's position and the Minister stands firm. We stand firm on the basis of public protection. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("(4A) Where a person is convicted of an offence which falls within subsection (1) above and the conditions mentioned in section 37(2) of the Mental Health Act 1983 are satisfied, the court may if it sees fit conclude that the satisfaction of those conditions constitutes exceptional circumstances which justify it not imposing a life sentence.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 9 is an important amendment and I am grateful therefore to other Members of the Committee who have been kind enough to add their names to it and support me in moving it. The amendment is coupled to Amendments Nos. 22 and 30 and also to consequential amendments in the schedules, Amendments Nos. 111 to 113. However, I intend to direct my comments to Amendment No. 9. I will wait to hear what my noble friend the Minister says when answering--I am happy for my noble friend to reply to all the amendments--before considering whether to move the other amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para15"></a>I said that this is an important amendment because it has been an important feature--I use the word "feature"; I should perhaps use a stronger word; it has been an important principle--of English law and English penal law that when persons have an identifiable psychiatric illness they are not punished; they are treated. That has been a principle of English law for many years. That is what is being attacked--I do not say that in any pejorative sense--by the provisions in Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill relating to mandatory sentences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para16"></a>Perhaps I may explain to the Committee--subject to correction from Members opposite who have more day-to-day experience on these matters than I any longer do--how the Act works at the moment. When I was called to the Bar in 1963 I would deal with the Mental Health Act 1959 and Section 60 offences. The law is now to be found in the Mental Health Act 1983.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para17"></a>What happens is that if on the evidence of two doctors a court decides that a prisoner who has been convicted of an offence has an identifiable psychiatric illness, which is in turn identified in the statute, the court, instead of passing a sentence of imprisonment, can give a hospital order. Furthermore, the court has power, if there is reason to think that the public is in danger from the offender, to place a restriction order on him. The practical effect of that is that a prisoner, instead of going off to gaol, goes to a special hospital. If he is also under a restriction order, it is a hospital that has security to keep its patients within the hospital and its grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para18"></a>Thereafter the sentence is an indeterminate sentence. It is left to well-established procedures that are set out in the Act and subject also to statutory instruments under which the offender remains in the hospital as long as he needs to be treated. The Secretary of State then has power to discharge the hospital and restriction orders. He has different powers when he concludes, on advice, that the patient no longer needs hospital treatment or a restriction order. He can discharge both orders altogether or keep them in being to allow the patient to be released from the hospital. There is also a legal system that can be brought into being, if there are <P>


<a name="column_410"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 410</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grounds for thinking that it is not safe for the public or not in the patient's best interests for him to remain in the open streets, to return him to hospital.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para19"></a>If I summarise the situation correctly, that is the law as it exists at the moment. The difficulty is that the provisions of this Bill attack those principles. They attack them most significantly and most seriously in the application of Clause 1 and the mandatory sentences. The effect is that the court will have no option other than to impose a prison sentence on the accused. At the same time, it can superimpose what is a new order--a hospital direction--under which the accused will be ordered to go to hospital. The assumption is that he will go to a similar hospital as that to which he would have gone under the Mental Health Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para20"></a>As well as the difficulty raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, about doctors now being involved in penal questions--namely, whether the accused should remain in prison or go back to prison--there is a further and serious difficulty that once the hospital order is discharged and the patient is no longer treatable he goes back to prison. He goes back to prison in circumstances in which he still could be suffering from the psychiatric illness which caused him in the first place to be sent to prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para21"></a>There is certain relief in Clause 43, which adds new Sections 45A and 45B to the Mental Health Act 1983, and the provision of a hospital direction. However, the basic difficulty is that the courts can no longer from the very outset identify those offenders who have a psychiatric illness and make a hospital order so that they are treated and not punished for their illness. But they are now being coupled into the penal system. There is a good deal of evidence that that would be highly damaging.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para22"></a>When I made a speech during the debate on Amendment No. 1 several noble Lords came up to me and said--I do not know whether it was a compliment--that I had made a rather passionate speech about government policy and had argued--and I am still willing to argue--that the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, and I were being loyal to the well-established policies of the Government on penal matters. I am happy also to present that argument in moving this amendment. A paper was issued in 1995 by the Home Office and the Department of Health entitled Mentally Disordered Offenders Inter Agency Working Party. In that paper a clear statement was made of government policy:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is government policy that those suffering from mental disorder who require specialist medical treatment or social support should receive it from the health and social services". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para23"></a>The paper went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Detention in prison is likely to be damaging to a mentally disordered person and the prison service is not equipped to provide treatment equivalent to that available in hospital". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-22_para24"></a>I find myself in a troubled position on the Government Back Benches in wishing to support the Government but wishing also that the Government would have consistency in their penal policy. That is why I am moving the amendment. Though I consider it to be a very important amendment, whether it is a matter <P>

<A NAME="70213-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hacking, for moving the amendment and I am happy to stand in support of what he says. In referring to Amendment No. 9, I shall also make general comments about the other amendments in the group.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para0"></a>Despite being happy to support the noble Lord, I feel a little depressed as a psychiatrist to find myself having to address your Lordships when a Bill comes to this stage in the legislative process with little apparent realisation of the different position of those who suffer mental disorders. Much was made at an earlier stage in the debate of the Secretary of State's famous coach and horses. Even at the time when a coach and horses was the mode of transport in general, people took a different view as to how to treat those who were mentally disordered and had offended. Often it is thought in the public mind that those who are mentally disordered are more likely to commit crimes. But that is not so, and it is particularly not so in respect of those who commit crimes against the person. Most of those who are mentally ill are very vulnerable people. They are often very timid people, more keen to stay away from others than to get involved in any fashion, particularly in a violent or disruptive one. But sometimes, through fear or the force of circumstances, they find themselves breaching the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para1"></a>There may be those suffering from mental disorder who knowingly break the law and should suffer appropriate consequences. But there are also those who--we now describe them as suffering from learning disability but they are more generally still described as the mentally handicapped--could hardly be held to have the same level of judgment as others who might commit crimes. There are those, too, who are disordered in their personalities, but very particularly there are those suffering from severe mental illnesses--schizophrenic disorders or manic depressive psychosis--who sometimes are completely misled by their disturbed thinking. It is that which has led to them committing a crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para2"></a> When we are thinking of a crime, we think of the behaviour that brings the person to the court. But we are also always aware of the thoughts, of the wishes, of the motivation and of the feelings that have generated the behaviour that is now before the court. There is always an appreciation, and always has been, that thoughts, motivation and wishes are important in these matters even in the normal course of events; and even more particularly in those whose thinking is disturbed, whose volition or motivation is damaged and whose behaviour is often born out of feelings that bear little relation to external reality and more to disturbed fantasies in their own minds. Yet we find a Bill coming forward which seems to have little to say to those matters except almost in a pejorative sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para3"></a>I find that disturbing because for such a long time there has been an appreciation of these matters in the public mind, particularly when the public reflect more <P>


<a name="column_412"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thoughtfully on them. Sometimes the public have thrust upon professionals responsibility for dealing with these matters. Sometimes the public are keen for doctors, nurses and others to take away these problems and deal with them, not in a penal but a caring fashion. They know that these are difficult matters to judge.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para4"></a>This is not a world of coaches and horses. It is a world of high technology. Computers are now able to be increasingly flexible in their response. We expect computers to be able to respond increasingly flexibly to what is going on. Yet in this Bill we expect humankind to behave less flexibly than we would expect computers to behave. That is extraordinary, particularly when one element of the machine is missing--humanity. There are not only the elements of education, intellect, skills, professionalism and experience that have already been mentioned but the element of humanity in our approach to those who find themselves in these circumstances. There should not only be humanity for the victims but also for those who are mentally disordered. They are themselves victims.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para5"></a>I think it extremely important that the Government think sensitively about all the implications involved. Let us think of some examples. Let us take the case of a young man who is below the age of 16 and is, in the old terminology, mentally handicapped. He lives with a young sister. Sexual exploration leads to the commission of what is clearly a crime. Some years later he finds himself as the butt of abuse, whether in public or elsewhere. He lifts whatever comes to hand and hits someone and injures that person seriously. Yet we are to believe that there is to be no understanding about that person that he would be treated with sympathy alongside the terrorist coming to his second conviction. We may have someone whose mind is completely disordered, who is hearing voices telling him to do this, that or the other. There may be someone who is frequently well, but who sometimes falls victim to a psychotic episode. Unfortunately, these are not exceptional matters. We are talking about 1 per cent. of the population as a whole who at some point suffer from schizophrenic disorder. Many others will suffer from some other psychosis which is either passing or more chronic.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para6"></a>Even for a psychiatrist, it would be a very depressing matter that a Bill should pass from the other place to this Chamber and--worse still--for it to pass from this Chamber to the other place, without recognition that professionalism, experience, understanding and, most importantly, humanity, demand that we understand that those who are mentally disordered in many circumstances require to be considered otherwise than those who have their full faculties. I firmly trust that the Minister will give consideration to these matters.

Perhaps I may make just one comment on the interesting speech of the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice. In view of what he said towards the end of it he should realise that the courts have become familiar with the difficulties of dealing with people who suffer from mental disorder. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>They take medical evidence and they have clear instructions as to what to do from the 1983 Act, which, by the way, is to be added to by the long new Clause 43.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para7"></a>Perhaps I may next refer to the amendment itself because that follows from what the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, was saying. The amendment begins,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a person is convicted of an offence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para8"></a>One cannot convict a person of an offence unless there has been criminal intent, which is mens rea. In many of these cases it will be found that the person is not fit to plead--in other words, he is not fit to stand trial--or in the course of the trial it will be found that he could not have had the intent because of his mental condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para9"></a>The amendment very wisely gives a definition of one of the matters included in the expression "exceptional circumstances". That is quite a useful precaution. I believe that technically my noble friends on the Front Bench will say, "If we start by giving one example of exceptional circumstances, where are we going to stop?". So I have that doubt about the best way of handling the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para10"></a>The alternative way is to leave it to the courts when applying this Bill, after it becomes an Act, to decide whether in any particular case exceptional circumstances arise or whether we should write into the Bill what must be regarded as exceptional circumstances. At the moment I have an open mind about the issue. It is a little dangerous because for the first time the provision creates a specific example of exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para11"></a>I wish to add something which is not universally understood even by lawyers. There is a difference between what is defined in the 1983 Act as one kind of mental disorder, described as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"mental impairment or severe mental impairment", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para12"></a>which, under the name "mental handicap", is most inaccurately described as "suffering from learning disabilities". We all have learning disabilities. I cannot play the piano with more than one finger and I find that a very severe handicap. That must be distinguished from the next kind of mental disorder mentioned, which is mental illness. That includes, incidentally, a psychopathic disorder. Mental illness is very often curable. However, mental handicap is completely incurable. I need not go into the medical reasons for that because the situation is so plain once it is understood.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-23_para13"></a>However, I believe that the wording will have a bearing on this amendment. The courts would be bound to consider that, if a person has mental handicap and simply cannot understand that it was wrong to do what he had done, it would be very difficult to allow the jury to convict. However, people suffering from mental illness may sometimes be people with brilliant minds. Although they may be suffering severely from mental illness they know the difference between right and wrong and they may very well be guilty. That is a another factor that we have to bear in mind. We should be grateful to my noble friend, and I look forward to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>hearing what my noble friend Lady Blatch has to say in answer to this very important matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, is it not the case that this Bill in no way changes the conditions of the 1983 Act by which courts can always say that someone appearing before them needs hospital treatment rather than sentencing?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   That is so. There is nothing in the Bill that prevents that. It is something which I hope and believe my noble friend Lady Blatch will confirm.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970213/text/70213-24.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I was delighted to put my name to this amendment and I am very glad that my noble friend Lord Hacking has moved it. When my noble friend the Minister comes to answer the debate, I hope that she will say that she will take the matter away and give it further consideration before Report stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para0"></a>I understand that mental disorder could not automatically be interpreted as amounting to an exceptional circumstance. Although to do so would be a humane interpretation of "exceptional circumstances", it would, I am advised, be a legally dubious interpretation given that mental disorder among serious offenders is neither uncommon nor exceptional.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para1"></a>I also understand that for someone who is mentally disabled or mentally ill, hospital is much the best place for them rather than prison. They are liable to get worse in prison. There is little in the way of treatment when they need it because the prison service is already over-stretched. If a court orders detention in a hospital, because it is indeterminate it is usually for a longer period than a spell in gaol. At the same time those in hospital are being treated and when they leave they will not be a danger to themselves or to the public generally. If they are incarcerated in gaol their condition is likely to get worse and, when they leave, they will be potentially a greater danger to the public and possibly to themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para2"></a>Therefore, it would be much better if powers were introduced to enable such people to be detained in hospital where they can be properly treated, thus making certain that when they come out they are no danger to anyone. In the long run, that would probably be a great deal cheaper for the country as a whole as well as a great deal fairer into the bargain.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mottistone: </B>   I was not intending to speak until we reached Clause 43. However, I thought that some noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, were somewhat unfair to the Government and to my noble friend in suggesting that they had not taken enormous care to try to deal with the problem within the terms of the Bill. Clause 43 is included in the Bill for just that purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para3"></a>Before we tackled this matter, my noble friend the Minister wrote me a long letter of some four pages which I was able to share with the psychiatrists advising the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, which advises me. Although they were still unhappy in some respects, they said that they were very impressed that the Minister <P>


<a name="column_415"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the Home Office had responded to the discussions that had taken place before the Bill was prepared and that they had gone quite a way towards solving the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para4"></a>I do not propose to say any more now because I am sure that when she replies my noble friend the Minister will be able to explain what has been done and why. I should like to return to the matter when I speak to my amendment to Clause 43 in two or three sittings' time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hacking, on moving the amendment and on the way he developed the argument. Before making one or two brief comments, I should declare an interest. I am a non-executive director of a mental health trust in south-west London called Pathfinder. We have a secure unit as part of the facilities on the hospital site.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para5"></a>I am aware that this group of amendments will apply to only a small proportion of mentally disordered offenders. It is widely accepted that our prisons unfortunately contain too many mentally disordered offenders. One of the difficulties facing our criminal justice and prison systems is how to deal with mentally disordered persons who commit criminal offences. It is not easy. In these amendments we are attempting to find a somewhat better answer than the Government have achieved in the Bill. I accept, of course, that Clause 43 provides us with another opportunity to discuss these issues although the focus is somewhat different.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para6"></a>It is difficult for the prison system to cope with some of the mentally disordered persons within it. If one talks to any prison governor or prison officer, one realises that it is extremely hard for them to provide the right environment for offenders when there are mentally disordered people among them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para7"></a>When a mentally disordered person has completed his or her sentence, we then have to look to the safety of the public. I believe that there are two challenges in this area. The first is by what means we can best protect the public who surely have that right. Secondly, can we do so by also being fair to mentally disordered persons--or some of them at any rate--in that they too are entitled to an element of justice in the way they are treated, albeit that they have offended?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para8"></a>The amendments are a step in the right direction. They provide protection for the public combined with fairness. If an individual who is mentally disordered has served a period of time in prison and is not fully well, it is much more difficult to provide continuity of treatment and supervision following prison than is the case for someone who has been in hospital for some time and is discharged from that hospital or secure unit only when they have recovered to the point when they are not a danger to themselves or to the community. We can manage it better that way, and I believe that these amendments are a move in that direction.

<a name="column_416"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships will be aware, I am the father of a mentally handicapped child. Recently I have received a brief from the Law Society which sees in this Bill the danger that mentally handicapped people will be improperly confined to prison. Thanks to the Government's unfortunate community care policy, many of the long-stay hospitals are still being closed. Therefore, one is dealing with a situation in which more and not fewer mentally handicapped people are being improperly discharged into the community. Another unfortunate policy that is espoused by the Department of Health is that when these people are discharged into the community they should lose contact with the hospitals and the friends that they may have made there. I am president of the National Society for Mentally Handicapped People in Residential Care. That body is losing touch with a number of these people. I do not know who will speak for them if eventually they commit crimes under this Bill. I am also aware that last year the mentally ill, who also perhaps should not be in the community at large, as opposed to the mentally handicapped committed about 100 murders.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para9"></a>This is a very serious situation. I do not want to delay the Committee. I shall listen with great interest to what my noble friend has to say. Like other noble Lords, I will consider Clause 43 with considerable interest.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, perhaps I may add one rather important point that I omitted and do not believe has been mentioned. I am indebted to MIND for drawing attention to this matter. The experience of MIND is that people can wait in prison for a long time before they are transferred to hospitals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This is an issue that we take very seriously indeed. It is an extremely important subject. It is right that while we discuss this Bill we should also discuss this issue. Therefore, these amendments give us a valuable opportunity to do that. The amendments would have the effect of upsetting the balance that the Bill provides between the need to ensure that the public are protected from repeat offending and the need to enable effective medical treatment to be given to mentally disordered offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para10"></a>Amendment No. 9 to Clause 1 and the two associated amendments to Schedule 4 would enable the courts to regard evidence of mental disorder as a reason itself for not applying the automatic life sentence provided by Clause 1. The life sentence is needed to protect the public from further repetition of the most serious sexual and violent offences and to ensure that people who have a history of committing such offences repeatedly, for whatever reason, receive supervision for life. A disposal under the mental health legislation cannot achieve that. It would frustrate the purpose of the mandatory sentence in protecting the public if evidence of mental disorder could be regarded in itself as an exceptional circumstance enabling the life sentence to be avoided.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para11"></a>My noble friend may be concerned to ensure that mentally disordered offenders who are sentenced under this provision can receive treatment for their disorder. That can be achieved by way of the hospital direction <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>power under Clause 43. Initially, that will be available only for psychopathically disordered people, but there is provision to extend its scope to all categories. Until that happens these people can be transferred to hospital by the Home Secretary if doctors recommend it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para12"></a>I have noted the point that my noble friend Lord Renton has made. I will investigate it and come back to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para13"></a>Amendments Nos. 20 and 30 to Clauses 2 and 3 are similarly intended to enable the courts to regard evidence of mental disorder as a reason for not applying the mandatory penalties provided for in these clauses. However, when sentencing under Clauses 2 and 3, the Bill already provides for a court to retain the power to make a hospital order as an alternative to the mandatory sentence, so there is no need for a mental disorder to be regarded as an exceptional circumstance in those cases if a hospital disposal appears to the court to be the most appropriate sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para14"></a>The effect of my noble friend's final amendment to Schedule 4 would be to enable the courts to substitute a guardianship order under the Mental Health Act 1983 for the mandatory sentences provided by Clauses 1 to 3. A guardianship order is a provision that is intended to ensure that vulnerable people receive care and support. It is in no way a custodial disposal, nor one that provides any sanction whatever for repeated criminal behaviour. A guardianship order would be entirely inadequate to provide the public with the protection from further repetition of serious and distressing crimes by a person who may continue to present a risk with which mandatory sentences are intended to deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para15"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, felt aggrieved that there has not been sufficient discussion about the matter. I am deeply grateful to my noble friend Lord Mottistone, who knows that there has been a great deal of activity on these matters within my department, the Department of Health and outside bodies. As long ago as our preparations for the White Paper, Protecting the Public, and within the White Paper, we flagged up the issue of mentally disordered offenders. That was followed up by yet another document which went out for special consultation entitled, Mentally Disordered Offenders: Sentencing and Discharge Arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para16"></a>We carefully considered the comments made by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and others. The proposals included in the Bill relating to the sentencing of mentally disordered offenders have been the subject of lengthy debate during the past year and longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para17"></a>The automatic sentence in Clause 1 does not prevent a mentally disordered offender from receiving treatment in hospital. The court may impose a hospital direction order under Clause 43 if the offender is psychopathically disordered. As I said, we have plans to extend that provision. The court may also recommend that the Secretary of State transfers the offender to hospital under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para18"></a>It might be helpful if I set out the flexibility that is available under Clauses 1, 2 and 3, because it is important to point out that, as a result of the added <P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>flexibility, courts will no longer have to make the choice between prison or hospital; a hybrid order is available to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para19"></a>Under Clause 1, if the offence is a second serious sexual and/or violent offence, the court must pass a life sentence. It may add a hospital direction order under Clause 43, but initially only if the defendant is psychopathically disordered. The court may also recommend that the Home Secretary transfers the offender to hospital under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Only if the court has accepted other exceptional circumstances for not passing a life sentence can it make a hospital order under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para20"></a>If a conviction is arrived at by the court, some degree of culpability has been established in court. It is important to point out that, if an offender was found to have been insane at the time of the offence, that can be dealt with under the insanity legislation and irrespective of Clauses 1 to 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para21"></a>Under Clauses 2 and 3, the court may make a hospital order under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Again, that does not rely on there having to be an exceptional circumstance. It is provided for by Schedule 4, paragraph 12(2). The court may also pass the mandatory sentence and add a hospital direction order under Clause 43. The court may also pass the mandatory sentence and recommend that the Home Secretary makes a transfer to hospital order under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The courts may also simply pass a prison sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-24_para22"></a>My noble friend Lord Renton rightly brought to the Committee's attention the vast range of mental disorders. The possibilities can range from someone who has committed an offence for which he was wholly responsible and who understood the criminal intent of his actions to someone who was not culpable because of his state of mind at the time. There is everything in between--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   I did not refer to Clause 43, but the Minister has done so. I trust that I did not give the impression that she and her colleagues had not considered the question of the mentally ill but had not, in my view, given due recognition to the problems thereof.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para0"></a>Perhaps I may deal with Clause 43. It suggests that, if someone is mentally ill and that mental illness has had a part to play in the commission of the offence, he might go to a hospital for treatment. The psychiatrist would then be in a position of having to judge when his patient is well enough to go to prison. How is that likely to help the relationship between the psychiatrist and the patient? The psychiatrist is supposed to decide, "Now I think you are well enough, you can go to prison". Of course, there is then a positive incentive for the patient, if he becomes mentally well enough to know what is going on, to continue to be as poorly as possible in order to continue in that situation. Thus, he will block a bed, continue to be unwell and ensure that the psychiatrist is not in a position to take in someone who is languishing in prison because there are no beds <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>available. With due respect to the noble Lord who spoke on those matters, those concerns are causing profound unhappiness to the Royal College of Psychiatrists and to others who are dealing with them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para1"></a>I refer to Clause 43 because the Minister has raised the matter. The way of dealing with this issue has intruded into the care of the mentally ill. In the past, it was felt that when folk were that disturbed, that was punishment enough indeed in the situation and the best thing to do was get them well, because the safety of society was more likely to be achieved if they were well when returning to society than if they went to prison, where they would not be so well looked after, and then came out into the community.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I do not wish to detract from the seriousness of the points made by the noble Lord because they are very important. But there are two distinct issues here. The first is that offences have been committed, arrests have been made and somebody has been brought before the courts. On the one hand, we are talking about the powers of the court to deal with a difficult situation where mental health may be a contributory factor or a condition which would either mitigate against the type of sentence passed by the court or may be a mitigating circumstance in terms of how the case was considered in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para2"></a>Then there is the other side of the coin, which is not a matter for this Bill but is certainly a matter for the Government to consider and to deal with other departments and agencies; that is, the management of mentally ill people in that process from the point of committing the crime. It is important that when the court hears the case it is made aware of all the circumstances surrounding the case, including the mental condition of the defendant who is before the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para3"></a>What we have done, and why Clause 43 is relevant as regards the range of options made available to the court, is moved away from the court having to make either/or decisions as to prison or hospital. We have given the courts flexibility to choose a hybrid provision which recognises some degree of culpability for the crime but which either sets it aside completely in the case of Clauses 2 and 3 in order to make a hospital order or passes a prison sentence with a direction to a hospital. I do not wish to confuse the two issues. It is very important for the courts to have that flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para4"></a>Reference was made to the degree to which someone is kept waiting to be moved as a result of a direction and the degree to which the prison service look after people when they have been released from the hospital. In our prison system, if somebody is still a risk to the community but all medical efforts which can be made have been made and the hospitals say, "We can do no more", or "We have completed the treatment", then people are released who are known to be a risk to the community. One of the reasons for the provision in Clause 1 is to make sure that that person is not released into the community without a proper assessment of risk. Now there will be a risk assessment. If they pass that risk assessment, they move into the community. If they do not, provision must be made for them. That provision <P>


<a name="column_420"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may be in the form of a hospital or a prison cell. We are giving that flexibility to the courts. That is what we are talking about here rather than the very important issues of managing people with mental disorder through that process and beyond.

<A NAME="70213-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   I listened with great care to the points raised and am most grateful to all Members of the Committee who participated in the debate. Although I should have preferred my noble friend the Minister to have little more of an open mind on the issues raised, it does not seem to be appropriate at this stage in our deliberations to attempt to divide the Committee. Therefore, I do not propose to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para5"></a>I believe that this matter needs further consideration. It goes to the heart of some very fundamental issues. At the end of the day, or perhaps I should say in the final analysis, the way that the Bill will impact upon the Mental Health Act 1983 means that mentally disordered persons will find themselves fully culpable legally and responsible for their actions by the imposition of life sentences upon them. That is a very serious matter. While there are certain reliefs to be found in the somewhat complicated further sections which are to be added to the Mental Health Act 1983 under Clause 43, it seems to me that that basic difficulty exists.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para6"></a>I did not address the Committee on my other two amendments. However, as my noble friend the Minister kindly commented upon them, I should like to point out that the effect of Clauses 2 and 3 and their relationship with the Mental Health Act is that the courts will not have the same freedom to deal with those who, in one form or another, are mentally ill. I should stress that I encompass in that expression those who may be mentally handicapped or who suffer from mental disorders. I say that because it will not be possible to use the guardianship orders nor, indeed, to use the psychiatric probation orders.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para7"></a>For all those reasons, and also because of the importance of the issue, I should be most grateful if my noble friend the Minister would agree further to consider the matter. During the course of the debate, my noble friend Lord Mottistone very kindly gave me a very long letter which my noble friend had written to him and which I have not had time to study. I, for my part, will certainly read most carefully what my noble friend the Minister has said and I shall also read with great care the detailed letter given to me by my noble friend Lord Mottistone. I shall consider all the issues, as I am sure will other Members of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para8"></a>We shall certainly remember the points made by my noble friend Lord Renton. It would be indeed a day of accolades were I to move an amendment with which my noble friend Lord Renton did not find technical deficiencies. I am very happy to take on board the criticisms that he made. However, the noble Lord talked about convictions. I should point out to him that my amendment would be activated only on conviction, which is exactly how Section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 works. Therefore, my amendment was at least consistent in that respect. Nevertheless, it does not mean <P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The above amendment seeks, if I may so put it, to rearrange the tartan fringe to the Bill. With the leave of the Committee, I shall mention also Amendment No. 15, for reasons that I shall explain. The purpose of Amendment No. 14 is to clarify the way in which the automatic life sentence provisions in Clause 1 will operate in respect of offenders whose first conviction is in the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para15"></a>Clause 1 provides that a person, aged 18 or over, is eligible for an automatic life sentence if he or she is convicted of a serious offence and had been convicted previously in any part of the United Kingdom of another serious offence. The Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill, which had its Second Reading in this Chamber earlier this week, contains similar provisions which are <P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be included in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. It is our intention that a conviction that qualifies an offender for an automatic life sentence in Scotland should also qualify an offender for an automatic life sentence in England and Wales. The reverse is also proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para16"></a>As presently drafted, Clause 1 of the Bill does not fully meet the Government's intention. In particular, it does not make clear that only convictions for relevant offences on indictment in the Scottish High Court of Justiciary are qualifying convictions for the automatic life sentence. This is inconsistent with the automatic life sentence provisions in the Scottish Bill. The Government are most grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, for drawing attention to this during the Second Reading debate of this Bill. This amendment seeks to correct this inconsistency and also lists on the face of the Bill the relevant Scottish offences to make sure that the Scottish element is fully understood by all those who may have to work with this Bill in England.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-25_para17"></a>This amendment has been discussed with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. He has authorised us to say that this fully meets the point he sought to raise at Second Reading. He also authorised us to say that had he been present he would not have insisted on his own amendment. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="70213-26_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I am fully aware that I am on dangerous ground. But, having read what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, said in his Second Reading speech on this Crime (Sentences) Bill for England and on the Scottish equivalent Bill, I should like to suggest that a new schedule is inserted into this Bill giving in two columns a comparison of the qualifying offences on both sides of the Border. My idea is designed to give judges a comparison between the different meanings and expressions used in the English and Scottish courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para0"></a>The Scottish Bill introduces in Clause 1 a new Schedule 5A into the 1995 Scottish Act. However, there is not a comparative schedule in this English Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para1"></a>If there are differences in what is a qualifying offence in Wales or Northern Ireland, then there would need to be a third or fourth column in the comparative schedule that I put forward, such as is mentioned in subsection (7)(c) which brings in S.I. 1981/155(N.1.2), which is not mentioned in the Scottish Bill. I refer to the margin note on page 2 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para2"></a>On Amendment No. 15, as I understand the position, the procurator fiscal decides whether a case goes to the High Court or the sheriff court. I do not think there is an equivalent officer in English law. Again I fully realise I am on dangerous ground. However, I felt there is such a difference that there should be a comparison put into the English and Scots legislation to cover the points I have raised; otherwise, I am all for supporting the Government's amendment as it stands.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>part of the amendment. Having given that undertaking, I hope that it will be possible for the amendment to be agreed to.

<A NAME = "70213-26_para4"></a>[Amendment No. 15 not moved.]
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 1, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   A few days ago I received out of the blue a most courteous apology from Mr. Tam Dalyell. In an admirable obituary concerning Lord Bancroft, he referred in passing to the support given in recent debates by myself and my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale. He made the no doubt Freudian error of referring to us both as "war Lords". Such is the price of diffidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para6"></a>I concede that at an early stage, although not before the Home Secretary's proposals had been roundly condemned by the then Lord Chief Justice, my noble and leaned friend Lord Taylor of Gosforth, I criticised mandatory life sentences perhaps not in the timid and deferential terms that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit would have wished. I was, however, in good company since the Government's own White Paper of 1990 made it clear that courts would continue to have the wide discretion they needed,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to deal justly with the great variety of crimes which come before them". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para7"></a>I emphasise the word "justly" because it is my respectful submission that one thing this Bill will prevent is just sentencing. In the White Paper the Government rejected in terms a rigid statutory framework on the lines of that introduced in the United States or a system of mandatory or minimum sentences for certain offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para8"></a>The White Paper gave as its reasons for such rejection that it would make it more difficult to sentence justly in the exceptional cases. Hence the proposition which I ventured to put before the Committee a few seconds ago about justice is supported by the Government. The White Paper went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Of course it could also result in more acquittals by juries with more guilty men and women going free unjustly as a result". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para9"></a>Again, there is reference to justice, or the lack of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para10"></a>However, my other submission is that not only will the Bill do injustices; it will detract rather than promote the safety of the public. Why should mandatory minimum sentences, or mandatory life sentences, make more guilty men and women go free as a result? Members of the Committee have already been told the reasons. I mention them as briefly as I can. There will be more pleas of not guilty when there should be guilty pleas. The heavy onus which lies on the prosecution will inevitably result in some cases which should have been the subject matter of a conviction being acquittals and thus a guilty man or woman would go free.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para11"></a>Secondly, there will be a positive reluctance by juries to convict when they know what will be the consequences of conviction. It is not difficult for an accused person, through his counsel, to make sure that the jury know what will be the consequences of their <P>


<a name="column_424"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 424</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conviction. One can hear counsel say: "Would my client, conscious that a life sentence could result from his acting as is alleged, take that risk?". Then there is the refusal or failure of witnesses to come up to proof because they know the consequences, particularly where the witnesses are close relatives or otherwise closely connected with the victim.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para12"></a>I shall not take these matters further. It is late, and the Committee has heard references to them. References have been made to plea bargains, to unrealistic pleas being accepted in order to achieve at least a conviction. We have heard how that will move the discretion of the judges to the prosecution or the defence and the bargains that they will make.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para13"></a>Noble Lords will no doubt recall the strength of the condemnation by the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, in a debate that he instituted on 23rd May on the Government's 1996 White Paper which forms the basis of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Turning to the White Paper, I venture to suggest that never in the history of our criminal law have such far-reaching proposals been put forward on the strength of such flimsy and dubious evidence. The shallow and untested figures in the White Paper do not describe fairly the problems the Government seek to address. Still less do they justify the radical solutions it proposes".--[Official Report, 23/5/96; col. 1025.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para15"></a>As recently as 27th January, at Second Reading, my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, the Lord Chief Justice, in a devastating attack, said that each of the proposals--that is, the mandatory life sentences, the minimum sentences and the abolition of parole--had to be tested by asking four questions:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Will it be just? Will it serve to reduce levels of crime or increase the protection of society? Will it be cost effective? Will it work in practice?". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para16"></a>He continued:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I feel bound to tell your Lordships that in my judgment these measures conspicuously fail to pass all four of those tests".--[Official Report, 27/1/97; col. 984.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para17"></a>At the outset of his speech, my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If this Bill is implemented, it is my fear that it will prove to be an extremely expensive way of making the criminal justice system worse".--[Official Report, 27/1/97; cols. 996-997.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para18"></a>It would be difficult to find legislation that has been so consistently referred to as bad in principle and bad in practice. I accept that there is no question but that the White Paper and the Bill have identified a problem in the inadequacy of the existing law to deal with potentially dangerous offenders who currently must be released at the end of their determinate sentences irrespective of whether or not they still pose a danger to society. That has been accepted right from the start. However, my submission is that the proposed solution is wholly unsound.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para19"></a>As Dr. David Thomas QC, a lecturer at Cambridge and the editor of the essential encyclopaedia, so to speak, on sentencing, in an article in Current Sentencing Practice News on 9th May pointed out:
<P>


<a name="column_425"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 425</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Much better ideas have been put forward and in some cases enacted. The Butler Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders identified the same problem twenty years ago. Its solution--a review of sentences--has been ignored by successive Home Secretaries". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para20"></a>He accepted that it would need some re-thinking to take account of developments in the intervening period, but it would provide a better starting point than these proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para21"></a>As I pointed out, the Canadian criminal code contains dangerous offenders provisions which are far more sophisticated than the crude device which the Government propose. Legislation of a similar kind enacted in Victoria in 1993 could prove a starting point. I accept that none of the schemes is perfect. But, as Dr. Thomas said, they begin by addressing the problem of the dangerous offender in an intelligent manner, avoiding the mistake of making the availability of the sentence depend on conviction of one of a narrow range of offences and including provisions designed to avoid the application of the sentence in cases where the offender is not dangerous.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para22"></a>There has been reference to the extent to which the prison population will be increased well beyond the estimates given by the Home Secretary. I think those estimates are highly suspect. His belief that the legislation will act as a deterrent and enable him to discount an increase by some 20 per cent. has no sound basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para23"></a>One point has probably not featured as firmly as it might--the reaction of the judges. I indicated my belief that the judges have grown sick and tired of being first of all the subject of complaint that they have sentenced excessively. That was the impact of the complaints in 1990, with strong media criticism. As a result, their discretionary powers were removed, despite it being pointed out that that would be disastrous and that they would have to be restored, as they were, not many months later. Now the complaint is that they are too soft, that they do not sentence with enough vigour. That is all in the space of a few years when imprisonment has increased by 50 per cent. from approximately 40,000 prisoners to 60,000. Accordingly, this rag-bag of suggestions has been provided.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para24"></a>The judges are expected to reduce the sentences which they would now impose by some two-thirds. The sentences that they impose now are sentences in every sense of the word. Half the sentence--up to four years--is served in prison. The other half is served at liberty but one quarter of it in circumstances of strict supervision and strict conditions, with the liability to recall, and the remaining quarter at risk of having to return if there are subsequent offences. That is all designed not out of softness but to try to achieve the end of criminal behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para25"></a>What the Bill does is to ensure that the available expenditure is directed to more and more prisoners. The ability to do something constructive in prison, the hope of training and fitting the prisoner for a sound subsequent existence cannot be provided to the extent it should.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para26"></a>I return to the judges and their reactions. It is said that they are expected to give two thirds of the sentence that they would have imposed. There is not a <P>


<a name="column_426"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specifically right sentence for a given offence--four, five or six years. Heaven knows what will happen to sentencing guidelines if this legislation goes through, but what there is at the moment is a bracket. For a given offence, say rape--an ordinary rape without circumstances which direct a considerable increase in the usual tariff--the bracket may be six years to eight years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para27"></a>I believe that the judges, in order to ensure that they are not castigated for being soft on crime (albeit at the instance of the Government and the legislation, which will provide in fact no such protection) will provide for the two thirds at the top of the bracket. Providing the two thirds at the top of the bracket will mean that instead of the rape sentence being brought down, as the Government would like, to four years, it will be six years, the top of the bracket having taken off the two thirds. Accordingly, the population in prison will go up and up. The expenditure on prisons will mean that the expenditure on means to keep people out of prison or keep them from returning to prison will be heavily curtailed. As a result, the so-called "protection of the public", which the Bill is so ill designed to achieve, will be wholly frustrated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para28"></a>A little over a year ago, in the debate on the Address on 20th November 1995, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, expressed the view that, if the Home Secretary's proposals came before this Chamber, they would not be accepted. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Even if a whipped majority in another place insisted on them, I do not believe that they would survive the considered view of your Lordships".--[Official Report, 20/11/95; col. 215.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para29"></a>I trust that the noble Lord will not be disappointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-26_para30"></a>This is a bad Bill and has been repeatedly so described in your Lordships' House. So far as this clause is concerned, I ask the Committee to say that it will have none of it. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I realise the lateness of the hour and apologise to the Committee for rising at this time. I appreciate in particular that my noble friend the Minister has been in this Chamber since three o'clock. However, I do not feel it possible to allow Clause 1 to go past without saying a few words about my concern with regard to some of its proposals. I shall attempt not to repeat what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, said, other than to say that I hope the Minister will take great thought about what he said at the end of his speech about the likely effects on the size of the prison population caused in particular by Part II of the Bill, which we shall debate next week.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para0"></a>I feel that there is a genuine problem in Clause 1, which the Home Office has recognised and faced; but it has taken an unnecessarily complicated way to try to deal with it. Clearly one must accept that there is a concern, which the Minister has expressed on many occasions, that people serving determinate sentences are released back into society when it is still felt that they are a danger. That is an anxiety we can all understand and share. But is the method of dealing with that problem enormously to increase the number of <P>


<a name="column_427"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determinate life sentences which should be passed, in many cases where the criteria of risk cannot possibly apply?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para1"></a>As I understand it, in all these cases the court will be asked to pass a sentence of life imprisonment on the second conviction: not a second conviction for rape or anything of that nature, but a second conviction for one of the offences that fall within this group. The court must then state the tariff. I will be grateful if the Minister will give thought to this point. The tariff is not a sentence. Presumably, therefore, if the judge says, "You will go to prison for life; I recommend that you stay there for three years", that three years is the minimum period the defendant has to serve.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para2"></a>Since the tariff is not a sentence, various clauses that deal with obtaining remission for good behaviour do not apply to that minimum period. That being so, what incentive is there for that individual to behave while in prison? What thought has been given by the Home Office to a substantial increase of potentially dangerous people in prison when, no matter how they behave, their sentences cannot be reduced?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para3"></a>The other matter about which I should like to ask the Minister is this. If it be right that of the 207 cases identified in 1994 to which this clause would apply, only 10 received life sentences, what is the logic which says that we should require the rest to receive life sentences in future? That is particularly illogical when the White Paper itself does not criticise the length of sentence passed in those cases. I suggest that we are posing a real problem for the prison service; we are posing problems for the courts--the release of those with determinate sentences who still remain a danger and who could be dealt with more effectively, for instance, by reference to the Butler Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para4"></a>Finally--because of the lateness of the hour I will limit my remarks to this--has the Minister seen the research being carried out by Dr. Roger Hood? If so, what is the attitude of the Home Office towards it? That research shows that this Bill, if passed, would affect only 10 per cent. of those about whom the Government claim to be concerned; namely, those who may be being released at the end of their sentences while still posing a danger to society. As I understand it, that figure was worked out on the basis of those who had been refused parole.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para5"></a>If it be right that 90 per cent. of those who are at risk of committing further offences do not come within the ambit of Clause 1--either because they are first-time rapists or because they have been convicted of offences against children which do not amount to rape and do not come within the ambit of this Bill--would it not be sensible to find some method such as that recommended by Lord Butler for dealing with cases in general which fall within that criterion, rather than taking a sledgehammer approach which will lead to many people receiving life sentences where in normal circumstances that would not be justified?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para6"></a>I apologise for raising these matters at this hour of the evening. But this clause has not been fully thought through. It is fraught with problems for the future. I urge <P>


<a name="column_428"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister to consider whether it is possible to find an agreed solution for what is, I am sure, a recognised problem.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   Perhaps I may preface my remarks by saying that this is one of strangest Committee stages I have ever attended. Here we are discussing a major Bill which will have profound effects upon our criminal justice system and which, justifiably or unjustifiably, will have a major effect upon our civil liberties, and yet for the past two hours there have been no more than 20 or 25 noble Lords in the Committee; and it is not actually particularly late. There is no need for the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, to apologise for speaking at this late hour, because it is not by historical standards a particularly late hour. This must have something to do with the impending general election and the consequent end of term feeling. But it is very worrying all the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para7"></a>As a layman, it seems to me that Clause 1 is the most important clause in the Bill, providing, as it does, for life imprisonment for a second but quite possibly totally unrelated so called serious offence. I say "so called" because, although many of the offences are indeed serious, some are not, by any normal standards. And not all, of course, are intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para8"></a>I give, as an example, manslaughter. Let us suppose that a respectable train driver, married with two children, having worked for whatever company succeeds British Rail for 25 years and who committed as a teenager an offence involving violence, foolishly one day takes his eyes off the track, goes through a red signal, crashes into the back of another train and kills a passenger. He will quite possibly be tried and convicted of manslaughter. Is it really necessary to sentence him to life imprisonment? Does he really pose a danger to the public?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para9"></a>What about rape? We all know that there are degrees of rape that vary enormously in their heinousness and effect upon the victim. On the one hand there is the terrible incident of the three men who broke into the vicar's house and raped and did other terrible things to his daughter. In my opinion, the sentences passed in that case were totally inadequate. They should have been at least double what they were, if not longer. On the other hand, there is the kind of case which the noble Earl, Lord Russell, knows all about, where a very young university student was invited into bed by a young woman who then changed her mind literally at the eleventh hour. In the event, he was acquitted, but he might very well not have been acquitted, and he too might be subject to being sentenced to life imprisonment for a second offence of any kind or description.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para10"></a>We note also that attempted rape is included. There are enormously varying degrees of attempted rape. Some are extremely serious and involve great physical assault and terror on the part of the victim. On the other hand, at the farcical extreme there is the case of Mr. Angus Diggle, where no physical harm was caused and, as both parties were totally drunk, there was hardly any mental distress either. Yet the same law will apply to this great range--in terms of heinousness--of cases.
<P>


<a name="column_429"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para11"></a>Even if life only means 18 months or two years, what effect will it have in practice? How will a person sentenced to life imprisonment but released after 18 months be able to get a decent job and hold it down? Will he be able to get a mortgage? Will he be able to get a passport? Some countries will not allow people in with that kind of thing hanging over them. Some people say that it is tough luck and that it does not matter. I think it does matter. If we want people to reform and go steady, we have to give them a chance to have a decent job. With life imprisonment being there in the background--undeservedly in some cases (but not all: in some cases it will be fully merited)--I do not see how it can be justified.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bingham of Cornhill: </B>   Whether it is late at night or not, perhaps I may invite the Minister's attention to one situation which, although hypothetical, is one that I think is by no means unrealistic. It is directly related to Clause 1 of the Bill. Let us suppose that a defendant is convicted of a second qualifying Clause 1 offence and is therefore, on the face of it, liable to an automatic life sentence. Two psychiatric consultants of unimpeachable reputation, approved by the Secretary of State, examine the defendant in depth and go into the witness box and express the opinion that in their judgment the defendant does not present a continuing danger to the public, although of course he should be punished for his second offence. The Crown calls no evidence to challenge that opinion and indeed accepts it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para12"></a>Does the Minister suggest that in that situation the judge should be required to pass a life sentence? If so, does she suggest that that result would be just and that it would serve any public interest to sentence such a defendant to life imprisonment? If her answer is that a judge would not have to impose a life sentence in such a situation, what does the clause achieve, because in appropriate cases a life sentence can be imposed now and, if it is not when it should be, the Attorney-General can come to the court and ask for the substitution of such a sentence?
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-27_para13"></a>I described this case as hypothetical, but I also venture to suggest that it is realistic because, as Dr. Hood's evidence shows, most of those who would become subject in theory to the automatic life sentence provided by Clause 1 would not present a continuing danger to the public. Therefore, they would be in a position to call evidence of this kind, which is the very sort of evidence that the Parole Board relies on when it makes its judgment that a prisoner can be safely released. I am sorry to burden the Minister with a question of that kind, whether late in the evening or not, but it is an important question and it goes to the root of Clause 1 of the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in his Conservative Party Conference speech in 1995 to which I was referring was wholly unacceptable in the sense that there was no judicial discretion of any kind proposed. As I have said, the White Paper moved, the Bill moved and now this Chamber in Committee today has moved still further--more perhaps, I acknowledge, on Clauses 2 and 3 than on Clause 1, but nevertheless it has moved.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para0"></a>I have proclaimed, and I believe, that the amendments which I moved and which the noble and learned Lord and other Members of the Committee were good enough to put their names to were constructive rather than wrecking amendments. To seek to take Clause 1 out of the Bill would be a wrecking amendment. For that reason I could not support it and I could not advise my noble friends to support such a move. I believe, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, said, that the right way forward now is for the Home Secretary to calm down from what he was saying on radio this morning and what he said to Jack Straw in a letter yesterday and to recognise that 180 Members of this Chamber take a different view from the Government about the application of this part of the Bill and agree to talk to us about it. That would be a more constructive way forward than seeking to take Clause 1 out of the Bill.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, in introducing this Motion, reminded me of how baffled the whole legal profession was in 1991 by the legislation passed at that time which directed a judge no longer to take into account the record of the offender before him, to ignore any further offences which would otherwise be taken into consideration and simply to sentence on the basis of the conviction for the particular offence that was before the court. Nobody could understand why suddenly, contrary to the whole history of the criminal justice system in this country, a person's past record was to be ignored. At sentencing conferences we were informed that that was because there were not enough prison places and that it was our duty, according to the Home Office, to reduce the prison population, to which, as I said at Second Reading, a very senior judge replied, "Now listen boys, if you want to send them to prison, if you think that that is what should be done, you send them to prison". That was quite contrary to the advice that was given to us by the Home Office at that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para1"></a>The next thing that happened was the virtual ending of the suspended sentence of imprisonment because sentences of imprisonment could be suspended only in special circumstances. Again, I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, who reminded me of the last time I was involved in a case with a suspended sentence. It was a case involving a weighbridge clerk who was in charge of the crossing gates on a railway level crossing. He negligently forgot to shut the gates before a train came through, with the result that a lorry went through the gates and was struck by the train on the level crossing. The clerk was charged with manslaughter. After a lengthy trial, he was convicted of a lesser offence under the Railways Act. Then it came to sentencing. Here was a person who had had a <P>


<a name="column_431"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>momentary lapse of concentration. The systems employed by the company employing him were not particularly good and, as a result, that terrible accident occurred. There was the greatest difficulty in persuading the judge not to send the man to prison as a result of the lesser offence of which he had been convicted.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para2"></a>Therefore, when in this Bill we see "exceptional circumstances" being referred to again and when we hear the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, saying that a proportion of less than 1 per cent. would come within the definition of "exceptional circumstances", one realises just what draconian legislation is being proposed in this clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para3"></a>My charge against the Government is that they have come brazenly in this Bill to say to your Lordships that justice is expendable. In the interests, so they say, of the protection of the public and for the safety of the public, judges can be instructed to pass sentences which they believe to be unjust. That is a completely false antithesis. It is not necessary to pass unjust sentences to protect the public. The public can be protected in entirely different ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para4"></a>One way was developed earlier today by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, who referred to the reviewable sentence. I would prefer to call it a "public safety sentence". If we are to have honesty in sentencing, why do we have to call an indeterminate sentence a life sentence? That is not what the Government intend by Clause 1. Everybody knows that. They do not even pretend that it is so. Why do they not call it a "public safety sentence" which gives the public some idea of what it is all about? It would be a sentence to protect the public which would be indeterminate in length. However, that sentence would not be passed automatically or mandatorily, but only where positive evidence is presented to the court within a fixed framework which informs the judge that he is dealing with a person who is a potential danger to the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para5"></a>As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said a moment ago, where a mandatory life sentence was proposed a psychiatrist might say that, based on what he had done, his background or his personality, the person was not a danger to the public. If within the armoury of the judiciary there were a public safety sentence based on evidence before the judge everyone would understand it. Its limitations and extension would be understood. It would be understood that at some future date a person would have to satisfy an executive body that he was no longer a danger to the public and he would remain in prison until that could be established. That is a sensible approach to the kind of problems envisaged in the Bill, not to say that the protection of the public involves judges passing unjust sentences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para6"></a>The use of the expression "life sentence" suggests to me that the proposal is made by the Government to get the headlines, "We are being tough", "We are passing life sentences" or "We are being honest in sentencing." It is nothing of the sort. I said earlier today, and I repeat it now: this Bill smacks of an election gimmick. It is most unfortunate that the Labour Party, at least initially, fell for it. Mr. Jack Straw adopted the same position as <P>


<a name="column_432"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 432</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>his opposite number Mr. Howard. It was only because of the pressure of much more sensible people in your Lordships' House that Mr. Straw changed his mind. He has allowed some concessions to be made by noble Lords who sit on the Labour Benches--although there are not many of them left this evening. He has not gone the whole way because, in squaring up for a fight in the election, he cannot be seen to be back-tracking in the face of Mr. Howard or of your Lordships. It is, however, sad that at the end of 18 years of Conservative government when crime has escalated for all kinds of reasons--I concede that it is not simply because of the Conservative Government--we enter an election period with a completely unwarranted attack on the judiciary. Before they were too hard; now they are too soft, as government policy has shifted.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para7"></a>At the end of the day, it is all about how best one protects the victims of crime. As a first priority the way to protect victims of crime is to try to stop it happening. One has a government that is about to commit &#163;1 or &#163;2 billion on the building of prisons for containment as opposed to spending the money in a constructive way on rehabilitation schemes, probation schemes, investment in a better police force, more policemen on the beat and better equipment. There are many other ways in which that money can be better spent than simply building prisons in which people are left to rot. I fully support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-28_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, is no longer in his place. This afternoon he covered himself in glory. I hope that tonight, or perhaps early next morning, he will sleep the sleep of the just. Nevertheless, I was rather sorry to hear him speak about wrecking amendments. It sounded as if he were already in office. He should recollect that the voters might send him to the political equivalent of Coventry; they might send him to Sheffield! Unfortunately, the precedents are against him. The most far-reaching amendment I have ever known tabled in this House was on the football membership Bill in 1990. That Bill consisted of a large and controversial Part I and a very small and totally uncontroversial Part II. An amendment was tabled to leave out Part I. It stood in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton. That ought to make the Government think twice before they talk about wrecking amendments. It is possible that in another Parliament the noble Baroness the Minister may be eager to eat some of her words about wrecking amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para8"></a>The Bill has rested throughout on an argument for longer sentences; but we do not need this Bill to get longer sentences. Since the present Home Secretary came into office we have had a rapid lengthening of sentences in response to the perceived political will of the executive, just as the shorter sentences, of which the Home Secretary complains, were the result of judicial responsiveness to the wishes of previous Conservative Home Secretaries. That record does not suggest that the judiciary has the least desire for a conflict with the executive; therefore we do not need the Bill in order to get longer sentences.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para9"></a>Earlier today my noble friend Lord Meston murmured in my ear, "It's treating them all alike that is inconsistent." That is our case in a nutshell. One offence is not like another of the same name. Even with attempted murder, which is the worst in this list, the arguments which have already convinced the House about murder must also apply. I have heard the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, ask how the Government's treatment of the case of Private Lee Clegg squares with their doctrine on the mandatory sentence for murder. That would have been equally true if the person shot by Private Clegg had survived and the case had been one of attempted murder. Some murders--for instance, the deliberate shooting of a night watchman in order to get the swag--may deserve very severe sentences indeed. But when one compares the actual case of a woman whose husband made a habit of ironing her with a hot iron and finally, at a moment when his back was turned, her patience snapped, it does not make sense to treat those cases on all fours. The point of the remark made by my noble friend Lord Meston was that treating them all alike is inconsistent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para10"></a>The same applies even more clearly in respect of manslaughter. In the classic case, someone is punched on the jaw, falls over, hits his head on the fireguard and at that moment suffers a heart attack. It can be very difficult indeed to be certain what exactly is the precise cause of death. Treating such cases alike is surely absurd.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para11"></a>I agree in general with the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, about rape, but I must assure him that I was not discussing an actual case and would never presume to have done so. The only comment I would make about the actual case is that no one who had read only the press report and had not read the transcript knew the first thing about it. That is a matter we should bear in mind when we talk about the force of public opinion. What is clear is that the noble Lord is right in saying that one rape is not the same as another.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para12"></a>When we look at what judges are being asked to do, it is understating the case to say that they are being asked to pass sentences which they believe are unjust. They are being asked to do the wrong job. They are being asked to apply a formula, so they are being denied the basic skill of their office, which is to match the sentence to the offender and to the offence. If you cannot do that as a judge, you are pretty well redundant.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para13"></a>I remember being taught as a boy, very much to my surprise, that a clock which is stopped is right more often than one which is five minutes slow. If a mandatory sentence happens to be the correct sentence, it will be correct only in the same way as the clock which has stopped: purely by coincidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para14"></a>These issues have been discussed in literature as well as in law. It is the basic principle of "Measure for Measure", and that is a play about the attempt to impose a mandatory life sentence; in that case, the death penalty for being an unmarried father. In that case, there were innumerable circumstances why it would have been unjust to impose that penalty. The argument was put to Angelo that the Lord Angelo, like the Home Secretary, <P>


<a name="column_434"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is precise. He redeemed his reputation for consistency, in the end, by refusing to ask for mercy for himself. I can see the Home Secretary doing just the same thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para15"></a>We are given a great case in terms of public opinion, but in terms of public opinion one must take account of the fact that information must be taken into account. The public does not know the circumstances of every individual case. If you read everything that appears in the newspapers about a case, you do not know anything about it. And that I do say from experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para16"></a>The point about the judge is that he has heard the whole of the evidence and, great though my respect is for public opinion, I do not think that an opinion formed in ignorance should carry as much weight as an opinion formed in knowledge. Also, public opinion is a great deal more fickle than one might think. The public is a sentimental animal and when it is shown a real injustice arising from a mandatory sentence, the Home Secretary may live to find that the Sun is as fickle as its heavenly namesake.

<P>
<A NAME="70213-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   I shall intervene briefly, as I did on the last occasion on which I spoke to the Committee about Clause 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para17"></a>I have a very clear memory of March 1964 in the Aylesbury Assize Court. As I recall, the noble Lord, Lord Richard, was also in that court on that day, and it was the end of the trial of the Great Train Robbery. There were too many defendants to be brought up together into the dock of that rather small Crown Court, as it now is, so the first of the offenders who was found guilty of participating in the Great Train Robbery, Mr. Wilson, I remember his name, was brought into court.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para18"></a>At that time, there were a number of options open to Mr. Justice Edmund Davies, the trial judge, one of which was to impose a life sentence. I remember the pause in the court, the quietness and stillness in the court as the judge came to pronounce the sentence itself. When the judge pronounced a sentence of imprisonment of 30 years, there was a tremble, not only from the offender himself, but from everybody else in the court room. He was a judge responding to the need, as he perceived it, not pushed by public opinion and only pushed--if he were pushed--by his own judgment, to impose a very severe sentence for a very serious crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para19"></a>Those of us who are opposed to mandatory sentences--I speak for myself--are not opposed on the right occasion to a very severe sentence. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said, there are many occasions on which, in any event, if you are operating Clause 1, a very severe sentence, including a life sentence, should be imposed. That is not the issue. The issue is whether the sentence should be mandatory, irrespective of the circumstances. When I intervened earlier during discussions on Clause l, the Committee was fuller and there was a kind of burble going on around me of disapproval. Therefore I was not able to develop the point properly. I shall only identify it now rather than develop it.

<A NAME = "70213-28_para20"></a>It seems to me that Members of the Committee have heard, not only in the debates on this Bill but also in the earlier debate of 23rd May of last year, many voices from very experienced judges who have given us their advice. I should point out that the other place did not have the advantage of hearing such advice. When we are given such advice, it seems to me that the only conclusion that we should rightly draw is that we should not have mandatory sentences. I wish only, therefore, to quote the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, as spoken in the debate that he initiated on 23rd May last. Although the noble and learned Lord was able to join us today he is, alas, no longer present in the Chamber. However, he stayed with us for a long time, as indeed he did on the Second Reading of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that Members of the Committee will allow me to remind them of a small passage of the noble and learned Lord's speech made on 23rd May. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Quite simply, minimum sentences must involve a denial of justice. It cannot be right for sentences to be passed without regard to gravity, frequency, consequences or other circumstances of the offending. To sentence a burglar automatically to a minimum of three years' imprisonment on a third conviction is to take no account of whether he is before the court for only three offences or for 30, no account of how long has passed between those offences, whether they involved sophisticated planning, drunken opportunism, and a host of other factors".--[Official Report, 23/5/96; col. 1026.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para21"></a>We are not talking about wrecking amendments; as I said earlier, I am more concerned about wrecking the established penal policy of my Government. We are talking about justice. That is why I attached my name to the Question, Whether Clause l should stand part of the Bill. I believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, has got it right. Although many noble Lords are not prepared to say so in the Committee, many of them say outside that the policy of mandatory sentences is not right. Indeed, I have not heard any developed argument from the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh and Lord Williams, about the virtues and benefits of mandatory sentences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-28_para22"></a>We are grateful to both noble Lords. Although the noble Lords will not acknowledge this--indeed, it is not perhaps appropriate for them to do so within their own party--we are grateful to them for the fact that they have influenced the Opposition. We know that as a result of their representations on the issue we had Amendment No. l not only tabled but also supported by the Committee. As I said, we are grateful to them for that. Nonetheless, the right position is to reject mandatory sentencing. That is why I support the noble and learned Lord.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="70213-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My noble friend will not be surprised to hear me say how depressed I was that, somehow or other, it is assumed that noble Lords who are against the Government on the matter possess intellectual validity for their arguments but that those of us who wholeheartedly support the Bill have not produced an intellectual argument to support their case. However, I leave it there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para0"></a>We have spent a great deal of time on the Question, Whether Clause l shall stand part of the Bill. I should tell the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, that, from <P>


<a name="column_436"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 436</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where I stand, the description of him as a "war Lord" is not too far off the mark. Indeed, I feel that I am on the receiving end of a war of attrition by those who do not support the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para1"></a>There is a high degree of public anxiety about such crimes. There is considerable public support for these provisions as set out in the Bill, including a healthy majority of 200 from another place at a time when the Government enjoy no overall majority at all. Therefore it is right that the government of the day should reflect the anxiety of the public, put before Parliament possible remedies, and allow Parliament--as it has the sovereign power to do--to determine which way it will respond to that issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para2"></a>Clause 1 requires the court to impose a life sentence on anyone aged 18 or over who is convicted for the second time of a serious sexual or violent offence unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances which justify not doing so. In that event it must state in open court what the exceptional circumstances are. Serious offences for the purposes of Clause 1 include rape, attempted rape, unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, attempted murder, manslaughter, serious woundings and certain firearms offences. Life imprisonment is, of course, already the maximum penalty for all these serious offences but the courts rarely impose discretionary life sentences in such cases, even if the offender in question has previous convictions for similar offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para3"></a>In 1994--I make no apology for repeating the statistic--217 offenders were convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence having previously been convicted of it at least once before. Only 10 of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. The courts can and indeed do impose long determinate sentences on those convicted of serious, violent or sexual offences. But when the offender has served his sentence he has to be released even if there is reason to believe that he will commit further serious offences and, regrettably, that is exactly what happens in a significant proportion of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para4"></a>This does not give the public the protection they need from violent and dangerous offenders. The mandatory life sentence will ensure in future that such offenders are released if and only if it is safe to do so. Those who are released will remain on licence and subject to recall. The procedures for setting tariff and determining release will follow those which currently apply to discretionary life sentences; in other words, the trial judge will set the tariff to be served for retribution and deterrence and at the end of that period, following an assessment of risk, the Parole Board will determine whether it is safe to release the offender. The Home Secretary of the day will play no part whatever in that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para5"></a>The court will have discretion to set aside the automatic life sentence in exceptional circumstances. There has been a good deal of debate in this Chamber and another place about exactly what that means. Without wanting to go over the ground in detail, in my view the exceptional circumstances formula strikes the right balance between maintaining the integrity of the policy and allowing the courts sufficient flexibility to <P>


<a name="column_437"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 437</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exercise discretion in those occasional cases where the mandatory penalty would be manifestly unnecessary or inappropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para6"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, served only to confirm one thing to me; namely, that the misunderstanding of this Bill is profound on the part of some Members of the Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Meston, who is not now present, whispered into the ear of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that the thing he does not like about this clause is that it treats all offenders alike. That could not be more wrong. When offenders come before the court they are not all treated alike. A case is heard, guilt or innocence is determined by the court and, according to Section 1, 2 or 3 of what will be the new Act, the minimum sentences apply; in other words, their sentences should not be fewer than three years in the case of burglary, or fewer than seven years in the case of persistent drug dealing. In the case of sexual and violent offences there will be an automatic life sentence with a variable tariff which can be lenient or long to reflect the seriousness of the crime. I hope the noble Earl will not intervene because it is important that we continue with what is left of this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para7"></a>It is not true to say that there is a single sentence for all people. They are not treated the same. There is a variety of ways of treating them. No formula is applied. I do not know where the noble Earl, Lord Russell, got that from. It is an automatic sentence with a tariff which can be at the discretion of the judge. That is not a formula.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para8"></a>I do not know where the formula is in Clauses 2 and 3. Perhaps the noble Earl will write to me and point it out. As I said, it is a sentence not less than the prescribed minimum.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Carlisle referred to the Roger Hood research. I am aware of the Roger Hood research and have looked at it. The research clearly illustrates that the present system is not perfect. All those prisoners about which the Parole Board expressed concern would have been released at the two-thirds point of sentence. They would have been supervised for a period equivalent to only 8 per cent. of the sentence. Under the Bill's proposals, 10 per cent. of them would be subject to the automatic life sentence; others who were sex offenders could be subject to up to 10 years' supervision on release; and the others would be subject to a period of supervision equal to 25 per cent. of the sentence. The public will be better protected, not worse, under the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, referred to indeterminate reviewable sentences. An automatic life sentence as provided under Clause 1 of the Bill provides a guarantee of lifetime supervision on release. An indeterminate reviewable sentence is very little different from a life sentence but it does not provide a guarantee of lifetime supervision. To that extent it offers less than the automatic life sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, posed a particular case and asked me to comment on it. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the court would impose a life sentence under Clause 1. That caveat is <P>


<a name="column_438"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 438</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, it would impose a life sentence under Clause 1. It would set the tariff according to the seriousness of the offence. Thereafter the question of release would depend upon the risk to society then posed by the offender. If the psychiatric assessment were correct, the offender might expect to be released on tariff expiry. But the offender would have committed two serious sexual or violent offences; and the question of risk would need to be considered carefully at the proper time before release. However, under our proposals, if the medical evidence to the judge hearing the case were sufficient to allow the judge to consider that it constituted exceptional circumstances, that would be a matter for the judge.

<A NAME="70213-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bingham of Cornhill: </B>   Would it be an exceptional circumstance that there was clear and incontrovertible evidence that the defendant presented no serious continuing risk to the public?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   No, not on that particular fine point because the person has committed two serious sexual and/or violent offences. He is guilty of those violent offences. The question of no risk and other factors taken together may constitute exceptional circumstances. But the judgment about exceptional circumstances--it is the reason we left it as we did in the Bill--is for the judge to make. It would be subject to possible appeal by the Attorney-General. But if the judge felt that the circumstances, the wilfulness and the offences committed were sufficient to bring about a conviction, he would invoke the life sentence unless he deemed that there were exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para12"></a>Perhaps I may pose a question to the noble and learned Lord. I listened carefully, as I always do, to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham. I feel that the contributions by the noble and learned Lord must be taken seriously not only because I believe that he is an eminent and very respected Member of this House but because of the position that he holds. He spoke strongly in support of the amendment which affected Clause 1 earlier today. I assume that the noble and learned Lord was satisfied that the amendment would not require judges to act unjustly. If the noble and learned Lord says that is not true, then it poses another question.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para13"></a>Even if psychiatrists say at the trial that they are satisfied that there is no risk to the public, what is the evil that arises in having that issue looked at again when the fixed period is served? I remind the noble and learned Lord that I referred specifically to subsection (2) of the new clause before Clause 1, which states:

<FONT SIZE=3>early release provisions, as set out in the 1991 Act, do not apply to life sentence prisoners; and the incentive for good behaviour is parole, once the period of the tariff is served. That is the case now, and remains so under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, accused the Government of a mere election gimmick. There is an arrogance about his remark. Again, it links to a point I made about my noble friend Lord Hacking. The idea is that those who are against the Bill are in some way virtuous and those of us who believe--I use the word because I am a believer in the Bill--that the Bill addresses a serious public protection issue are only playing politics.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para16"></a>I came to this House in 1987. The one thing that deeply impressed me about it, and which I thought was a characteristic of this place, is that we respected each other's genuinely held views. That has always guided me. It is part of the civility of this House that can be carried on through very serious debates. But continually, throughout the day, there has been a suggestion that, somehow or other, those of us who believe in the Bill are playing politics, being superficial and playing to a gallery out there. But some of us genuinely believe that there is an anxiety among the public at large that needs to be addressed. We believe the Bill is a genuine attempt to address that anxiety.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said that 180 people in this Chamber did not take the same view as the Government. I have to concede that; it happened earlier today and we all witnessed it. But 172 people did take the same view as the Government, so the opposition was not quite so overwhelming as the noble Lord suggested. To return to a point I made earlier, the Bill came to this House from another place, under a Government who do not enjoy an overall majority, with a majority of 200. We cannot ignore that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, also referred to justifying his own change of heart on these matters. As long ago as the initial introduction of the White Paper, reference was made to "exceptional circumstances" being considered to be part of the Bill. Some of the noble Lord's remarks have been made since that publication.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-29_para19"></a>People who repeat sexual and violent offences are causing great grief in our community. Clause 1 is a proper response to that. The key rationale for Clause 1 is that people who represent a risk to the public are not released back into the community without a risk assessment; and when they are, if at any time after release they begin to pose a further risk to the public, they can be recalled. I believe that this is a genuine attempt to address a very real problem in the community. I hope that the clause will remain part of the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-30_para0"></a>The noble Baroness thought that I entirely misunderstood the matter in saying that there was not a formula. If the mandatory sentence is not a formula, I do not know what is. Of course I understand the difference between the mandatory sentence and the tariff. I was reluctant to attribute to the noble Baroness the view light-heartedly suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, at Second Reading, "I sentence you to life. By the way, you can expect to serve 18 months." But if that really is her view, I cannot see how it is compatible with the principle of honesty in sentencing.

<A NAME = "70213-30_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is coupled with Amendment No. 30. I did not address the issue when I moved my first amendment, Amendment No. 9.

<P>

<A NAME = "70213-30_para15"></a>The other point I wish to make is that although I passionately disagree with the Bill and identify it as a serious deviation from the established penal policy of the Government, at no time has the word "election" slipped from my mouth and at no time have I suggested that either political party is in any way motivated by the oncoming election on the political position that they take on the Bill. Nor have I ever attacked the integrity of those who disagree with me. I have never attempted to be sanctimonious in this Chamber. I am not being sanctimonious now. I am not intellectually critical or otherwise critical of my noble friend who so patiently is at the Dispatch Box on this Bill. That is not my position.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-30_para16"></a>I fundamentally disagree with the Bill, not only Clauses 1, 2 and 3 but many other parts of it, including the treatment of the parole system and all kinds of other matters.

<P>

<A NAME = "70213-30_para17"></a>Perhaps I may say that throughout Second Reading and in the course of responding to the amendments today I have done my best. I can only say that my noble friend dismisses the validity of my arguments. But I can give <P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   I am very grateful for that assurance. Inviting my noble friend to speak has justified me very briefly moving this amendment.

It was just that I was having a little tease, if I may say so, with the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh and Lord Williams.

<A NAME = "70213-30_para30"></a>Is not there another possible avenue apart from that of imposing a mandatory three-year minimum sentence for persistent burglars? It is a fallacy that most burglaries are committed by teenage amateurs, as a number of Members of the Committee have said this afternoon and others have suggested elsewhere. It may be the case that teenage amateurs are mainly involved where housing estates are concerned and in some other urban areas, but it is certainly not the case in rural Britain.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-30_para31"></a>We are plagued by highly professional individuals in their 20s, 30s and 40s. They carefully spy out the ground beforehand with binoculars or telescopes; they are equipped with advanced electronic equipment; they drive expensive Volvo estate cars or sometimes Peugeots or Mercedes, but more often than not nowadays, powerful four-wheel drive, off-the-road vehicles so that they can make their approach and getaway across fields.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-30_para32"></a>Far too little use has been made of the power to confiscate the tools of their trade. I urge the Government to remind the judiciary of those powers and to make fuller use of them. Unlike prison, that costs the taxpayer nothing and may ultimately even benefit the taxpayer as well as making life much more difficult for the criminal.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="70213-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   There is nothing in Clause 3 that prevents the courts from dealing very severely with people who indulge in sophisticated and organised crime. Indeed, we have done a great deal about sophisticated and organised crime and have constantly tried to strengthen the measures in that regard. We have also done a great deal in relation to giving the power to courts to confiscate the ill-gotten gains of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para0"></a>However, the courts are not using maximum sentences for burglary when it is at their disposal. One of the reasons this Bill is before the Committee is to at least impose a floor on the sentences that are passed; that no sentence shall be less than three years. We hope that more use will be made of the maximum sentences where the crimes are as serious as the noble Lord describes.

(".--(1) Without prejudice to any other power in that regard, the Court of Appeal shall consider and review sentencing practice and policy and from time to time issue guidance in respect thereof, including guidance on progression in sentencing.

(2) Without prejudice to any rule of law, a court in passing sentence shall have regard to any relevant guidance issued under subsection (1) above.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This is an amendment to deal with a greater use by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division of its guideline powers. Sentencing of offenders ought to be consistent, reasoned, open and predictable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para4"></a>The former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lane, set down guidelines for serious offences like rape, incest, drug trafficking and social security fraud; the noble and learned Lord, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, following, issued guideline judgments on <P>


<a name="column_444"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aggravated vehicle taking, causing death by careless driving and so forth. But there are large areas of sentencing, mainly relating to the lower levels of Crown Court work--which are very important, as the Minister said (and I agree); burglary, theft, deception and handling--and in particular the vast bulk of criminal work (95 per cent. plus) done in the magistrates' courts, where no guidelines exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para5"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to introduce into the Bill a specific encouragement in statutory form that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Court of Appeal shall consider and review sentencing practice and policy and from time to time issue guidance in respect thereof", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para7"></a>I shall be grateful for the Minister's views on this. It is our testing amendment to see whether or not the Government's view is that the Court of Appeal should intervene over a greater area in terms of guidance. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   I want briefly to support this amendment. It seems to me that this is the right way forward. The problems have arisen during certain periods over the past 20 years where courts have not had sufficient guidance on sentencing. There have been occasions when sentences have been very topsy-turvy: sometimes sentences have been far too harsh and on other occasions it has been the other way round. It seems to me that for the Court of Appeal to play an active part in the way proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, is a healthy, practical and sensible way forward.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I wish to support the amendment and would add only this. The Minister must believe in the Bill from the passion and the work that she has put into it. I commend her for it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I do, I do. I agree that inconsistent sentencing can undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. It is, of course, important that criminals should receive punishment which is appropriate for the crime and which as far as possible achieves consistency. That is exactly what the Crime (Sentences) Bill is about. In relation to certain carefully targeted categories of serious, dangerous and persistent offenders we believe that the public needs greater protection. That is why we propose the introduction of mandatory sentences. However, that does not mean that a case has been made for restrictive sentencing guidelines across the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para8"></a>Of course there is a role for guidance to be available to the courts. The lower courts are already assisted in sentencing by guidance given by the Court of Appeal through its judgments on the appropriate penalty range for particular offences. This is a practice which has been considerably developed in recent years. Court of Appeal guidelines have been particularly useful in some areas in ensuring the courts take a more consistent view of particular offences and reflect levels of public concern in their sentencing practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para9"></a>To take an example, the Court of Appeal's 1986 guideline judgment in the case of Billam suggests starting points for sentences for rape. The judgment states that for <P>


<a name="column_445"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a rape with no aggravating or mitigating factors, the starting point should be five years' imprisonment. That is for a contested case; it would be a little less where the offender pleads guilty and the victim is spared the trauma of appearing in court to give evidence. These guidelines have had the effect of very significantly increasing sentence lengths for rape, the average sentence length being 76 months in 1995. Another example is the R v. Aramah which indicates the appropriate penalties, whether imprisonment or fine, for offences involving the importation, supply and possession of Class B drugs according to the scale of distribution and quantity of drugs involved. For example, it suggests that 10 years' imprisonment is appropriate for massive supplies of cannabis for those playing anything more than a subordinate role and that a fine is appropriate for possession of small amounts. It is important to remember, however, that Court of Appeal judgments can only be guidance: in each case the court must weigh up all the circumstances and decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para10"></a>Currently, any Court of Appeal judgment in an appeal against sentence, whether it allows or dismisses an appeal, gives a clear indication of its opinion on the sentence passed in the lower court. The judgment will explain the reasoning behind the court's decision. Court of Appeal judgments are held as authorities for cases in which the circumstances are similar. The cases I have quoted clearly show that they can be used as guidance as to appropriate sentence lengths for different categories of offences and different levels of seriousness. Furthermore, the Judicial Studies Board plays a valuable and continuing role in disseminating Court of Appeal guidance to the courts and in training the judiciary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para11"></a>The current system works well in targeting the areas where inappropriate or inconsistent sentencing in the lower courts has highlighted the need for some central guidance. At the lower end of the scale, the Magistrates' Association issues guidelines on sentencing to its members which for specific offences give appropriate sentences for cases of average seriousness and indicate aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para12"></a>I believe that the roles that the Court of Appeal and Magistrates' Association already play in providing guidance are important and effective in areas of sentencing which cause most difficulty. The clause would require the Court of Appeal to consider sentencing practice generally, even in areas where scrutiny is not required. It would greatly, and unnecessarily, increase the burden on the court. The new clause seeks to give the Court of Appeal a statutory role in sentencing policy. However, sentencing policy is a matter for the Government and Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para13"></a>We are satisfied that the present system is sufficiently effective in ensuring consistent and appropriate sentencing. Where there have been grounds for concern in particular areas, we have not hesitated to act; for <P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example, the proposals for automatic life and mandatory minimum sentences in this Bill. The clause would unnecessarily introduce statutory duties without adding to the present arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para14"></a>I ask the noble Lord not to press the amendment for two reasons. First, there are too few noble Lords present to go through the Lobbies. Secondly, it would be helpful to have the views of some of the noble and learned Lords who have taken part in our debates on the extended role that is being suggested in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para15"></a>I end with one final point. In determining sentencing policy--that is government and Parliament at the end of the day or, as my noble friend would say, "in the final analysis"--the important thing is that they can look across to the Appeal Court for anything which might influence that policy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The Minister has asked me not to press matters to a vote and, of course, whenever she asks me not to do something I readily agree. I entirely agree with the Minister's comments about the Judicial Studies Board. It has done tremendous work under Lord Justice Henry and now under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Judge. There are one or two of us here who for some years have been saying that it should be better funded; that the training of judges should be much more consistent and coherent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213-31_para16"></a>But that is not the point that I am making. I did the Minister the courtesy of listening with great care to what she said. She said that sentencing policy was not a matter for the Court of Appeal. But earlier she said, commending the Court of Appeal, that it had rightly set down policy guidelines in respect of rape and drug trafficking on a serious basis. I detect possibly, even at this time of the night, a modest internal inconsistency. If, as the Minister says, guidelines have worked well in rape, incest, drug trafficking and the other cases which I mentioned earlier, why should they not be of reasonable practical utility in the great span of offences not presently covered by guidelines such as burglary, theft, deception and handling? I yield to no one in my respect for the Magistrates' Association, but I simply suggest that the weight of the Court of Appeal might usefully be directed to these areas. Since the Minister asked me so nicely, I shall not put this amendment to the vote.

<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What reasons remain for expanding NATO in the light of the successful development of Partnership for Peace which had not been envisaged when NATO expansion was first studied and in the light of general problems arising from the proposed expansion.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  Partnership for Peace and enlargement to the east have always been considered parallel processes. The NATO summit of 10th/11th January 1994, at which Partnership for Peace was launched, made clear that NATO expected and would welcome enlargement to democratic states to the east.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What recommendations have been made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as requested by the Security Council, on the type of assistance which the international community could contribute towards the holding of free and fair elections in Liberia, and whether the 20th May date originally planned for the elections is still to be maintained.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   A United Nations technical team visited Liberia in December to determine how a viable and credible framework for free and fair elections could be established by 20th May. Their recommendations are shortly to be considered by ECOWAS and the United Nations.

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>detention promptly "before a competent, independent and impartial authority"; if so, how this is achieved; and, if not, in what respects it is not achieved.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  Detention powers contained in the Immigration Act 1971 are used only as a last resort. Temporary admission is granted wherever possible and detention is authorised only where there are good grounds for believing that the person will not comply with the terms of temporary admission.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213w01_para0"></a>The initial decision to detain is reviewed regularly and at progressively more senior levels within the Immigration Service. There is provision for any detainee who has an appeal outstanding or who has been detained for more than seven days pending further examination to apply to the independent appellate authorities for bail. In addition, detention may be challenged in the courts and bail may be sought once a case is before the
courts on an application for judicial review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213w01_para1"></a>The Government are satisfied that their detention policy does not represent a breach of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or any other international obligations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What has been the annual cost during each of the past five years of detaining asylum seekers in Her Majesty's prisons.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The annual cost during each of
the past five years of detaining asylum seekers under the Immigration Act 1971 in Prison Service establishments cannot be obtained without disproportionate cost, since accounting systems do not distinguish between those and other immigration detainees and those on remand or serving a prison sentence.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What proportion of asylum seekers detained in prison are awaiting an initial decision or the outcome of an appeal.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This information is not available.
I can, however, say that as at 31st January 1997 there were a total of 324 people solely detained in prisons under the powers contained in Schedules 2 and 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 who had claimed asylum at some stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_wqn6"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether bone meal, meat and blood are safe for use as fertilisers in the growing of vegetables.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The sale and use of meat and bone meal as a fertiliser on agricultural land has been prohibited. The ban follows a recommendation of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) that <P>


<a name="column_WA29"></a>

<B>13 Feb 1997 : Column WA29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mammalian meat and bone meal should be prohibited in any circumstances where there might be a risk of ruminant animals ingesting such material.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213w01_para2"></a>The ban applies to commercial horticulture but not where plants are propagated and grown in greenhouses or similar glass or plastic structures. Since the measure is concerned with preventing BSE from reaching ruminants, there is no restriction on the use of meat and bone meal fertilisers in private gardens. Such fertilisers must not contain material derived from BSE suspects or animals slaughtered under the Over Thirty Months Scheme, or specified bovine materials.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213w01_para3"></a>The SEAC has advised that there is no reason to forbid the spreading of blood on the land.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_wqn7"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their policy towards the updating of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty; and
<P>
Whether they will seek, in negotiations on updating the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (a) further overall reductions in military manpower and equipment in Europe, and (b) the prevention of the new arms races based on the modernisation of deployed weapons, on new production facilities and on research and development; and whether they will ensure that the existing verification and information exchange regimes, which are fully equipped to monitor such matters, are used.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Earl Howe): </B>  Our aim is to co-operate fully with other States Parties to improve the operation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty in the changing European environment, and hence the security of each State Party. We hope in particular to develop further binding mechanisms which enhance mutual confidence, transparency, stability and predictability, while taking into account the legitimate security interest of each State Party.
<P>

<A NAME = "70213w01_para4"></a>We also wish to explore, with other States Parties, the scope for reducing further the present limits on equipment holdings, but not those for manpower. The OSCE Lisbon Summit mandate for adaptation of the Treaty does not address military manpower, which is covered by a separate political agreement (the Concluding Act of the Negotiation on Personnel Strength of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe).
<P>

<A NAME = "70213w01_para5"></a>As to modernisation of deployed weapons, new production facilities and research and development, these are neither within the scope of the existing CFE Treaty nor covered by the OSCE mandate for its <P>

<P>
<UL>Whether they are taking any part in the development of the US small sea-launched cruise missile, Sea Ferret; whether they participated in the December 1996 exercise in which the missile was used to locate, among other targets, a nuclear power station; and, if so, what type of war-fighting is being contemplated.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Her Majesty's Government have no involvement in the development or testing of a US sea-launched cruise missile designated Sea Ferret.

<UL>What is standing in the way of the Western European Union collaborating with the European Space Agency on matters relating to the peaceful uses of space, which previous answers from the Government make clear include surveillance satellites of all kinds.<P></UL>
<P>

<A NAME="70213w01_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Arrangements are already in place to enable the WEU Satellite Centre to acquire and use European Space Agency (ESA) imagery, respecting constraints of ESA's convention, which specifically states that its activities shall be for exclusively peaceful purposes.

<A NAME="70213w01_wqn10"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to take part in the development of HELIOS II and Horus satellites, along with Germany and France, and, if not, why not.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70213w01_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   The HELIOS II and Horus satellites are a Franco-German initiative. There has never been any suggestion of direct UK participation in this programme. The UK will continue, however, to take part in the work of the WEU Space Group and, together with her partners, will consider, on their merits, any concrete proposals that may emerge for WEU participation in the HELIOS II/Horus programme.
