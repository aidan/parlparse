<H4><center>Reassembling after the Summer Recess, the House met at half past two of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Viscount Cranborne): </B>  My Lords, the whole House will have been saddened by the news last week of the death of my noble friend Lord Home of the Hirsel. I can think of no one who was held in greater respect or affection by this House, by his party or by this nation at large. And your Lordships, who were so often privileged to hear him speak, will wish to remember today his distinguished career, his charm, his wit and his service to this place.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para0"></a>Your Lordships will already be familiar enough with the outlines of my noble friend's political life. I therefore do not need to rehearse them in detail this afternoon. However, the length of his political experience, particularly of foreign affairs, has been equalled by few modern statesmen; and for me it is something of a shock to realise that we are today paying tribute to a man who was already at the centre of affairs by the time Hitler rose to power. Thus, when he came to occupy the great offices of Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, his natural courage and judgment were nourished by a length of perspective which is perhaps often the victim of the parliamentary hurly-burly of today.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para1"></a>His achievements at the Scottish Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office have been justly and widely recognised. As Foreign Secretary he inspired trust, affection and respect in equal measure. However, I suspect his achievements as Prime Minister and party leader have not received the notice they deserve. After all, he inherited&#151;I make no comment about this&#151;a demoralised and divided party, some of whose leading lights refused to serve under him, and he faced a young and formidable Leader of the Opposition who, encouraged by the howls of derision Lord Home attracted from much of the press, must have thought him easy prey. Yet after only a year he lost the election by a mere four seats. His diffident manner was deceptive. Here, indeed, was a tough and tenacious politician, qualities after all which had always distinguished his Border ancestors. It was that toughness, as well as his natural lack of rancour, that enabled him to continue in politics and to return in due course to the Foreign Office where the same quality enabled him famously to expel 105 Soviet spies from London.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para2"></a>I have said that my noble friend was tough. His grasp of essentials was also rapid and striking to those who witnessed it. His kindness in accepting invitations to address small audiences was legendary and I was one of <P>


<a name="column_566"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those fortunate in being a beneficiary of that kindness in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving with a couple of minutes to spare he would ask, "Now what do you want me to say?". I tried as best I could to explain the situation as I saw it and confess to wondering whether he was even listening to my briefing. I need not have worried. His speech two minutes later showed not only that he had listened to every word but that he had understood implications of events that his briefer had not yet begun to spot.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para3"></a>I was fortunate to know Lord Home a little and to have been the lucky recipient of his kindness and hospitality. Anyone who saw him on his native heath would realise that Lanarkshire and the Border country were as much a part of him as his rod and his gun. He belonged there and covered their accidented ground with effortless speed. However, I venture to suggest that he also belonged in your Lordships' House. Indeed, he was the last Prime Minister to hold that office while a Member of this place&#151;albeit for only four days. It is for this reason that his bust stands in the Norman Porch. His unassuming courtesy, his experience, his judgment, and his wit&#151;above all he was a very funny man&#151;perhaps made him seem peculiarly at home in this place and I venture to suggest that we are grateful for the lustre he added to our proceedings.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para4"></a>I cannot finish without sending our best wishes and sympathy to his family. This, of course, is a conventional courtesy on occasions of this kind and a very proper one. However, in my noble friend's case, the extraordinary happiness of his marriage and the affection in which he was so obviously held by his many relations make that convention particularly important to observe today. Lady Home's death must have been a terrible blow to him but it was one that he faced with his customary courage and indeed his customary modesty, and with the love and support of his children.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para5"></a>I am sure that the whole House will recognise that he was a remarkable man and a great servant of the state. He was also, which is rarer, a man who was much loved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches are happy to join with the Leader of the House in the sentiments he has expressed. Lord Home was for over 60 years a dedicated public servant of whom the party opposite and the country as a whole should be justly proud.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para6"></a>Born into a noble and ancient Border family, he determined to devote his life to politics. Educated at Eton, where he was no mean cricketer, and Christ Church, where he just failed to get a Blue, he could have spent his time in much more aristocratic pursuits. That he did not was very firmly his own decision. His father believed strongly&#151;to use Lord Home's own words&#151;that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it was a duty for one born with the means to be independent to undertake public service"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para7"></a>but not, apparently, he tells us, in politics, for he wrote of that part of his life:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My father strongly advised me against politics as a career. He also told me that no Home could drink champagne. Otherwise a dutiful son, on both these points I disagreed and proved my point". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>


<a name="column_567"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<a name="51016-01_para8"></a>First elected to Parliament in 1931, his career spanned some of the more turbulent years of this century. I myself always felt that it was indicative of his nature and character that, having been Prime Minister, nevertheless he found it possible to serve as Foreign Secretary in the government of his successor as party leader.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para9"></a>Reading the obituaries of Lord Home, the two words which recur again and again are "decency" and "integrity". While we on this side of the House did not and indeed could not be expected to agree with all his views, there is no doubt that he held those views sincerely and advocated them honourably. Together with the late Lord Stockton and others, some of whom are still in your Lordships' House, Lord Home was one of those who put their distinctive stamp upon the Conservative Party at least until 1979. As the Guardian wrote of him:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"He was the embodiment of a moderate British Conservative tradition". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para10"></a>It is that very moderation and decency for which we will remember him. He was invariably courteous and considerate, and party confrontation was hardly his style. Indeed, he became Prime Minister in 1963 precisely because of those qualities, which perhaps meant that he disunited the party less than any of his competitors. They were qualities that he displayed throughout his career.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para11"></a>The intensity and depth of the political battle today might have surprised and perhaps upset him. I was reading his autobiography again over the weekend. I came across a few sentences which perhaps I may share with your Lordships today since they seem to me at any rate to encapsulate the nature of the man. He said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Party Leaders should exercise restraint in the use of the power of the majority to a point where it is not necessary for an Opposition to pledge itself to undo what the government of the day has done. It is not an easy assignment but politics is a profession not for the bully with a bludgeon but for the artist with a baton". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para12"></a>That seems to me to sum up his whole approach to politics and public administration. He may have been tough and shrewd&#151;as the Leader of the House said&#151;but honourable, decent and a man of integrity he clearly was too. For that, we mourn him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Hillhead: </B>   My Lords, Alec Home, whose death we deeply regret, became Prime Minister almost accidentally, though, as is often the case with accidents, causing a few casualties in the process. He occupied the office briefly. If I try to think of a 19th century comparison it would be with his fellow Scottish Earl, the somewhat elusive Lord Aberdeen, who was also a long-serving Foreign Secretary. But Lord Aberdeen had a deeply melancholic private life, losing two wives and five children while young, whereas Alec Home, I hope and believe, had a full and happy old age&#151;more so, perhaps, than any Prime Minister except perhaps Attlee and Macmillan.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para13"></a>Lord Home had an exceptionally long post-ministerial retirement, yet he was far from a shadow during those post-Downing Street years. He was Foreign Secretary for three-and-a-half of those years. He was a frequent attender in your Lordships' House until fairly recently. <P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I find it peculiarly easy to summon up a picture of that sparse figure and cranial yet benevolent head sitting somewhere between the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, and the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter.
<P>

<a name="51016-01_para14"></a>Lord Home never pushed himself forward. He had the most perfect good manners, based, as high good manners mostly are, on a dual foundation of self-confidence and self-effacement. He was not an emotional orator but he could make a speech with a faultless touch and a delicate wit which I have never seen rivalled. I suppose in some ways he was the final station of a railway line which may not survive the harsh commercialism of privatisation. He was the last, thus far, of Eton's 18 Prime Ministers and the last thus far of Christ Church's 13. But who knows, Fettes and St. John's College are thrusting in the wind. Whatever the future holds, we should cherish the memory of Alec Home, the more so perhaps for we may not, alas, see his like again.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Greenhill of Harrow: </B>   My Lords, for many years the Cross-Bench Peers have included several Members who served under Lord Home. I am one of them, and I hope I may be permitted to recall some of our experiences and impressions of him. Strangely enough I have the clearest recollection of seeing, over 70 years ago, a picture of the Eton team in the Cricketer weekly magazine. Seated in the centre was Lord Dunglass wearing the captain's cap. I knew that our lives would never cross on the cricket field, but I did not imagine that I would ever work with that captain if he became Prime Minister or Foreign Secretary of our government at some distant date.
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para0"></a>It is of the period 1970 to 1973 that I now briefly want to speak&#151;when I knew him best and when I was his Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The calm and friendly atmosphere of his Whitehall office was unique. His desk was usually clear of official papers. Within easy reach of his right hand was a copy of Ruff's Guide to the Turf. Often there was a welcoming smile on his face as he came off the 'phone after advising his brother William where to place their money. If there was a morning meeting of officials he usually put the first question of the day to the most junior officer in the room, who rose visibly in stature. Many of those who saw Lord Home working in Whitehall know how encouraging he could be. There were no short tempers and no rebukes, even when justified. And those of us who were fortunate enough to travel with him abroad know what an inspiration he was and what an asset he could be to this country.
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para1"></a>Lord Home's foreign opposite numbers, either friends or potential foes, clearly held him in great respect, often even affection, whether it be Gromyko, Cho En Lai in China or Ian Smith in Rhodesia, to say nothing of American, European or Commonwealth leaders. Those of us who were with him could not but be proud of him. I refer to two dramas in which he played a central role, one success and one setback. The first was the expulsion from this country of 105 Soviet intelligence agents, which has already been mentioned: the second was his attempt to solve the problem of Rhodesia.
<P>


<a name="column_569"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para2"></a>The mass expulsion of Soviet agents was opposed by certain fellow Cabinet Members who claimed that we would be the laughing-stock of the world. They were fearful of the extent of Russian reaction. Lord Home stuck to his guns and in the event his action was fully justified. Other friendly countries followed suit. Marshal Tito expelled one Soviet agent who had worked in London. Lord Home sent the marshal a telegram of congratulation saying, "Well done. Keep them moving".
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para3"></a>Lord Home's failure to settle the Rhodesian problem was a great disappointment to him. At one time he thought he was being obstructed by some of those who claimed to be his friends. But the sincerity of the Secretary of State could be questioned neither by people at home nor by the suspicious Africans when he accepted at once the negative conclusions of the Pearce Report which had been delayed by events beyond the control of any of the parties. It was a most important action for the Commonwealth and for our international relations worldwide.
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para4"></a>Finally, Lord Home's stamina at home and on exhaustive tours was remarkable. When abroad it was characteristic that he did not hesitate to eat and enjoy the most exotic oriental food without the slightest damage while others fell by the wayside. Alec Home and his wife Elizabeth always acted as a team. From the angle of my life and my profession I can think of no political pair who have made a comparable contribution to the interests of this country.
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para5"></a>On his 70th birthday we in the Foreign Office, with the assistance of Kew Gardens and Sir Anthony Acland, gave him 91 trees and plants to mark the variety of the countries he had visited on his official duties. They are now planted in the grounds of The Hirsel, his family home, for all to see in the years to come.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Norwich: </B>   My Lords, many years ago I was privileged to spend an evening with Lord and Lady Home at the home of one of my parishioners. I wish now that I could recall more of the conversation but even after 25 years the impression upon a young rector remains vivid&#151;a kind of wonder that this man of eminence should be such easy and delightful company. Before my hostess had a chance, he introduced himself as though he expected I would have no idea who he was. That simple and humble courtesy was of course characteristic. I remember regretting afterwards that I had not asked him more questions because, as those of your Lordships who knew him will remember, he was a generous listener who had the endearing gift of making one feel that what one said was interesting and important, even if it was not.
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para6"></a>Much has been made by journalists of his privileged upbringing. But it was not that which marked the man; rather it was his total and unselfconscious dedication to the service of his fellow human beings. That sprang of course from long family tradition, but beneath was a profound faith in God which was transparent though never exhibited. Nor was his faith merely the inheritance of a Christian upbringing. He valued the habit of churchgoing and spoke more than once of the benefit of habit closely allied to duty, that much derided virtue. He made his own journey of faith, not evading hard questions but, through a combination of intellect and <P>


<a name="column_570"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 570</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intuition, reaching not final answers but certainly a faith by which to live. In the final chapter of his autobiography, after expressing gratitude to his family, and especially to his beloved wife, he says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Finally I am glad that I was brought up in the Christian faith and provided with the hope of a God who is a Redeemer. I do not think I have been unduly influenced by the prospect, so to speak, of saving my own skin". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para7"></a>He was, in matters of faith as in all things, modest, but he was also, in faith as in life, a man of total integrity.
<P>

<a name="51016-02_para8"></a>Among those who share his faith and who had the privilege of knowing, even slightly, Lord Home, none can doubt that passing from this life he earned that simplest and noblest of all accolades, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant".

<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they plan to review the present NHS regulations on pharmaceutical prescriptions, under which pharmacists can appear to be in breach of regulations if they supply items at a charge lower than the standard prescription charge.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Cumberlege): </B>  No, my Lords, because we believe that although a standard prescription charge may mean that in some cases patients pay more than the cost of an item, in others they will pay less.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. In view of the reply to my Question on pharmaceutical matters during the summer months, when it was confirmed that 80 per cent. of National Health prescriptions are totally free, can she state what is the element of beneficial cross-subsidisation that results from this fixed charge for NHS prescriptions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, about half of the items that are charged at &#163;5.25 cost less and about half cost more. But the estimated average cost of each item is about &#163;8.80.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the main point is the one that she mentioned in her reply to the noble Baroness's supplementary question&#151;that more than half the number of existing prescriptions are charged at less than the NHS prescription charge? Surely this must lead to completely unnecessary administrative costs. The new Secretary of State for Health is, I understand, conducting a 90-day review of unnecessary costs and administrative burdens in the Health Service&#151;burdens which have presumably grown up under his predecessor. Will the Minister try to find a way to include the issue of prescription costs in that 90-day review?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I should like to make two points. It was the Labour Party which introduced prescription charges. In 1968 the Labour <P>


<a name="column_571"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 571</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Party re-introduced prescription charges. The charges raise &#163;310 million a year, which is the equivalent of 75,000 hip replacements and 235,000 cataract operations. It is income which the National Health Service sorely needs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, by how much would it be necessary to increase the national insurance contribution to cover the total cost of prescriptions? What administrative saving would be made by doing that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I do not have those figures with me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew8"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that a great many people on the poverty line who are not receiving income support, and thus the passported benefits, are going to pharmacists and saying, "What can I do without on this prescription because I cannot afford to pay for the whole of it?"? Can the Minister say whether any research is being conducted within the Department of Health to find a more equitable way of charging people? For example, some pensioners can afford to pay for prescriptions. Can she say what is being done?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, many groups of people are exempted from prescription charges. As my noble friend mentioned, 80 per cent. of the medicines dispensed do not attract a charge. With regard to old age pensioners, the Government have no intention of introducing prescription charges for old age pensioners.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I should be grateful if the Minister could respond to my point on whether or not prescription charges will be included in the 90-day review. The matter is particularly relevant because, as I hope the Minister will be aware, the committee on this subject in another place said that it wished to look at this whole issue and I believe that the Government's response was that they would examine the potential for change in the prescription charging area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the noble Baroness is, no. A fundamental review of health expenditure took place in 1993. The conclusion of the review was that the present scheme operates effectively, is well targeted and does not cause hardship.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has obviously done some research on prescription charges in order to deal with this Question. Can she say when the cost of the prescription began to outstrip the cost of the drugs? Is that a new phenomenon or did it happen some years ago?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, every year the prescription charge increases, but so does the cost of some of the drugs. Indeed, some of the drugs, for which people have to pay only the &#163;5.25 prescription charge, are extremely costly. For instance, some drugs for diabetes and for lowering cholesterol cost around &#163;70 a month. The recipient has to pay only &#163;5.25.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that whenever we are talking about prescriptions we should remind ourselves how successful our drug industry is?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Yes, my Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. Ten out of the world's top 35 medicines were discovered in the UK and more than one-third of all European biotechnology companies are based in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Fisher of Rednal: </B>   My Lords, how many asthma sufferers are without nebulisers, which ease their lives considerably, just because they cannot afford to purchase them? Cannot those items be supplied by the National Health Service? Many children, particularly in the Birmingham area, are suffering very severely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, children are exempt from prescription charges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, what is the position with regard to National Health Service general practitioners giving private prescriptions to patients registered with them when the cost of the drug concerned is below the prescription charge?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, it is open to GPs to offer private prescriptions to those who need their medicines.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask a follow up question to that asked by the noble Countess, Lady Mar. I understand that if someone feels unable to afford any form of National Health treatment, whether it be dental or ophthalmic treatment or a prescription, special forms can be completed for exemption from the cost. Does that apply to pharmaceutical products in the same way as it applies to medical and dental treatment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, we are anxious to ensure that people who need medication and who are on low incomes are exempt. Indeed, they are. As the noble Baroness said, 81 per cent. of all items are free of charge. That compares with 60 per cent. in 1979.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew12"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness put something right? Unless people are on income support and in receipt of passported free prescriptions they cannot have their prescription charges waived. People have to be in receipt of income support, or be over the age of 60 in the case of women and 65 in the case of men, or be children or suffer from special illnesses. There are people who cannot afford to pay for prescriptions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I believe that I made it very plain to your Lordships' House that there is an enormous number of exemptions. I believe that those on income support, family credit, the disability allowance and low incomes, etcetera, are exempt. We do not find cases of people being unable to get medication because they cannot afford it.

If Shell UK Limited requires an extension, it will need to seek the agreement of the Norwegian authorities.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for his reply. Because this giant storage buoy ended its working life four years ago and is liable to start breaking up, is not an early decision needed on its disposal, time already having been lost by the misguided and misinformed campaign by Greenpeace, although the deep Atlantic will probably prove still to be the best and safest option?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, Brent Spar is at present in relatively shallow water; it is safe and not subjected to any of the stresses of weather. What is important is that the right decision on its disposal should be taken. Our view was that on a case-by-case basis the most appropriate was deep-sea disposal. If Shell UK Limited comes forward with a proposal or any proposal is put to it for another means of disposal, we shall want to be satisfied that it is at least as good as the originally proposed deep-sea arrangement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, what will happen to the Brent Spar if Norway does not give an extension to the safe anchorage licence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, there is still some time to go before July of next year. As the noble Viscount will appreciate, Shell UK Limited has been very open about the proposals which it is prepared to consider. Indeed, it is inviting a further round of suggestions. It has received proposals for anything from a floating casino to a reef in the North Sea to provide cover for fish. It will be for the Norwegians and Shell UK Limited to come to an agreement if it is felt necessary to have an extension. Shell is properly asking anyone who has a better solution to come forward with it now. Clearly something will have to be done with Brent Spar in the fulness of time.

What are Her Majesty's Government doing to address the whole problem?

<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, we must not exaggerate the scale of the problem. Something like three-quarters of the platforms to be found in the North Sea are likely to be entirely removed and probably disposed of on land. That is because most of them are to be found in the shallow part of the southern North Sea. We have no doubt whatsoever that the only way to approach this matter is on a case-by-case basis. We should not have a broad policy. As regards Brent Spar, the clear conclusion of a deep-sea disposal was the right one. I believe that that is the right way to approach the matter. In the past we have taken the views of other signatories to both the Oslo and Paris Conventions. I believe that we were right to approach this case in the way we did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister agree that keeping the public in the dark over the negotiations between Shell UK Limited and the British Government has meant that the emotive arguments were much easier to harness, to the eventual disadvantage of both Shell UK Limited and Her Majesty's Government? Does not the Minister further agree that transparency would have avoided all that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I cannot accept for a moment that there has been any lack of transparency. In fact, before the decision was taken all the governments who were signatories to the conventions were advised. No one offered any objection to the proposed disposal agreed to by the United Kingdom Government and Shell UK Limited. It was only after Greenpeace occupied Brent Spar that attitudes changed. The noble Lord may have seen in an editorial in The Times last week that it was described as "environmentalist" headbutting by Greenpeace. I believe that, when one has regard to the cavalier disregard which Greenpeace had for scientific measurement of what remains on Brent Spar, that assessment was a touch generous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-03_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, since Brent Spar is neither a platform nor a rig and has no comparable duplicate in the North Sea, does my noble and learned friend agree that its eventual disposal should not be a precedent for platforms which are mostly steel towers without residues? As we are a maritime nation, and as we expect to be kept informed, can encouragement be given to the media to identify marine structures correctly, as would be done in distinguishing a liner from a battleship, a ferry or a fishing boat?

<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend makes an extremely valid point. That is why I believe that our approach of taking this matter on a case-by-case basis is the only correct one. I am not aware that there is any proposal to dispose of anything similar to Brent Spar. As my noble friend said, some of the structures are steel and others are concrete. We need to look at each individual case. What is clearly important is that because of what happened over Brent Spar the option of deep-sea disposal should not be rejected. All the sound reasoning that led us to the conclusion that it was the right one remains. I believe that my noble friend will be aware that the Research Council's advice to us has been that, even if Shell UK <P>

<A NAME="51016-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, can the noble and learned Lord assure the House that under no circumstances will the Government allow the Brent Spar platform to be brought to British shores if there is any danger either to those who will dismantle it or to those in the area where that is to happen, including the environment of the area? I hope that the noble and learned Lord will confirm that it is still the Government's view that the platform is disposed of in deep water in the North Atlantic, because I believe that that is the best solution and always was.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I am very glad to agree with the noble Lord. If there were to be disposal on land there would be risks to the workforce dismantling the structure. That appears to be the present advice. One of the most significant risks will be mildly radioactive scale deposits on the insides of the tanks. If they were to dry out and be released into the atmosphere as dust, I am sure that the noble Lord appreciates that the risk would be not only to the workforce but to other people as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor for that reply. Do the Government accept, in these belated trials on assumed extra-territorial jurisdiction already having retrospective effect for the best part of 60 years, that the judicial recommendation, which takes into account all relevant circumstances as to the time to be served before release from the mandatory life sentence, should be made in open court and should not be extended by the Home Secretary, there being no prospect of reoffending? Will the Government take an initiative to introduce pre-trial measures of safeguard to seek to ensure that under the inherent jurisdiction only fair trials may ensue, as approved by this House in Clause 3 of the War Crimes (Supplementary Provisions) Act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, perhaps I may take the second question first. The Government's belief is that the powers of the court to secure a fair trial in any case are available as regards cases under this Act. As <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, as at the end of September 1995&#151;so, strictly speaking, I am not reminding your Lordships of figures you have already had&#151;the Metropolitan Police costs were &#163;5,368,646 and the costs of the Crown Prosecution Service were &#163;1,463,800. Those figures relate to England and Wales. Costs in Scotland are in addition. As your Lordships know, the Lord Advocate indicated that, on the basis of the investigations made, there would be no prosecutions in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, if the solitary octogenarian who is now to be tried survives the trial and is convicted, what is to happen to him? Can he be sent anywhere other than to a prison hospital? Are not the figures which have been given a rather expensive indication of what that would cost?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, there were investigations other than that relating to this particular trial. My noble friend indicated that there would be a trial. I think that there may be issues to determine before a trial actually begins. They were referred to by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway. In any event it would be unwise for me to prophesy what might be the proper outcome in certain circumstances at the conclusion of the trial. The costs to which I have referred are the costs of the investigation and proceedings so far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mayhew: </B>   My Lords, are we to understand from the original Answer that we are unlikely to have further applications for prosecutions? If so, is the whole achievement of the Government in this area a single trial which may or may not take place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spmin4"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I am not certain that I regard as a measure of achievement in relation to the preservation of law and order the number of cases that are brought to prosecution. I had the privilege once of being in the United States and was told that New York City had given much extra money to the police but no extra money to the courts in respect of criminal prosecutions. The judge was very annoyed that there was to be no more money for the courts, but the police answer was that the money would be used to prevent cases ever reaching the courts because law and order would be so well preserved. Therefore, I do not think that that is a measure to apply to this matter. On the policy, the legislation was passed by Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Acts.

If we bear those facts in mind, we might have a more tolerant attitude on the question.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spmin5"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the matters to which the noble Viscount refers were debated in the course of the passing of the Act.

<A NAME="51016-04_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer, but I cannot say that I found it informative. The Minister will know&#151;for he has often told me so&#151;that the Government do not monitor the behavioural effects of disentitling people to benefit. The Minister will also know&#151;for he has often told me so&#151;that it is important to cost measures accurately. How can we cost the effects of disentitling people to benefit if we do not know what the behavioural effects of such disentitlements may be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, as I have explained to the noble Earl on a number of occasions, research into the behavioural aspects of benefit changes or the way in which benefits impinge on people is extremely difficult to conduct for a number of reasons, including one's ability or inability to obtain a proper control group. However, the Department of Social Security has an outpouring of statistical information on which it can base some of its judgments at least in these matters.

<A NAME="51016-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that those in the DSS are not the best people to evaluate the information which the noble Earl seeks? It is quite common knowledge outside this House among people who consider such matters, including people who are in the midst of crime or who are its victims, that disentitlement to benefit is high on the list of causes of crime, together with the effects of television and living on some of our housing estates. Those in the DSS are not the only people who should be evaluating such things. Indeed, in my view, the DSS is not the body which should do that. The Minister should be considering more scientific methods. Perhaps the police and the courts can help. Certainly, agencies other than the DSS should be involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, people become disentitled to benefit for a number of reasons. They may have found employment or they may have had employment while claiming benefit. They may have other income or their circumstances may change. Disentitlement to benefit takes a considerable number of forms. It includes people who do not, for example, take up the offers of YT places that are made to them. If such people become disentitled to benefit they have a way of re-entitling themselves to it; that is, by accepting the job prospects or YT prospects that are on offer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has indicated that he has a considerable amount of information on these matters from a number of sources and that the Government have made a number of judgments. Will the Minister assure the House that the Government will publish their judgments, supported by the necessary facts to which, apparently, they have unlimited access?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, for most of the past Session I have been not only publishing but explaining the Government's judgments on a range of Department of Social Security policies. We also produce statistics. One important statistic relating to 16 and 17 year-olds is that 72 per cent. of 16 and 17 year-olds in England are in full-time education today compared to only 49 per cent. in 1979.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister agree that the large amount of legislation we have had, which has resulted in reducing entitlement to benefit (the Jobseekers Allowance Act is the most recent example), will undoubtedly mean that more people will come off contributory benefit and go on to means-tested benefit? In view that, should we not know what happens to such people if they later become disentitled to means-tested benefit? Surely we should know the result of legislation which we pass in this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, as I have already explained, such things would be extremely difficult to quantify and research. Perhaps I may say also that anyone who becomes disentitled to, for example, <P>


<a name="column_579"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the jobseekers allowance has become disentitled because of a deliberate decision that that person has taken&#151;either not to take the jobs on offer or not to take the YT course on offer. It is not the Government or the taxpayer doing the disentitling, it is the people involved disentitling themselves by not obeying the entitlement criteria.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister recently drew my attention to the Government's reply to the Social Security Select Committee of another place which says that it is a Treasury instruction to other departments that they should consider the cost to the DSS of their measures. Is it an instruction to the DSS that it should consider the cost to other departments of its measures? If so, is it obeying it? If it is not, why not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, when in the DSS and elsewhere in government we are considering proposals for change we attempt, as well as we possibly can, to quantify the costs and savings which may arise from those changes. Indeed, in the course of the four pieces of legislation I have brought before your Lordships' House this year on a number of occasions&#151;a great number of occasions some of your Lordships may feel&#151;I have expanded on those costs and savings.

I feel guidance of that kind is to be honoured, of course, purely in practical terms, and I should be perfectly happy, with your Lordships' permission, to be guided by the noble Lord, Lord Houghton. If he would prefer this committee to continue, despite the inquiry which the committee in the other place is also conducting, I would be perfectly happy to see that happen. On the other hand, if he would prefer to withdraw it, I am equally happy. The respect with which the noble Lord is viewed in this House must make it his choice rather than mine.

<a name="51016-06_para32"></a>The noble Lord said: I thank the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for his co-operation in agreeing that it would be in the interests of the Committee to dispose of the issue of parliamentary control of <P>


<a name="column_584"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>delegated legislation before moving on to the content of the Bill. The noble Lord's first amendment was a paving amendment for his important amendments of substance, which no doubt he will be explaining.
<P>

<a name="51016-06_para33"></a>In moving Amendment No. 2 I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 3, 69 and 72. The purpose of this series of amendments is to draw the attention of the Committee to the 14th report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. It was published on 21st July and therefore became available only after the Second Reading debate on the Bill. In its report the scrutiny committee stated that the power to establish a scheme for compensation for criminal injuries is a delegated legislative power (paragraph 6); that important elements of the legislation and its administration are included in the scheme and not in the body of the Bill (paragraph 7); and that the Bill is unusual in that it does not make the document embodying the delegated legislation a statutory instrument and that the exercise of the majority of the powers would not be subject to parliamentary control (paragraph 9).
<P>

<a name="51016-06_para34"></a>In the form in which the Bill was passed by another place and debated on Second Reading in this Chamber only the tariff proposals were subject to parliamentary control. When, in Standing Committee in another place, an amendment was tabled on this matter the Minister of State declined to go any further. He said that the amendment was impractical as the scheme itself contained so many matters of routine detail and that it would impose an unnecessary burden on Parliament and introduce a cumbersome degree of rigidity. That view might be open to challenge but this is not the place to rehearse it because, spurred on perhaps by the amendments giving effect to the recommendations of the Select Committee tabled by my noble friends and myself and joined by the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, from the Liberal Democrat Benches, the Government have had second thoughts.
<P>

<a name="51016-06_para35"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has tabled amendments to Clause 10, which were printed only last Thursday. They concede parliamentary control over both the scheme itself, contained in Amendment No. 61, and any alterations in future to the provisions within the scheme, contained in Amendment No. 66. The decision is greatly to be welcomed. Perhaps the noble Baroness will confirm that, as I read her amendments, the affirmative resolution procedure applies to the introduction of the scheme and the negative resolution procedure applies to any subsequent amendments to the scheme. That seems entirely appropriate because there may well be a number of detailed amendments which are not suitable for the affirmative resolution procedure. If the noble Baroness can confirm those points, the main proposals of the scrutiny committee are met.
<P>

<a name="51016-06_para36"></a>The remaining points in the report of the committee can be dealt with briefly. Given the significance of the delegated powers, the committee recommended that the Secretary of State should undertake a process of consultation before formally laying proposals before Parliament in draft. That has been done. During the Recess copies of the draft Criminal Injuries (Tariff Based) Compensation Scheme were circulated. A number of Peers in the Chamber today will have <P>


<a name="column_585"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>received the draft, as did Members of another place who took part in the debates there. The draft was also sent to a list of interested parties, including Victim Support of which I have the honour to be president. In the case of Victim Support, the opportunity was taken to express views to the Home Office, and no doubt others responded as well. There has therefore been consultation as recommended by the scrutiny committee. I hope that the noble Baroness is able to confirm that Parliament will be notified in some way of any changes made to the scheme as a result of those representations. The process of consultation may not yet be complete, but when it is I believe it is right that Parliament should ask to be kept informed.
<P>

<a name="51016-06_para37"></a>The final point raised by the scrutiny committee dealt with transitional provisions. In paragraph 5 of the 14th report the Minister was invited&#151;I quote the language of the report&#151;to give an undertaking to keep the transitional period to the minimum. As she has been so willing to initiate action or proposals to meet the other matters to which the attention of the Committee has been drawn, I hope she will have no difficulty with this one either. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I rise to speak briefly as a member of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, to which my noble friend referred. Its 14th report on the Bill was published only on 21st July, the day we went into Recess.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para0"></a>I have been a member of that committee since it was created two or three years ago and on the occasions on which the committee has drawn attention to matters for the consideration of this Chamber the Government have almost always acknowledged the points and then taken action, proposed amendments or made changes. That has been gratifying. The action taken, to which my noble friend referred, is also encouraging because it is clear that during the Recess my noble friend and other Ministers have been looking at the points raised by the committee. Like my noble friend Lord Windlesham, I shall be interested to hear how far the amendments go in meeting the points raised in the 14th report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   In recent years there has been a growth of ministerial documents which are non-legislative but which purport to have legislative effect; for example, codes of practice, guidance offered under statute, departmental directives and, as in this case, schemes. Unless we are very careful, Parliament has no control over those ministerial documents.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para1"></a>Of course, if those documents are merely administrative or explanatory of legislation which has been approved by Parliament, that is all well and good. But if they purport to have a legislative effect of which Parliament has not approved, then we must be extremely vigilant. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Windlesham on his vigilance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Committee will be pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, on his introduction of these important matters and to acknowledge, as he does, the extent to which the Government have taken heed of the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, which are extremely welcome.
<P>


<a name="column_586"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 586</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para2"></a>As the noble Lord said in his opening speech, the issue of affirmative resolution appears from the later amendments to Clause 10 to have been covered very thoroughly. It is also the case that consultation has taken place. Indeed, the Minister was good enough to see me towards the end of last month and I know that the Minister and her colleagues have been accessible to quite a wide range of organisations concerned with the principle and details of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para3"></a>I am not sure that the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, which deal with the commencement and transitional provisions are not rather severe. They would require that the new scheme should come into force within a month of Royal Assent. That may be rather tough. Personally, I am reasonably satisfied with the indication that the new scheme should come into force on 1st April of next year. Although I fear that my later amendments have been tabled in the wrong place, they are intended to achieve that effect. No doubt we shall reach a suitable resolution of that final issue which exercised the minds of the members of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, was kind enough to say that I had agreed not to move Amendment No. 1. However, he did not say that as an experienced ex-Leader of the House. He made it clear that, if I did not so agree, he would move a manuscript amendment before Clause 1 which would pre-empt me. I do not think that I can get round the noble Lord that easily and I should not dream of trying to do so.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para5"></a>The implication of the debate on this series of amendments must be that on these issues the Government have been amenable to persuasion and reason in their consideration of the Bill. I cannot say the same about later amendments because it would be a mistake for the Committee to be given the impression that the Government's flexibility went so far as to cover a wide range of detailed amendments which we have tabled and which we shall debate over the next two days.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para6"></a>Of course, it is valuable for the detail of the tariff and the scheme to be subject to affirmative resolution. But I remind the Committee that, in itself, that is of very limited value because there is no opportunity for amendment. These are extremely detailed, amendable issues. From these Benches in this Chamber there is no opportunity to overturn the Government on an issue of delegated legislation. That is why we have tabled amendments to be considered in Committee which either bring on to the face of the Bill the enduring elements of the scheme without amendment&#151;&#151;that is, when we agree with them&#151;&#151;or which propose to bring them on to the face of the Bill with the amendments which we consider necessary. That will provide the House with an opportunity to debate all the details of the scheme. Therefore, the Committee stage of the Bill will no longer be a Committee stage of an enabling Bill. I hope that the Committee will recognise that the effort which we have put into the detailed consideration of the extremely complex elements of the scheme which have been published is essential to parliamentary scrutiny. I hope that the Government will be as flexible in <P>


<a name="column_587"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 587</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considering favourably the arguments which we shall put forward as they have been in responding to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   There is always a danger in being premature&#151;anticipating the speech of a Minister and assuming that what one wishes her to say will indeed be said. But I too welcome the amendments that are proposed by the Minister and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, on having the perspicacity to table the amendment and thereby encouraging the Minister in the course that she has adopted.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para7"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in regard to the shortcomings of affirmative resolutions. But it is certainly better that an affirmative resolution should be laid before the House rather than having no opportunity whatever to discuss the matter. I noted his caution, although expressed in a round-about way, about the idea of amending affirmative resolutions and, most important, occasionally voting against them. In due course I hope that if the House feels fit it will exercise that power, if necessary, on the right occasions. But I say that without prejudice to the welcome which I give to the steps which the Minister has apparently taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Windlesham for his introduction of the amendments. I hope that my reply will help to reassure my noble friend and others who have spoken. Perhaps I may say also, as a Minister speaking at the Dispatch Box, how much I value the work of the scrutiny committee because it makes us think very carefully about some of the reservations held by that committee. I believe that that work probably smooths the procedure of work through the Chamber.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para8"></a>The scrutiny committee seemed generally satisfied with the Bill's delegated powers, but drew the attention of the House to four points. I shall consider each of those in turn. First, the committee felt that the Minister might wish to give an undertaking to the House that the transitional period between Royal Assent and the start of the new tariff scheme will be kept to a minimum. I can give that assurance.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para9"></a>Our intention that the new scheme should start on 1st April 1996 has been known for a long time. That will allow just sufficient time for, among other matters, Parliament to approve the new scheme. That process will require the affirmative approval of both Houses; for the new authority and complementary appeals panel to be established; for the authority to prepare the accompanying guide to the scheme; for the authority to arrange the printing and distribution of the scheme, its accompanying explanatory guide, and all the new forms which will have to be brought into use; for the authority and appeals panel to arrange appropriate training for their staff and members; and for getting the computer system and other administrative procedures ready for the new scheme.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para10"></a>That represents a great deal of detailed work which will have to be undertaken quickly and efficiently. There is no realistic prospect of compressing that timescale; indeed, if Parliament were to delay, or even withhold, approval of the new scheme it could not be met at all.
<P>


<a name="column_588"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 588</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para11"></a>That is why it would be quite impracticable to accept the third and fourth of my noble friend's amendments. They would effectively require us to bring the new scheme into force within one month of Royal Assent. If we did so, we could not continue to operate the current scheme. I am afraid that that would leave the victims in limbo. I am not sure that we could even continue settling residual old scheme cases already lodged. But we certainly would not be able to accept new applications because there would be no scheme in operation under which they could apply. I am sure that my noble friend would not want to be held responsible for such a state of affairs, particularly, as he said, as he is president of Victim Support.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para12"></a>Secondly, the scrutiny committee commented that the House may be satisfied that the Bill sufficiently defines the essential elements of the proposed scheme, although important elements of the legislation and its administration will fall to be included in the scheme itself.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para13"></a>We think that we have achieved the right balance, particularly in view of what I shall say next. As Members of the Committee are aware, the Bill is essentially enabling legislation which enables the Secretary of State to make, subject to parliamentary approval, a scheme for compensating the blameless victims of violent crime. As the committee will have seen, the Government have tabled amendments to Clause 10 intended to give Parliament rather than the Executive the final say over all aspects of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para14"></a>As the Bill presently stands, certain key elements of the proposed new arrangements&#151;relating to the tariff itself and bearing on quantum&#151;will be subject to prior parliamentary approval before they can be incorporated into the scheme. Our proposed amendments go much further. They will require the whole scheme to be approved by the affirmative resolution procedure. Subsequently, any changes to the more important or key features of the new scheme would require prior parliamentary approval by the affirmative resolution procedure, while changes to any other features would require prior parliamentary approval by the negative resolution procedure. The Executive would no longer be free to make any changes whatever to the scheme without the prior consent of Parliament. I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that this represents a most significant change in the proposed control arrangements, giving Parliament the last word.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para15"></a>Thirdly, the scrutiny committee commented that, given the significance of the delegated powers, this Chamber may wish the Bill to require the Secretary of State to undertake a process of consultation before he can proceed formally to lay his proposals before Parliament in draft.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para16"></a>The Government have in fact already undertaken a process of consultation on the proposed new arrangements. We issued a draft of the proposed new scheme towards the end of August. That set out clearly, and in detail, the proposed rules and procedures of the new scheme. That draft had a wide circulation. It went to Members of both Houses of Parliament who had taken part in earlier debates, and a copy was placed in the Library of the House. It also went to the Law <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Society, the Bar Council, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, Victim Support, the TUC, the police representative bodies, and the equivalent bodies in Scotland. We have already received some useful comment on the draft proposals, and some of that is likely to be reflected in the revised draft of the new scheme which we shall now have to lay before Parliament under the procedures I described a little earlier.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para17"></a>Given that extensive consultation process, I do not think that there is any need to consult yet again in the way the scrutiny committee suggested or in the way that my noble friend's second amendment would require. We would be unlikely to receive any comment that had not already been made under the current consultation exercise, and a further consultation exercise would eat further into the time available to get the new scheme up and running by next April. As I explained earlier, that timetable is already a tight one. However, I can give my noble friend the assurance that he sought; namely, that any changes would be notified to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para18"></a>The fourth point that the scrutiny committee made was that the Committee might like to consider the case for allowing the delegated powers to be exercised by a scheme which was not contained in a statutory instrument. But the scrutiny committee went on to say that this Chamber may consider that Clause 10 confers an appropriate degree of parliamentary control of the exercise of delegated powers.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para19"></a>As I have just explained, since the scrutiny committee reported we have tabled amendments which would extend the Clause 10 powers and require the whole scheme to be subject to prior parliamentary approval by the affirmative resolution process. Again, I can confirm to my noble friend the fact that any subsequent amendments would also require parliamentary approval by either the affirmative or the negative resolution procedure, depending on whether or not they affected key elements of the scheme. I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that that confers the appropriate and necessary degree of parliamentary control.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para20"></a>I should perhaps say here that we see no compelling need for the scheme to be set out in a statutory instrument. We want the scheme to be easy for victims to understand, without recourse to legal advice which could be expensive and slow down the process. As far as possible, therefore, we want to use every-day terms that are readily understood. That would be less easy if we had to draft in the legal language and format necessary for statutory instruments. In doing so, we might inadvertently circumscribe any capacity for exercising common sense or a degree of discretion where that was appropriate and quite likely be to the victim's advantage.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para21"></a>However, I can assure Members of the Committee that not only will the negative and affirmative resolution procedure be used, but all the appropriate consultation in advance of any changes would also be followed. I hope that the Committee will share the view and agree that my noble friend's first amendment is neither necessary nor appropriate for a scheme of this nature. I also hope that Members of the Committee will agree that we have given most careful consideration to the <P>


<a name="column_590"></a>

<A NAME="51016-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I wonder whether I can persuade the Minister to take her argument just a little further. I must say right away that I am personally most grateful to the noble Baroness for sending me a copy of the scheme during the Summer Recess. As the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, it has been customary through the years for Parliament to establish such a scheme and then, after the scheme has been established and approved by Parliament, to appoint the authority.
<P>

<a name="51016-07_para22"></a>I should like to persuade the noble Baroness to give some thought to appointing the authority, if not the appeals panel, as soon as possible and then consult the authority which will be responsible for operating the scheme about the scheme itself. I accept the fact that the Minister and her officials have consulted widely. But would it not be a good idea in this particular instance if the authority were to be appointed as soon as possible and then consulted about the scheme? In that way, we could get away from the custom that Parliament has developed down through the years whereby the scheme is first introduced by Parliament and then the authority which will administer it is appointed. I hope that the Minister will give some thought to that aspect of the matter.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I understand the noble Lord's point. We certainly need to get on with such arrangements as soon as possible; and, indeed, appointing the authority is most important. However, so too is getting the scheme through all its statutory stages and the Bill passed with Parliament's approval of the scheme. As I have already spelt out, that process will tax all of us as regards ensuring that we meet the deadline of 1st April 1996. But, where consultation can be carried out&#151;certainly subsequent to the original scheme being placed before Parliament and approved&#151;I agree that it is absolutely essential that the authority should be the first point of consultation for any changes, however minor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Windlesham: </B>   The reply from my noble friend the Minister is entirely satisfactory. I regard it as a matter of some encouragement that we have been able to resolve the first issue with consent from all sides of the Committee. I shall not be moving my remaining amendments in the series&#151;that is Amendments Nos. 3, 69 and 72. What was said about transitional arrangements, not only by my noble friend but also by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was persuasive. The subject will no doubt be discussed again when we reach the later amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. But I shall not move any of the amendments in the series in my name and those of my noble friends. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51016-08_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: One ventures to hope that the atmosphere of consensus which has so far pervaded our debate may augur well for the future. It may be to the convenience of the Committee if, with this amendment, the Committee discusses Amendments Nos. 5 and 27 for a reason which I shall endeavour to explain later. The purpose of these amendments is to write into the Bill the definition of a key term. If we had been told prior to the introduction of this Bill that it was about criminal injuries and had then been informed that it would be necessary to write into the Bill by amendment a definition of the term "criminal injury", we might have expressed some surprise. Parliament is being invited to pass a Bill which does not define the very term which is central to the entire purpose of the Bill. It simply declares that the definition "may be specified".
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para3"></a>I doubt whether our anxieties would have been laid to rest if we had been told, "It is all right. After Parliament has passed the Bill and it is on the statute book the Government will produce a scheme to explain what they mean by the term which is the key to the whole thing". It is true, of course, that the noble Baroness helpfully circulated to a number of us the draft of the scheme in advance of this debate and for that we are grateful. I am sure, however, that she would not regard that as a substitute for placing in the Bill something which ought to be in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para4"></a>At Second Reading I ventured to question a matter which seems to have occasioned some surprise to the scrutiny committee&#151;the constitutional propriety of a Bill which has no content, just a series of blanks, and empowers the Government to fill in the blanks after Parliament has parted with the Bill. Surely, normal constitutional practice is for the Executive to submit a proposal to Parliament and then Parliament rejects it or passes it or amends it, but Parliament is the legislature and that is what is meant by legislating. Of course the proposal need not consist of every detail of the scheme. Lord Hewart back in 1929 thought that it should. He thought that subordinate legislation itself endangered democracy. He was a former Conservative Law Officer. They do not make Conservatives like that any more, and no one would now argue for so extreme a view. But what the Government are doing is to invite Parliament to pass a Bill which virtually declares that the Secretary of State may do as he likes. That is not legislating; that is signing a blank cheque.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para5"></a>Of course, as we were told at Second Reading, it is more flexible to leave it to the Government to make changes and amendments whenever they think fit. So it is, of course. A blank cheque is always more flexible than one in which the drawer inserts what he is agreeing to. The conclusion of that argument would be to abolish the legislature altogether and leave everything to the Executive. No doubt the Home Secretary would be rather in favour of such a proposal, particularly when the judiciary told him that it was a usurpation to introduce a scheme on the very subject on which Parliament had legislated while ignoring the conditions which Parliament had imposed. I remember that some time ago the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, spoke of a elected dictatorship. This is a legislative vacuum.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para6"></a>We are told that there will be an affirmative resolution and for that we are grateful. We are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, for having raised that matter so early in our proceedings. However, I hope we will be forgiven if we are not wholly comforted. We all know the shortcomings of subordinate legislation, even when it is subject to an affirmative resolution. My noble friend Lord McIntosh mentioned some of them a few moments ago: an unamendable scheme; a brief debate in the silent hours of the night. In this busy generation I suppose that must suffice for matters of detail, but that does not mean that Parliament must abdicate its legislative role in the very structure of what is proposed. We would wish to register our protest against this haemorrhaging to which parliamentary democracy is being subjected.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para7"></a>As to the definition of a criminal injury which we invite the Committee to write into the Bill, it is unlikely that there will be much controversy about that, because it is the Government's own definition in the draft scheme. Our quarrel is not with the definition. However, if it is ever to be changed we want to see Parliament invited to alter it by a proper constitutional process because it is a key term in the whole Bill. If some future Home Secretary decided to exclude half the crimes of violence to which the scheme applies, we want not merely to be told but to be part of the decision. To be informed that it will be subject to an affirmative resolution does not meet that anxiety. As to that part of the definition which relates to the place where the offence took place, we are content for that to remain in the scheme. There is room for discussion as to what is a matter of detail. However, we are troubled when we find that the definition of a detail is in effect everything which the Government may seek to do. Henry VIII might have approved of that, but Henry VIII, of course, is dead.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para8"></a>Finally, as regards Amendment No. 27, we suggested that that might conveniently be grouped with Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 because it is an example of what they are about. We have no quarrel with what the scheme proposes. We are saying simply that this is an example of matters which ought to be in the Bill. Our Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 say that in any event to have a Bill about criminal injuries which does not define the term "criminal injury" is a constitutional impropriety. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The aim of Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 is to bring onto the face of the Bill some of the more detailed provisions of the scheme itself, those which establish what constitutes a "criminal injury" for the purpose of the scheme, and those which provide for the payment of awards by structured settlements. We do not think that is either necessary or appropriate.
<P>


<a name="column_593"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 593</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para9"></a>Clause 1 of the Bill requires the Secretary of State to make a scheme for the payment of compensation to the victims of criminal injury. Among other things Clause 1 of the Bill requires the scheme to specify the meaning of "criminal injury". The substance of new Clause 1 draws heavily on the draft scheme we have published in this respect. The remaining clauses of the Bill set out various matters in respect of which provision must be made in the scheme, and also give a clear indication of the scope of the Secretary of State's powers by giving examples of particular matters in respect of which provision may be made. The Bill thus clearly sets out the basic parameters of the scheme but leaves the detail to be set out in the scheme itself made under the Bill's powers.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para10"></a>I propose to set out arguments which will apply to other amendments which seek to insert the detail of the scheme onto the face of the Bill. The Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee of this House was clearly not averse to this approach. As has already been said, in its fourteenth report it commented, among other things, that the House may be satisfied that the Bill sufficiently defines the essential elements of the proposed scheme. It also said that the House may consider that Clause 10-requiring approval of the most significant parts of the proposed scheme by the affirmative resolution procedure&#151;confers an appropriate degree of control of the exercise of the delegated powers. Since then, as the Committee will be aware from the amendments we have tabled to Clause 10, we are proposing to go further and make the whole scheme subject to prior parliamentary control by the affirmative resolution procedure. Subsequent amendments will also be subject to parliamentary control in the form of either the affirmative or negative resolution procedure, depending on whether or not the changes relate to key features of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para11"></a>I invite the Committee to consider the disadvantages of trying to put too much detail on the face of the Bill. That would be too prescriptive, too unwieldy and too inflexible, requiring further primary legislation to make any changes that prove necessary in the light of experience or changing circumstances. I should say here that although these amendments seek, by and large, to replicate in the Bill some of the detailed provisions of the draft scheme which was widely circulated at the end of August, it has already become clear from the very useful feedback we have been receiving that some of those provisions may need to be amended in the interests of clarity and accuracy. Thus, to incorporate such provisions in the Bill&#151;knowing already that some changes may well be needed&#151;would be irresponsible and could only work to the disadvantage of victims. On the other hand, there is no disadvantage to victims in not having the detail set out in the Bill itself.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para12"></a>It might be argued nonetheless that we should accept these amendments&#151;and similar ones&#151;and change them as necessary during the remaining stages of the Bill. However, as the Committee will be aware, there is very little time left, and I would not be able to give an assurance to the Committee that we would be able to get everything right in the time available, particularly as we are still receiving comments on the draft scheme which could necessitate further change.
<P>

<P>

<a name="51016-08_para13"></a>As an alternative it might be suggested that we accept the changes as drafted but provide a further power in the Bill to make any changes that subsequently prove necessary by subordinate legislation. I doubt that taking such Henry VIII powers would be regarded as acceptable. The Committee may agree that having gone to all the trouble of setting out a detailed scheme in primary legislation it would be inappropriate to allow it to be changed by secondary legislation. That would not seem to serve any good purpose. We think our approach is much better. It is pragmatic, sensible and transparent. That is important. In addition, it will not place victims at any disadvantage. Similar arguments apply to Amendment No. 27. That aims largely to replicate paragraph 42 of the draft scheme, which makes provision for structured settlements.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para14"></a>I have explained why we think it inappropriate and unnecessary to include such detail on the face of the Bill, and I would have asked the Committee to reject the amendment on that point of principle alone.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para15"></a>Furthermore, the substance of the amendment is unacceptable because it makes no provision for the cost of setting up the structured settlement to be met from the award. That would mean that the cost would have to fall on the scheme administration. That does not accord with usual practice and is not acceptable.
<P>

<a name="51016-08_para16"></a>I hope that for those reasons the Committee will reject the amendments if they are pressed.

<A NAME="51016-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   Before the noble Baroness resumes her seat, perhaps I may suggest that a simple solution to the definition of criminal injury could be to add the words "as may be specified in terms of the scheme". The scheme is defined in the next clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The point at issue is whether the definition itself should appear on the face of the Bill or be contained within the scheme. We argue that it should be within the scheme, and therefore that is where the definition of criminal injury should reside.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My noble and learned friend Lord Archer made the point very forcefully from this side of the Chamber that there may well be a simple solution. I declare an interest as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. All members of the board are very anxious to make sure that we have a scheme which is workable and understandable. We do not want to get involved in semantics. As has been indicated from both sides of the Chamber, we are trying to agree on a workable scheme. I was only trying to be helpful, but perhaps my noble and learned friend Lord Archer may not agree with me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   In moving the amendment the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, said that it merely repeated what was contained in the draft scheme proposed by the Government. Will my noble friend the Minister confirm that it repeats the existing procedure under the 1990 scheme and makes no difference in substance in terms of the definition of criminal injuries?
<P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para0"></a>While I am on my feet perhaps I may ask my noble friend a further question. The only substantial change to the scheme is proposed in Amendment No. 27 tabled by the noble and learned Lord, under which it is intended that there should be power to make structured settlements. At present under the criminal injuries compensation scheme there is no power to make structured settlements. Many of us who are members of the board have believed for some time that it would be in the interests of certain seriously injured victims if we had such a power. I ask my noble friend whether she can confirm that it is the intention of the Government, once the Bill has been passed, to permit the present board, in implementing the existing non-statutory scheme, to provide for structured settlements.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para1"></a>If my noble friend wants a moment or two to obtain an answer to that question, perhaps I may ask her a further question. Am I also right in saying that there is a change in the definition of mental injury, which is brought into line with certain decisions of the House of Lords as to the type of mental injury which will be compensated when the individual himself has not been physically attacked?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   This is the second Bill this Session under which a statutory phrase is to "have such meaning as may be prescribed". I well understand that, and the noble Baroness made it very clear why she likes that approach in this Bill. However, we should be very chary of conceding that type of draftsmanship. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, pointed out, the most essential phrase in the Bill is "criminal injury", and "criminal injury" is to "have such meaning as may be prescribed".
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para2"></a>The noble Baroness made it very clear that the Government may wish to tinker with the details. That is understandable. However, that drives us back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, earlier that we are allowing adjustments in the detail to be made by subordinate legislation; in other words by legislation which cannot be amended. I have felt for a long time that the unamendability of subordinate legislation particularly endears itself to Whitehall and is probably a sticking point. However, we ought to think very carefully about how far we accept provisions that require amendment and are intrinsically subject to the requirement of amendment, and indeed are called into being because they require adjustment and amendment, and whether such provisions should not be subject to some procedure whereby they can be amended notwithstanding that they are subordinate legislation.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para3"></a>Techniques are available. On occasion, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, has used a resolution procedure in relation to subordinate legislation asking that the Government take account of this or that. I am not sure that that procedure goes far enough, but it is necessary that where we have provisions which need amendment and which have been called into being because they need amendment, the amendments should be subject to parliamentary control in some way. At present we do not have that directly. What we have seen over the past decade or so is the gradual attenuation of parliamentary control over legislation; and that is a very serious matter <P>


<a name="column_596"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indeed. The arguments regarding flexibility are paraded every time. Nevertheless, Members of the Committee will not wish to be beguiled for all time into, in effect, surrendering parliamentary control over important areas of legislation.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para4"></a>Having said that&#151;it is only by way of warning&#151;I do not invite the noble and learned Lord to press the amendment to a Division. However, we should be very careful, very chary, as we go along that path. Officials in Whitehall should be warned that noble Lords are unlikely to put up indefinitely with the phrase that a statutory provision shall have such meaning as may be prescribed, or that a measure requires amendment and adjustment from time to time which, it is asserted, calls for a procedure which is unamendable.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para5"></a>I do not oppose the measure on this occasion; I believe that it may be a special case. However, there are few special cases. We should be aware of the path that we have trodden&#151;namely, a substantial abnegation of parliamentary control of legislation over the past decade.

<A NAME="51016-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   First, I am grateful to the Committee. It has been an important and useful debate. Perhaps I may say to my noble friend Lord Carlisle that I can give him all the assurances that he seeks. The definition of "criminal injury" is indeed a replication of the scheme as it stands. I can also say that when Royal Assent is given to the Bill the existing scheme will be amended to allow structured settlements for residual claims. I know that that is an important point.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para6"></a>There will be a change regarding the definition of "mental injury" in the interests of clarity if nothing else. I hope my noble friend will accept that I shall write to him on that. I shall copy my reply to anyone who is interested.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para7"></a>We have had the main debate about what should be on the face of the Bill and what should be contained in the scheme. We have the safeguard that the scheme itself, and the key points of the scheme&#151;this issue would certainly be regarded as a key point of the scheme&#151;would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and lesser points would be subject to the negative resolution procedure. On that the Government rest their case and hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I confess that I was a little surprised that the noble Baroness described the definition of "criminal injury" in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill as one of the more detailed provisions of the Bill. I was fortified that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, shared my surprise.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para8"></a>I wholly agree with the noble Baroness that one does not wish to put too much detail in a Bill. I am no disciple of Lord Hewart. However, how does one draw the distinction between what is detail and what is essential to the structure of the measure being undertaken and how should we retain control over changes in that structure?
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para9"></a>I was also a little surprised that the noble Baroness stated that one of the difficulties regarding the amendment was that, although we have accepted the Government's <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>own formulation, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, sought to confirm, the Government still wish to be in a position to amend their own formulation in the light of consultation. If the appropriate consultation had been carried out before the Bill was introduced, the Committee would not be confronted with such a difficulty.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para10"></a>I take the view that what we initially stated on this matter is still the case. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, pointed out, we have seen an attenuation of the powers of parliamentary control over legislation over the past decade. One can think of a number of examples even within the past two Sessions. We regard the issue as a matter of very real principle. I see no sign that the Government&#151;not even the Home Office, to whom one normally looks for an appreciation of or a sensitivity to the constitutional proprieties&#151;have taken that matter on board or that there is any meeting of minds on the subject. Therefore, although the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, suggested that I might think again about taking the opinion of the Committee, I believe that this is one of the essential matters of principle in the Bill and I propose to take the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord sits down, perhaps I may add one point. I suggest that he stated quite wrongly that the Government are putting the definition into the scheme because they may want to change it. That is not the reason why that definition is in the scheme. Should a change be necessary, it is important to recognise that we should have a faster track to allow that change to take place than we would have if the provision were on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="51016-09_para11"></a>It is true that in recent times changes have been made to the definition. Therefore it is a question of convenience, of the benefit being wholly in the interests of the victim and of getting the matter right. The long stop must be that at the end of the day with regard to any change, and in particular a change of this nature, the Government must have the last word.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   If I misunderstood the noble Baroness, I apologise. I thought that she was arguing that, because we are still carrying on consultations about the draft scheme, we may want to change what is in the draft scheme and therefore we do not want to put the definition into the Bill; that we may want to change the provision before anything is done under the scheme. That seems a different point from arguing that at some point in the future we might want to change the matter and would like to keep it flexible. The arguments are different in the two cases. On either limb it seems to me that the Government have not made out their case. If they are likely to want to change the draft scheme in the immediate future, the consultations and reflections should have been undertaken earlier. If they are talking about the advantages of flexibility, we are back to the flexibility of the blank cheque.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Perhaps the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, will reflect for a moment on what he says. It is a fact, I am sure he will agree, that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the current non-statutory scheme has been changed from time to time over the years to the advantage of the scheme. Does he not believe that if every desired change in future had to be by primary legislation, that is imposing too great a burden on the Government and on the scheme and that it is better to have the flexibility proposed by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I agree that we should have a degree of flexibility. That is why I attempted to draw a distinction between matters which should properly be left to flexibility and those which are part of the essential structure of the measure that Parliament is being asked to agree. I hope that the noble Lord does not seek to argue that the definition of "criminal injury" in a Bill on criminal injuries should be left flexible. That is the issue between us. That is why I seek to test the opinion of the Committee.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement on prison security that is being made in another place. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="51016-10_para6"></a>"I am today publishing the report by General Sir John Learmont into prison security. I am extremely grateful to Sir John and to his two fellow assessors, Sir John Woodcock and Mr. Gary Dadds, for their comprehensive and authoritative report.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para7"></a>"Let me begin by reminding the House of the circumstances which led me to ask Sir John to conduct his inquiry. In September 1994 six exceptional risk Category A prisoners escaped from Whitemoor Prison. I asked Sir John Woodcock to conduct an inquiry into the escape and I presented his findings to the House on 19th December last year. I also asked General Sir John Learmont to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of physical and procedural security in the Prison Service in England and Wales and to make recommendations.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para8"></a>"On 3rd January this year two Category A prisoners and one Category B prisoner escaped from Parkhurst. All three were recaptured on 8th January. I pay tribute again to the police for that successful operation.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para9"></a>"An immediate inquiry was carried out by the Prison Service Director of Security. As I told the House on 10th January, this immediate inquiry highlighted very serious deficiencies in procedural and physical security at Parkhurst. I asked Sir John Learmont to extend his inquiry to include an independent assessment of the events surrounding the escape.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para10"></a>"The report makes the most serious criticisms of Parkhurst and its management. On security procedures, Sir John found that the Prison Service's own security manual was disregarded and that the most basic security procedures were not observed. Sir John also makes a number of criticisms of the physical security of Parkhurst, including the failure of the Prison Service to provide the prison with the full benefits of technology.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para11"></a>"I am also publishing today the report of the inspection of Parkhurst by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Judge Stephen Tumim. The inspection took place in October last year and the report was submitted at the end of February.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para12"></a>"Judge Tumim also makes a number of severe criticisms of the situation at Parkhurst, including weak and inadequate security, unacceptable conditions in health care and drug dealing which <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 601</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>pervaded the whole sub-culture of the prison. There was a reluctance by staff to assert proper control in areas such as searching and accounting for inmates. The judge considered the problems were so serious that he wrote to the director general before he even left the prison, with a copy to me, drawing attention to the serious shortcomings he had found. As I told the House on 10th January, I immediately spoke to the director general and asked for a full report. He assured me that all Judge Tumim's recommendations had been implemented.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para13"></a>"Sir John Learmont recommends that Parkhurst should be taken out of the dispersal system as soon as possible and consideration given to its replacement by a more appropriate establishment (paragraph 2.179). I accept this recommendation. Parkhurst has not in practice operated as a dispersal prison since April when all Category A prisoners were removed from normal location. I have asked the Prison Service to identify another prison in the south-east of England to take Parkhurst's place in the dispersal system as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para14"></a>"Sir John's inquiry was not a disciplinary inquiry. Sir John has recommended to me that no disciplinary inquiry should be undertaken into the escape from Parkhurst. He is of the view that such an inquiry could finally break the resolve and commitment of many of the staff at Parkhurst, with the very real possibility that the secure running of the establishment could be severely compromised. He is also of the view that it is difficult to see what a disciplinary inquiry would achieve. In considering this recommendation I have been influenced by the fact that more than one of those concerned will not be staying in the Prison Service. I have therefore decided to accept this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para15"></a>"The Learmont report makes it clear that responsibility for the Parkhurst escape was not confined to management and staff at Parkhurst. On the contrary: the report says that,
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>'alarm bells should have been ringing throughout the Prison Service' (paragraph 2.255), </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para16"></a>and that many of the ingredients,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>'can be traced along the lines of communication to Prison Service headquarters'. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para17"></a>In his covering letter Sir John Learmont makes it perfectly clear that responsibilities ultimately reach the level of the Prisons Board and that is where criticism stops. Sir John has not found that any policy decision of mine, directly or indirectly, caused the escape.
<P>
<UL>
<a name="51016-10_para18"></a>"I turn next to the organisation of the Prison Service and its relationship with the central Home Office. It is now some two-and-a-half years since the Prison Service became a next steps executive agency. The decision to make the service an agency was taken on the recommendation of an independent inquiry conducted by Admiral Sir Raymond Lygo. Sir John Learmont does not recommend that there should be any change in the agency status of the Prison Service. He does recommend that someone with wide experience of the workings of agencies should undertake an in-depth study of the relationship <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_602"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 602</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>between the Prison Service and the Home Office. This work is under way and I shall report on it to the House when it is complete.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para19"></a>"Sir John's report makes 127 detailed and wide-ranging recommendations. I accept the broad thrust of Sir John's analysis. About half of the recommendations endorse actions that have already been completed, are under way or are already planned. I will deal today with Sir John's key recommendations and I will come back to the House with a full response in due course.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para20"></a>"A key recommendation of the report is that there should be one maximum security prison to house the most dangerous prisoners in the system. This was a recommendation first made by the Mountbatten Inquiry in 1966 and accepted by the then Home Secretary (who is now the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead). But the Radzinowicz Report in March 1968 recommended against it and it was not implemented. Since then the policy has been to disperse such prisoners among a small number of high security prisons. Sir John concludes that,
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>'the continuous development of explosives and weapons and their availability to criminals and their associates pose a much greater threat to the security of our maximum security prisons than the Service has previously encountered'. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para21"></a>He believes therefore that the most dangerous prisoners should now be housed in a purpose designed and built maximum security prison.
<P>
<UL>
<a name="51016-10_para22"></a>"This is a very far-reaching proposal which would represent a major departure in penal policy. The report makes a strong case for it. I have already asked the Prison Service to consider the feasibility, costs and benefits of building such an establishment and report to me in six months' time. The Prison Service will also consider Sir John Learmont's proposal for a single control prison to hold the most unruly and disruptive prisoners. I should welcome comments on these proposals.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para23"></a>"Sir John also recommends a fundamental review of the system under which prisoners are allocated to different security categories according to the threat to the community and the likelihood of escape. I accept that a review of this system should take place.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para24"></a>"Sir John also recommends that minimum physical security standards should be set for each category of prison. Work is well under way on bringing the dispersal estate up to the standards of security recommended by Sir John Woodcock. National standards exist for all new prisons. Decisions on the appropriate security standards for non-dispersal prisons will be based on the outcome of the review of categorisation.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para25"></a>"One particular aspect which I asked Sir John to consider was the extent to which visits should be closed. He recommends that there should be closed visits for exceptional risk Category A prisoners other than in exceptional circumstances. This coincides with the policy I introduced in June this year.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para26"></a>"I turn finally to Sir John's recommendations on the ways in which physical security is enhanced by activities and incentives. I told the House in December last year that the Prison Service would <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_603"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 603</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>introduce a national framework of privileges and incentives. That framework is already in place and implementation has begun. Sir John recommends that a system requiring early release to be earned, not granted automatically as at present, would be a significant additional inducement to good behaviour. Last week I set out proposals for ending automatic early release and for introducing a system of earned remission.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para27"></a>"But there are two issues on which Sir John and I must agree to differ. I reject his proposal that in-cell TV should be made widely available. This would not be consistent with my view that prison conditions should be decent but austere. Nor can I accept Sir John's proposal that home leave should be more widely available. In my view, the restrictions introduced earlier this year have an important role in protecting the public; and I have no plans to relax them.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para28"></a>"Sir John Learmont has found a great deal that needs to be put right within the Prison Service, spanning leadership, structure, the management chain and the ethos of the service. He says that responsibilities ultimately reach Prisons Board level&#151;and the criticism stops there.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para29"></a>"These comments, coming so soon after the Woodcock Report on Whitemoor, cause me great concern. I must be able to assure this House, and through it the public, that the grave weaknesses in the service which have been disclosed will be put right.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para30"></a>"I have come to the conclusion, with some sadness, that this requires a change of leadership at the top of the Prison Service. The present director general has served in his post for nearly three years. I pay tribute to him for what he has achieved. But I cannot overlook the serious criticisms in the report. I believe the service requires a change of leadership to carry forward the programme of reforms which is needed and to increase public confidence in the security of our prisons.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para31"></a>"The director general has accordingly ceased to hold his post with effect from today. The director of security will take over temporarily until a successor is appointed.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para32"></a>"I believe that this report will be seen as a major milestone in the evolution of the Prison Service. I heartily endorse Sir John's conclusion that:
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2> 'There is an abundance of excellent people within the Prison Service whose most fervent wish is to do a good and worthwhile job'. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
"The changes that I have announced today will help them to achieve that goal".
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para33"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_time2"></a><H5>5 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for repeating that lengthy Statement. Let me make it clear from the outset that I have not had an opportunity to study the report, but I have no reason to suppose that Sir John Learmont and his colleagues did their work in anything other than an <P>


<a name="column_604"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exemplary way. The fact that they produced 127 detailed recommendations covering a wide range of security issues in our prisons is evidence that their work must be taken extremely seriously.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para34"></a>I feel that there are three levels at which we should consider this report. The first is the particular recommendations. I have one or two questions to ask about them. The second level is the implied re-opening of the issue of the next steps agency status of the Prison Service. The third and, I believe, the most important level for our consideration today is the political responsibility: the relationship between the Prison Service and the Home Secretary and, through the Home Secretary, Parliament.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para35"></a>As I said, I have not had an opportunity to study the report or see anything other than the summary of the recommendations which is contained in the Statement. But if the intention is to explore over the coming months the prospects for a single prison for maximum security prisoners, we certainly wish to co-operate with such an inquiry and will be keenly interested in the results of such a review. Perhaps I may ask the Minister how long it will be before such a review takes place.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para36"></a>An important recommendation is on allocations policy. The Home Secretary has accepted the recommendation that there should be a review of allocations policy. My only comment on that is that many of the complaints about bad conditions and lack of security in prisons have arisen because allocations policies have been distorted by overcrowding in our prisons. That is the fundamental reason why, in many prisons&#151;not just Whitemoor and Parkhurst&#151;there are prisoners in locations where they should not be and where it was never intended that they should be. That in itself&#151;I ask the Minister to comment on this point&#151;is a potential security risk.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para37"></a>Is it not the case that the announcements made by the Home Secretary in his speech at Blackpool last week at least raised the prospect of a very substantial increase in overcrowding in our prisons? If our prison population is to increase by the 20,000 or so implied by the Home Secretary's statements, it will be many years before a prison building programme could accommodate those prisoners without affecting not just decent conditions but also bad allocations policy.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para38"></a>I notice that the Home Secretary feels free to pick and choose among the report's recommendations. Where he thinks that they fit in with the stance that he takes at his party conference, he leaps at them; but where they contradict his own judgments&#151;for example, in-cell television and home visits&#151;he rejects them without so much as an attempt at serious argument. He also claims that the abolition of automatic remission and its replacement by earned remission of sentence is an important part of his policy. That is not how I understood his statement last week, which seemed to everybody who read or heard it to be going much further than that in reducing the application of the parole system. The noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, whom I am glad to see in his place, in a devastating letter to The Times today has criticised some aspects of the Home Secretary's speech. So the Home Secretary has accepted some of the recommendations and rejected others. We <P>


<a name="column_605"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 605</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>look forward to an opportunity to have a full debate of the recommendations, which we certainly cannot have now.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para39"></a>The next question is whether it is right that the Prison Service should be a next steps agency. The Statement simply says that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sir John Learmont does not recommend that there should be any change in the agency status of the Prison Service". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para40"></a>But does not Sir John then go on to say that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"someone with wide experience of the workings of agencies should undertake an in-depth study of the relationship between the Prison Service and the Home Office"? </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para41"></a>Does not that imply that Sir John is unhappy about the relationship but is simply reserving his judgment on the issue until he has further evidence in order to help him take a position on it? I ask the Minister, when the review that has been recommended is completed, whether Sir John and his colleagues will be asked to reconvene and submit a report to the Home Secretary on that very important issue.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para42"></a>The final and most important issue is, above all, political responsibility. The Statement says that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sir John has not found that any policy decision of mine,"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para43"></a>that is the Home Secretary&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"directly or indirectly, caused the escape". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para44"></a>He says not once but twice that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"responsibilities ultimately reach the level of the Prisons Board and that is where criticism stops". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para45"></a>That is not good enough. The responsibility to Parliament for the Prison Service is the responsibility of the Cabinet Minster responsible for that service. He cannot shrug it off simply by saying that Sir John did not explicitly criticise the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para46"></a>Let us remind ourselves of what Sir John was asked to do. He was asked to conduct:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "a comprehensive and independent review of physical and procedural security in the Prison Service in England and Wales, and to make recommendations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para47"></a>He was not asked to investigate the issue of political responsibility. It is politically irresponsible of the Secretary of State to imply, because of the absence of such a criticism, that he has been exonerated. It is the Home Secretary who is responsible for the state of affairs in the Prison Service. It is not good enough for him simply to shrug it off by sacking Mr. Derek Lewis, against whom I have no personal animus at all, and claiming that he has no responsibility.
<P>

<a name="51016-10_para48"></a>If it is the case that we cannot secure parliamentary responsibility by our next steps agency system, so much the worse for the next steps agency system. If we can secure such parliamentary accountability and it is the Home Secretary who has been at fault, so much the worse for the Home Secretary. He is not let off the hook in any degree by this report.

<A NAME="51016-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, on behalf of these Benches I too thank the Minister for the Statement that she repeated in the House today. Clearly, this is a deeply alarming report. The Statement that has been given to the House is very far from reassuring.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para0"></a>The report was leaked to the Daily Mail last week and was referred to on the BBC in its early programmes today and discussed in detail in "The World at One". It <P>


<a name="column_606"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 606</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seems to me quite inadequate and an offence against Parliament itself that we did not have this report to consider before the Statement was made while others have clearly had an opportunity to examine it in detail.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para1"></a>I agree entirely with what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said on the question of parliamentary responsibility, the need to debate and the responsibilities of the Home Secretary in these respects. In repeating the Home Secretary's Statement, the Minister said there would be a full response in due course to Sir John Learmont's report. Can she tell the House when that full response is likely to take place? Though she was not able to give an undertaking to the House that there will be a debate, can she say to the House today that she will make representations to her right honourable friend that there should be a debate at an early stage when the response is available, if not before?
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para2"></a>We must all hope that Mr. Derek Lewis has not been made a scapegoat in any way. It is too soon to draw a conclusion. I say only that, according to his lights, he has done his best to serve the Prison Service during his period of office and there should be no personal animus against him. Clearly he inherited a situation which was far more difficult than he or anyone else could anticipate and there is every reason to believe that he has not had the support of the Home Secretary in those areas which should properly be his if the next steps agency is to function in the way intended.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para3"></a>In that respect it is interesting to read what is now proposed in regard to the Prison Service. The Home Secretary refers to the recommendations of Sir John and says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This work is under way and I shall report on it to the House when it is complete".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para4"></a>The Statement says that Sir John recommended that someone with wide experience of the agency should undertake the work. But who is undertaking the work? Is it a person of independent status or somebody who is responsible to a Minister who may well be less concerned with finding a solution to these problems than finding a solution acceptable to Ministers alone?
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para5"></a> Perhaps I may say, without being unreasonably mischievous, that the Minister may like to re-read her speeches of 25th January last. On that occasion we on these Benches raised the whole question of the relationship between the Home Secretary and the Prison Service. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, dismissed all our anxieties as being of no account. Now, less than one year later, because Sir John Learmont says what we were saying then, there is to be an inquiry. I welcome it. But the noble Baroness should look carefully at the way in which she dismissed what we said at that time as being of no account and matters which in some ways should not properly be the concern of this House.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para6"></a>I note also the way in which the Home Secretary selected the recommendations&#151;in so far as he declared his attitude to them&#151;by choosing those with which he agreed and turning down those he found to be inconsistent with his own policies. Again, a difficult question of responsibility arises. What are matters appropriate to the Home Secretary and what are matters appropriate to the Prison Service? If Sir John recommends in-cell television for purposes he sees as <P>


<a name="column_607"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 607</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>totally consistent with his report on security, it should not be for the Home Secretary to reject that recommendation because&#151;to use a phrase to which he attaches great importance&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prison conditions should be decent but austere". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para7"></a>On the question of home leave, Sir John proposes that it should be more widely available, but the Home Secretary says that he has no plans to relax the restrictions introduced earlier this year. That is a selective choice. If Sir John believes that the recommendations are consistent with higher security, then it follows that in rejecting them the Home Secretary is not adopting the course that Sir John believes to be in the best public interest.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para8"></a>I have one further question for the Minister relating to the cost of the proposals that Sir John Learmont is putting forward. On the face of it a large sum is involved and it would be interesting to hear the Minister say today that, whatever the cost of implementing the recommendations, there will be no delay in doing so. I appreciate that the Minister and the Home Secretary, in deciding how much can be allocated and how much the Chancellor may be asked to bring forward to implement the recommendations, must also have in mind the proposals put forward by the Home Secretary in his Blackpool speech a week ago. If indeed it is the case that the restrictions he then indicated (the intervention he made in matters normally left to the judiciary) will result in an increase in the prison population of 10, 15 or 20 per cent., that will be a large addition to the cost of the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para9"></a>Again, it will help us to assess the relevance and the likelihood of the implementation of Sir John's proposals if the Minister can tell the House today what estimates the Home Office has made already in relation to the cost of implementing the proposals set out one week ago by the Home Secretary. We cannot judge the importance of the Home Secretary's Statement and the expectation we have of the implementation of Learmont except against the wider cost of the Prison Service which the Home Secretary now anticipates. I hope that in replying to these questions the Minister will give the House at least some provisional figures. They must be available and they should be the property of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I understand the difficulty, with such an important and detailed report, of responding to it in any kind of detail in the time allowed, and am grateful to both noble Lords for what they have said so far. Perhaps I may address some of the points raised by the report.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para10"></a>First, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, asked about the timetable for the "supermax" prison. A feasibility study is already under way examining the supermax principle and its impact on the remainder of the prison estate. The Home Secretary expects to receive a report in six months and a decision will then need to be taken as to the way forward.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was concerned also about the impact of the Home Secretary's new proposals on the population within the prisons. That will depend very much on the sentencing decisions of the courts. Of <P>


<a name="column_608"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course we expect there to be some increase in the size of the prison population as a result of that change. There is already a substantial building programme. It is difficult to assess the demand for places. Some will be needed but I would expect a significant deterrent effect and incapacitation of those locked up to moderate that.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para12"></a>It is also important not to exaggerate the requirement. It will need to be assessed once consultation is concluded on the details of the proposals. It is worth noting how much work has been done on reducing overcrowding in prisons. The Prison Service has done much to deal with increased population. There have been 22 new prisons since 1980; 11,635 new places have been found and 8,000 extra places at existing prisons. There is no evidence of that having a negative effect on security.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para13"></a>Much has been said about the Home Secretary's responsibilities for policy and his role in all this. I am reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, of the exchange we had on a previous occasion in regard to the role of the Home Secretary. At no time did I dismiss the anxieties people felt about this matter. They are legitimate anxieties and it is a legitimate question. But if he goes back to the records he will find that I was more concerned with the tone and some of the accusations being made by the noble Lord at that time.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para14"></a>There is no doubt that the Home Secretary is accountable to Parliament for the Prison Service. I believe he has carried out that accountability with considerable openness and much candour. It is not an easy situation and some of the decisions to be taken will not be easy. But he has never shirked from taking difficult decisions and certainly will not shirk from taking them at this stage. I thought it was entirely characteristic of my right honourable friend to come clean straight away and not to delay on the recommendations. Out of 127 he immediately wishes to reject two and it was right that he should say what they are. He says&#151;and I agree with him&#151;that in-cell televisions should have no place in prisons. He believes that the privileges sought in prisons should be earned and not given automatically as they are at the moment. The changes that he made recently in regard to home leave are beginning to bear fruit and the record is there for all to see.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para15"></a>Reference was made to the agency status of the Prison Service and it was suggested that it had failed. I do not believe that it has failed. With agency status the service is responsible to a far greater degree for managing its own affairs than it was when it was simply another part of the Home Office. Its objectives and its expectations are quite clear and are published. It has a greater degree of accountability both to Parliament and to the public.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was concerned about implementing Sir John's advice that there should be a more arm's length relationship between Ministers and the Prison Service agency. Work has already started to look at the relationship between Ministers and the Prison Service agency and my right honourable friend will be considering Sir John's recommendations in the light of the outcome of that work. But while Ministers and the Home Secretary are accountable to Parliament for the <P>


<a name="column_609"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 609</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>running of the service it is important that they have good liaison with the service in order to be able to fulfil that role effectively.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, was concerned about accountability. The Prison Service's framework document makes it clear that the director general is responsible for the day-to-day management of the service. However, the framework document also makes it clear that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is to be consulted by the director general on the handling of operational matters which could cause grave public or parliamentary concern. In that sense my right honourable friend is accountable to Parliament as are his Ministers.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para18"></a>I was asked how long it would be before we give a full response to the report. My right honourable friend says that he will place an implementation plan in the Library as soon as he possibly can. I attach top priority to implementing recommendations, as indeed does my right honourable friend, which directly bear on security. That has to be the priority. My right honourable friend has already given another place his initial response to Sir John's principal security recommendations and I have had the privilege of repeating that here today.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para19"></a>I believe that I have responded to at least some of the points made. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, asked for a debate. That must be a matter for my noble friend the Leader of the House and the usual channels. The House will want to debate this matter at some time and I do not believe that I would be giving too much away in saying that the request for a debate will be received sympathetically.
<P>

<a name="51016-11_para20"></a>Questions were asked about costs. I hinted in the Statement that work is being done on costs. My right honourable friend will keep Parliament informed of any detail about costs and any consultation documents issued will include costs.

<A NAME="51016-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that concern over the substance of the report is not confined to the other side of the House and that, on the contrary, there is considerable anxiety among her noble friends? Will she add a word to what she has just said about the desirability of a debate? I would suggest to her, with respect, that an early debate, during which the views of noble Lords on both sides of the House can be considered in conjunction with the other ideas which are put forward, would be valuable. Although I know perfectly well that my noble friend the Leader of the House shudders when noble Lords ask for a debate&#151;

<A NAME="51016-12_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   Oh no.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I am delighted to have that reassurance, however surprising. An early debate would be a very great advantage in enabling your Lordships' House to influence the discussions at an early stage. I beg of my noble friend to use her influence and good will to secure that such a debate takes place.
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para0"></a>There is only one other point on which I would ask my noble friend to expand a little. She touched on the effect of home leave on some of these issues. I should <P>


<a name="column_610"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 610</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be very grateful if she would explain whether, as I believe to be the case, there are a very considerable number of offences committed by prisoners on home leave, and if that is so whether it is intended to restrict that development very considerably so as to prevent the commission of those offences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that the substance of the report is a matter of concern to all sides of the House. Therefore, I have no difficulty in accepting that point. Secondly, the request for a debate is noted. I have to pray in the defence of my noble friend the Leader of the House that he is the soul of reasonableness. I know that he is listening to all the requests about an early debate.
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para1"></a>My noble friend is right when he refers to the issue of home leave. The protection of the public from people who go free from prison, sometimes on parole or on early release, and commit further crimes is one of the factors which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary took into account. That is an important point. When my right honourable friend announced the new rules governing temporary release from prison, which made the protection of the public of paramount importance, the changes resulted in a 50 per cent. reduction in grant of temporary release from prison. In 1994-95 there were 1,600 temporary release failures. So far this year, with the new changes, there have been only 500. That is a fall of 80 per cent. I believe that the Home Secretary needs to be congratulated on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Windlesham: </B>   My Lords, I have met Derek Lewis, the director general of the Prison Service, on a number of occasions. He struck me as a conscientious and able man working in exceptionally difficult surroundings. I regret the circumstances of his departure. As chief executive of a next steps agency, the director general of the Prison Service is expected to exercise operational control. But there is ample evidence, as anyone with any connection with the prison system is aware, of a marked reluctance of Home Office officials and Ministers to let go. To some extent that is inevitable. One can see the reasons. The Home Secretary regards his ministerial responsibility for the prisons as a delicate and sensitive one. There is the question of presentation as well. So the report raises a question that has caused anxiety for some time. Is agency status, whatever that may mean, something that can be reconciled with ministerial responsibility, or does it blur the issue of where responsibility lies?
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para2"></a>The relationship between Ministers and the Prison Service is now a matter of urgent public importance. I am pleased to hear that it is to be reviewed, although some of the remarks made just now by the noble Baroness make the heart sink. She said that within the principle of agency status the director general is responsible for day-to-day operational decisions until, I paraphrase, it looks as though there are going to political implications. Then the Home Secretary is responsible. That is a circle that cannot be squared.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend makes important points. I made the point in the Statement, and I repeat it now, that much has been achieved by Mr. Derek Lewis as the director general of the Prison <P>


<a name="column_611"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 611</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Service. My right honourable friend meant that phrase when he put it into the Statement. But it is also true that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary cannot possibly ignore some of the very serious criticisms contained within the report. Therefore it was very important that he took those criticisms seriously.
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para3"></a>My noble friend referred to agency status and asked whether it can be reconciled with the proper management of the service. What is important&#151;I alluded to this in the Statement and it is work that is in hand&#151;is that the relationship between the Home Office and the service and Ministers and the service is in need of review. That is being reviewed. But as long as Parliament wishes the Home Secretary to be accountable for the service&#151;it is reasonable to expect that no Home Secretary of whatever party could possibly be responsible for the day-to-day running of the service&#151;there has to be a proper review of how those two relationships can be reconciled in a way that allows the service to be run properly and Parliament to be properly accounted to for the running of the service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the former Chief Inspector of Constabulary, in his first report on this series of episodes, pointed out that it was impossible for people within the service to understand the distinction between operational and policy issues? That was in his report. Is the noble Baroness aware that this problem will not be resolved until the matter is clarified?
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para4"></a>In that context, can the noble Baroness answer the question raised by my noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. Who is going to conduct the review? Is it to be someone who is wholly independent of government or an official? It would be helpful to have a response to that question. Is the noble Baroness aware that most of us recognise that prison escapes will take place under governments of any political party? The question is how Ministers respond to those critical situations. If a belief begins to establish itself among prison governors in particular that there will be a relentless search for scapegoats after such episodes, that will do grave damage to the morale of the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para5"></a>One of the unsatisfactory features of the Statement, as my noble friend Lord Rodgers pointed out, is that this report was leaked to the Daily Mail and obviously quite deliberately. It occupied a great deal of the news on "The World at One" today, yet none of us has had the opportunity of looking at the report. The Statement made by the noble Baroness is a summary. For instance, we have no idea why the author of the report suggested in-cell television. It will be extremely interesting to have an answer to that question. As we have not had an opportunity to read the report, we are put in an impossible position. All we know is that the recommendation has been made and rejected because it is not consistent with what the Home Secretary said in a statement earlier this year. It seems to me pretty odd to ask a distinguished man to conduct an inquiry of this sort and simply to disregard one of his principal recommendations in the way that has happened.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, as regards the first point made by the noble Lord concerning the relationship between the Home Office and the service, there always will be a tension. Perhaps I may remind the House that very often when we switch on the radio in the morning or read the newspapers, something quite dramatic has happened in the community; for example, a prisoner has murdered someone while on early release. Whatever the incident may be, it is very important that Ministers seek information from the service in order to account to Parliament or to deal with what is a public safety and protection issue on the day. How that is done gives rise to possible ministerial interference. I notice that there is a passage in the report which refers to a meeting which was being held with the director general within the course of a day and where that meeting was interrupted a number of times by a Minister seeking information. That information was as a direct result of having to come to the Dispatch Box in Parliament and answer questions. There are legitimate reasons when the relationship is under tension. It is right that the matter should be properly reviewed and its outcome reported to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para6"></a>As regards the leak, I am almost offended by the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, that it was deliberate. I cannot tell you the lengths to which we have gone as Ministers&#151;to the point that I had not had a copy of the report until today when I was answering for it at the Dispatch Box&#151;because of the sensitivity of the people involved, if for no other reason. It was wrong that the report should be peddled publicly before we had the opportunity to come to Parliament. I can tell the House that my right honourable friend is also very concerned about the fact that we heard about the report publicly over the weekend.
<P>

<a name="51016-12_para7"></a>I am sorry that I did not come to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, about independence. It is an important point. I can assure the House that the review will be independent as regards the relationship between the Home Office and the service. The work is already under way. The report will be independent of the service and the Home Office, but I cannot give names. If it is possible to do that following this debate, I shall do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may raise a matter with the noble Baroness which so far has not been referred to; namely, the need to reassure those who reside in the area of the prisons concerned. Is the noble Baroness aware that one of the main features of prison policies is to reassure local residents who live in the area of these establishments? What measures are being taken to reassure in particular the residents on the Isle of Wight? Am I correct in saying that on the island there is not one institution but three, built and running side-by-side, with a very high number of dangerous prisoners contained within them? Has not the time come to reconsider the policy of concentrating so many high risk prisoners in such a small geographical area? Can the Minister reassure people, particularly those living on the Isle of Wight, that the Government will treat this as a matter of great urgency? I have to say to the Minister that many of the aspects to which she has referred today are long term and not short term in terms of reassuring the local population.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I regard that as an extremely important point. If the noble Lord recalls the Statement, I made it clear that Category A prisoners were removed some time ago from that particular prison. There has been a policy of dispersing the most serious criminals to a number of locations. That is the very policy being criticised by Sir John Learmont in his report. Sir John is suggesting that there should be one geographical location but in a maximum security prison specially designed to contain the prisoners and protect the public.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para0"></a>As regards the important point made by the noble Lord about the residents of the Isle of Wight, I can certainly give an assurance that they are safe. Again, referring to the Statement, many of the changes announced by Woodcock needed to be made quickly. They are almost all complete. That work is very much in hand and it is continuing apace. As I say, for the moment, Category A prisoners are not on the Isle of Wight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may return to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, with which the Minister agreed; namely, the repeated leaks to the media and the press before Parliament is informed. We hear morning after morning that the BBC has acquired information followed by discussion about a matter which should be first brought before Parliament. It cannot be beyond the ability of intelligence within the Government to discover how that is happening. It is outrageously unsatisfactory from the parliamentary point of view. It is regular; it is not an occasional happening. We have to register the fact that the situation is totally unsatisfactory and that action should be taken to stop it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness. It is an important point. My heart sinks when we go to such lengths to keep a matter confidential until Parliament has actually heard the case. I am as disturbed as the noble Baroness. One of the difficulties with this kind of report is that a very large number of people have been interviewed as a result of it and have made statements to Sir John in the course of the investigation. Consistent with convention now, a large number of Salmon letters were sent out to people who have been interviewed as part of the investigations, and perhaps critically. Therefore, they are given the opportunity to respond to the criticism and to any inaccuracies which they pick up in the report. They are then considered by Sir John before the report comes to Parliament. So it is very difficult to pin down that someone who has been party to the inquiry and who has a fairly good idea of what is going to be contained in the report has not actually pre-empted the announcement. I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness's basic point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the Minister for repeating the Statement and reiterate the calls made from other parts of the House for a debate on the report. The question of a "supermax" prison&#151;I believe that that is how the Minister described it&#151;needs careful consideration. That will not form part of my questions this afternoon, but we shall obviously need a debate on the subject.

<a name="51016-13_para1"></a>My question is: what alternative steps will be taken to protect prisoners' families, prison staff and the community at large, given that the Government have apparently taken significant decisions that fly in the face of the report's recommendations? I refer particularly to in-cell television and home leave. I think that we would all accept the validity of having in-cell television in order to prevent idle minds getting up to mischief. I am sure that we would all also accept the importance of home visits when it comes to reintegrating prisoners into society and family life. Therefore, what alternatives to in-cell television and home leave are to be provided?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, on the noble Lord's final point, many privileges can be earned in prison. I have visited a number of prisons where the system of earning privileges works well. I have visited a prison in the Channel Islands where prisoners start with a basic level of provision and almost everything they receive is earned by good behaviour in the prison. However, those privileges do not extend beyond radios in the cells. They do not extend to television. The principle of privileges having to be earned as opposed to being given automatically seems an inducement to good behaviour. If prisoners are better behaved, that makes life easier for those running the prisons. We know to our cost&#151;this is behind much of the Parkhurst report&#151;that in the end the policy of appeasement never works.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para2"></a>I hope that your Lordships will accept a correction of something that I said earlier. I must put this on the record. In answer to an earlier question, I said that there were no Category A prisoners on the Isle of Wight. I am told that there are no Category A prisoners in normal locations but that there are some in the segregation and psychiatric units at Parkhurst which are secure. Therefore, as I was seeking to say, residents of the Isle of Wight can sleep safe in their beds. I hope that your Lordships will accept that correction.

<a name="51016-13_para3"></a>House again in Committee on Clause 1.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para4"></a>[Amendment No. 5 not moved.]
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para5"></a>Clause 2 [Basis on which compensation is to be calculated]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 4, after ("compensation") insert ("or an amount within a defined band of compensation").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-13_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to propose that, within the tariff system, instead of having merely one specific figure for each type of injury, there should be as an alternative for certain types of injury a band of figures from which the appropriate amount of compensation may be chosen.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para7"></a>In declaring an interest as the present chairman of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, perhaps I may say that in moving this amendment I in no way depart from the view that I expressed originally that it is sad <P>


<a name="column_615"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 615</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we are moving away from the common law system of damages to a tariff system as a whole. As has been said on many occasions, a tariff system is unable to take account of the very different effects of similar injuries on different people. Such a system can take no account of age, occupation, sex, way of life or other obvious matters which should be taken into account when deciding compensation. I shall not repeat those arguments today because the House has had two opportunities to debate these matters and our views were expressed then.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para8"></a>As I said on those occasions, I recognise that there is a need for change and that one cannot say that a system that is now required to deal with 70,000 cases a year can be the same as that which was required originally to deal with 3,000 cases a year. Therefore, I recognise and accept&#151;although I regret it&#151;that the tariff system is probably necessary in the vast majority of cases. At the moment, in something like 85 per cent. of the cases dealt with by the board the award is less than &#163;5,000. Many such cases are straightforward. I accept that given the need for simplicity and speed there is an argument that there should be a tariff system, as proposed in the Bill, for a general type of injury. We could have tariff compensation for those who suffer a broken nose, broken arm or broken cheekbone.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para9"></a>However, I still believe firmly that there are certain types of injury or certain offences for which a single tariff figure is, frankly, so unrealistic as to become almost unworkable. The purpose of my amendments&#151;the others are consequential on Amendment No. 6, which I am now moving&#151;is not merely to accept the principle of the tariff system which the Home Office is proposing and which has been accepted by this House and another place and to accept that there should be published figures for types of injury, but to say that for certain types of injury there should be bands with a lower and a higher figure within which the individual claims manager&#151;I think that that will be his title&#151;can decide on the proper amount of compensation in the case in question.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para10"></a>I should like to give the Committee the four examples&#151;one might say the three areas&#151;for which I believe that such a system is necessary. I urge that this be considered by the Home Office. I refer to scarring cases, to cases involving mental shock, to sexual abuse cases and, perhaps as a further category, to cases of abuse against children.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para11"></a>In my submission, it is not realistic to believe that scarring cases can adequately be dealt with by a single figure. In the tariff which the Government have provided, it is intended that so far as facial scarring is concerned there should be three categories. I accept that that is done in an effort to make distinctions. The three categories are minor disfigurement, significant disfigurement and serious disfigurement. The difference between "significant" and "serious" may be a question of semantics to some extent, but amounts apparently to &#163;4,000. If you suffer significant disfigurement, you get &#163;3,500, whereas, if you suffer serious disfigurement, you get &#163;7,500. One knows from experience on the board that the effect of scarring, particularly facial or <P>


<a name="column_616"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 616</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>visible scarring, varies enormously with different people. It is absurd to suggest that substantial and clearly visible scarring on a young girl of 17 or 18 does not have enormous emotional effects as well as physical effects compared to such scarring on someone of adult or even elderly age.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para12"></a>In fairness to the individual, that is one of the areas in which there should be a band within which people should attempt to put the individual rather than suggest that they can fall into those three categories. It may be that &#163;7,500 just is not enough for the really bad case of scarring. Those cases should be looked at by photograph and, where necessary, by seeing the person concerned. There should be a wider area of choice than that which exists.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para13"></a>I move on to the three other areas that I mentioned: mental anguish, mental injury, and shock. Those cases differ enormously depending upon the make-up of the individual concerned. With the best will in the world, I recognise that the Home Office has accepted&#151;it has had to accept, though it may be a bad acceptance&#151;and has attempted in its most recent tariff to meet the board's own recommendation as to how, if it is to be done by a tariff, a tariff should achieve that end. However, we still believe that a tariff is not appropriate. To say that the compensation for a disabling mental disorder which lasts for over one year but which is not permanent is &#163;7,500, and then to say in the next breath that the next step is that the amount for a permanently disabling mental disorder is &#163;20,000, is far too wide a gap.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para14"></a>I do not believe that the proposals I am advancing&#151;if the Home Office is concerned, as I understand it is, about the costs of the scheme&#151;need necessarily increase costs in any way. For example, if one takes the case of mental shock, one could say that the compensation should be up to whatever the figure is in the tariff at the moment. What I believe&#151;and what I believe experience has shown in the past year when we have had to review the cases that were carried out under the aborted tariff which the Home Secretary attempted to bring in&#151;is that a great many awards of public money are being given which are far more substantial than were being given under the board and far more substantial than we would have recommended in those cases.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para15"></a>Then there is the whole area of sexual abuse. How can one have a single tariff figure for abuse of a child? Is the effect the same if the child is four or if it is 14 or 15, and conscious of what is happening to it? The suggestion is that if the severe abuse is for less than three years&#151;however many offences within that time, and whatever effect they may have&#151;the victim will receive only &#163;3,000 whereas if the child should be shown to have been abused for just over three years it will receive &#163;6,000. It is not a question of the length of time for which the child is abused. It is the relationship with the abuser, the type of abuse, and the effect on and the age of the individual child and its emotional development. Again, it is unrealistic to look at the matter on a single-figure basis.
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para16"></a>Finally&#151;I know that this is always highly controversial, and I tread warily into this field of adult sexual offences&#151;I notice now that for rape there are <P>


<a name="column_617"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 617</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be two figures: for non-consensual vaginal or anal intercourse &#163;7,500, and for non-consensual vaginal or anal intercourse with other serious bodily injuries&#151;whatever those bodily injuries are&#151;the figure jumps to &#163;17,500. Surely, again, that cannot be right. Of course there are some rapes of extreme degrees of seriousness, but often a rape at gunpoint or knifepoint without any physical injury to the individual concerned is just as serious as when that knife inflicts the slightest wound, which presumably would take it into the field of being "other serious bodily injuries".
<P>

<a name="51016-13_para17"></a>Therefore, what I would ask the Home Office to consider, and what the board has repeatedly asked the Home Office to consider once we accepted, as we do, that the Home Office was determined to stick to the principle of the tariff&#151;it is not inconsistent with the principle&#151;is whether in certain areas of what I would call generic offences a band of figures would not be more appropriate than a single figure. That is the purpose of my amendment. It is for the purpose of obtaining debate on that issue that I put it down today so as to hear the views of other Members of the Committee on what I believe is a proposal which would improve the tariff system as now proposed by the Government. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   I have already declared an interest in this matter. I have heard the observations made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, and sympathise with his approach to the matter. He and I have had discussions with other members of the board over a considerable number of years and also with the Home Office and various junior Ministers to try to achieve some system that will do justice to the victim. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about the technicalities of the system. The important person is the victim.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para0"></a>Having listened to what the noble Lord had to say, it occurs to me that one of the difficulties with his amendment might be&#151;I underline the words "might be"&#151;that once there is a band everyone goes for the top end of the band. Everyone thinks that they are severely shocked. If there is a band from &#163;5,000 to &#163;7,500, and the board member gives &#163;5,000 that will almost inevitably be appealed on the basis that that person was more severely shocked than the board member thought and therefore he should receive &#163;7,500.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para1"></a>I emphasise again&#151;subject to anything my noble friend on the Front Bench might say&#151;that there are great difficulties in the working of the scheme. If we are to have a scheme at all, it must reflect the interests of the victim. We cannot have a defined figure for child abuse. If, as I believe I said on Second Reading, some Members of the Committee were to visit and, with the permission of the victims of terrible abuse, listen to the horrible&#151;I really mean horrible&#151;tales of sexual abuse, deprivation and all the rest of it which would not be believed if they were read about, then Members of the Committee would see how the system is supposed to work.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para2"></a>We are getting judicial intervention now. I have never seen a judge sitting with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to see how it works. Judicial review has become an industry, and that is wrong <P>


<a name="column_618"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 618</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because what we want is a system which does not reward the victim but which recognises that the victim has had something done wrongly to him.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para3"></a>We are not discussing the tariff scheme because that is a matter for another debate. The important thing is&#151;as I understand it, this is what the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, was saying&#151;that discretion has been removed, and the essence of justice is discretion. Once we remove discretion, we remove justice. We have members of the board&#151;I kid you not&#151;sitting with large piles of blue bags each of which contains 20 cases resulting from the illegal actions of the Home Secretary. I am not making a political point, but that is the way life is. We are reviewing the cases, and it is astonishing to see some of the awards that were made and some that were not made. An element of discretion must be built into the system, however the Government intend to do it.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para4"></a>Perhaps I may make an important point in conclusion. One of the large areas is child sexual abuse. There is no time clock on the abuse of children. We know that because we see such situations day in and day out. It is sickening but we must deal with it. However, just to put down a tariff and say, as the noble Lord has already said, "Well, you give somebody &#163;5,000 for that. That was too bad. But that is the way it happened", is not the way the system should operate.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para5"></a>From an examination of the files which we have to look at, it is also becoming patently clear that the tariff does not take into account the circumstances in which an assault takes place. It is all very well for an HEO in the Civil Service to press a button on the tariff scheme and say "Scarring", or whatever it might be, but that does not take into account the circumstances in which the assault takes place. We hear horrendous tales of assaults which have no long-term consequences, but the event is worth an award which is not given in the tariff scheme. Although we are both members of the board we are at one in believing that an element of discretion must be built into the scheme; otherwise it will act unfairly towards the most important people&#151;the victims of violence in this country.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I too listened with deep attention and respect to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. After all, he knows far more about the subject than almost any of us and certainly far more than I do. However, I suggest to him that my noble friend Lord Macaulay is right. The implications of allowing, as the noble Lord's amendments allow, for a band of compensation amounts across the board would be in the first instance that everyone would go for the top of the band. We would end up with a great many appeals and a great deal of additional expense. I urge the noble Lord to look at subsequent amendments which we have tabled and which address the points that he has so eloquently addressed. I hope that they deal with those points more precisely and more effectively.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para6"></a>The noble Lord talked about the differences between injuries to a young girl and to an older man. Our Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 allow for additional payments to be made, taking account of sex, of occupation and of dominance as between injuries to the <P>


<a name="column_619"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 619</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>left and right upper limbs. They also include a wider difference for age, which would take account of the points that the noble Lord has correctly made but would do so more exactly and without so much potential damage to the tariff scheme as a whole.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para7"></a>We have not specifically covered the point that the noble Lord made about scarring, which I acknowledge. However, in Amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 30 we have gone further than the noble Lord and have suggested that, in cases concerning the abuse of children, sexual abuse and shock, the tariff virtually gives up. That is particularly so in respect of shock where there is no definition but simply a footnote at the end of the tariff stating that such definitions are available pending the forthcoming Law Commission report.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para8"></a>I suggest to the noble Lord that by limiting the amendments to the point that we make in Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 and to the exclusion from the tariff altogether of shock, sexual abuse and the abuse of children, we are dealing more directly with the failings of the tariff system than he does in his amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-14_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I know how deeply my noble friend feels about this and I know that he speaks from considerable experience. Therefore, it is with diffidence that I take issue with him on his amendments.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para9"></a>Perhaps I may take the first proposed provision for compensation bands. That would undermine the whole rationale of the tariff system. In effect, it would reintroduce a common law damages scheme, which my noble friend has hinted he would prefer, with the associated delays and complexity. The whole point of a tariff system is that it provides a quicker, simpler and more transparent arrangement.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para10"></a>We have made the point on many occasions that there is no right or precise figure of compensation for a particular injury. We also believe that victims want their compensation as quickly as possible. Under the enhanced tariff scheme, therefore, we are no longer attempting to make finely judged assessments. Instead we are making a generous payment&#151;based on the board's own awards&#151;in recognition of society's concern for the blameless victims of violent crime.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para11"></a>At the same time the tariff in its current draft form contains over 300 different injury descriptions. A more severe case of a particular injury can therefore be assigned the appropriate higher tariff amount. And where the injury is particularly severe, or its effects prolonged or severe, there are additional payments for loss of earnings and the costs of special care.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para12"></a>A further problem with a system of compensation bands, which was hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, is that since many claimants, quite understandably, would believe their cases to be exceptional there would probably be far more requests for review and appeals. I slightly argue that it would increase further the demands for reviews and appeals. And reviews and appeals would be longer and more complex. However, claimants will be able to appeal on the grounds that they believe that their injury should have been placed in a higher rated category.
<P>


<a name="column_620"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para13"></a> As I said, these amendments would also provide for the tariff to define the harm done to the claimant in terms of the offence rather than the injury. However, we do not consider that this amendment is necessary since subsection (5) of Clause 2 already makes it clear that an injury may be described in the tariff in whatever way the Secretary of State considers appropriate. We take the view that this will permit reference to offences in so far as that may be necessary and, indeed, we do refer in the tariff to indecent assault. Perhaps I should explain that, as far as possible, we wish to avoid reference to specific offences in the tariff because this may produce uncertainty where the law differs between England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other. Offences would have to be defined in terms of the relevant legislation, which can be complex and may differ for England and Wales. The use of such terms might also be confusing to claimants who may not understand the technicalitites of legal definitions.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para14"></a>The tariff, therefore, seeks to describe the injury, wherever possible, in terms of the harm done. Should the injury include mental or emotional harm serious enough to warrant compensation in its own right the tariff allows for that. And of course should it become apparent that the way in which a particular injury is described in the tariff requires amendment for whatever reason, the Bill gives the flexibility to do that. We are confident that in practice the tariff will be able to produce awards which reflect the range of injury and suffering of victims with, as I have said, the advantage of greater speed and simplicity.
<P>

<a name="51016-14_para15"></a>The issue is important, but if we are to go for, on the one hand, the suggestion made by my noble friend in the particular amendments in front of us or the suggestion which was not defined but put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, that there should be some element of discretion, we believe that that flies in the face of what we are trying to do; that is, to produce a simple, understandable, transparent and speedy system of compensating people for injury when it has been caused by a criminal act.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I have heard what has been said and, if I may put it in the vernacular, I know when I am beaten. However, I wish to make one or two brief remarks with reference to the comments that have been made. Perhaps I may say, first, to the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, that of course if there is a maximum figure someone may ask, "Why haven't I got the maximum?", and there may be appeals from people who believe that they should have been awarded the maximum amount. However, I believe that many people will appeal saying, "You may say that my scarring is significant but I say that it is serious". I do not believe that one is avoiding appeals by taking bands rather than categories, which I believe will encourage people always to argue that they are in the highest category. That is particularly the case when they see that the amount is not &#163;500 but &#163;4,000 or more depending on the use of a word.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para0"></a>I have looked at the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. I differ from him as regards the best way to achieve flexibility. With great respect, he is going a lot further outside the tariff system than I <P>


<a name="column_621"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 621</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was attempting to do. I was attempting to provide a degree of flexibility within the tariff system. Of course, the noble Lord would take out of the system entirely all the sexual, shock and multiple injury offences. He prefers the hybrid system. I had rather accepted that the argument for that had been lost at an earlier stage.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para1"></a>The noble Lord's proposal for a percentage within which the tariff could be moved means that every type of accident and injury to any individual would have to be assessed individually, whether it was within the 10 per cent., 20 per cent. or 50 per cent. band. I notice also that the bands proposed by the noble Lord all go upwards rather than downwards. The Government will not find that acceptable for that reason. That is why I proposed an alternative method to provide flexibility in those three closely defined areas. But as I say, I know when the feeling of the Committee is against me. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 6.

Page 2, line 7, at end insert ("and loss of pension rights").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-15_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: At the outset I should declare my interest in that I am one of the advisers to the Police Federation of England and Wales. I should inform the Committee that I have spoken to the federation before deciding to table the amendment.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para5"></a>Of course, this Bill is not aimed specifically at the police and helping the police but one should bear in mind the fact that 16,000 police officers are assaulted every year; that many of them are injured seriously; and that in 1994 over 3,000 claims were submitted on behalf of police officers to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Therefore, the police service is particularly concerned about the issue of compensation for criminal injuries and the amendment which I have put before the Committee.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para6"></a>Police officers tend to retire earlier than people in other walks of life. It is their duty to remain physically very fit and therefore it is normal for a police officer, unless he reaches senior ranks, to retire at the age of 55 or after 30 years. Therefore, any injury to the body and mind of a police officer is likely to hasten retirement or make more likely forcible retirement.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para7"></a>I wish to draw to the attention of the Committee to Clause 2 of the Bill which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The amount of compensation payable under an award shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme...Provision shall be made for...an additional amount of compensation calculated with respect to loss of earnings". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and loss of pension rights" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para9"></a>should be added. I believe that loss of pension rights is as important to the award of compensation to a victim of criminal injury as is loss of earnings. Bearing in mind the fact that pension receipts will be set off against loss of earnings, it seems unfair that a victim will not also be able to claim compensation for the loss of those pension rights. Any claim put to the board should take into account the fact that an injured officer's pension as well as his earnings has been reduced sharply because he was forced to leave the service early.

<a name="51016-15_para10"></a>This amendment takes into account the fact that the earlier any such calamity occurs, when a victim is so badly injured that he must retire, the greater is the loss of pension rights, simply because he accrues those rights by length of service.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para11"></a>I believe that wounded police officers and other victims should be enabled to receive the full benefit of the pension that they would have earned had they continued to serve until normal retirement age. There are signs that the Government accept that principle. My honourable friend Mr. David Maclean, in a letter dated 27th September, informed the Police Federation of England and Wales that his view was that a police officer should have his loss of pension taken into account when the claim is assessed.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para12"></a>At the moment it seems that the question of pension rights is not addressed by the Bill or the draft scheme. I wonder whether my noble friend will assure me either that she will accept the amendment or that it will be included in the scheme. If it is to be in the scheme, are we to take it that the scheme thus changed&#151;thus improved, I would suggest&#151;will be put before your Lordships and another place as envisaged by Amendment No. 61? In other words, can we take it that if the spirit of the amendment is to be included in the scheme it will eventually become not just a guideline but also part of the law of the land? I await with interest my noble friend's reply.

<A NAME="51016-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I support the amendment on the very simple basis that pensions are deferred pay. One's remuneration package consists of one's instant, immediate pay and the pension, which is merely pay deferred until retirement. Accordingly, if compensation is to include loss of earnings, it should include both loss of one's immediate, weekly pay and one's deferred pay, which is one's pension.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   This amendment opens up a very wide field indeed. If the Committee is to discuss the whole question of loss of pension rights because of criminal injuries, the principle must extend way beyond the police forces. In your Lordship's House there is no greater supporter than I of the police, but once we begin to create special categories in legislation we lay all sorts of minefields for ourselves.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para13"></a>Even in the police force itself it must be remembered that when a police officer retires he receives his pension the day after he retires, at whatever age he may be. That is not true of all other people who are entitled to occupational pensions. There are many instances in which people retire early because of ill health or for some other reason but they do not receive their pension until they reach pensionable age. That is not true in the case of police officers.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para14"></a>Nor is it true or accurate to say that police officers retiring early retire only because of criminal injuries. There is a whole host of reasons for that. Perhaps I may take the example of the Hillsborough disaster. That was a regrettable incident at Hillsborough football park in Sheffield where police officers were subsequently retired, not because they were injured in that disaster but <P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because psychologically they could no longer handle the situations which they faced. Where do they fit in with the amendment?
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para15"></a>I want to make it clear that I am in favour of pension rights being taken into account in the settlement of such injuries and of the consideration that is given to the victims of crimes. However, I am in favour of that principle for all people and not just one category because that begins to divide society. That is the last thing that we should be doing especially in relation to criminal injuries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   With the leave of the Committee, I should like to make it clear that my support for the amendment was based upon its general application because it does not seek to point out or emphasise the police. Indeed, as I understood it, the noble Lord, Lord Bethel, was merely using the police as an example. My comment that pension is deferred pay is of general application and my support for the amendment was based upon the proposition that it is illogical to limit the compensation to the immediate loss of pay and to remove from it deferred pay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps I may speak now in order to assist Members of the Committee. My noble friend has given good reasons for such a provision relating to a particular category of victim, while other speakers have mentioned the general point. I am happy to be able to tell the Committee that we do consider that the loss of pension rights are included within the scope of the term "loss of earnings". The draft scheme will be amended before presentation to Parliament to make that clear. Therefore, it will be generally applied. In the light of that assurance, I hope that I have allayed all the anxieties on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If I may say so, that is all very well; indeed, I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bethel, will be pleased with the Minister's answer. However, there are two kinds of effects on pensions of an injury caused by crime. One is that the person concerned receives a pension early because he or she can no longer work. The other is that, at the end of a normal working life, someone who has been injured is able to work but is no longer able to achieve promotion or undertake a certain kind of job. The pension is, therefore, diminished as a result of the injury.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para16"></a>We considered whether to put the pension elements of the scheme on the face of the Bill in the form of an amendment, but paragraph 35 of the scheme is so dense that it is virtually impossible to understand what it means. There is still an anomaly in paragraph 35 of the scheme. It says that an award will be offset&#151;that is, the amount will be reduced&#151;by the amount of any pension arising from the injury. In other words, if someone takes early retirement and has a pension, that will be offset and then there is special provision as to whether or not the payment is taxable.
<P>

<a name="51016-15_para17"></a>However, if a pension is contributed to entirely by an individual&#151;that is, by the applicant&#151;it is not offset. That distinction does not seem to be fair. I say that because an occupational pension is usually a combination of payments by the individual and by the <P>


<a name="column_624"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 624</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employer. I am not suggesting for one moment that the Minister should attempt to answer the issue now because it is not referred to in the noble Lord's amendment; but perhaps the noble Baroness would give consideration to the point about the fairness between self-employed or self-contributory pension schemes and jointly contributed occupational pension schemes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I understand that in calculating loss of earnings loss of pension would be subsumed therein. That will be made clear as a result of today's debate; and, indeed, had already been thought about before my noble friend raised the matter in relation to the police. I also understand that, where pensions are paid, clearly there will not be a double payment. We are talking about a situation where there is a loss of pension as a direct result of a criminal injury which is properly recognised by the authority and where the loss of pension rights would also be subsumed within the calculation for loss of earnings. I do not believe that Members of the Committee should be concerned about the issue. However, I shall read what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said and we shall continue to try to make the matter as clear as possible in the hope that all fears are allayed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Before we leave the matter, I do not wish to make my noble friend's life more complicated but, while listening to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, it occurred to me that there may be another problem involved. The compensation for loss of earnings mentioned by my noble friend the Minister is payable only if the person is off work for 28 weeks. It seems to me that there are many cases at present of people in public services&#151;especially, as it happens, in the police&#151;where a person may have a substantial future loss of pension by being retired without in fact having had 28 weeks off work at the time immediately following the injury. Therefore, although the matter may already be covered, it is important to ensure that the scheme will provide for the effect of loss of pension even where the individual concerned has not been off work for 28 weeks immediately following the original injury.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I must now admit to being somewhat confused. However, I shall read what my noble friend said. Again, if someone is out of work as a result of criminal injuries but then returns to work within 28 weeks, the tariff will be paid and loss of earnings will not apply. However, if that person is subsequently out of work as a result of the criminal injury beyond the 28 weeks when loss of earnings starts to apply, then loss of pension will also be taken into account in the calculation. If I am wrong about that I shall return to the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bethel: </B>   I am grateful to all those Members of the Committee who have spoken. I should like, first, to confirm to the noble Lord opposite that in mentioning the police I was only using them as an example. If the spirit of the amendment is accepted by the Government it would apply to all victims of criminal injuries. If there is a category involved, that is the category; namely, victims of criminal injuries and not just the police.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para0"></a>I was most encouraged by the response made by my noble friend the Minister about loss of pension rights being subsumed into loss of earnings. However, perhaps <P>


<a name="column_625"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 625</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I may ask my noble friend to make that absolutely clear. I have the impression that she accepts the spirit if not the precise text of my amendment. In subsuming loss of pension rights, is it the case that it would be part of the scheme that my noble friend expects in the fullness of time to submit to the Committee under proposed Amendment No. 61?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Yes it is. In the new scheme that will be put before Parliament that change will be made to make it absolutely beyond doubt that the loss of pension will be taken into account as well as loss of earnings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bethel: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend. In that spirit, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell </B>   moved Amendment No. 10:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, leave out lines 8 and 9 and insert&#151;
<br>
("(c) where the applicant has lost earnings or earning capacity for longer than 28 weeks as a direct consequence of the injury or, if not normally employed, is incapacitated to a similar extent, additional compensation in respect of special expenses, payable from the date of the injury, shall be awarded for&#151;
<br>
(i) loss or damage, as a direct consequence of the injury, to property or equipment belonging to the applicant on which the applicant relied as a physical aid;
<br>
(ii) the cost other than by way of loss of earnings or earning capacity of attending for medical or dental treatment;
<br>
(iii) the cost of private medical or dental treatment, but only if the claims officer considers that, in all the circumstances, both the private treatment and the cost of it are reasonable;
<br>
(iv) the reasonable cost of special equipment or adaptations to the applicant's accommodation or of care, whether in a residential establishment or at home, which are not provided or available from the National Health Service, local authority or any other agency free of charge, provided that the claims officer considers such measures to be necessary as a direct consequence of the criminal injury; and
<br>
(v) the reasonable cost of housework, childcare, maintenance of the applicant's home, garden or means of transport to the extent that the applicant cannot perform such maintenance to the extent he did before the injury and as a consequence of it.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-16_para3"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: We come now to another example or perhaps, more accurately, other examples of problems which arise when we begin with a totally inflexible scheme and then seek, somewhat belatedly, to introduce some flexibility into it. I wonder whether it would be more sensible to go back to the beginning and start again. However, if I made such a proposal to the Government I assume that it would not readily be accepted.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para4"></a>Clause 2 makes some attempt to repair the damage; indeed, subsection (2) sets out the heads of compensation which will be available under the scheme. Paragraph (c) makes provision for "special expenses", but that enigmatic provision is where the Bill leaves it. For further enlightenment one must turn to paragraph 23 of the draft scheme.
<P>


<a name="column_626"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 626</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para5"></a>Perhaps I should have said at the outset that it may be for the convenience of the Committee if we also discuss Amendment No. 24. Amendment No. 10 has two purposes. First, it seeks to write certain provisions into the Bill because we believe that they are of major importance. However, we have already discussed that principle and, if I were to invite the Minister to reply, I envisage that we would hear the arguments that she has already employed.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para6"></a>Secondly and more particularly for this purpose we are concerned to include under the heads of compensation a provision which on our understanding is absent from the scheme. Amendment No. 10 proposes to add paragraph (v) which makes provision for a head of loss which is recognised in the common law scheme of damages but, as I say, appears to be missing from the scheme.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para7"></a>One serious financial burden which may follow from a physical injury is that the victim is unable to do some of the things which are part of civilised living. I nearly referred to a woman but I suppose these days a woman or a man may be unable to do the housework. A person who takes a pride in the appearance of the house and its surroundings may be unable to keep the garden tidy and if those tasks are to be done that person may need to pay someone to do the work. As I say, I understand that that is now accepted in common law as a head of damages but it does not appear to be recognised as a special expense in the scheme. It is not a fanciful concept. For those who find themselves in that situation it is an intensely practical problem. I look forward with interest to hearing the response of the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para8"></a>Amendment No. 24 repeats what is in paragraph 23 of the scheme but again adds another paragraph. Incidentally, for reasons which are not wholly clear to me, I note a reference to subsection (4). Clearly it should be paragraph (d). If we are confronted with that technicality today, it is a matter we shall have to face up to. The provision covers the case of someone who has provided care for a victim without making a charge and who has, himself or herself, suffered loss in consequence. Perhaps that person has had to give up work which he would otherwise have done, or something of that kind. Technically, that does not represent a loss to the victim but it seems in common fairness that recompense should be made. If the relative had charged for those services, that charge, as I understand it, would be recoverable as a loss to the victim. I hope that the Government see that justice indicates that where a person has not charged he might also be properly remunerated if he has lost financially in consequence. While we would like to see those provisions in the Bill we would be mollified if the noble Baroness felt able today to tell us that they will be written into the scheme. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The aim of these amendments, as the noble and learned Lord said, is to bring onto the face of the Bill more of the more detailed provisions of the scheme itself, this time those relating to special expenses. For the reasons I have already explained we do not believe that that is necessary or indeed <P>


<a name="column_627"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 627</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appropriate. We had a long discussion a while ago about the point of principle involved, and I do not propose to run through those arguments again. Suffice it to say that I shall have to ask the Committee to reject these amendments for the reasons adduced previously.
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para9"></a>With regard to the examples given by the noble and learned Lord, for example the reasonable cost of housework, or, possibly, child care, maintenance of the applicant's home, garden or means of transport and detriment&#151;other than financial&#151;suffered by a relative caring for a victim, which appears in the new clause which it is proposed to insert after Clause 2, it is clear from the draft of the scheme which we circulated in August what sort of things will be covered by the term "special expenses".
<P>

<a name="51016-16_para10"></a>In general the new scheme will cover the "core" losses which are covered under the present arrangements. However, the scheme is not intended to cover each and every item which might be allowable under common law damages either now or in the future. That is because the scheme is no longer based on common law damages, and it is not the function of a scheme funded by the taxpayer to make good each and every potential loss which a victim might conceivably suffer. That is why the more peripheral losses of the kind mentioned by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, will be outside the scheme's scope. Such losses are less susceptible to precise quantification and would provide endless scope for argument and, quite possibly, fraud. For example, how could one assess the extent to which an incapacitated victim had previously done his own gardening or housework or cared for someone else, and what that was worth? I am afraid that the term "other detriment" is far too wide and far too vague to be included in the scheme. For those reasons I must ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I was not wholly surprised when the noble Baroness said that the Government would object to writing these matters into the Bill for the reasons which we have debated already. I say simply that I am unrepentant. These seem to me to be matters of sufficient importance to be in the Bill. As regards the specific matters which I sought to raise with the noble Baroness, I was a little sorry that she regarded these as peripheral expenses. It seems to me that getting one's housework done or making one's garden look tidy are matters of some considerable importance to someone who has suffered an injury. The noble Baroness asked how we could possibly assess what those tasks are worth. In many cases people have to pay someone to perform those tasks and therefore there is no difficulty in assessing that. I fail to understand the Government's objection. If the noble Baroness had said that the Government would try to write this provision into the scheme I would have been mollified. However, I am not mollified and I propose to invite the opinion of the Committee on Amendment No. 10.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I do not rise to deter the noble and learned Lord from doing that. I simply rise to say that I hope that I have not been misunderstood when I used <P>


<a name="column_628"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 628</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the word "peripheral". I certainly did not use it in a derogatory sense. I meant that the provisions mentioned were peripheral to the core compensation which the Government have recognised; that is, the tariff for the injury, loss of earnings, care and aftercare for an injury. Those are the core considerations that have been accepted by the Government. It is in that sense only that these other expenses are considered peripheral. Although someone may have to pay for his garden to be done that is still no proof that it was a task that he necessarily did before his injury. It is difficult for the board to prove the validity of some of these other claims for compensation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I readily forgive her use of the word "peripheral". However, we want these heads of compensation in the scheme. The noble Baroness says that we cannot have them. I fear that we are no closer than we were before she explained her use of the word "peripheral". The noble Baroness said that one could not know whether someone had done his garden before he was injured. However, if I were injured on my way home this evening and the question arose as to whether I had done my garden I could easily invite members of the board or anyone else to look at the garden. It seems to me that the Government are clutching at straws to find reasons why a perfectly reasonable head of compensation should not be included in the scheme. In those circumstances I propose to invite the opinion of the Committee.

<a name="51016-17_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 11 is intended to make it clear beyond doubt that the scheme may provide for awards in fatal cases to include, in addition to the fixed tariff award, additional amounts calculated in accordance with the scheme. That will allow payment to be made for such other elements as reasonable funeral expenses and loss of dependency and support. Those elements are not fixed or specified, and so provision could not be made for them under subsection (2)(d) as it stands at present. Rather, they will be calculated by reference to the circumstances of the case, not on the basis of the fixed tariff. The amendment simply ensures that such payments can properly be made. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell </B>   moved Amendment No. 12:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 11, at end insert ("which amounts may include additional compensation to reflect the extent the claims officer is satisfied the applicant was financially dependent on the deceased and (in the event of the deceased's income at the time of death being limited to state benefits) the extent the claims officer is satisfied the applicant was likely to become financially dependent on the deceased.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-17_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Perhaps I may begin by expressing our appreciation of the open-mindedness shown by the Government up to this stage about fatal injuries. The concessions in Clause 2(2)(e), as elaborated in the scheme, are very much to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="51016-17_para6"></a>One of the concessions that the scheme includes is the possibility of additional compensation where the claimant was financially dependent on the deceased. So far so good. However, there is one limitation which puzzles us. It is provided that a dependency will not be established if the deceased's only normal income was from state benefits. We are puzzled for two reasons. First, if someone was in receipt of benefit which included an element for dependent family we are not clear why that ought not to be reflected in compensation if that income ceases to be forthcoming. If there is a reason for that it is not self-evident.
<P>

<a name="51016-17_para7"></a>There is a further point which puzzles us. We wonder whether it is really the intention to exclude the family of a victim who had reasonable prospects of future employment but who happened at the moment of his or her death to be dependent on public benefits. If a person had been receiving a small amount in wages at that time he would not have been excluded. Why exclude him because at that moment he happened to be fully in receipt of statutory benefits? We move the amendment more in bewilderment than anger. I await the response of the noble Baroness. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I hope that I can clarify the point for the noble and learned Lord. The amendment seeks to ensure that in fatal cases payment may be made to reflect the applicant's financial dependency on the deceased victim. But, as the noble and learned Lord already knows, the amendment is not necessary to secure that. The scheme already provides for that.
<P>

<a name="51016-17_para8"></a>As we made clear when we first announced the broad parameters of the enhanced tariff scheme, it was always the intention that in fatal cases, in addition to the fixed tariff award, additional payment would be made for loss of dependency and loss of parental support. When we came to draft the scheme itself we quickly realised that the powers conferred by Clause 2(2)(d) of the Bill were not in fact adequate for that purpose. That is why we brought forward an amendment of our own&#151;we have just discussed it&#151;to correct that omission.
<P>

<a name="51016-17_para9"></a>The government amendment will ensure that loss of dependency can be paid. It will also ensure, as this amendment does not, that we will be able to pay for loss of parental support as well.
<P>

<a name="51016-17_para10"></a>The new scheme will carry forward the position from the previous ones whereby financial dependency cannot be founded on social security benefits which the deceased has received. It nevertheless allows an <P>


<a name="column_631"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 631</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assessment of dependency to be made where, for example, the deceased was only temporarily unemployed or where there was otherwise clear evidence that the deceased was about to start work, thereby enabling a reasoned assumption to be made about the extent to which his family had lost the benefit of his potential earnings.
<P>

<a name="51016-17_para11"></a>If one partner dies who at the time of death had been receiving state benefit, that state benefit ceases on his death. If the dependent partner, still living, qualifies for state benefit in his or her own right, that issue will be addressed by the state. If the need for state benefit disappears, the person will not receive state benefit. State benefit is paid only where the beneficiary qualifies for it. For example, if state benefit were given to a husband who subsequently dies as a result of a criminal injury and the wife is left bereft without means of support she will qualify for state benefit. It is not the scheme but the state that should compensate for the particular circumstances of a person if he or she qualifies under the rules of state benefit.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   The Minister will remember that the original abortive scheme as published did not allow for any payment to the dependants of those who were killed. One of the most major and welcome changes between the previous and present proposals is the fact that payments are to be made to those who are shown to be dependent on someone who, sadly, has been killed.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para0"></a>Perhaps I may ask one question out of interest. Since the Government have made that change, have they given any consideration as to why they leave the fatal award&#151;it is the equivalent of the bereavement award&#151;at a higher figure than at present and higher than the bereavement award figure? Had they consulted the Lord Chancellor's Department when they made that decision? What pressure do they believe that that will have on the Lord Chancellor's Department to raise the bereavement award in other cases?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I cannot answer the second part of my noble friend's question. The Lord Chancellor's Department was consulted in arriving at this level of tariff.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I understand that if the dependant receives state benefit after the death, account will have to be taken of that factor in calculating the amount of compensation. I do not believe that that is an issue between us. That does not require the blanket condition in the scheme. But what of this situation? The dominant wage earner has been unemployed at the time of his or her death but had every expectation of receiving employment within the next week, fortnight or month. That has nothing to do with whether someone else benefits from state sources. It represents a genuine loss of dependency. If the noble Baroness explained that, I confess that I did not follow the argument. If there is anything else to explain, I shall be happy to listen. If not, we shall have to continue to differ.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   While I have a clear understanding of what I said I am always prepared to go back to the record to see how I answered the noble and learned Lord and to read what the noble and learned Lord asks me now.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para1"></a>My understanding is that if person A is in receipt of state benefit the other person, the husband or the wife, who is a dependant will represent part of the calculation of that benefit. When the person dies his or her claim for state benefit dies with him or her. However, the element representing the dependent monies for the wife or husband would be recalculated by the state. It is not for the scheme to compensate for that state benefit, but genuine qualification for state support which has ceased with the victim's death is addressed by the state.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para2"></a> I shall go back to the record and will continue to consider the matter. I believe that I am right in my understanding of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   With great respect to the Minister, surely the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, has a point. If someone is temporarily not working at the time of his death, it does not mean that there is no dependency if he were about to take up another job. One has to consider the whole work record in assessing whether there was dependency, whether he had been providing for the family and whether it would be reasonable to assume that he would provide again through work rather than referring to the short period that he was on state benefit. As I understood it, that was the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   On that specific point, I have made it absolutely clear that if the person were temporarily unemployed, or there was an expectancy that the person was about to go to work, that would be a loss of dependency which would properly be catered for in the compensation arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. That does not diminish my gratitude to the noble Baroness. I had put two hypotheses to her, not one. I believe that that is where the confusion arose.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para3"></a>As she correctly appreciated, my first hypothesis related to a person in receipt of state benefit which includes an element for dependence. I believe she answered that point and I am grateful.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para4"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, pointed out, the other hypothesis related to someone who is temporarily in receipt of state benefit but who has every likelihood of shortly being employed, and where there will be a dependency. The noble Baroness states that that is provided for in the scheme. I confess that if that were true we have probably misconstrued the scheme. Perhaps we may consider the matter together at some stage. If we agree that the measure should include that provision, I am content.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I think that I can be helpful. I repeat the point. If the unemployment is temporary&#151;someone would be expecting to obtain a job if a job is available, or had a job lined up which he had not yet taken up&#151;there would be a potential for employment, a potential for earning, which the partner would lose in <P>


<a name="column_633"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the event of a death as a victim of a criminal injury. In that case the scheme would be compensating for potential loss of earnings from that person rather than for losing state benefit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I think that I follow that argument. We are close enough now to make it imperative that I seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para5"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-18_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 22, at end insert&#151;
<br>
("( ) The person determining an award of compensation may increase the standard amount of compensation shown in respect of the relevant description of injury in the Tariff by a sum not exceeding 20% of the Tariff amount to reflect special factors relating to the applicant including but not limited to the applicant's&#151;
<br>
(a) sex;
<br>
(b) occupation or intended occupation; and
<br>
(c) dominant limb, in the case of injury to an upper limb.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-18_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In rising to move this amendment, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 17. These amendments refer, in what I believe to be a constructive way, to the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, on an earlier amendment. He suggested the possibility of a band of compensation for each of the amounts specified in the tariff. Our suggestion is in my view more limited, since it makes it possible for the person determining the award&#151;be it a scheme manager, claims officer or adjudicator&#151;to increase the standard amount of compensation shown by a specified percentage to take account of differences of sex, occupation, intended occupation and of dominant limb. Amendment No. 17 proposes a wider range of discretion for differences of age.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para9"></a>The unfairness of the undifferentiated tariff has already been adequately expressed both in earlier debates today and at Second Reading. It is the case&#151;and I do not believe that anybody can deny it&#151;that the tariff as specified does not make an adequate distinction between individuals, each a victim of a crime with the same injury, who suffer in a totally different way owing to their circumstances.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para10"></a>The examples are numerous. A young child who loses an eye clearly suffers very much more over his or her lifetime than an elderly person. The disability lasts for many decades longer. Loss of fertility&#151;one of the items in the tariff&#151;is clearly enormously different for a young woman, or indeed a young man, than for somebody older. As I said at Second Reading, a facial scar is unimportant to an unattractive person like me but very important to a young woman.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para11"></a>We have discussed the issue of dominant and non-dominant limbs. I have searched the scheme and the tariff very carefully and I find no reference to people being left-handed or right-handed. When the Minister was kind enough to meet me at the end of last month I <P>


<a name="column_634"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was assured that the distinction was provided for, as the tariff provided for the dominant limb. Even so, it is not stated. It mentions "left" and "right", and distinguishes between the two. However, I find it difficult to understand exactly how the preference for the dominant limb is achieved.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para12"></a>While making this point, perhaps I may correct an inadvertent error in the Hansard report of my Second Reading speech. What I said was that I was gauchiste, which is Left-wing, and gauch&#233;, which is left-handed. Hansard recorded it as "gauche". I may be gauche as well, but I am definitely gauch&#233;. I should be grateful if Hansard would put the acute accent on the final "e".
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para13"></a>For all these reasons, which are well-known to the Committee and which represent real differences in the suffering caused to victims of crime, we suggest that some method of differentiating must be found. We propose providing for the possibility of an increase of the tariff by a sum not exceeding 20 per cent. for differences of sex, occupation or intended occupation: clearly those in manual occupations suffer more from certain kinds of physical injury than those in sedentary occupations, and from injury to the dominant limb in a case of injury to an upper limb; and in the case that I have already exemplified provision is made for differences in the age of the applicant.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para14"></a>In parenthesis, perhaps I may say that we had a little difficulty in trying to write these issues onto the face of the Bill. The scheme is rather badly drafted. It sometimes refers to the person involved as a "person", sometimes as an "applicant" and sometimes as a "victim". I hope that when any new scheme is drawn up, some rationality will be applied to it. I know that these elements of the scheme come from different places, but they could have been rationalised prior to be its being placed before your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="51016-18_para15"></a>I do not think I need continue with the argument. I am not wedded to the particular solution that we have found. I am not wedded to 20 per cent. or 50 per cent. But I am wedded to the idea that any scheme which is to be just, and seen to be just, must reflect these differences. I await with interest the Minister's remarks on how that can be achieved. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I had considerable sympathy with Amendment No. 6, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. However, I also accept that if bands are brought in the concept of a tariff is substantially modified, if not substantially changed. I therefore did not speak in favour of the amendment. Clearly the Government are insistent that there should be a tariff scheme and the justification, which is wholly understandable, is that this provides a much quicker determination than using the common law approach.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para0"></a>On the other hand, one would expect that the Government would wish the scheme to be fair&#151;not only to be perceived as fair but to be fair in fact. The Government will have to accept that the scheme will be perceived as being in many respects unfair for the simple reason that the compensation is not related to the victim; it is related to an injury in the air, not an injury to a particular person. Therefore the compensation is just a rough and ready guess at what might be <P>


<a name="column_635"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 635</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appropriate. If the scheme is to be fair, the Government will have to give way. If they do not give way, it means that they are insistent that the scheme will be unfair in many cases.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para1"></a>It seems to me that what is proposed here is a compromise. The amendment does not propose bands, since that would be to bring in the common law approach&#151;the bands that are set out in the Judicial Studies Board's publication for the assistance of judges who have to deal with the common law. What is proposed is a measure of discretion based upon a percentage uplift, to use that horrible expression. That may mean that one disadvantage of the scheme is that it will have to be operated by a civil servant of a somewhat higher IQ than that anticipated at the moment, but that may be no bad thing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Perhaps the noble and learned Lord will permit me to intervene. I do not believe he would wish to assert that ranks in the Civil Service were associated with different IQs. Perhaps it would be more appropriate if he used the words "seniority" or "experience", but junior civil servants also have high IQs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I do not shrink from the reality that mental capacity is meant to have some connection with the position that is held. I am surprised that the noble Lord flinches from that inference. Clearly, if there is to be a measure of discretion which is exercised by a judicial function, the person who exercises that discretion must be better aware of the subject with which he deals. However, all that is by the way. I simply suggest that what is proposed is a compromise. It provides a measure of discretion of a limited kind. Of course, it will result in a number of people being dissatisfied that the discretion has not been exercised in their favour, which is one of the disadvantages of discretion. What needs to be balanced is the demand for a scheme which clearly is not in many respects unjust and unfair against the administrative disadvantages of providing a situation in which there are more appeals and effort involved in the decision-making process. I believe that to use a percentage increase as the measure of discretion is a fair compromise. Like the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, I am not wedded to a particular percentage, as long as it provides a realistic element of discretion. Therefore, in principle I support these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I should like to add my support to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. Because he was intent on correcting an earlier report in Hansard, he was perhaps rather modest in moving this amendment. It is a very important debate, though it goes back to matters discussed earlier in the course of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para2"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, has said, the tariff is inevitably rough and ready. However, the Government have settled upon it, and all of us find it very difficult to say categorically, in view of the previous discussion, that that may not be the right course. Having settled on that course and agreed on a <P>


<a name="column_636"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 636</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tariff of the kind before us now, it is up to the Government to consider whether there is any way of differentiating, within the idea of a tariff, between the very different circumstances of individuals.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para3"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, also said that the scheme had to be fair and seen to be fair. Although only experience will show, in my judgment there is a very real danger that the good intentions behind the scheme will be undermined by the extent to which inexperience is seen to be unfair. Whatever the Committee may decide, and whatever Parliament may eventually contrive in this Bill, I find it very difficult to believe that within the next four or five years proposals will not be made to have a scheme which includes the flexibility that is now absent. How much better it would be if the Minister today or on Report or at a late stage could say that within the idea of the tariff there would be a degree of banding.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para4"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, said that, if bands were introduced, the idea of a tariff would be substantially changed. I do not agree with him. I believe that the idea of a tariff remains even if banding is introduced either in the terms of this amendment&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, says he is not committed in detail&#151;or in some other way. It is possible to have flexibility to take account of differences of age, sex and circumstances and yet preserve the idea of a tariff which will make it much easier to administer the scheme and make clear to those who may wish to claim under it what claims they can make. What is being asked for is a measure of discretion. I hope that, even if the Minister feels unable to accept this amendment, she will be prepared to look again at the possibility of an element of discretion being introduced into the basic scheme to which the House has been committed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   It appears to me that this amendment meets the issue raised earlier in the debate, in that it introduces a compromise between a tariff scheme and a common law scheme, having regard to the equation that compromise equals fairness to the individual who has been injured. I hope that the Minister will take on board what has been said by all parties in support of this amendment.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para5"></a>I am sure that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, did not mean to insult any of the civil servants who were running this scheme under great difficulties. I can assure him that they are working under tremendous pressure from all sides. Having worked with them in London and Glasgow, I can assure the Committee that in both cases there are tightly structured and controlled teams of civil servants. Whatever happens to this particular Bill, those civil servants make decisions which enable the scheme to function. Without their dedicated service this scheme would have ground to a halt about four or five months ago following the Home Secretary's illegal actings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Taken together, these amendments would allow the tariff award to be increased by up to 20 per cent. to reflect so-called special factors, and by a further 50 per cent. on account of the applicant's age; in <P>


<a name="column_637"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other words, in some cases the tariff award could be increased by up to 70 per cent. That is on top of the most generous scheme in the world. I have noted and taken account of the points spoken to by everyone in the debate.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is not hooked on a particular percentage. One can negotiate percentages. However, whatever they are, the percentages are in addition to a very generous scheme. We find this unacceptable. The whole point of a tariff scheme is to have a quick, transparent means of getting money to victims of crimes of violence. It does away with the individual assessment inherent in a scheme based on common law damages, which is inherently more complex and tends to militate against speedy decision taking. I take gentle issue with the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. Any introduction of discretion, which would sweep all the way through the list&#151;mention was made of age, whether somebody was pretty or ugly, and all sorts of exceptions&#151;would invalidate the whole point of a tariff scheme. There is a legitimate debate about whether there should be a tariff or common law scheme, as mentioned earlier by my noble friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. But once a tariff scheme has been accepted the integrity of the system needs to be thought about.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para7"></a>As the Government have sought repeatedly to explain, there is no right figure that can compensate the blameless victim for the pain and hurt that he or she has suffered as a result of a crime of violence. Under the enhanced tariff scheme we do not try to make a finely judged assessment of compensation, in the sense of attempting to put the individual back into the position in which he or she would have been had the attack not occurred. What we aim to do is to make a generous payment in recognition of society's concern for the blameless victim of a violent crime. In our view, a simple, transparent system, where the awards are based on the most typical award for the injury concerned&#151;the median award&#151;is the right way to do that. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, that the scheme is not that rough and ready. The scheme is based on actual awards made by the present system, which is based on the common law approach. Over a period the average has been taken, and in every case the dominant injury is in the tariff. So we have erred on the generous side in that sense. It is not so rough and ready, as the noble Lord said.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para8"></a>We therefore cannot accept the amendments. They would mean in effect reverting to a system of individual assessment, very much as happens under the present scheme. The introduction of such subjective assessments would inevitably mean that cases would take longer to settle. It would also mean that requests for review and subsequent appeal would become the norm, since claimants&#151;or their representatives&#151;would have nothing to lose by claiming that there were special factors in their case. There would inevitably be upward award drift, with more and more awards tending to be tariff plus "something additional". That would take us back to the position where costs would no longer be predictable or controllable and where claims took an increasingly long time to settle as their handling became increasingly convoluted and subject to dispute.
<P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para9"></a>Where the victim is particularly badly injured or the effects of the injury are most prolonged or serious, the new scheme includes provision for the claimant to receive additional compensation for loss of earnings and the cost of special care. In such more serious cases, that will enable variations in impact of the same injury on different people to be taken into account, so that, for example, a young person who loses an eye is likely to receive a considerably higher award than a pensioner who suffers the same injury.
<P>

<a name="51016-19_para10"></a>Finally, I repeat the point that the tariff awards are in fact based on the injury to the dominant limb. There is therefore no case for adding to the tariff award for such an injury. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, mentioned references to "right" and "left". I have looked all the way through the tariff. There are references to losing a hand or both hands, a leg or both legs, but there is no reference to right legs and left legs or right hands and left hands. If we are being logical, there is a case for reducing the award. If the argument in this Chamber is for a relativity between the award for a dominant limb and the award for a non-dominant limb, if someone would like to bring forward an amendment, that can be considered. I feel that one should take what there is on the table at the moment and be generous all round rather than consider, for artificial reasons, introducing a relativity. If there are to be relativities, at the moment we rather favour the non-dominant injury and pay the right award based on actual awards for the dominant injury.

<A NAME="51016-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   With the best will in the world, I call that a defence of despair. The Minister has done nothing to defend the tariff that is before us except to say that it is transparent. If the only justification for the tariff is transparency, it may be that it is transparent because there is nothing there.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para0"></a>In these amendments we do not propose a fundamental departure from the tariff for physical injury. We may have to do that for certain kinds of injury, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer will refer to that later. But, so far as concerns physical injury, we accept that the tariff is a gallant attempt to categorise the enormous complexity of different types of injury which may occur as a result of crime.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para1"></a>The Minister is right to say that there is no difference between "left" and "right". She is also right in saying that, if one were to be logical about the matter, we say that we are being too generous. If I were to lose my right hand, it is less serious than if the Minister were to lose her right hand and I should be paid less. The actual amount will depend on the budget for the scheme, inflation and all sorts of things. But the Minister has never sought to deny that there is a real difference between the dominant upper limb and&#151;whatever the alternative is&#151;the "recessive" in genetic terms upper limb. I believe that she has not answered that question.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para2"></a>In these amendments we are not departing from the principle of the tariff. We accept that there has to be some form of an enhanced tariff. We accept that in certain circumstances the loss of earnings payment will compensate for particular difficulties and extra expenses. But, once we have accepted that there has to be a tariff, surely it is right that the tariff should be as <P>


<a name="column_639"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>close as possible to reality. What we propose is not a departure from the tariff but an extra dimension for certain elements of the tariff.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para3"></a>When introducing his amendments earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, said that he was suspicious of our amendments because they would open too much of the tariff to additional payments. I do not believe that, if one looks at the wording, that is the case. It would be evidence that a very large number of injuries in the tariff are not susceptible to change by age, sex, occupation or dominance. It is only those to which that really does apply, particularly in the case of dominance for upper limbs, that it is a serious issue.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para4"></a>I said at the beginning that I was not wedded to the percentages. Therefore I shall not be caught in the Treasury's trap of being told that I am proposing an additional expenditure of 70 per cent. of &#163;460 million and that that is the Labour Party's policy for the next general election. In case anybody starts adding that to the list, let them forget it, because it will not work.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para5"></a>The Minister has not adequately defended the tariff. It could be made better than it is. It could reflect reality better than it does. The Government are in a better position to try to do that than I am. If they are not willing to do so, I shall try again. Subject to that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 26, after ("State") insert ("after consulting such persons or bodies as he considers appropriate").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-20_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak also at this time to Amendment No. 67. They both raise the same issue; namely, that there should be proper consultation between the persons or bodies affected by the introduction of the new scheme before the tariff scheme is laid before this Chamber. The noble Baroness the Minister has already spoken in relation to this matter. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am not clear why these amendments should be thought to be necessary. If the intention is to require the Secretary of State to consult before changing the tariff, the amendment to Clause 10 would achieve it, making the amendment to Clause 2 unnecessary and superfluous. Accordingly, I shall confine my remarks largely to the Clause 10 amendment.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para9"></a>Clause 10 requires the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament the draft of certain provisions or amendments to the scheme. The Clause 10 amendment would first require him to consult such organisations as appear to him to be representative of interests substantially affected by the proposals and such other persons or organisations as he considers appropriate. I suspect that we can all see the benefits of appropriate and timely consultation. Any well organised administration would want to use its discretion to seek the views of informed individuals and organisations on a particular issue when that was appropriate. But this <P>


<a name="column_640"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 640</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment goes further than that and is too prescriptive. It requires consultation before any change to the tariff whether or not such consultation is likely to be helpful either to the Secretary of State or the bodies or persons consulted. I believe that that is a recipe for unnecessary bureaucracy, delay and frustration.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para10"></a>There may well be occasions when a very minor change might need to be made to the tariff, for example, to make a very small technical change to an injury description or to make a minor change to the accompanying notes, which may even emanate from the authority itself. In such circumstances I have no doubt that we would want to consult with the authority and the appeals panel. But I cannot see that any wider consultation is likely to be helpful, if one has to consult simply for the sake of consulting.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para11"></a>In short, I can assure the Committee that we would always want to consult as necessary and appropriate before recommending to Parliament any changes to the tariff. Let us not forget in this connection that under the enhanced tariff scheme the Government are not free to change the tariff administratively. They have first to secure parliamentary approval by the affirmative resolution procedure. With such a safeguard I see no need to put such an unnecessary and overly prescriptive amendment on the face of the Bill. However, I do not want anything I have said in response to the amendment to indicate that we do not regard consultation as an important part of the process.

<A NAME="51016-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that comprehensive and informative answer to Amendments Nos. 18 and 67. We appear to be getting into some difficulty as to the difference between the Bill we are considering and the scheme. The scheme is not before the Committee at the moment, as I read it, though I may be wrong. It will come before the Chamber at a later stage. In this debate we appear to be cross-referencing the scheme and the Bill, and we are dealing purely with the Bill.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para12"></a>Can the noble Baroness tell the Committee whether a final consultation date was given in relation to the Bill before us, and if so what that final date was? I am sure that many Members of the Committee have been inundated with information from various organisations&#151;I shall not name them because that would not be fair&#151;concerned with the introduction of the new scheme. Was there a consultation period for the purposes of the Bill? If so, when was the end of that consultation period? What response was received in relation to it and from whom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   At some point during the afternoon I explained that the Bill is largely an enabling Bill to allow a scheme to be established. The Committee accepted that that scheme shall not be on the face of the Bill but will nevertheless be subject to parliamentary approval. The whole of the scheme will initially be subject to parliamentary approval under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para13"></a>Consultation was substantially in regard to the scheme; for instance, the setting up of the scheme and everything to do with it which will affect those who will <P>


<a name="column_641"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 641</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>run it and those who will benefit from it. That is what was consulted upon. The amendments to Clause 10, which is the Bill, are to do with making sure that we allow the scheme in its entirety to be presented to Parliament through the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para14"></a>That consultation ended at the end of August. We have not closed the door on receiving comments. We are still receiving comments into the department and no one is setting their face against them. Indeed, this debate will be used to reflect on the details of the scheme and already this evening I have had words with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, on the fringe of the debate in relation to one of the amendments discussed this evening. While the principle of the response to the amendment does not change, nevertheless we shall look again at the clarity of the words in the scheme to reflect what I have said across the Dispatch Box. In that sense there is a continuing dialogue in regard to the scheme until it is presented to Parliament for its approval.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   Again I am grateful for that explanation. I received certain indications that the end of the consultation period was set out as the end of October, which we have not yet reached. I was obviously ill-informed and apologise to the noble Baroness for raising the point.
<P>

<a name="51016-20_para15"></a>In connection with the general principle encapsulated in the two amendments, we must be careful on all sides of your Lordships' Chamber that an enabling Bill does not become a disabling Bill. With that observation&#151;I do not know whether or not it is pertinent&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="51016-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar </B>   moved Amendment No. 19:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, leave out line 28.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-21_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: With the leave of the Committee, in moving Amendment No. 19 I shall deal also with Amendment No. 20 because they really run together. Amendment No. 19 is a probing amendment which raises a question in relation to the Secretary of State having the power to remove the "description" of an injury. The word "description" is not defined. Is it deemed that the Secretary of State in the future will be able to remove the injury itself&#151;for instance, a "severely broken leg"&#151;or the description of the injury; that is, the word "severely"? Are the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by removing a description of injury", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para1"></a>happily phrased within the context of the Bill? I put it no higher than that. This is a probing amendment to see what the word "description" means in the context of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para2"></a>Amendment No. 20 is perhaps more important because it gives the Secretary of State the power either to increase or reduce the standard amount of compensation. If one's nose is broken in 1995, can the Secretary of State come along in 1996 and reduce the award one received in 1995? I am not sure what the phrase means, especially in relation to the cases we discussed earlier in regard to child abuse, sexual abuse and so forth, which I shall not repeat.
<P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para3"></a> A tariff has been drawn up. We have all seen it and the noble Baroness was kind enough to send me a copy some time ago. If the tariff scheme has been drawn up as representing the values for awards as of now, how can the Secretary of State reduce the value of an award, bearing in mind that we live in a time of inflation, even with the Government's best expectations? It may be that in three years' time they hope to bring inflation down to nothing, but I would have thought that that was a pious hope.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para4"></a>Assuming that inflation runs at 1.5 per cent. per annum, how can an award be reduced for someone who received a broken nose in 1995, whose claim is settled in 1997, because the Secretary of State says that it is worth less than it was in 1995? It is perhaps a conundrum. I leave it with the noble Baroness and I am sure that all those involved will be interested to hear her reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Perhaps I may take this opportunity to make one point to my noble friend the Minister. With respect to my noble colleague on the board, the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, I do not agree with his intention to remove the words "or reducing" in Amendment No. 20. However, I ask the Minister in all seriousness what thought has been given to the views expressed by the board in relation to some of the figures in the tariff.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para5"></a>I am not trying to be cheeseparing; I am concerned generally about the overall cost of the scheme. When the original tariff was produced, it was not intended by the Government, sadly, that any loss of wages or future care should be taken into account. As a result, as we know if we look at the top end of the tariff, figures of &#163;250,000 were put in as general damages for quadriplegia or tetraplegia and &#163;175,000 for paraplegia. We felt it our duty to point out to the Home Office that those figures are way above those accepted by the courts as appropriate for general damages for tragic accidents of that kind.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para6"></a>As the Minister knows, as well as ignoramuses like myself and the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, the board also consists of several practising personal injury senior barristers and solicitors. Their assessment was that the going award although that is perhaps a cheap way of putting it and I shall substitute the phrase, the normal award, for tetraplegia or quadriplegia for general damages in the High Court is &#163;125,000 and for paraplegia around &#163;100,000.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para7"></a>I am concerned, and those who practise particularly in the personal injuries field are concerned, that the Government are to publish a tariff with figures apparently double the size for the general damages aspects only of tetraplegia, paraplegia and these other very serious injuries. What thought have they given to the effect of the inflation on damages in the civil courts and to the effect on insurance companies generally? It was clearly right when there was not an intention to pay loss of wages, future earning capacity or loss of care&#151;I totally agree with their intention not to pay&#151;to put in figures above the normal figure for general damages. But once they had decided and conceded on the issue of paying for loss of earnings and future care I do question&#151;not on behalf of the taxpayer but on behalf, I <P>


<a name="column_643"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hope, of the responsible view from the legal profession&#151;whether it is right to leave figures in the tariff which roughly are double the amount being paid by the civil courts at the moment without any apparent consideration of the effect this may have on inflation. I raised this matter under the question of the bereavement award under fatal accidents and I think it only right to raise it again now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps I may take that point first. My noble friend will understand if I do not give him a specific answer at this moment as we have not yet determined the tariff that will be put before both Houses as a final document. All the comments that have come in and all the consultation is still being considered. The point made by my noble friend is part of that consultation and we shall consider it.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, asked what will happen to someone who makes a claim in 1995 which is dealt with in 1995 or 1996 when the new scheme is in place. It will be dealt with under the rules applying when the applicant applied. I have referred to one change that will be made. There will be an amendment to the present scheme in order to allow for structured settlements. That is intended to follow Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para9"></a>The power provides for the Secretary of State to revalue the standard amount of compensation payable in respect of a particular description of injury. It is also the power under which all or part of the tariff would be revalued. Increases or reductions in tariff amounts, or removal of injury descriptions from the tariff, could be required for sound, practical reasons. For example, it is possible that a number of broadly similar injury descriptions might need to be amended under Clause 2 (6)(a) or (d) of the Bill if experience showed that the tariff could better describe injuries of the relevant type. It might be necessary to add a new, more serious injury description, while reserving an existing one for less serious injuries for which a lower amount was now appropriate. Or it might be better to describe an injury in a new way, which might make the former injury description redundant. Leaving the old description in the tariff in such circumstances would create unnecessary confusion.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para10"></a> All the reasons I have just given are also the reasons why a scheme under the affirmative resolution procedure is so necessary, to allow for making sensible changes to the scheme which will arise from the operation of the scheme. Perhaps I may also remind the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay&#151;this is probably his underlying concern&#151;that the Secretary of State is not free to make any change to the tariff. Under the arrangements I have spelt out today, any changes to the tariff will require parliamentary approval by the affirmative resolution procedure and/or the negative resolution procedure. Thus, if Parliament is not happy with the changes the Secretary of State wishes to make to the tariff under this clause&#151;in this instance, if it does not agree that injury descriptions should be removed or a lower tariff value substituted&#151;Parliament can simply refuse approval for the proposed changes. That is the safeguard in the Bill. To go back to what the noble Lord, <P>

One of the difficulties with the Bill, which we have had to consider at fairly short notice, is in its operation. Where is responsibility to lie? There is a theme throughout the Bill with regard to the managers, office managers and so on that none of them will be deemed to be acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. We shall perhaps come to that at a later stage, if not during Committee then certainly on Report, and ask where responsibility lies for the administration of the Bill. I am sure that what the Minister said will be noted with interest by those concerned with these matters. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

For the convenience of the Committee perhaps I may say that I do not intend to deal with Amendments Nos. 21 or 35 at this time. It may be more appropriate to leave Amendment No. 51 until we reach it in the Marshalled List. I understand that that is acceptable practice.

<br>
(a) not provide for any maximum amount of compensation;").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-21_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment may appear to drive a coach and horses through government spending constraints but it really does not. The overall maximum provided in the tariff for individual awards is &#163;500,000, which I acknowledge straight away is an improvement on the &#163;250,000 in the tariff which was found to be illegal. In moving an amendment which removes that cap on total compensation of &#163;500,000 I am not opening the floodgates of public expenditure. In 1993-94 there were only seven cases exceeding &#163;500,000, the total excess being less than &#163;1.38 million. It does not seem sensible to have this quite arbitrary cap.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para16"></a>Perhaps I may give two examples of the way in which larger amounts can be built up. I hope that the Committee will understand that the strictures which the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, placed on some what he called excessive awards for quadriplegia and paraplegia do not really apply in the cases that will arise under the terms of this amendment. I have an example of a case of paraplegia where the general damages were &#163;90,000. It concerns a man aged 33 at the date of the assault and 39 at the date of the hearing. He was stabbed in the back. He has complete paraplegia with all the difficulties associated with that&#151;frequent episodes of severe pain, recurrent urinary tract infections and <P>


<a name="column_645"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 645</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pressure sores. He needs permanent live-in care which had been provided by his wife and would continue to be provided by her in the future.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para17"></a>The total award of &#163;785,000 was made up as follows: &#163;90,000 for general damages&#151;for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; &#163;45,000 for loss of past earnings; &#163;62,000 for loss of future earnings; &#163;39,000 for future replacement of equipment; &#163;22,000 for equipment already purchased or needed; &#163;72,000 for past care; and &#163;242,000 for future care. This is where the cost really starts to add up.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para18"></a>There are various other items for medical expenses. There is the future cost of transport at &#163;39,000; accommodation at &#163;60,000; future household expenditure, &#163;75,000, and so on. It is a total of &#163;784,000. One can very well see how, with the special expensive provisions which are made in the scheme and the tariff, one can get up to that figure and not be unduly generous.
<P>

<a name="51016-21_para19"></a>A second example concerns a woman aged 19 at the date of the assault. She was attacked and suffered a fractured skull, a fractured cervical spine and fractured ribs. She also suffered severe head injuries. The severe head injuries caused severe memory impairment and concentration and organisational difficulties; in effect, severe brain damage. She had an interim award of &#163;100,000, but she was awarded in the end &#163;65,000 damages for injury, &#163;7,500 for past loss of earnings, &#163;60,000 for past care, &#163;84,000 for future loss of earnings, &#163;522,000 for future care (which is a multiplier of 15.5) and court and protection costs of &#163;32,000. That is a total of &#163;800,000. Again, one can see how that kind of amount builds up without any individual item being excessively generous. For the sake of what is probably less than &#163;2 million in total, can the Government not give up this arbitrary &#163;500,000 maximum? I beg to move.

<A NAME="51016-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   Perhaps I may express support for the motive behind the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and do so in the light of what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. I fully understand what he said about comparing the tariff with a normal figure for damages under industrial injuries. It was a very fair point and one which the Minister indicated, as I understand it, will be looked at.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para0"></a>I approach these matters very much as a layman. Although the Minister has said today, as on previous occasions, that this is a very generous scheme&#151;and no doubt it is on a comparable basis with schemes available elsewhere&#151;when I look at some of the tariffs I do not believe that I would feel that they were very generous if they applied to me. If noble Lords themselves were subject to criminal injury, I do not believe that they would feel that the compensation was adequate. It may be that I am very fastidious and unworldly in this respect, but the idea that one gets compensation to the extent of &#163;40,000 for the loss of a tongue is absolutely extraordinary. For the loss of both legs the sum is &#163;100,000. Would we be prepared to see ourselves lose a tongue for &#163;40,000 or two legs for &#163;100,000?

<a name="51016-22_para1"></a>As I say, the tariff may be generous taken as a whole&#151;but &#163;100,000 for the loss of both eyes? Would any of us feel that that was adequate compensation for the loss of a facility of that kind? We have to say that because the courts approach these things in a very hardheaded way. They have precedent and they have to take that view. I say this in view of what the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, has said, in case his remarks are thought to be representative of the views of the Committee. A number of the individual items are totally inadequate as compensation for the degree of injury which is described.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para2"></a>At the bottom end of the scale some of the figures are perfectly acceptable. Indeed, I am surprised that compensation is payable at all for some very minor injuries. But at the top of the scale one can see what it would mean to the life of a man or woman to be injured in this way. This comes back to a matter we discussed about being 15, 16 or 17 years of age, at the beginning of one's life. I do not believe that the message should go out that these levels of compensation are seen to be generous.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is now of course exercising excessive prudence in relation to public expenditure. He says that he does not want to open the floodgates. He is saying that now in case he is in the position of the noble Baroness within a relatively short time. It is not for me to judge whether that will be so. But I do not want it to go on record that, expensive though this scheme might be seen to be by some criteria, the compensation offered to those who suffer injuries will ever be considered to be true compensation for what has happened to them.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para4"></a>I ask this question of the Minister. Although it may sound very naive, it is genuine. In the light of that, what really is the purpose of compensation? It may be an elementary question for those who deal with these matters from day to day in courts and tribunals. But what is &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000 meant to do? If the Minister, myself or any other Member of this Committee lost our eyes, what would &#163;100,000 mean to us? I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, continues with the self-indulgence of inviting the Committee to pass amendments to spend more money, and then says that it should not be taken too seriously because he does not wish to talk about money at the moment. This is another amendment which is very open-ended. The noble Lord has said that he believes that at the end of the day it would not be very expensive. But one has to add this to the other amendment.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para5"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, was interesting in what he had to say. It is never possible properly to compensate somebody for losing their legs or their tongue or ending up a quadriplegic. The scheme is not attempting even to try fully to compensate someone: I do not believe it can be done. It is attempting to represent society's concern for blameless victims of crime. Society has seen fit, through its taxes and other money, to put in place a compensation scheme which <P>


<a name="column_647"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 647</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be approved by Parliament in order to make some amends for discomfort, medical needs and possible incapacity to work.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para6"></a>I remind the House yet again that the original common law scheme contained within it an element for loss of earnings and care. That has remained in our calculations. It has not been stripped away. In addition to that and quite separate from it, I refer to the example of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, of the person who loses a tongue or who loses his legs. The noble Lord mentioned only the tariff amount. That amount is only one part of what a person would receive. In addition to that &#163;100,000 or &#163;40,000, there would be compensation for medical care, loss of earnings, loss of pension and so forth.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para7"></a> As the Committee knows, our intention is that the scheme should set an overall cap for awards. Already my noble friends have said that there is the generous figure of &#163;500,000. That is double the amount set up under the earlier tariff scheme which had to be withdrawn. It is pertinent to the examples given by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, to take into account the fact that for the first time it is possible to purchase an annuity with that &#163;500,000. The income stream generated from that annuity would be entirely tax free for life for the victim of criminal injury.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para8"></a>If we were talking about legal liability on the part of the state to pay damages for acts which its employees have committed, there could be no such limit. But that is not the case here. As I said earlier, the scheme pays compensation as an expression of society's concern for and sympathy with the victim. It is not reasonable to expect a state-funded scheme to make good each and every loss a victim may have suffered. That would place an undue burden on the taxpayer, on whom the cost of the scheme ultimately falls.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para9"></a>I ask the Committee to agree that &#163;500,000 is a very large sum of money. It has already been queried. Fewer than 10 of the board's awards in 1993-94 under the present scheme exceeded that amount. But it is no argument to say that, if that is the case, the potential cost of removing the cap cannot be very great. We need the certainty to control costs that the facility of setting an upper ceiling on awards will give. We cannot have an open-ended system under which costs in any one year cannot be predicted or controlled. I remind the Committee again that with a new facility to make payment by structured settlements&#151;that is the purchase of tax-free annuities which this Bill introduces&#151;the value of high awards to claimants during their lifetime will be considerably increased. For all those reasons I hope that the amendment will not be pressed.

<A NAME="51016-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Minister claims that I am simply asserting that there will not be significant extra expenditure if the amendment is agreed to. That is not the case. I have given exact figures for 1993-94, which is the most recent year for which I have figures. It is clear that the number of such cases in that year would have been seven and that the total amount <P>


<a name="column_648"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 648</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of money involved would have been &#163;1.38 million. In terms of the total cost of the scheme, that is not a significant amount by anybody's standards.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para10"></a>Indeed, it is not as if removing the cap is removing the basis upon which the compensation is paid. I am not claiming for a moment that there should not be any restraint on what should be awarded for loss of earnings or future loss of earnings, for care or for future care. I am saying&#151;if the Minister is listening&#151;that without making any change in the tariff, without in any way relaxing the financial constraints which exist both in the tariff itself and in the calculation of special expenses, it would be just, equitable, not expensive and common sense to remove an arbitrary limit of &#163;500,000. I acknowledge that &#163;500,000 is a larger limit than in the interim illegal scheme, but it is also the case that there was no limit before and that there was no exploitation of the lack of a limit under the previous scheme.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para11"></a>It is not the case that very large numbers of people will have their awards totalled. Such awards will be made only under severe scrutiny by claims officers, systems managers and adjudicators. There will not be a free-for-all of any kind. I find the Minister's attitude to this modest reform quite inexplicable. Although I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, I cannot promise that I shall not return to it at a later stage.

<A NAME="51016-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell </B>   moved Amendment No. 25:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After clause 2, insert the following new clause&#151;
<center><b>Compensation for loss of earnings</B></center><br>
(". Where the applicant has lost earnings or earning capacity for less than 28 weeks as a direct consequence of the injury, an additional award of compensation in respect of loss of earnings will be made in a sum equivalent to the difference between the applicant's actual income and the higher rate of statutory sick pay applicable to that period.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-22_para16"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: We return to dealing, by way of an amendment to the Bill, with a quarrel that we have with the scheme. Paragraph 22 of the draft scheme provides for compensation for loss of earnings after earnings have been interrupted for 28 weeks. That provision was introduced by the Government on second thoughts and will indeed benefit the more seriously injured. I say at once that we welcome it.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para17"></a>However, those who suffer loss of earnings for less than 28 weeks may suffer real hardship. I assume that the period of 28 weeks was chosen because up to that period there is statutory sick pay. However, that is hardly a fortune. It may amount to substantially less than the victim's normal earnings. If the victim is committed to, say, periodical mortgage repayments or similar outgoings, it may lead to a financial crisis at a time when the victim is least able to cope with such financial and family problems.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para18"></a>Some employers have a contractual sick pay scheme to make up the shortfall but, unhappily, that is far from true of all employers. There is, if anything, some <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>correlation between being in the kind of employment which subjects one to high risk and not having a contractual sick pay scheme. Self-employed people do not receive statutory sick pay at all, yet a taxi driver is at greater risk of criminal injury than most of us. That is equally true of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para19"></a>From the figures which I have been privileged to see by courtesy of the Library in another place, it appears that by the 28-week rule as many as 12 million people could be excluded from the scheme who in consequence may suffer real hardship. There are some 3 million self-employed people; some 3 million who at present are below the lower earnings limit; 1 million who are on short-term or temporary contracts and so do not qualify; some 2 million people have employers who do not have such a sick pay scheme; and 3 million people have not worked for an employer for long enough to qualify. Therefore, it does not follow that because many people will qualify for sick pay up to 28 weeks, those who are disabled for less than 28 weeks have no problem.
<P>

<a name="51016-22_para20"></a>I cannot believe that the Government intended that situation to arise. The 28-week rule must have looked a fairly simple and just way of effecting a division. I am sure that, on reflection, the noble Baroness will accept that it is not. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Perhaps I may reply briefly to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, has just said. Obviously anyone who loses a job as a result of injury or who is unable to work for a short time suffers a blow. I accept that that must be so, but one must to a degree be pragmatical in approaching this matter. The board is now facing something like 70,000 cases a year. At the moment the scheme requires us to look at any potential loss of earnings for however short a period of time. A great deal of the time of the board's staff is taken up in inquiring as to the loss of wages claimed by someone who may not have been off work for three or four weeks but for, say, two or three days. Then you have to write to the DSS to inquire whether they received benefits, deduct the benefits from the wages to discover whether they have an additional claim on top of the general damages or, in many cases, whether there is an excess of what they received in benefits as against their losses to be deducted from the sum for general damages.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para0"></a>Based on my experience over the past five years with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, I am bound to say that the amount of time spent finding out the answer to that question often far outweighs the result. I have put that badly, but a great deal of time is taken up finding very small sums owed one way or another. Although I believe that it is in some ways harsh, it is, regrettably, pragmatically correct for the Government to say that the first few weeks of earnings should not count. Whether they have the right point with 28 weeks, I do not know. The submission we put to the Home Secretary when he was putting forward his revised tariff was that we thought that it was reasonable up to three months not to account for the loss of earnings. The Government are right to say that we cannot have such a finely tuned scheme any longer and account for every day's earnings lost. With a degree of regret, because I believe that the <P>


<a name="column_650"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 650</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arguments of principle are on the side of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, the Government are right to say that the amount of work involved is not justified by the outcome. The awards at the lower end, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said, are on the generous side compared to those we pay in general damages and have attempted to take into account that fact. So I hope that the Government will resist the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend because he has put the argument rather more eloquently than I could have done. That is precisely some of the thinking behind having to choose a period. We believe that 28 weeks is about right. It is the period for which statutory sick pay is paid, and many employers, as we know, pay full sick pay for that long anyway. Those ineligible for statutory sick pay are usually able to claim incapacity benefit or some other state benefit according to their need.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para1"></a>There is just one other point to add to what my noble friend said. Under the proposed scheme, payment for loss of earnings or earning capacity will be capped as at present at one-and-a-half times the national average wage. The amendment makes no allowance for such capping, which could mean that a higher wage earner off work for fewer than 28 weeks could receive considerably more for loss of earnings from the scheme than a lower paid worker who was off for more than 28 weeks. I am sure that that is not the intention of the amendment, and it is not the intention of the scheme. It would greatly increase the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer and would, in effect, mean a return to something close to the present system. As we have already heard from my noble friend, this would make the system work rather better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, and by the Minister. Of course I understand that the administration of effecting justice can sometimes be itself a substantial drain on the resources which could otherwise have been devoted to the doing of justice. Sometimes, I believe, we would be financially better off if we allowed every claim rather than devote the resources which we do to adjudicating on claims. However, there are obvious arguments against that.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para2"></a>Clearly in all these cases one has to balance the amount in issue against the cost. I could take that point more readily if the cut-off point were, say, four weeks or even six weeks. Someone deprived of his earnings and reduced to SSP for six weeks might suffer real hardship, but it would probably, in most cases, be hardship with which he could cope. If we are talking about 28 weeks, the hardship is mounting up week after week after week. The mortgage has to be paid and then there comes a time when the children need new clothes, and so on. By the end of the 28 weeks, the family, unless it is particularly robust, could be in a state of chaos. I believe that 28 weeks is too long to sustain that argument.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para3"></a>I see too the point made by the Minister, that there could be some anomalies, and we should be happy to see how they could be eliminated. We remain unhappy at this. There would be, not everyone, perhaps not <P>


<a name="column_651"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 651</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>massive numbers of people, but a substantial number of people who would suffer real hardship because of this rule. I should like to reflect upon what has been said in the course of the debate to see whether there may be other ways of addressing the problem. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved Amendment No. 26:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After clause 2, insert the following new clause&#151;
<center><b>Exclusion from Tariff of multiple injuries</B></center><br>
(". The Scheme shall provide for the calculation of a compensation award to an applicant who has suffered two or more injuries each of which would otherwise attract a Tariff based award at level 7 or above to be made upon the same principles as an award for pain, suffering and loss of amenity at common law.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-23_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 26 deals with multiple injuries and refers to the changes that have taken place between the original common law scheme, the illegal scheme that was introduced and has now been replaced, and the proposed new scheme. Unfortunately, this is one of the examples of defects in the illegal scheme being continued in the proposed new scheme. We are not talking about multiple minor injuries. There is a note to the tariff which states the way in which minor injuries such as grazing, bruising, black eyes or bloody noses shall be dealt with. The amendment is not concerned with those; it is concerned only with injuries at tariff level 7, which is &#163;3,000 or above.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para6"></a>The first tariff scheme provided that there should be a 100 per cent. payment for the first injury, a 10 per cent. payment for the second, a 5 per cent. payment for the third and nothing for any subsequent injury. I wish to give two examples in order to illustrate how that results in total awards which are not only very much less than the original common law scheme but so low as to be unreasonable and even unjust.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para7"></a>Perhaps I may give the example, first, of a man who was attacked and landed on his head on the pavement. He received a right-sided haematoma causing compression of the brain with evidence of confusion of the brain. As a result of that he suffered epileptic fits for a number of years in a continuing period after the injury. He had right-sided headaches and tinnitus and a tendency to become depressed and irritable. Indeed, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital on four or five occasions after the incident. His speech incapacity for language was significantly impaired. He was virtually unemployable, his personal life was destroyed and his marriage broke down after the incident. Under the common law scheme his award of general damages&#151;and I shall stick to those&#151;was &#163;50,000. Under the tariff scheme he would have received &#163;20,000 for the psychiatric injury, only 10 per cent. of &#163;12,500 for the epilepsy and only 5 per cent. of &#163;7,500 for tinnitus. That is a total award of &#163;22,000 as compared with the &#163;50,000 that he would otherwise have received.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para8"></a>The second example is of a woman who was aged 23 at the time of the incident. A hand-held distress flare hit her in the left eye and exploded. She lost the sight of <P>


<a name="column_652"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>her left eye, she has a traumatic cataract and severe retinal damage and is left with double vision in her left eye. She is unable to wear an occlusive contact lens, she has a shrunken eye, a shattered eyebrow, a fixed dilated pupil and divergent squint and she cannot close her eye because of the tethering of the skin. She has had plastic surgery but that has not worked. She was pregnant at the time but she has since been diagnosed as depressed. She was a trained hairdresser but she could not continue in that employment. Under the common law scheme she was awarded &#163;33,500. Under the tariff scheme she would have received &#163;20,000 for loss of sight, only 10 per cent. of &#163;7,500 for scarring and only 5 per cent. of &#163;7,500 for psychiatric injury. Therefore, she would have received &#163;21,000.
<P>

<a name="51016-23_para9"></a>There are literally hundreds of examples such as those in which the arbitrary figure of 100 per cent. for the first injury, 10 per cent. for the second injury, 5 per cent. for the third injury and nothing thereafter amount to injustice. That is not a challenge to the tariff; the tariff is not being attacked in this amendment. However, what is being attacked is the over-simplistic way in which the tariff deals with multiple injuries. Again, this is not an open door to huge numbers of claims. There were only 641 applications in respect of multiple injuries in the year of the operation of the 1994 scheme and it is difficult to imagine that there would be a significantly greater number in the future. I cannot calculate what the expenditure would be but on that number of applications it clearly would be very small indeed. However, there would be a significant improvement in the justice and acceptability of this scheme if those arbitrary limits were removed. I beg to move.

<A NAME="51016-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   On the last occasion I rose to support the Minister on an amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer. On this occasion, I make a brief intervention in support of the principle of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para0"></a>The provision for serious injuries as working in practice is frankly unfair. I agree with the noble Lord entirely in that approach. As a result of the decision of the judiciary of your Lordships' House which held that the tariff was unlawful, we had to look again at all those awards which had been decided under the then tariff. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, will agree with me that one of the most common comments of ourselves and our colleagues has been that that was shown to be very unfair when one is dealing with someone who has multiple injuries.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para1"></a>Of course, if you have a broken nose and a scar on the nose, it might be said that that is one injury which can be approached in that way. If you have a broken jaw and you have lost a tooth, again those are related injuries. But let us say that you have an accident which causes you to be blind in one eye. That does not mean that there is no effect if you have also broken your leg or badly broken your ankle. When you have injuries which are totally distinct, it seemed to those of us on the board who looked at those cases to be unfair to limit the award for the second injury to 10 per cent. As the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, demonstrated in the <P>


<a name="column_653"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 653</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>examples he gave, a figure is reached which does not compare with the degree of injury caused to the individual.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para2"></a>Between now and Report I ask the Minister to look again at the tariff proposal in relation to multiple injuries. She may not go along with the idea that they should be removed entirely from the tariff but I believe that the percentages are unfair and deserve to be looked at again.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para3"></a>While I am on my feet, perhaps I may say to my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger that I was not suggesting necessarily that &#163;100,000 could ever compensate a person for the loss of their eyes or for becoming paraplegic. The point that I was trying to make was that through the courts, society has accepted that there is a generally agreed figure for the pain and suffering element. The Government should not move too widely from that figure without at least reflecting on the consequences which that might have on the settlement of cases in the courts. I was not wishing to be hard on the paraplegic. I merely said that if other expenses were allowed on top, we should look again at the figure given for general damages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am afraid that this amendment&#151;like a number of others we shall consider later&#151;effectively rules itself out of court straightaway by talking in terms of assessment on the basis of common law damages. We have made it clear&#151;indeed, it is a central tenet of our tariff approach&#151;that we want to break right away from the present system based on individual assessment. We are looking for a system which is simple, quick and transparent, and one under which costs are more predictable and controllable. Our enhanced tariff scheme provides just such a system. Against that rationale, there can really be no question of reverting to the common law method of assessment for any category of case.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para4"></a>Before addressing the point at issue on the amendment, perhaps the Committee will bear with me while I say a few words about the general principle involved. It has been argued by many&#151;and it will no doubt continue to be argued&#151;that certain categories of case are not susceptible to a tariff-based approach but require assessment on an individual basis. We do not accept that view. I remind the Committee that the tariff was constructed extremely carefully on the basis of 20,000 awards made by the board. That extensive sampling exercise demonstrated clearly that it was quite feasible to group injuries into bands of comparable severity&#151;including complex or sensitive cases&#151;and that it was possible to assign a typical monetary value to that grouping (the median value). The exercise enabled us to devise a range of awards for all cases, including the difficult ones, depending on their relative seriousness.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para5"></a>As regards the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, he seemed to me to be comparing a common law award with a tariff and ignoring any loss of earnings payments or any after-care payments. Therefore, it was not an absolutely true comparison with what could be received by an applicant at the end of the day. I see that the noble Lord wishes to respond. I give way.

<P>
<A NAME="51016-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I was comparing the damage element of the common law with the tariff; in other words, I was excluding extra payments, loss of earnings and so on from both sides of the equation. So I was comparing like with like.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   In that case, I entirely withdraw the assumption that I drew.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para6"></a>Great care has been taken in the tariff to provide injury descriptions which can be readily applied. We therefore see no justification for departing from the straightforward tariff approach for particular classes of injury or type of case. That tariff approach is open, readily understood and provides certainty and consistency in the level of awards.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para7"></a>Victims will know where they stand. We think that that is most important. A return to subjective assessment&#151;for that is what the amendment and a number of those which follow amount to&#151;of the pain and suffering attributable to the injury would mean that cases would take longer to deal with, that there may be more appeals about quantum and that the costs of the scheme would be far less certain. What the scheme provides is a tariff payment plus an objective assessment of financial loss attributable to the injury. That is intended to deliver a fair, generous and consistent outcome across the whole range of cases.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para8"></a>As I have said before, and I shall no doubt have to say again, we are no longer aiming to provide finely-judged compensation on the same basis as hitherto. That is no longer appropriate, or affordable, for a scheme funded by the taxpayer which has to deal with over 70,000 claims a year. Many victims and their families think that their case is special and deserving of particular consideration. But we believe that our enhanced tariff scheme will provide for all types of case, without reintroducing delays.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para9"></a>Having made those more general remarks, I should now like to say something about the point at issue here. The draft scheme presently provides for serious multiple injuries to be assessed according to the formula of 100 per cent. for the first injury, 10 per cent. of the award for the second and&#151;where appropriate&#151;5 per cent. for the third.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para10"></a>The sampling exercise to which I referred a moment or two ago showed that in cases of multiple injury most of the award was made for the most serious injury, with very little added on for additional, lesser injuries. That approach is also recommended in the Judicial Studies Board guide to damages for personal injury. The tariff adopts the same approach, and the formula that we have adopted for assessing multiple injuries closely reflects board practice. We think that that is the most sensible way of dealing with such injuries, and can see no defensible basis for going down any other road.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para11"></a>In some circumstances I can see that our formula might be considered to leave the victim under compensated to some degree; for example, where he had lost both an arm and a leg and received only 10 per cent. of the award for the loss of the arm. But such cases are extremely rare. As I have sought to make clear at a number of points during consideration of the Bill, the <P>


<a name="column_655"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>scheme is not aiming to make good each and every loss an individual victim may have suffered. As there is no "right" figure for compensation, we are aiming instead to make a generous payment to most victims as quickly as we possibly can. We believe that the tariff scheme achieves just that aim. If the Committee accepts that point of view on the treatment of multiple injuries, then the consequential amendments to Clause 10 must also fall as the scheme will have set out how such injuries will be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para12"></a>My noble friend posed the question of whether or not I would consider, think about, or continue to read what has been said during the course of the debate between now and the next stage of the Bill's proceedings. I can give my noble friend that assurance unequivocally. Indeed, we shall go on thinking about all such matters until the Bill passes its final stages in this Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Minister's response has two parts. First, because we are discussing the first amendment which refers to a reversal to common law procedures, she makes the defence that she has made previously of the statistical procedure on which the tariff is based. As a statistician I am not opposed to the general principle on which the analysis was made. It was right to take a sample of cases&#151;a sample of 20,000 is a large number of cases&#151;and I was right to take the median rather than any other form of mean. However, I would still argue that the analysis of this proper sampling procedure has been inadequate.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para13"></a>If the analysis of each of the items in the tariff had taken account of the age of the victim, the sex of the victim, his or her occupation and the dominance and extent of multiple injuries, there are various ways in which it could have been made more sophisticated. We would have then obtained a more complex tariff&#151;there is nothing wrong in itself with a complex tariff&#151;and a tariff which more closely approached reality. At the moment we have a tariff which, through its ignorance and rejection of further discrimination by age, sex, occupation and dominance, is extremely crude. The Minister defends this, as she has throughout the Committee proceedings, on the grounds of transparency and speed. I do not reject that analysis; I agree that speed and transparency are important. However, a complex tariff can also be made transparent and can also be made accessible to the layman and it can be applied more speedily. It is better than a crude tariff. The same is true as regards multiple injuries.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para14"></a>Secondly, I come to the specific point which the Minister makes. She says that there is a relatively small number of cases of multiple injuries. Indeed I said that in my opening speech. There were only 641 in the first year of the tariff scheme. The Minister says that most of the people who receive these injuries receive a large amount for the first injury and a smaller amount for the second injury. However, that is an even stronger reason why the amounts that exist for the second and third injuries should not be reduced to 10 per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively, because it confirms that the cost of a more equitable recognition of the pain and suffering <P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>caused by multiple injuries would not be very great. However, such a provision would increase the credibility of the tariff scheme without breaching it.
<P>

<a name="51016-24_para15"></a>I would not have wished to put down an amendment which reverted to common law damages for multiple injuries if I could have avoided it. If I could think of a way of providing for multiple injuries within the tariff which was fairer than the 10 and 5 per cent. system, I would still prefer to opt for that. However, I do not have the resources to do that; the Minister and the Home Office do. They must acknowledge, as they have been urged to do by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, that the case for providing better treatment for those who have suffered multiple injuries is a sound one. Surely something could be done, if not by giving 100 per cent. awards for all injuries, then at least by providing something better than 10 per cent. or 5 per cent. In that way we can avoid what all of us want to avoid, which is a return to the common law scheme. It is because our amendment represents a return to the common law scheme and because I want to pursue the matter constructively with the Minister before we reach a later stage that I shall withdraw the amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="51016-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   Before the noble Lord does that, I should say that I wish to support his suggestion. Having obtained a sample of 20,000, which is a good start for an analysis, it should be possible at this stage to do a special analysis of the particular group of people who are affected in this way, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has suggested. The noble Lord probably has all the data and such an analysis could be carried out. It would be illuminating to see such an analysis. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, agrees with me but I believe that from a technical point of view it could be done and it would be useful.

<A NAME="51016-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It depends entirely on whether adequate records were kept of age, sex, multiple injuries and so on. Technically, the noble Baroness, who is a fellow social scientist, is quite right. Perhaps that is something that the Minister may like to pursue. One can make much better use of data of that kind if one has collected them correctly in the first instance. I am encouraged by the sampling exercise. I should like to feel that it can be used to greater effect than it has been, and I very much agree with what the noble Baroness said. Perhaps that is also a matter that we could consider "off line". I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="51016-25_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The Committee may find it convenient to discuss Amendment No. 29 with Amendment No. 28.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para3"></a>Once again we are addressing the inflexibility of the tariff scheme. In the course of the last debate the noble Baroness said that it had been argued that some categories of case are not susceptible to a tariff approach. It has indeed been so argued, and I argue that now, because it is true.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para4"></a>There are some situations which are notoriously difficult to assess in terms of appropriate compensation, whether one is arguing a personal injury case in the courts or one is a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. There are some cases where the effects of what is done vary enormously by reason of a whole range of factors of which no account is taken in the tariff. In fairness, I doubt whether account could easily be taken of such factors.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para5"></a>The two categories we raise in this debate were mentioned earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, when he introduced Amendment No. 6. His suggestion for dealing with the problem was a series of bands instead of a single inflexible figure against each entry in the tariff. The noble Lord was right when he said that our proposals&#151;he was probably referring to those in this amendment&#151;go further. We believe that there are some kinds of injury which do not fit into a tariff scheme at all, for the reasons which the noble Lord gave. For example, the effects of a sexual assault may vary with a whole range of factors: the degree of violence or intimidation; the place where the offence took place, whether it was a lonely country lane at night or a home which the offender shared with the victim; the degree of relationship between the two sides.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para6"></a>The scheme seeks to deal with those difficulties by forcing them into a series of boxes. At an earlier stage the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, gave some examples. In the case of sexual abuse of children, repeated non-consensual vaginal and/or anal intercourse over a period of up to three years compensation would be &#163;10,000; in a similar situation lasting longer than three years it would be &#163;17,500. There is not a gradation but a jump. In the case of sexual assaults other than on children, compensation for non-consensual vaginal or anal intercourse the figure would be &#163;7,500; and for the same offence involving two or more attackers there is a jump to &#163;10,000. If there are other serious bodily injuries there is a further jump to &#163;17,500.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para7"></a>The problem is that, if one attempts to produce a tariff by reference to the average of awards that have been made over a period of time, that average will fall very far short of what would be an appropriate level of compensation for the worst cases. My noble friend Lord McIntosh gave some examples in relation to the injuries that he discussed in the course of the previous debate. Perhaps I may give three examples.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para8"></a>The first is the case of a female aged three and a half who was subjected to sexual abuse over a period of time. She experienced disruption of sleep, loss of appetite, a reversion to bedwetting, was reluctant to associate with male adults, and refused to co-operate in a medical examination to assess whether physical damage had taken place. A psychiatric assessment <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concluded that family and social services support might alleviate acute problems but there was uncertainty as to whether it would be necessary to intervene therapeutically at different stages of development as the child grew up. Here we compare like with like. The general award of damages was &#163;7,500. So far as we can judge, the tariff award would have been &#163;2,000.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para9"></a>Perhaps I may take another example. A boy and girl aged respectively 13 and 12 years were abused by their father over a long period. Despite injunctions, it was believed that he wanted to continue to see the children. It was thought that the harassment and terror were an important contribution to the children's failure to overcome any of their major symptoms caused by the abuse; they had aggravated the abuse. There could not be provision for that situation in the tariff without making the tariff impossibly complicated. General damages in that case were &#163;15,000 for each child. Under the tariff they would have received &#163;6,000.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para10"></a>The effects can vary from permanent psychological damage which may ruin a victim's life to the shock and distress which a particularly robust individual may put behind him or her after a few months.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para11"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the other example: sexual assaults on other than children. Again I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that some of those damages cannot be forced into boxes. I give one example of a female aged 27 at the date of the assault. Already she had developed epilepsy. She had educational learning difficulties and suffered from a pre-existing schizo-affective disorder. She was then living reasonably happily in sheltered accommodation. Following the incident, her mental state deteriorated. Her schizophrenic symptoms flared up. She developed severe depression. The evidence of the consultant was that the change in the pattern of her illness was significant and appeared likely to extend for an indefinite period into the future. Her general damages were &#163;10,000. Under the tariff scheme she would have received &#163;3,000.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para12"></a>One could go on. I hope, however, that the noble Baroness will take on board that there are some kinds of injury where the effects vary enormously with a range of factors which have not been included in the scheme and could not reasonably be expected to be included. We do not seek to abolish the scheme. We simply say that every rule has some sensible exceptions. I hope that the Government will find it possible to think again on this issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I support what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, said. When I moved Amendment No. 6, I stated to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, that I preferred my approach to his because I had attempted to meet the Government's intention to obtain a tariff and to find some discretion within the tariff. However, I have to come clean and say that that apart my preference would be for the total exclusion of sexual offences from the tariff for all the reasons that have been stated. The board has always taken the view that sexual assaults on children are not properly or suitably assessed under a tariff scheme. Every word that one heard from the Minister in answer to the last debate on multiple injuries, and from what I suspect she will <P>


<a name="column_659"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 659</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say on this issue, proves the case that we should be discussing a hybrid scheme with something like 85 per cent. of cases being dealt with under a tariff. The 15 per cent. which are extremely complicated or serious, or involve particularly sensitive aspects of matters such as child abuse, should have been put out to individual assessment. In that way a great deal more money would have been saved than the Government will save at the end of the day.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_time0"></a><H5>9.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   I endorse what the noble Lord said. Practice has shown that the great majority of children who have been abused, whether boys or girls, are in local authority care. No matter what award a single board member makes to the child, the local authority has to watch its back, so to speak. It has to look after the interest of the child. Inevitably it appeals against the award. It is a very, very difficult, almost impossible, situation to ask members of the board to deal with. I adopt the idea of the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, that there should perhaps be a special sexual abuse unit, government-funded or otherwise, to deal with these matters, with specialists dealing with local authorities.
<P>

<a name="51016-25_para13"></a>A lot of time is wasted. One can readily understand why people in the social services and the local authorities appeal against most awards. It is because they could no doubt be sued in a few years' time by the victim, asking why they did not appeal against a particular award of, say, two-and-a-half thousand pounds. I know somebody who received &#163;15,000, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, just demonstrated. Therefore, a multiplicity of sexual abuse cases are pursued through the board and take up a lot of time. No doubt other areas of life might be excluded from this scheme, but that is a matter for debate on another day or night as the case may be. Certainly, sexual abuse cases represent one of the most difficult areas for adjudication.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   To take the special cases contained within both this present amendment and those that are to come, we are not talking about minor variations from the tariff scheme. We are talking about very substantial numbers of cases if taken altogether. The same principle applies. A very real attempt was made to look at 20,000 awards right across the board, including the types of cases to which we are referring, and including some that are very complex and difficult. The aim was to arrive at a semi-scientific judgment on the basis of that sample, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, said, is a fairly substantial number of cases. We shall continue to consider whether that can be refined. The view has been taken that there should be a tariff scheme. All the arguments about moving away from a tariff scheme continue to apply.
<P>

<a name="51016-26_para0"></a>It is very interesting that, while my noble friend hinted that the Government could save money if they took on board some of these amendments, every single example used so far has doubled, trebled or quadrupled the amount of award. All the examples used stated that the general award would be X, the award from the tariff would be Y. In each case the tariff award was lower <P>


<a name="column_660"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 660</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than would be the general award. That was used as an illustrative case, both by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, and by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. We are saying: yes, there is an element of rough justice in this; some will receive more under the scheme, and some will receive less. But the scheme is a real attempt to respond speedily to people who have been the subject of criminal assault. We have also tried to make the scheme readily understood. I keep using the word "transparent". It is very important that people see and understand the nature of the scheme, together with money for aftercare, loss of earnings and loss of pension rights. Frankly, I want to stay with that principle. The numbers of occasions and the numbers of groups cited throughout the day in an appeal to move away from the tariff scheme and towards the common law scheme invalidate the whole essential thrust of the Government's case to produce a tariff scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   The noble Baroness takes comfort from the fact that the Government looked at 20,000 awards. I have no doubt that they did it very carefully. I accept that the results reflect the average of those awards. The whole thrust of our argument is that there are some kinds of injury where the average simply bears no relationship to the worst cases.
<P>

<a name="51016-26_para1"></a>I cannot make it any clearer than I have tried to make it already. When the noble Baroness reflects upon this matter after the benefit of a night's sleep and reads what we have all said perhaps she may at least take in that argument and appreciate that what she has said is not an answer to the argument. It is true that the examples that we have given will increase some of the awards and thus the cost of the scheme, though not, I suspect, as substantially as the noble Baroness appears to think. Perhaps someone may do a little work on this and some figures will be available, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, suggested in another context a few minutes ago. If that is the price of doing justice in the worst cases it seems to be a price that is worth paying.
<P>

<a name="51016-26_para2"></a>However, this is perhaps not the occasion to press the matter further. I should like to give the noble Baroness an opportunity to do what I have suggested. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51016-26_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: We have been round this course so often that your Lordships shall not be wearied further by it.

It is impossible to <P>


<a name="column_661"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column 661</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expect a tariff scheme to incorporate all of that. When we looked at the scheme to see what was the tariff figure against shock we found that there was a note but no figure at all. The tariff simply does not cater for shock, as my noble friend Lord McIntosh said earlier in the debate. I assume that the reason is that the Law Commission is looking at the whole field. I hope that at a not too distant date it will make a number of recommendations which can be given effect to when they arise. But, if we are to be confronted with a tariff, that will not make the process any easier. I shall not repeat all the arguments that we have already traversed in the course of the debate. I beg to move the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This is yet another group of people for whom noble Lords opposite believe that the tariff scheme is not appropriate and for whom the common law damages approach is the answer. We can no longer argue that this is just a small example of how a tariff scheme and a common law damage scheme can work alongside each other. Just as the noble and learned Lord cannot add anything to his argument in pressing for yet another special case&#151;we have been dealing with special cases for a long time as part of today's debate&#151;I do not believe I can take the matter much further. I do not agree with the noble and learned Lord. I believe that a real attempt has been made to arrive at a tariff scheme that reflects complexity, the range of injuries and what the board has awarded in a large number of cases. I believe that, if we are to have a tariff scheme, to deal with all these matters in a different way is not acceptable or sustainable. It will introduce unpredictability and instability. We know that at the moment with the common law scheme costs escalate uncontrollably. I have suggested that there will be no caps on the highest award. All these categories will be brought back into the common law scheme, with all the complexity of introducing the administrative arrangements to deal with them, taking each of the categories suggested by the amendments today case by case. I believe that it will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>wholly invalidate the changes that we are trying to make: predictability, stability, transparency and speed of response to people who are the victims of crime. We wish to have something that is predictable, controllable and affordable to the taxpayer who has to meet the bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If these matters were indeed in the tariff, the Minister might have a case; but they are not. The tariff says "Shock&#151;see notes" and then gives five different levels of seriousness of shock, such as disabling or temporarily disabling, over different periods of time. When one looks at the notes, there is simply a list of different kinds of shock or mental injury (which is what we are talking about) and there is no attempt at all to produce an effective tariff. There is no predictability in the tariff so far as concerns mental injury. There is no transparency. There is no certainty, and there is no speed. Beyond that, the Government have already acknowledged that the Law Commission is looking into this matter and that anything that they do in the future will have to be changed.
<P>

<a name="51016-26_para6"></a>Whatever my noble and learned friend may decide to do about the amendment, it does not come well from the Government to claim that the tariff provides an adequate description of the compensation amounts for mental injury.

<P>
<UL>Further to their Answer of 19th July (HL WA34) whether they will say when they expect the eight prisoners convicted of terrorist offences at present temporarily transferred to Northern Ireland prisons to be returned to Great Britain; and
<P>
By what criteria they are guided in deciding which prisoners convicted of terrorist offences in Great Britain should be transferred to prisons in Northern Ireland and which of those should be transferred to Northern Ireland jurisdiction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch: </B>  All requests by prisoners for permanent or temporary transfer to another United Kingdom jurisdiction are considered on their individual merits under criteria announced to Parliament in answer to a Written Question from Lord Hylton on 23 November 1992 (HL WA60).
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para0"></a>A permanent transfer has the effect of transferring responsibility for the prisoner's continued detention and release to the receiving jurisdiction. A request for such a transfer which meets the criteria may, however, be refused if it is considered that the prisoner's crimes were so serious as to make it inappropriate that he or she should benefit from a substantial reduction in time to serve if that would be a consequence of the transfer.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para1"></a>If a permanent transfer is refused, a temporary transfer may be granted. A temporary transfer does not disturb a prisoner's release arrangements; these remain the responsibility of the sentencing jurisdiction.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para2"></a>Of the eight prisoners convicted of terrorist-related offences and granted a temporary transfer to Northern Ireland, four have been granted a period of temporary transfer of up to six months from 28 July. The temporary transfers of the other four expire on 1 September.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para3"></a>The criteria for considering transfer requests provide for prisoners granted a period of temporary transfer to apply for extensions. It is open to the eight terrorist prisoners to apply for further periods of temporary transfer before expiry of their current transfer. Any such request will be considered on its individual merits.

<A NAME="51016w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Consultation on the Interdepartmental Review of Fire Safety Legislation and Enforcement resulted in over 460 responses, many of them raising important and complex issues. The Deregulation Task Force, set up to help the Government promote deregulation, is now being consulted about the way ahead on fire regulation and enforcement, including the draft Fire Precautions (Places of Work) Regulations and the emerging findings on the review. The Government's response will be announced as soon as this is complete.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The following information is given for the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para4"></a>There are currently 21,066 district council and 4,024 regional or county council seats. Local authorities have the discretion to set their own allowances and travel and subsistence rates, although the Government do set a ceiling for some rates. The figures for average remuneration and expenses are not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para5"></a>There are 651 Members of the House of Commons. The total salary cost for 1993&#150;94 was &#163;22,934,000, giving an average salary cost of &#163;35,229. The total allowances cost was &#163;43,599,000, giving an average allowance cost of &#163;66,972.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para6"></a>As at 31 March 1994, there were 1,202 Members of the House of Lords, of whom 92 were Peers without writs and 79 were Peers' with leave of absence. Of the 1,031 eligible to attend the House, 936 did so. Payments from the Peer's Expenses subhead of the Lords' Vote totalled &#163;6,274,000, giving an average of &#163;6,700 per Peer. Remuneration is restricted to a few specific Peers and it would therefore not be appropriate to provide an average for this. The value of facilities provided free of charge to MPs and Peers could only be provided at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="51016w01_para7"></a>There are 87 Members of the European Parliament representing the United Kingdom. 85 received the full salary payable at 1 January 1994 of &#163;31,687. Two received a reduced, one-third rate of &#163;10,562 because they held dual mandates (that is, were MEPs and UK MPs at the same time). Allowances and expenses are met directly from the budget of the European Commission and figures could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

<P>

<a name="51016w02_para2"></a>Comprehensive monitoring by water companies in the last five years indicates that contamination of drinking water by organophosphate pesticides is not a problem. Concentrations of organophosphates in drinking water are practically always below the statutory limit of 0.1 microgram per litre. On the few occasions when an organophosphate compound has been detected above this limit, it has been present transiently. The concentrations correspond to exposures many thousands of times lower than those known to be harmful or likely to affect health.

<A NAME="51016w03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   In 1992, when the Agriculture Council agreed reforms to the tobacco regime, the Commission estimated that these would reduce expenditure by 25 per cent. by 1997, from 1233 mecu (&#163;873m*) to 903 mecu (&#163;639m*). The reforms are now in place. The major changes were the removal in all but exceptional circumstances of export refunds and intervention, which had accounted for about 5 per cent. of expenditure on tobacco, and the reduction in the volume of tobacco eligible for support by around 18 per cent. The full impact of these changes is not transparent in the 1995 expenditure estimate of 1132 mecu (&#163;906 million**) because of the effect of exchange rate fluctuations and the agrimonetary system in the meantime. The regime is to be reviewed again in 1996.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016w03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Discussions on the EU proposals to set limits for nitrate in lettuce have been held in abeyance pending the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) on the toxicology of nitrate. The SCF has very recently reaffirmed its Acceptable Daily Intake for nitrate set in 1990, but it considered that it has insufficient information to judge whether setting maximum limits on nitrate levels in certain vegetables would have significant effect on overall intakes. The SCF is aware that the current survey of dietary nitrate intake in the framework of Scientific Co-operation may provide more information. The UK will be pressing the Commission to await the outcome of this study before it restarts discussions on the proposed regulations.
<P>

<a name="51016w03_para8"></a>We continue to oppose the Commission's proposals on the grounds that there is no scientific evidence that they would improve safety of food for the UK consumer.

<P>
<UL>Whether they will commission further research into the methods of detecting airborne levels of organophosphates in the aerosol generated during sheep dipping and the extent to which these aerosols are absorbed by humans.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016w03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   As part of a broader investigation into sheep dipping practices, the relative contribution of contamination of the skin and of the inhaled air to the overall exposure of sheep dippers to organophosphates has been assessed in collaborative studies carried out by the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) Edinburgh, and the Health and Safety Executive. The results were published in 1993.
<P>

<a name="51016w03_para9"></a>The assessment methods used are well established and have been validated. In a study of sheep dipping being carried out under normal conditions by farmers, no detectable contamination of inhaled air was found whilst skin contamination was considerable. The detection methods for airborne contamination were sensitive enough to detect contamination well below that which is expected to produce harmful effects. In an additional study involving a contractor using a mobile dip, only trace amounts were found (0.035 mg/m <sup>3</sup> ), which were well below the concentration (0.1 mg/m*sup3;) which has been judged to be the safe limit of exposure for 8 hours every day. These studies indicated that inhalation made only a minor contribution to the total exposure to OPs resulting from dipping sheep and that efforts to reduce exposure should be concentrated on measures to prevent the dip from getting on to the skin.
<P>

<a name="51016w03_para10"></a>We therefore do not see any need to commission further research.

<UL>Whether they still consider measurements of cholinesterase activity to be a reliable method for assessing levels of exposure to organophosphates, particularly those used in sheep dips, and if not whether they will commission research to find an appropriate indicator.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51016w04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Measurement of blood cholinesterase activity is considered to be a useful method of monitoring acute exposure to organophosphates under certain circumstances. Guidance in the government booklet Sheep dipping AS29 (Rev), recommends monitoring cholinesterase levels in contract sheep dippers who may have regular and frequent exposure to sheep dip chemicals. Measurement of cholinesterase <P>


<a name="column_WA79"></a>

<B>16 Oct 1995 : Column WA79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may also be a useful diagnostic tool in cases of severe acute poisoning, where levels are expected to be clearly below the normal range. As the activity may recover rapidly, it is necessary to test the blood immediately after exposure. It would not however be the most suitable method for assessing levels of exposure among those, such as sheep farmers, who use organophosphates sporadically.
<P>

<a name="51016w04_para0"></a>An alternative method is to monitor urinary excretion of the breakdown products of organophosphates. This has been used by the Health and Safety Executive to estimate exposure of sheep dippers to organophosphates and compare it with that of other workers. The levels found were similar to those found in other agricultural workers exposed to organophosphates and lower than those found in workers manufacturing pesticides. Although very sensitive for measuring exposure to diazinon, it cannot be used to determine exposure to propetamphos, because the urinary marker metabolite measured is not formed by this organophosphate. Diazinon and propetamphos are the two main active ingredients in organophosphorus sheep dips.
<P>

<a name="51016w04_para1"></a>These two methods (the measurement of cholinesterase activity and of urinary metabolites) provide workable tools for monitoring acute exposure to organophosphates.
<P>

<a name="51016w04_para2"></a>There is no method for measuring chronic exposure. Development of such methods would depend on prior knowledge of a biochemical defect or of any biomarker associated with chronic exposure. There is currently no evidence of such a defect or of any biomarker suitable for assessing such exposure. (The enzyme neuropathy target esterase (NTE), which is associated with delayed neuropathy, is not affected by diazinon, so this would not be a useful measure).
<P>

<a name="51016w04_para3"></a>We take the concerns over possible long-term health effects of OP exposure very seriously and are commissioning new research to investigate whether chronic exposure poses a health risk to sheep dippers. It is expected that an announcement about the award of a contract will be made shortly.

The Commission reported on progress to the Cannes European Council in June. The European Council restated the importance which it attached to a rigorous application of the principle of subsidiarity, and called on the Commission to report back to the European Council's meeting in Madrid in December.

<FONT SIZE=3>the Answer given to Mr. Bernard Jenkin on 8 July 1995 in another place. Under the principle of subsidiarity, which was codified as a binding Treaty provision by the Maastricht Treaty, the European Community is to act only where action at the Community level is lawful and justified and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the EC Treaty. In the areas of health, education, training and culture the Treaty explicitly limits the scope for Community action.

<a name="51016w05_para1"></a>Articles 8 and 18 of the Basic Law provide that the Court of Final Appeal has jurisdiction to apply the common law except in so far as it may contravene the Basic Law itself.
<P>

<a name="51016w05_para2"></a>Article 19 of the Basic Law obliges the court to obtain an executive certificate but only on questions of fact concerning acts of state whenever such questions arise in the course of adjudication. This is consistent with the present position in the common law, whereby certificates on questions of fact concerning acts of state are binding on the courts. But such a certificate cannot pronounce on matters of law, as opposed to fact. In so far as it purported to do so, it would not be binding on the courts. Thus, the legal consequences which flow from the facts remain a matter of law for the courts.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
