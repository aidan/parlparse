The office of Black Rod is an important one for the realm, and when the holder of that office changes, it is an important moment for the House.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09043029000005"></a>Others will follow me with tributes specifically focusing on particular aspects of the job, as it has been defined, of the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, on security, for instance, or on ceremonial matters. I am convinced that my job today is more difficult than theirs, because it falls to me to give to the House a sense of what Black Rod is like&#151;difficult, because he is so well known to all Members of the House that each individual Member will have a clear view of what Black Rod is like.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09043029000006"></a>As Black Rod, though a commanding figure, he has been assiduous in engaging with, communicating with, and talking to all Members on all sides of the House. He has seen, I believe, accessibility as a central part of his job. That may of course be because, as an old military man, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Willcocks believes that it has been pretty well essential for him to know the lay of the land. It is as well, though, because he is a naturally gregarious and sociable man. Black Rod is a familiar figure to the House, whether swinging along Millbank of a morning, with his dog Sugar by his side, or in deep conversation in the Bishops&#146; Bar, or just being about the corridors of the House so that Members can tackle him on any issues of concern to them. In fact, so assiduous is he that I hope he will forgive me for revealing to the House his nickname in his old Army regiment, the Royal Horse Artillery. He was known, highly affectionately, after the old &#147;Magic Roundabout&#148; figure, as Zebedee&#151;always bouncing about as if spring-loaded. To echo the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in his reply to the opening of the debate on the gracious Speech, &#147;Boing!&#148;.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09043029000007"></a>Black Rod, too, is a familiar figure well beyond this House. Visiting a school recently, I was asking the pupils what they knew about Parliament. I talked a  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_320"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>little about something that they may have witnessed on television&#151;the State Opening of Parliament. What did they know about it? That was clear: &#147;There&#146;s a man with a stick, Miss, who bangs on the door three times every year. Miss, does he get paid for that job?&#148;. Now, we happen to know that there is, perhaps, a touch more to the job of Black Rod than that, yet it does portray that office as a key symbol of Parliament and a fixture in the public consciousness of what Parliament does. Sir Michael has taken very seriously, as is right, those aspects of his job&#151;his role in Parliament and his role as a member of the Royal Household. He has never been stuffy, but he has always been serious: serious in what has been his role, serious in how he has gone about it, and serious in what he has accomplished for this House.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09043029000008"></a>There is, however, another side to Sir Michael&#151;Mike to all who know him, although, as Leader, he and I both stick properly to our formal titles in dealing with each other, as he has quite rightly done with all my predecessors with whom he has so successfully worked in his eight years, all but a few weeks, in the role. He is, too, a well-spring of jokes and anecdotes. I shall not attempt to repeat any of them here, partly because I should pale in comparison to his own abilities, and partly because I do not have his particular skill of starting out with what looks likely to be an extraordinarily risqu&#233; joke that turns out, somehow magically, to be highly respectable.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09043029000009"></a>Although we are used to seeing him formally attired and properly dressed, it has not always been like that. He is remembered for the occasions when he left behind at home his ceremonial shoes, and had to process in a natty pair of leather loafers, and for when he left his tights behind&#151;Ede &amp; Ravenscroft 60 denier, I am told&#151;although history, perhaps thankfully, does not record his strategies to mount a cover-up and spare his, and our, blushes. However, he has been unembarrassed in wanting to spread the word about what this House does; those skills will no doubt stand him in good stead when he moves to his new role with the Press Complaints Commission.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09043029000010"></a>As Black Rod, he has shown considerable leadership and prompted great loyalty among his staff. He may not always have agreed with the decisions taken by the House, but when he has not he has, despite his own views, as ever, enacted those decisions to the letter. He has, too, been a key member of the management team of the Lords. In particular, it falls to Black Rod to take on the highly unenviable task of arranging office accommodation for Peers, where his tact and skill in handling the difficult issues have been exemplary. His strategic work on accommodation, based around the planned island site for Lords offices, has been essential.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09043029000011"></a>I take this opportunity to pay special tribute to him for the way he has handled the number of particularly difficult issues on which we have worked since I became Leader of this House, including the matter of the police inquiries earlier this year. Throughout those difficult periods, Black Rod, again, acted with tact, skill and sensitivity, as well as the required robustness when necessary. In doing so&#151;just as he did when, a few short months into his job, he had to deal with the security implications of the 9/11 terrorist attacks for

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09043029000012"></a>I welcome Lieutenant-General Sir Freddie Viggers as his successor as Black Rod, and Carl Woodall as Director of Facilities. I look forward to working closely with them both. I end, as I began, by thanking Black Rod for all that he has done for this House: for his courtesy, for his considerateness, for his care, for his attention, for his effort, and for his enthusiasm. We are all indebted to him, and we are all grateful.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="09043029000013"></a><b><a name="90430-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09043029000538"></a>Lord Strathclyde:</b> My Lords, I wholeheartedly associate myself and this side of the House with the tribute that the noble Baroness the Leader of the House has just made in welcoming Lieutenant-General Sir Freddie Viggers and with her tremendous expressions of gratitude to Sir Michael Willcocks.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09043029000014"></a>I would like to speak particularly of Sir Michael's role in ceremonial. Need I say more of Sir Michael's conduct than that it was masterly in every sense of the word? After all, he is one of the few to come under attack from that notorious network of spin doctors and not only to survive it but, with characteristic tenacity and courage, to teach those who tried to bully him a sharp lesson or two.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09043029000015"></a>Ceremony is an expression of the roots and the continuities that are needed in a fast-changing modern world. It is an affirmation that institutions are greater than those who temporarily embody them and it is something that I believe we in Britain do better than anyone. Day in, day out, in small things and big, Black Rod has unfailingly seen that we put our feet in the right place&#151;and he has never put a foot wrong either.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09043029000016"></a>Sir Michael's place in the history books is assured, when all is said and done, for his conduct of, and in, that immense and moving event of the lying-in-state of a greatly loved Queen. No one who witnessed that event will ever forget it, or the fact that Westminster Hall was open 24 hours a day for people to pay their respects. It was largely thanks to Sir Michael that it was a unifying ceremony of state and nothing more.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09043029000017"></a>In that great work of literature, the <I>Alastair Campbell Diaries</I>, Sir Michael is described as &#147;that little ... (expletive deleted)&#148;. That accolade alone shows that he must have done something right. I am told that Black Rod's reaction, with that typically pithy sense of humour, was, &#147;How dare he call me little?&#148;</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09043029000018"></a>Sir Michael was a big man, in a great office, that he carried out with exemplary loyalty and devotion to this House and, above all, to the Crown. We will all miss him. We thank him sincerely, and we wish him well.</p>

I am sure Sir Michael will be pleased that not only is he in the &#147;loft&#148;, but so, too, are many of the staff who worked closely with him, who are listening to these tributes.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_322"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09043029000020"></a>It is my part of this carve-up to talk about his role in managing the parliamentary estate&#151;a rather dull part of his role, your Lordships might think, but important. Probably no greater tribute can be paid to Sir Michael than the fact that, when he leaves, two people will replace him, in that a parliamentary estates manager will take over that part of his job. It is important that we understand what a difficult job it is properly to manage a building that is a world and national treasure and yet keep it working effectively as a modern Parliament, while at the same time managing it in a pull-me, push-me way, with other parts of the management at the other end not always working collegiately. To add to this problem, the whole thing is managed by committee. It must test a military man to the utmost to find that his ideas and his plans are then taken to a committee of politicians. Just for a fleeting moment you can sometimes see pass across his eyes the thought, &#147;If I could get you lot on a parade ground for 15 minutes&#148;, but then the diplomacy kicks in and he listens patiently while some of his carefully thought out ideas for making this place more efficient are slowly unpicked by people probably reading their committee papers for the first time. I wish him very good fortune in the future.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09043029000021"></a>As well as his diplomacy, we have to recognise his courage. Certainly, the ex-Members of the other place will appreciate this. Every year, for eight years, we have sent that man down that Corridor to that Door, knowing that on the other side, waiting for him, is Dennis Skinner. That alone deserves another gong on the list that was read out. The greatest tribute to Sir Michael is that long before his term of duty was over, he managed to turn the press coverage of the annual event that has almost become part of our constitution in favour of Black Rod, rather than Mr Skinner.</p>

<a name="90430-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09043029000022"></a>It is a moment of parting. I know, as a member of the House Committee, just how much work and preparation has gone into the island site in particular. It will be Black Rod&#146;s memorial when we eventually get it. In the meantime, along with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and the Lord President, and&#151;learning something new every day&#151;I wish Zebedee a very happy retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09043029000024"></a>A rough estimate indicates that there have been 57 Black Rods since 1361 when a certain Walter Whitehorse got the job of supervising access to the House of Lords. The job has changed in the intervening 700 or so years, but perhaps never quite as rapidly as during the tenure of Sir Michael, the 57th Black Rod. Sir Michael took over from his predecessor barely four months before that terrible autumn day, 9/11, when the focus of his job shifted dramatically.</p>

As Bishops in the Church of England we know what it is to try to maintain confidence and stability when all around is changing.

With that relationship, we have continued, in perfect harmony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09043029000029"></a>Sir Michael has been particularly valuable to this House because the advice he has given on security issues, at a time when that advice was of crucial importance, has always been professional, as one would expect from his history, and his assessment of risk and of the measures to obviate that risk has been of the highest quality. However, that has always been tempered by an understanding of and commitment to the need for this place, this Parliament, to be accessible to staff, to Members and above all to the public whom we serve. For that I have the highest gratitude.</p>

The reply to the Question for Written Answer asked by the noble Lord, Lord Corbett of Castle Vale, was delayed due to the time taken to identify the document in question, to confirm that it constituted an official document, to check whether it amounted to confidential advice to Ministers and to ensure that all concerned were content with the response. The reply to the Question for Written Answer asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was delayed due to difficulties with the distribution and submission of Written Parliamentary Questions, following the introduction of a new IT system in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office used for the drafting and dispatch of Written Parliamentary Questions.</p>

But could she say why it was that when I asked the Question earlier as a Written Question, Ministers simply brushed it aside and ignored it? It is long overdue that Ministers more often are given answers rather than just replies to pass on to those who ask Written Questions in this House.</p>

First, the 500 people were trained as part of a regular ongoing training programme whose origins date back to the establishment of Commission offices around the world as a result of the treaty of Maastricht. The training programme was reorganised by my noble friend Lord Kinnock some years ago, so it is a routine part of the Commission's work. There are now 130 overseas Commission offices. Sometimes, that is confused with the new external service, which is intended to secure better co-ordination between the Commission and the Council and is in no way intended to replace the embassies of member states.</p>

I cannot at this moment provide the annual figures, but the point is that it involves people from different parts of the European Commission who, as part of their work, need to engage with the broader Community.

If we look at the work of the Commission around the world on issues as wide-ranging as the environment, commerce, trade, transport and human rights, we see that they are a series of activities of enormous importance. Most of us in the House believe it very important that the Commission carries out that work around the world.</p>

Does he by any chance have figures on how many member states of the United Nations the British Government no longer have permanent representation within? Does he accept that there are some advantages in sharing facilities in small countries abroad? I am about to go to Reykjavik; I know that we share some facilities with the Germans there and in several other countries.

Like the noble Lord, I think that Britain&#146;s representation abroad is critical. We want to keep it as strong and universal as possible. However, where costs make that impossible, the fact that we can occasionally share offices with other European member states or, occasionally, even with the Commission is an economy measure which allows us to be present in more places than would otherwise be the case.</p>

The Council of Ministers or other organs in Brussels occasionally determine that such a demarche needs to be made, so the instruction can occasionally also come from Brussels. However, there is a lot of delegated freedom for European diplomats collectively to act locally on key issues.</p>

There were initial routine preparations under the Slovenian presidency in 2007, which always happens when there are preparations for a treaty to go into force, but those were suspended at the time of the loss of the Irish referendum and have not been resumed. On his first point, I say again that the purpose of this external action service is not to replace national embassies. What I cannot give the noble Lord, obviously, is an assurance that the current footprint of British national embassies around the world will remain exactly as it is for ever. Nor could I, in a sense hypothetically, tell him now what a Minister standing at this Dispatch Box some years from now might claim as the reason for opening or closing specific embassies.</p>

I am thinking of the requirement to have served for 20 years, when only officers are allowed to do so, with 15 years being the maximum for others. In view of the Government&#146;s defeat yesterday, will the Statement later give all the information necessary?

Therefore, a Statement was made in the other place yesterday evening, which I will repeat later today. On numbers, one of the major difficulties seems to be the estimate from those who are supporting the Gurkhas that only 100 people would benefit from the new government proposals, whereas the Government&#146;s estimate, which was based on Ministry of Defence figures, was 10,000, as I have just outlined. The test of this will be the examination of the 1,500 outstanding cases, which my colleague in the House of Commons, the Minister responsible for this, said would now be completed by the end of May. That will give us a much closer estimate and enable us to see who is correct&#151;those who are very pessimistic about the number who will enter or those in the Government&#146;s ranks who believe that the number will be in the area that I mentioned. Any new policy has to await the urgent examination of these cases and take account of the debate in the other place yesterday.</p>

In making estimates, one has to estimate the scenario that could be the most expensive. Some argue that fewer than that would wish to come. The figure will be tested in the debates next Tuesday, because the Minister responsible, Mr Woolas, will appear before a Select Committee on this issue.

I feel more like a sacrificial goat than a sacrificial lamb, although I do not want to take that too far. This gives me a unique opportunity as a Minister to say that the Liberals did not do a lot about the Gurkhas when they were last in power. In fact, no Government did until this Government. In 1997, we introduced equal pay with the British Armed Forces and we have improved pensions. All the fairness that has been given to Gurkhas has come in the last decade. We believed that these regulations were full and fair, met the spirit of the judgment in the High Court and would command the respect and support of Parliament. However, it is clear from the views expressed in another place that they have not achieved that last aim. Therefore, they will be looked at again over the next few weeks. It is promised that the outcome will be reported to the House before the Summer Recess.</p>

At that time there was tremendous pressure for those who lived in Hong Kong to be able to come to Britain if they wanted to. There was a terrible row because the Home Office did not want that. The officials said that there would be far too many people coming in. I was at the Home Office at the time and I thought that they should be allowed in, but I was told, &#147;No, we can&#146;t have it&#148;. The result was that hardly anyone came in. If we gave the Gurkhas the right to come here, maybe very few would do so, but the ability to come would be a great comfort to them.</p>

We have promised to ensure that the cases of those in the pipeline are not at all prejudiced. Those who are being reviewed before the end of May, if they have passed the criteria, will be granted leave.

Any criteria that take account of service other than 100 per cent of zero&#151;in other words, people have eligibility simply by being a member of the Gurkhas at any time&#151;will have to be cast in a discriminatory sense; there will have to be a qualifying period below which you do not qualify and above which you do. Taken with the other factors, that is part of the package that has not found favour in another place, so we will be looking at it. The 20-year factor produces a certain number, which will clearly increase if the factor of seniority is reduced from 20 years, but that is a judgment to be made in the light of the examination of the outstanding cases, taking account of the sentiments of Parliament.</p>

<a name="09043029000097"></a><b><a name="90430-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09043029000623"></a>Lord King of Bridgwater:</b> My Lords, I start with a tribute to our Armed Forces that is neither facile nor routine, but a genuine recognition on this day, when a memorial service is being conducted in Basra to those who have lost their lives in the Iraq campaign, of the debt that we owe to our Armed Forces. Many criticisms have been made of the current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, not least in your Lordships&#146; House, but virtually none has been made about the conduct and outstanding performance of our Armed Forces in the circumstances in which they find themselves, some of which are extremely dangerous, where the loss of life could have been extremely high but where their courage, professionalism and morale have saved the day.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09043029000098"></a>It is a sobering thought that we are discussing the involvement of our Armed Forces in two campaigns, both of which have already lasted significantly longer than either of the two world wars, and it is right that we should recognise at this time the price that they have paid. In Iraq, just under 180 lives have been lost, and in Afghanistan, 150. But I include immediately those who have been very seriously and seriously injured. Earlier the Minister very properly expressed her condolences at the loss of another life, but I hope we never forget those whose lives will never be the same again. In Iraq, there have been 220 very seriously or seriously injured casualties, while during the first three years of the Afghanistan campaign, from 2003-05, there were only 10. Over the past three years, however, there have been 185. I add also another category that is of increasing significance and about which there is a real and increasing concern. I refer to those suffering from mental health problems resulting from stress as a result of the particularly difficult nature of these campaigns. Between 2003 and 2006 the number being managed for mental illness by the Defence Medical Services was 2,300, but in 2007 alone the figure rose by a further 1,900. I do not have the figure for 2008, but I fear that it will continue to increase.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09043029000099"></a>Against that background, we are concerned about the situation of our Armed Forces. Many noble Lords and many Members of the other place have visited our forces in the front line and, without exception, have come back with admiration for the morale, good spirits and enthusiasm of the troops they meet. However, in a sense that is one of the great difficulties for those trying to assess correctly the morale of the Armed Forces. A tradition of loyalty to the regiment, loyalty to friends and colleagues, and the discipline of a sergeant-major perhaps listening around a corner to the answers being given to visiting dignitaries of one  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_335"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sort or another makes it hard to get the real picture. There is no question that we now face a very serious situation indeed.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09043029000100"></a>I turn to the issue of resources in the widest context, even before the collapse of the Government&#146;s financial situation in terms of the public finances. This was clearly described by no less an authority than the late Sir Michael Quinlan, who knew about these issues as much as anyone, as the most difficult defence budget position he could remember. Given the procurement issues as well, it is an unsustainable position. We are facing serious overstretch. We have far too many &#147;pinch points&#148;, as they are described, particularly in the Army, even among infantrymen. This means that, with the demands we make on them, we cannot abide by the manning balance&#151;having the number of troops required to discharge their undertakings. A year ago it was forecast that the Army would not be back in manning balance before 2011. This is the challenge we face.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09043029000101"></a>Distinguished and gallant noble Lords in this House will say that the Army will always rise to a short-term challenge. It will always meet short-term extra-stress requirements of that kind. If the challenge is continuous and there is no end in sight, however, it becomes a serious problem. In the Continuous Attitude Survey conducted on an annual basis, a poll of 36 per cent of those serving revealed that the majority did not feel valued, were dissatisfied with their equipment and resources and were concerned about the impact on their personal and family life. Their intention to leave had been increased. The family strain is particularly serious not necessarily for the youngest recruits and the newest members of the Armed Forces but for that key core structure of more experienced officers and senior NCOs who are the essential fabric of our Armed Forces and whose family responsibilities are a major challenge. My purpose, against this background, is to discuss what our duty is in this House and to try to impress on the Government what our duty should be to those who serve us so well, both those who serve us now and those whose contribution has already been made.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09043029000102"></a>Those who talk about our Armed Forces as a force for good in different parts of the world have first to ensure that when we ask them to embark on these undertakings they have realistic objectives in a realistic timeframe. We know the challenges we faced in Iraq when we went from being liberators to an occupation force. In Afghanistan the latent hatred that has existed for hundreds of years against the foreign invader can all too easily be roused up against people whose intentions are benevolent.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09043029000103"></a>We need good intelligence. I do not mean immediate intelligence, such as the issue over the dossier, but an understanding of history. Noble Lords may have noticed recently that the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology issued a paper entitled <I>Lessons </I><I>from </I><I>History</I>, which asked why should we use history for policy making. It was talking about science and technology, but why not use history also for our foreign affairs and defence? It is interesting to look at learning the lessons of history. I do not know how many noble Lords heard today the BBC reporter who was on his way to the memorial service at Basra but was actually standing  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_336"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the desert beside the memorial to those who lost their lives in 1921 in another ill-fated Iraq expedition. It was all the more tragic to hear that against the background of the tributes now being paid to those who recently served in Iraq. The BBC report also said that after six years of our activities the canals are full of sewage, there is no regular supply of electricity and no clean water is available in Basra. That is a tragedy.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09043029000104"></a>In the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement on Afghanistan and Pakistan yesterday he sought to adjust current policies to the realities of the situation. I wonder whether among his voracious reading he has ever read Winston Churchill&#146;s first book, <I>The Malakand Field Force</I>. I do not know whether noble Lords are familiar with it. I direct them to chapter 6, which is an account of the challenges faced when there is an uprising against the Government, led by tribesmen who have taken up arms under religious fanatic leaders who seek to establish an Islamic caliphate. For those not familiar with where Malakand is, it is just next door to Swat, which at this very moment has been handed over by the Pakistan Army to the kind auspices of the Taliban. The lessons from history are all before us.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09043029000105"></a>One of the difficulties we have got into is that we did not drawn on the resources of history, most of all in this country, enormously well contained in the Foreign Office. We have a reservoir of experience in our former and current ambassadors. One of the tragedies for the United States and our country is that the State Department, with all its experience, was sidelined and the Pentagon took over. In our country, insufficient attention was paid to the experience and knowledge of those who could have given guidance, not least in the Foreign Office. In any activity of this kind, for us to be a force for good, diplomacy is infinitely preferable to armed force. We need to use the resources of history, which are important in determining the likely attitude of our allies. One of the biggest disappointments at present is our failure to get more help and genuine wide support from NATO allies in the challenges we face.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09043029000106"></a>It is our duty to ensure that our troops are properly equipped and supported. The financial pressures that we face are inevitable. That will mean a major reassessment, whether or not it becomes a major review. There must be some shift in the resources to meet the needs of the challenges of current insurgencies, and at this stage that may be in preference to the resources for conventional warfare that might arise in the future.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09043029000107"></a>There is also the duty of aftercare. We pay tribute to the dead, but I have already said that we should recognise the importance of casualties, whatever form they might take. I notice that Dr Liam Fox, the shadow defence spokesman in another place, talked about the mental health time bomb. Certainly, there are some worrying statistics. I know that the Government have recognised some aspects of this but there must be a much more proactive follow-up, not just letting people come forward in the end if they think they are suffering, but careful aftercare for all those who have served in these difficult circumstances.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09043029000108"></a>I declare a slight family interest in this. I had the opportunity to speak to the Veterans Minister two days ago. One of the tragedies for the Armed Forces is  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_337"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that a number of our ex-service people who have come back from serving in Afghanistan and Iraq are now homeless, unemployed and facing serious personal circumstances. One imaginative approach to this, which I hope the Government will pick up in a significant and substantial way, is the pioneering work of the Community Self Build Agency. People without jobs and housing, under certain arrangements, can be encouraged to build their own homes, rehousing themselves and, in the process, rebuilding their lives. That therapy is very effective.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09043029000109"></a>I am delighted at how many noble Lords wish to speak in this debate. The background is that our Armed Forces have performed outstandingly for us, but in many significant ways we have let them down. We are not giving them the support, the resources or the clear, realisable objectives that they should have been entitled to expect in return for the courage that they have shown. We have been warned that there is a real risk that our Armed Forces&#151;the Prime Minister referred to them yesterday as the finest in the world&#151;could be relegated to the second division in terms of all-round capability and the quality and scale of the resources and the training that are available to them. If that did happen it would have a serious impact on our standing in the world and our ability to be an influence for good in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09043029000110"></a>The previous Prime Minister, in a speech that he made in Plymouth towards the end of his premiership, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09043029000452"></a>&#147;The nation must decide what we want our country to do and then fund it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000435"></a>That was a valedictory message that was not carried forward. If there is continuing severe overstretch, restrictions on adequate training and shortage of appropriate equipment there is genuinely a risk that we will be relegated. We must not let that happen. It would be the greatest betrayal of our Armed Forces who have served us so well. Governments are the trustees for the nation of our Armed Forces during their period in office. Obviously there is the prospect&#151;it might be said the reality&#151;that there may be new trustees in place shortly. There is no doubt that the challenges that they face will be as great as any incoming Government have faced in terms of our defence capability. I beg to move.</p>

I commend and thank the noble Lord, Lord King, for giving us this opportunity to talk about these serious issues. He and I have both had responsibility for the great office of state in charge of the Ministry of Defence and we know how complicated and difficult it can be.

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09043050000002"></a>Of course, we will all pay tribute to our troops today, which is right and proper. I will certainly do so. The noble Lord, Lord King, has pointed out their sacrifices and some of the continuing problems, and I subscribe to everything that he said. We need to go beyond words. Fine debates here and in the other place do not necessarily make a lot of difference. We pay tribute to the fine professionals out there, most of whom are very young, who serve this country and the international cause. We are reminded by the death of a Welsh Guardsman this week of the price paid by them in the defence of liberty of this country and the wider world community.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09043050000003"></a>I pay tribute to the civilians who also help our forces in theatre, because they share some of the dangers as part of the reconstruction element and they deserve commendation for their support of our troops. I associate my sentiments with the noble Lord, Lord King, in praising the families of our service personnel. Without their support and stoic undertakings, our troops would not be able to do the job. I remember in my period during the Kosovo campaign talking to spouses and family members. The strain is enormous and permanent. It is not easy to resolve, so they deserve commendation from us as well.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09043050000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord King, mentioned mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder, which is an increasing problem given the nature of modern war. I have a vivid memory of going to Omagh as Defence Secretary after the bomb and talking to the troops there. Hardened infantry soldiers, trained in the art of defence and used to using their arms were absolutely affected by the carnage they saw in the streets there. They may have been used to battlefield casualties, but they could not cope with babies blown apart, small children destroyed in the streets of that small village in Northern Ireland. I remember sharing the trauma with them and advising them that mental injury is as great a problem as physical injury and that they must take steps to make sure that they retain their strength and their sanity.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09043050000005"></a>There are so many issues that could be dealt with here; the noble Lord has dealt with many of them and I associate myself with him. Let me make comments about three areas. One is about NATO. Our troops serve under a NATO flag in Afghanistan today, but NATO is not some amorphous organisation; it is not the European Commission, it is not the United Nations, it is simply the product of 26&#151;about to be 28&#151;individual nation states and it is as good or as bad as those nation states make it. To characterise NATO as some great amorphous force is to completely misunderstand the nature of the organisation. I know that Ministers are looking at NATO at the moment with the idea of reform. A new Secretary-General is about to take office, the former Prime Minister of Denmark, and we all wish him well. He has impeccable credentials. Reform must be

Getting NATO to operate as an integrated command, as it was originally designed, where the risks, the burdens and the credit get shared, must be high on the agenda.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09043050000006"></a>I would like to say how pleased I am that France has now fully rejoined the integrated military command. The terms on which it has rejoined are a huge bonus. It appears that a French general will take over in Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia. This is a post that was created under my stewardship, replacing the old Allied Command Atlantic. Transformation command was designed to make sure that the United States and its allies would always be able to work together. A French general, committed to strong European forces as part and parcel of the alliance, is a great bonus that we can look forward to.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09043050000007"></a>On British domestic defence, I conducted a Strategic Defence Review in 1997 and 1998 and I am glad that I got a lot of support and input from previous Defence Secretaries and Defence Ministers at that time. It still remains the template for what we do in the world today, but 10 years is too long. It has had additional chapters and has been refined in certain ways, but it is time now for a fundamental Strategic Defence Review, because the circumstances of 2009 are not the circumstances of 1998. This Government should start it and, whatever happens after the election, it should be continued. It should be done in the way we did it in 1997 and 1998&#151;openly, transparently, inclusively and fundamentally, looking at every capability that we have and whether it is necessary or needs to be augmented. It has to be based on the national security interests and foreign policy of this country. Only in that way will we be able to properly deliver defence forces for the future and to justify the faith that troops have on the ground as well.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09043050000008"></a>Afghanistan is a place where our troops are caught up just now. I have not got time to go into it in detail, but I simply say this&#151;there is a disconnect between the bravery and professionalism of the people who fight out there and the people in this country who do not understand sufficiently that their safety is connected to that bravery and that commitment. We, the political leadership in this country, have an obligation and a fundamental responsibility to make sure that people understand why they are out there, why they are making that sacrifice and why it is connected to our safety and security in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09043029000121"></a>It was a problem that I could find very little to disagree with in what the noble Lord, Lord King, said; virtually nothing until his last couple of sentences. The fact is that we are in an ongoing war, for which we were not prepared and for which our Armed Forces were not really designed. We have prepared on the hoof our level of equipment, design and tactics to try  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_340"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to meet the targets. As the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, suggested, our Armed Forces are involved in a major structural alliance that was designed for another era. The fact that NATO now includes Poland suggests that something that was designed to combat the Warsaw Pact is totally out of date. All our structures and our thinking need to be attacked from that point of view, and it is from there that we need to go on.</p>

<a name="90430-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09043029000122"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord King, said, the fact that we are fighting an ongoing conflict means that we should fundamentally deal with that conflict, because it will be a long slog. People have suggested that there might be elements of engagement there for decades, so we must make sure that our troops on the ground have the appropriate equipment and the appropriate structure to deal with this. This argument is not that new. The minute that the Cold War was seen to be over and other disputes broke out&#151;the Balkans being the classic one&#151;the idea of smaller, peacekeeping units trying to get between not very sophisticated armies, using cheap, mass-produced weapons with which the world is still awash, was seen to be the format in which we should be specialising. How far have we engaged in making sure that this is the case? Is our investment in the right type of technology? Main battle tanks might have been quite useful when we rolled into Iraq, but we discovered that we did not need them. Our light armour was quite sufficient for the job, because our enemy simply cannot match us. Are we liable to meet someone there? Are we going to invest in new forms and structures of defence?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09043029000123"></a>Can NATO be developed into something that will enhance that role? Having read some of the NATO articles, I have come to the conclusion that it thinks that to still be relevant it must take on much more this role of peacekeeping, monitoring and helping. This role will also probably seem more attractive to its newer members. We must make sure that we do not give nationalistic politicians in Russia an excuse for going clinging back to nurse, saying &#147;We are still being persecuted&#148;. We should try to move away from what is left of the confrontational structure.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09043029000124"></a>I shall move on to talk about the support and care of our service men and women. Both noble Lords have spoken about combat stress, and I endorse what they have said. Let us not fool ourselves. Combat stress is only a part of the problem. We are discovering that those who leave the Armed Forces, particularly in the junior ranks, seem to be particularly badly prepared for civilian life. These people often join the Army young and then do not have to deal with the mundane difficulties of life, such as organising how to pay bills, where you go and what you do, and how to find accommodation. They might have low literacy skills and so on; I have discovered that the Army is one of the better employers of dyslexics. The Army gives them structure and help but they are then, after X number of years, effectively dumped on the street.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09043029000125"></a>They are then told, as the noble Lord has said, that they can get help if they ask for it: &#147;If you fill in form XBY, turn up on time, in the right place and say the right thing, you will get help&#148;. That is a recipe for only those who least need it getting the best help; only those with parents who are capable of assisting them,  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_341"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for instance. Let us face it: these people will not be that young when they leave. The Ministry of Defence should have a good look at the experience of, say, the department for education in getting support and help for people. The Armed Forces should take on board the idea that only the middle class, who can probably subsidise these things, get the help because it is difficult to access through bureaucracy. They should make their help available to those who need it.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09043029000126"></a>I hope that the Minister can respond to that. How well does he think that the Armed Forces are doing in ensuring that their support for ex-servicemen gets to those who need it most?</p>

It is now generally recognised that, among other things, we should not have charged into Helmand province of all places, in the south of Afghanistan. We had, at first, token forces and totally inadequate weapons, vehicles and munitions. We were still committed significantly in Iraq and in pursuit of an unrealistic aim and strategy. If anything, that made the terror situation worse, not better, and a price had to be paid in significant battle casualties.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09043029000128"></a>Now, poised as we are on the brink of a new strategy in Afghanistan and with an all-embracing funding problem, this may well be an opportune moment to remind the Government to face up to realities and their responsibilities. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgewater, on this debate and on introducing it with his customary penetrating clarity bred from considerable experience, all of which I warmly endorse.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09043029000129"></a>Noble and noble and gallant Lords have also made some, I hope, helpful suggestions in these debates. It is to the Government&#146;s credit that, over the past two years or so, the Ministry of Defence has made strenuous efforts to get our Helmand force in better balance and provide the proper equipment and supplies to support, sustain and protect our land and air forces in that area, where they still have such a difficult job to do. However, it is equally clear that, as a result of the urgency of all this, and because of continuous cheeseparing over the past 10 years or so, they now have a fundamental funding problem on their hands, accentuated by the recent Budget, of which more in a moment.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09043029000130"></a>However, we are now committed to Afghanistan and, for many compelling reasons, there can be no going back in the foreseeable future. Indeed, our best hope is wholly to support the United States, to the limit of our resources, in its new, more enlightened strategy, with a strong&#151;albeit temporary, I hope&#151;surge of forces to give people in that vulnerable area proper rather than fleeting protection, with less talk of democracy and more of stability. There must be meaningful negotiations and financial inducements which could help separate the moderates from the fanatics,  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_342"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who must then be isolated and dealt with. We must have better directed and more quickly implemented financial aid.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09043029000131"></a>We must also work as closely as possible with Pakistan. It was good to hear the Pakistani president welcome the initiative of President Obama, giving us hope that we can, despite all of Pakistan&#146;s very real internal problems, work together in some common cause, to our mutual benefit and for the benefit of the peace of the world. In conjunction with our well motivated, highly professional American and Canadian friends, and with others from a still somewhat lukewarm NATO, all of that will require our best shots. At the moment, we have no alternative but to provide and sustain them, fortified by the wonderful sense of duty and esprit de corps of our Armed Forces that the noble Lord, Lord King, brought out so well.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09043029000132"></a>Finally, while the Secretary of State has a significant war to oversee and manage, he has another major problem: a virtual black hole between established requirements and the resources that the Treasury is likely to make available. If the Treasury is to get its pound of flesh, as it usually does, that will require some very hard decisions, particularly if our best-shot operations in Afghanistan are to be fully supported and sustained, and those personnel matters such as medical, housing and welfare&#151;the ones that fall off the bottom when you try to squeeze a quart into a pint pot&#151;are not to suffer in a way that would rupture the military covenant, now so generally recognised as essential for the well-being of our Armed Forces. That means that the higher-spending items of equipment will have to be looked at rigorously.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09043029000133"></a>What we really need is a proper defence review, but that will clearly not happen before the next general election. Meanwhile, a similar intellectual rigour will have to be turned on the more expensive items in the current three to five-year spending cycle. Of course, what is kept in or left out is a matter for the chiefs of staff to recommend as they, chaired by the Chief of Defence Staff, try to find that difficult balance between the most urgent operational needs and what the longer term may require if our forces are to be capable of taking part in any wider and more sophisticated conflict. That capability cannot be produced from a standing start.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09043029000134"></a>We must look again in more detail at how we spend our money in the context of, perhaps, a more flexible approach to our independent nuclear deterrent and what exactly follows Trident, and when, and, certainly, with the general recognition that, since the Cold War, the world scene and the scale of urgency of future threats have changed considerably. We cannot automatically feel bound by old Cold War cries and clich&#233;s such as, &#147;You must have four and not three nuclear submarines, because there must always be one on station&#148;. Indeed, I was surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, repeat that in an otherwise wide-ranging and flexible summing-up of a foreign affairs debate.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09043029000135"></a>The same intellectual rigour needs to be applied to the carrier argument. The Royal Navy has tasks that fall upon it regularly in peace and war&#151;some on every day of the week&#151;while we should take into account  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_343"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the new dimension of piracy. In order for it to do those tasks, we should look at whether the Navy would prefer two less than fully equipped carriers with greatly reduced and, I would suggest, insufficient small surface ships and killer submarines or, perhaps, one fully equipped carrier with everything required to fly off it and to protect it and, perhaps, rather more ships for their everyday tasks.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09043029000136"></a>There is no doubt, then, that the Secretary of State has some real problems on his hands. I hope that the Minister will give us some idea how the Government are facing up to those problems and how they are likely to be resolved in the near future, while ensuring a proper defence of the United Kingdom against a variety of eventualities, and proper support for our foreign policy and interests abroad&#151;whether that involves peacekeeping, enforcement or something even more decisive and intense altogether.</p>

In this brief intervention I shall argue that, honoured and respected though the British Armed Forces might be, as the noble Lord, Lord King, indicated in his speech, they are presently so stretched in both personnel and resources that their effectiveness is close to being dangerously at risk.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09043029000138"></a>Obviously, in the shadow of the financial crunch it is not easy to find ever more money for the Armed Forces but, following the speech of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, I suggest that substantial sums could be released if Her Majesty&#146;s Government were to decide not to proceed with upgrading the Trident nuclear weapon system. Nor is that simply a financial matter; I, like many of your Lordships, am of the generation that grew up under the shadow of the Cold War, and it is at least arguable that in those dark days the world was, through the nuclear deterrent, spared a horrific global war which would have been catastrophic even using conventional weapons.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09043029000139"></a>As your Lordships are aware, toward the end of those deeply worrying times, in 1968, the United Nations sponsored the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The signatories agreed a three-pronged deal. The nations without nuclear weapons would not seek to develop them, provided that those with nuclear weapons agreed to progressively disarm, while knowledge for the peaceful use of nuclear energy would be shared. It was also agreed that the signatories would meet at the UN every five years to review progress; I understand that such a meeting is planned for next year. Her Majesty&#146;s Government argue that they have honoured the treaty by reducing the total number of nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, but that argument lacks conviction if upgrading the Trident system results in the possession of fewer but more powerful and sophisticated nuclear weapons. The moral, and perhaps legal, case against countries such as Iran, North Korea, Pakistan and India developing their own nuclear weapons is subsequently weakened.</p>

I believe, rather, that Britain is more likely to be respected if it is prepared to play its part in peacemaking and peacekeeping by supplying Armed Forces who are professional, disciplined, and well resourced with the personnel and equipment needed to respond quickly and flexibly whenever and wherever they are needed. Would the estimated &#163;20 billion needed to upgrade Trident not be better spent in that way?</p>

At the moment some 17,000 recipients are eligible, of which today many thousands have Motability cars. I want to share an experience that I had last year, at Motability&#146;s 30th anniversary celebrations at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Her Majesty the Queen was handing over keys to newly disabled servicemen. The Queen then spoke to a young 20 year-old Royal Marine; he was accompanied by his carer and was recovering at that marvellous hospital, Headley Court. Both his legs had been blown off above the thigh. A fine athlete at school, he had passed out only seven months earlier in front of his proud family. For me it was a most poignant moment. What of his future? He could have been my grandson. This, I suppose, is the cost of war, or perhaps a more correct way of looking at it is that this is the cost of peace. I could not support more strongly the views expressed by my noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater with regard to casualties in the armed services and their families. There has been some improvement but it is still shaming for all of us that there has been such reluctance to get the proper support for these brave young men and women who serve their country with a total sense of duty and pride, putting their lives on the line at our behest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09043029000143"></a>In recent times our armed services have been actively engaged in conflict for some 25 years, and for its size we probably have the most battle-hardened, experienced and professional defence force in the world. Apart from our deep involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Royal Navy is leading the European Union naval force, whose operating headquarters is at Northwood, where it also runs the Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa). At this very moment oil tankers and LNG carriers are traversing the Gulf of Aden en route to our shores. Energy security is critical and a natural role for our Navy. Protecting our trade routes has always been, and will continue to be, crucial to this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09043029000144"></a>Our Chiefs of Staff and senior officers of our defence services are highly talented and experienced, and the present Secretary of State for Defence is deeply committed to their strategic needs and is strongly supportive of their endeavours. Nevertheless, as has been said, they can do only so much with limited resources. Defence reviews have pretty well become shorthand for cuts. The most recent will have the effect of our not being able to fulfil our present undertakings and certainly will not meet the needs of the procurement programme already agreed.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09043029000145"></a>Should we be Treasury-driven or policy-driven? We have reached a critical crossroads at this time and there is no way we could seriously engage in another area of conflict without reducing forces in other areas. Of course, I am more than aware of our present financial challenges, but the world moves on and in my view these cuts are hugely short-sighted and we are putting our heads in the sand. Not to play with words, I say that it is no less than appeasement. There are still many in this House who not only remember the dangers of appeasement but risked their lives in active duty because of it, of which the noble and gallant Lord, Field Marshall Lord Bramall, knows better than most. My own company, P&amp;O, suffered huge losses in both world wars. Before it is too late, this great country of ours must have a major strategic debate on the role of our defence forces for the future&#151;a key part of our national security. It must be a debate which I sincerely hope will come to a rapid and positive conclusion.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09043029000146"></a>I believe that we have a moral duty, if that is not an outdated expression in this day and age, to have a response force of a size and flexibility that in time of need is both a deterrent and has the capability to help, for example, members of the Commonwealth. It is too easily forgotten how they flocked to help us in the past two world wars and other conflicts. Many small countries throughout the world still look to us for leadership, help and protection in these uncertain times. Sadly, the world is not only unlikely to change in the near future, indeed it is likely to become even more dangerous. If such a debate concluded that this was the right way forward but that it would take, say, 3 to 3.5 per cent of our GDP, I for one would say so be it. It is our duty. As the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, said, it is vital that everybody in this country fully understands the reasons for such a decision and is strongly supportive of it.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09043029000147"></a>The defence of the realm and our future role in the international world is the first duty of Government, and therefore their key priority. I hope noble Lords will agree that it is very much the responsibility of this House, and indeed of Parliament itself, to ensure that the right decisions are made. Time is not on our side.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09043029000149"></a>This is a busy week for the Armed Forces. Many of us will have seen on television this morning the moving ceremony that took place in Basra, which was a timely reminder of the price that our service men and women pay day in and day out for carrying out our foreign policy. Yesterday, a decision was made in relation to the Gurkhas. I have no doubt that that will come up in the debate. I think that the right decision was reached in the end. I look forward to my noble friend Lord Brett repeating the Statement made in another place. I hope the Government do not become too defensive and that the Opposition do not crow too much, as I recall that when I was chairman of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body the Gurkhas were treated appallingly as a result of government policy. It was good to see the new Labour Government improve the Gurkhas&#146; pensions and the conditions for them and their families. Earlier, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, mentioned Hong Kong. I was in Hong Kong just before the handover. The Gurkhas were extremely worried then about their and their families&#146; future. It is not surprising that many of them did not come here, because the conditions imposed were such that they were not encouraged to do so. I am delighted at the decision reached yesterday.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09043029000150"></a>During this busy week the Prime Minister made a very welcome visit to our Armed Forces in Afghanistan. He then travelled to Pakistan. Certainly, Pakistan has to be at the centre of our attention regarding what we do in the future. I am not someone who believes everything I read in the press, rather the opposite, but I was somewhat concerned to read a little paragraph this morning which said that the Prime Minister had rejected the advice of the Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of State for Defence to send 2,000 more service personnel to Afghanistan. Instead, 700 will be sent on a temporary basis. It would be helpful if the Minister could comment on that.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09043029000151"></a>I wish to concentrate on the enormous contribution that our Armed Forces have made to the interface with civilians not just in a peacekeeping role but in operational theatres. I have seen this for myself and have never failed to be amazed at the work that they do. Unlike people from other international organisations and, indeed, services who stay safely in their vehicles, clearly marked with a big cross, or whatever, British troops are out on the street with civilians, talking to them and getting to know them. I was particularly struck by our troops&#146; attitude to women. When I went to the Balkans I coincidentally met some local women. I saw 18 year-old servicemen confidently talking to young women who were ignored by the men in their own community because they had been raped. It was an enormous privilege to observe those young soldiers comforting those women and their children.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09043029000152"></a>In Afghanistan, General McColl and his soldiers protected women attending the Parliament. Now 25 per cent of its members are women. That is a substantial contribution to peacekeeping for which the British Armed Forces deserve credit. Anyone who meets them cannot fail to be impressed by them. However, words do not mean very much unless we do something. Following a service that was held in the abbey and a reception in the Palace of Westminster, I was surprised  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by how many Members of this House said, as if they were astonished, &#147;Aren&#146;t they wonderful?&#148;. It was as if noble Lords were not fully aware of what our Armed Forces do. That leads me to the point made by my noble friend Lord Robertson about the disconnect. We have to do something about the disconnect between what we are trying to do in Afghanistan and, I hope, Pakistan, and how we get that across to the British population because they are not swinging around in support of it. That is understandable, but we have a responsibility in that area.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09043029000153"></a>Much needs to be done and more resources are needed, but let us be objective in our debates, as this House is. Headley Court was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Sterling. How right he is. I was privileged to take members of the House of Lords Defence Group to visit Headley Court about 18 months ago. Headley Court&#146;s limb provision had come from being appalling, relying on the National Health Service, to being the national winner of limb provision for service men and women who had lost arms or legs in the defence of this country. At the end of that enormously uplifting visit the Defence Group said as a whole that we were quite happy to support Headley Court, and we asked what it would like us to go back and lobby for or raise. The answer was that it did not want us to ask for anything because the money that it had asked to be spent on Headley Court had been spent, as we could see. That is an area of progress.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09043029000154"></a>I certainly welcome the additional resources for Armed Forces housing in the Budget, and the improvements in pensions and medical services, although I exclude entirely the support for Armed Forces personnel with mental health problems. We really have to get to grips with that issue. Perhaps we need to discuss it more than we do.</p>

<a name="90430-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09043029000155"></a>I believe that our services are overstretched. The last Strategic Defence Review was absolutely first-class. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, is in his place. I remember well not so much the debates but the consultation about it. It is easy to say that we need more resources. They may well come through a new Strategic Defence Review, which is direly needed now. If we had another, it could raise the issues and the challenge that we need more resources for our Armed Forces and the defence budget. I would support that. Where would the money come from? It would mean less for other areas. We need that debate, which will be helped by the more overt presence of our Armed Forces in our community, such as the marches when they come back. We can see how the general population respond to them. I very much welcome this debate and support entirely the call for a Strategic Defence Review. That will help us to take the necessary steps for our service men and women and their families, who deserve our support and without whom we could not do what we are trying to do.</p>

I do so not only out of a profound admiration of and gratitude for the Gurkhas&#146; loyal and courageous service but also because it is in our national interest to encourage settlement of Gurkhas in this country and to use their skills, not least in the area of civil defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09043029000159"></a>Without 3,000 Gurkhas, we should have been in grave difficulty in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I wonder just how carefully the Government have considered the advantage to our defence capacity that would accrue from a Gurkha presence in this country. There are the obvious ones, such as their power to play a pivotal role in response to such emergencies as flooding, the foot and mouth crisis and in helping to sustain essential public services. They are disciplined, practical and could surely form the basis of a paramilitary territorial force to deal with major civil crises, including the protection of our trade on the high seas perhaps, leaving the regular military forces free to operate abroad. We are looking at a body of men who could join the police or work for the security contractors who work for the UK Border Agency. The recent Cabinet Office report, <I>Security in a Global Hub</I>, makes clear what an important area this is.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09043029000160"></a>We must expect, very probably, a rather disturbed society for a time, thanks to the economic crisis. That may lead to civil unrest and encourage disruptive or violent elements, including disturbed, volatile and angry young men. We already have a relentless tide of immigrants without the skills that the Gurkhas have. Many of them will take time to assimilate to our society and way of life, if they ever do. They are likely to need more from the state than they contribute. The Gurkhas, Buddhists, will form an element of peaceful integration, rather than an alien culture wishing to impose its own laws. The <I>Rights and Responsibilities </I>paper from the Secretary of State for Justice recognises the possibility of that more volatile society. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09043029000453"></a>&#147;Our country is changing and faces new and profound challenges. At such times, people need reassurance that the structures which support them in their daily lives are robust. They need to know that their liberty and freedoms are secure&#148;.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09043029000161"></a>The Gurkha community would make a positive contribution. They are disciplined, practical human beings, who will adjust to our society and form a stable element. They will be very employable. This country will be the loser if the Gurkhas are virtually excluded. We need them. I urge the Government to think again in the national interest. Why, indeed, are HMG ignoring the words in Command Paper 724, which expressly includes the Gurkhas under foreign and Commonwealth service personnel, recognises their unique circumstances and pledges action by the UK

It is a delight to welcome back to our debates my noble friend, who has just pleased us with her speech about the Gurkhas, which I hope will receive great consideration. Having sat next to my noble friend for the last 10 or 11 years, I never doubted her resolution to come back after her long and regrettable absence through disability. We welcome her very warmly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09043029000164"></a>There could hardly be a more timely moment for my noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater to have given us the opportunity for this debate. We are on the verge of completing our military withdrawal from Iraq, save for a few detachments. Our troops are coming back at the conclusion of a dangerous and difficult job, most professionally carried out, as has been so warmly acknowledged. I share that acknowledgement and gratitude.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09043029000165"></a>For all our Armed Forces&#146; high reputation, I would, if I were the Defence Secretary, be a deeply troubled man, even if I had the experience and very great qualities of the present incumbent, who I happen to think is the best that this Government have produced. The Defence Secretary must often wish that he had half the number of infantry battalions as the battalions in which his sorrows come. A major concern of his surely will be for the well-being, safety and fair treatment of the young men and women who are committed to his charge in the Armed Forces. Across all three services&#151;mainly, of course, in the Army&#151;these young men and women are called on to place themselves potentially in the way of mortal danger, often in tours of duty that recur far too frequently, yet they have never let us down and their contribution has been immense.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09043029000166"></a>I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, mentioned the Army in Northern Ireland. He spoke movingly of what it had to experience in Omagh. I was deeply grateful during my tenure there for the way in which the Army carried out its difficult and sophisticated tasks. In comparison with today&#146;s challenges for the Armed Forces, it is worth noting that in Northern Ireland we never had to face a suicide bomber. The terrorists there were pretty keen to preserve their own skins. Alas, that is not true in the Middle East or in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09043029000167"></a>If the Defence Secretary is to do his duty by the Armed Forces, he must protect them from further deployments that involve overstretch and insufficient operational support. He must protect them from what I euphemistically call today the &#147;pinch points in manning&#148;,  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_350"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or the absence of proper numbers, which is what that really means in English, of skilled service people to fill important posts. That is experienced in all three services. He must also protect them from insufficient research into technology and into other areas on which future operational capabilities will depend. At the moment, all those things are brought about by a lack of resources. Stories of failure in those quarters are, unfortunately, legion and their effect on recruitment and retention are well known. They all derive from the old sin, committed by all Governments, of failing to match commitments to the resources that they are prepared to devote.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09043029000168"></a>The Secretary of State also has to see that our forces are provided with what may be called a war aim that is defined clearly and convincingly and seen to be both worthy and winnable. Public support for what the forces are called on to do will always demand that, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, has frequently said. In the first Gulf War, the question that he was most frequently asked by soldiers was, &#147;Is the country behind us?&#148;. On that occasion they could be reassured about that, but these days, in my experience, there is far less assurance of it. The Government have much more to do before there is the same measure of support for our operations in Afghanistan. To put it bluntly, there is a feeling in the country that the war there against the Taliban is unwinnable and I would be surprised if that does not also find a place among some of our service people who so loyally conduct it.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09043029000169"></a>Would it not have been far more realistic first to have secured Kabul as a firm base and then to have widened the hunt and sought to enlarge the footprint of the rule of law in Afghanistan? People have always been sceptical that sound, fully fledged democratic government can somehow gratefully spring forth, but that is what we seem to have hoped for. The Prime Minister&#146;s Statement yesterday indicates that the Government know better now, which is welcome. I think that the Government are right in what they are seeking to achieve now, but it will take time to overturn the damage done to confidence, which is not good for the forces. The Government are right to perceive that the Taliban either will have to be defeated in the area of the country bordering Pakistan or will have to be defeated on the streets of Britain and so forth. Public scepticism has to be overturned.</p>

In the light of the appalling state of public finances, he will have to fight some lonely battles in Cabinet for what he knows the forces need. That has been foreseen by other speakers today. Unless it is the Prime Minister himself, no colleague will stand up for him; they will all recite the mantra that, if they are to make sacrifices, the Defence Secretary must make them on an equal basis. That is not so. No other department&#146;s sacrifices will foreseeably result in young men and women needlessly losing their lives while striving to make our country safe. He will have to stand and fight. If he goes down, he will know that he has done his duty; if he succeeds, the credit will extend not only

I also echo the pleasure that has been expressed at seeing the noble Baroness, Lady Park, in her place.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09043029000172"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord King, should have talked about the contribution made by the Armed Forces to the defence of the United Kingdom and peacekeeping. I want to focus on the ability of the Armed Forces to make that contribution in the future. There is always a danger in looking back but my plea, which I shall end with, is based on three experiences on which I shall draw. I remind the House that we are debating this matter in a week in which we have had two important Statements, one on the reserves and one on Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09043029000173"></a>My first experience may well be remembered by the noble Lord, Lord King. When the aircraft crashed at Lockerbie, the first people on the scene were the crew of a Territorial Army field ambulance. They were sent away by the police because no one knew what to do with them. One of my concerns about the reserves, which I hope will be put right as a result of the review, is that at last people will think through what the reserves represent in terms of skill and application, not just in the defence of the United Kingdom and in Iraq and Iran but also in the whole spectrum of peacekeeping, to which I want to move on.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09043029000174"></a>My second experience was just before leaving the Army when I was sent out to look at the United Kingdom contingent with the peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. I was disturbed to find that the commander of that contingent had been issued with a Barclaycard and told to buy what the contingent needed in the markets of Phnom Penh. That seemed to me to demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of what peacekeeping operations mean, particularly in a multinational organisation such as the United Nations. On complaining, I got my comeuppance, as the Secretary of State asked me to write a paper on the management of the United Kingdom contribution to UN operations, which led to my being asked to join a group under the command of the director-general of peacekeeping in the United Nations to consider the same in the whole context.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09043029000175"></a>It was quite clear that the word &#147;peacekeeping&#148; covered a spectrum of activities, including conflict prevention, peacekeeping under Chapter 6 of the charter, peacemaking or peace enforcement under Chapter 7 and post-conflict reconstruction. All four matters were interlinked. What was peacekeeping in one place could actually be conflict prevention in another, as could post-conflict reconstruction. If all those were to be exercised, it was essential that there should be shown to be no disconnect, to use the word used by the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, between the activities of the great offices of state in this country in deciding what the national contribution should be. That means the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and what was then the ODA and is now DfID.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09043029000176"></a>Therefore, I was extremely concerned when I went to Afghanistan last year to find that there was a disconnect. The Foreign Office in Afghanistan appeared to have no link to the department run by DfID, which was sitting in a completely different building from the brigade commander. When I looked into the money available, I found that each American company commander sent to Afghanistan had not just $200,000 to spend on post-conflict reconstruction but the backing of the American Corps of Engineers. An Italian major had $2 million plus the help of the Italian Government and our brigade commander had $200,000 for the whole of Helmand, all controlled by DfID. I do not think that satisfactory peacekeeping is made unless there is a connect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09043029000177"></a>The third experience was a conversation that I had with the divisional commander who commanded the troops going into Iraq in 2003. I asked him after the event, &#147;What was your battle-winning factor as far as equipment was concerned?&#148;. He replied, &#147;The American Marine Aircraft Wing, which was put under my command, because it had absolutely everything we needed for operations of this kind, virtually none of which was available from the Royal Air Force or the Army Air Corps&#148;. That is a telling comment and it deserves deep examination. I entirely concur with the words of my noble and gallant friend Lord Bramall questioning the cost in the current defence budget of Trident, aircraft carriers, Astute submarines and eventually the Eurofighter, all of which are hideously expensive; they have a read-back to the Cold War and distort a budget based on operations that we are required to do today and tomorrow.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09043029000178"></a>In this context and based on reflections on those three experiences, I echo the calls in this House today and previously for a serious defence review to examine the capability of our Armed Forces to contribute to not just the defence of the United Kingdom but also peacekeeping. The noble Lord, Lord King, quoted the late Prime Minister, saying that we must ask &#147;What do we want to do?&#148; and then fund it. The question &#147;What do we want to do today and tomorrow?&#148; has not been properly examined and the funding will be irrelevant unless it is based on an answer to that question.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09043029000179"></a>Finally, because this is a debate about the Armed Forces&#146; contribution, as so many noble Lords have said, we must not forget that what is included in that funding is the all-important care and aftercare of all those young men and women whom we ask to carry out these operations on behalf of our great nation.</p>

These debates are simply not the same without her. Like everybody else, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater, for having introduced this debate and for the very reasonable, balanced and thoughtful contribution he made in opening it, which has set the tone for all our deliberations today. Of course he was right to emphasise the tribute which all of us should pay to the men and women of our armed services and to their families. I was especially glad that he remembered the wounded and maimed,

I was particularly impressed by his telling references to mental illness, resulting from the experiences service people are expected to endure. It is too easy to sweep that under the carpet.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09043029000181"></a>We owe it to all these people that our armed services are properly resourced, both in the numbers of people available to undertake a task and also the equipment at their disposal. None of us can have been happy with the Nimrod story or the stories about getting right the patrol vehicles our infantry are expected to use. I am glad it has been stressed in the debate that what is most important of all is that is absolutely clear to servicemen and women and their families what the objective of the engagement and the undertaking is. It must clearly be legally and morally justified. It is quite wrong to expect servicemen to undertake a task on our behalf unless we are certain that it is justified in international law and that it has the cause of morality fully behind it.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09043029000182"></a>It is also important&#151;again, we owe this to those involved&#151;that we have thought through the implications and consequences of what we are doing. It is one thing to have the resources to fight the war, but the resources must be available to build the peace. Otherwise, we will have betrayed all those who have served and died in the cause. This brings us to the central issue of facing up to the real threat. It has been put that we must decide what we want to do and then make available what is necessary to do it. Of course I relate to that argument, but I remember thinking many years ago, when I had the privilege of being a service Minister, that it was important all the time to be clear about what the real existing and future threat is, and not be operating on what was appropriate for a threat which may no longer be relevant in the form it took in previous years.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09043029000183"></a>When one is analysing that, one has to recognise that, characteristic of what we face, is the unorthodox nature of warfare now&#151;although it has become so usual that it is probably not right to refer to it as unorthodox because, in a paradoxical sort of way, it has become the orthodox. In this our Special Forces are clearly particularly well designed to meet the needs that confront us. It is good to see that the Government are concentrating on the future of our Special Forces in the way our services are organised. It is also important to recognise, in this context, the contribution made by organisations such as the Royal Air Force Regiment or the distinguished Royal Marines. When I was the Minister responsible for the Navy&#151;a privilege I have always greatly savoured and regarded myself as extremely fortunate to have had&#151;I was never anything but inspired by the commitment and esprit de corps of the Royal Marines, who have been making a very important contribution. Then there are the reserves, and it is again good to see the way the Government are thinking through now how we need to integrate the reserves more completely in the total task in a way that is appropriate to the present situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09043029000184"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, made some observations about the Royal Navy. I am not sure that I am totally with him in his doubts about carriers. It seems to me that, facing the kind of threat I  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_354"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 354</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>described, carriers can be invaluable in enabling us to have flexibility and the ability to deploy our forces across the world. Where I think he is right is in questioning the whole context of the deterrent, a point also raised by the right reverend Prelate. I am not convinced that, with the pressures and demands being made on our fighting forces at present, we can see the renewal of Trident as an inescapable priority. That argument has not yet been proved.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09043029000185"></a>Finally, in the nature of the task with which we are confronted, two things are true: the services are becoming more and more integrated, and increasingly we are required to operate in an international context. I would find it invaluable if, when my noble friend replies, she could tell us about how we are preparing our officers and men and women to serve in an international context and in an integrated context together with the other services. The quintessence of a high-flying officer today should be the ability to serve internationally but also to serve in the centre. I am sometimes a little fearful that we have not yet moved away from the tradition in which the person who has served in the centre comes back to their service as a bit suspect, with a doubt about how far they are really still part of the service, the Army, Navy or Air Force, to which their loyalty should be primary. Loyalty should be seen to the effectiveness of the integrated task.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09043029000186"></a>The challenges are huge. All I can say is that we all owe a debt of gratitude to my noble friend and her colleagues for the tremendous responsibilities that they accept on our behalf.</p>

As our involvement in Iraq draws to a close, that in Afghanistan appears to be expanding. It seems to me that the lesson from Iraq is that although military intervention may be necessary, military occupation should if at all possible be avoided, and certainly be ended as early as possible. It is at last being recognised that Afghanistan is now a part of a far bigger problem: the survival of Pakistan as a democratic and secular state. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a dangerous contradiction between the problem in Pakistan and the NATO military operations in Afghanistan. The NATO operations are clearly inciting the instabilities in Pakistan.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09043029000188"></a>I read and reread the Prime Minister&#146;s UK policy Statement on Afghanistan and Pakistan yesterday. I fear that I found it a rather woolly, disconnected melange of military, political and social suggestions. The repeated emphasis on Britain's aid contribution to both countries made me wonder whether he had his priorities right. As my right honourable friend David Cameron said after the Statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09043029000454"></a>&#147;We are not in the business of trying to create a new Switzerland in the Hindu Kush&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/4/09; col. 873.]</p>

<p><a name="09043029000436"></a>My right honourable friend cited President Obama&#146;s strategy:</p>
<ul><a name="09043029000466"></a>&#147;to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043029000437"></a>What a pity that we did not have such a crisp and clear statement from the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09043029000189"></a>In trying to influence what happens in Pakistan, the West is taking on a task of immense scale. The population is 174 million: double that of Iran and five times that of Iraq. A comparison with the population of Afghanistan is difficult because the Americans and the British disagree on the basic figure. The CIA says that it has 34 million people; the FCO says that it has 29 million&#151;17 per cent difference. Perhaps the Minister will tell us who is right.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09043029000190"></a>The deterioration in Afghanistan is epitomised by the recent agreement of President Karzai to introduce Sharia family law, with all its horrors for the treatment of women. Despite all the outrage from the West at that proposal, the best that the Prime Minister could report yesterday was to welcome Karzai&#146;s &#147;decision to review&#148; that law. What sort of person are our troops being asked to lay down their lives for?</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09043029000191"></a>The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that we are fighting in Afghanistan to defend Britain. He emphasised yesterday:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09043029000455"></a>&#147;Two thirds of the attacks or plots in Britain come from Pakistan&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/4/09; col. 875.]</p>

<p><a name="09043029000438"></a>The problem in Pakistan and Afghanistan is so vast in relation to our UK resources that I believe that we would defend ourselves more effectively if we focused more on the protection of our UK borders. We know that there are a very large number of persons of Pakistan origin living in the UK. Many of them have both British and Pakistan passports. They can therefore use their British passports to depart from and return to the UK and their Pakistan passports for travel outside the UK. The vast majority of these people are wholly loyal and are great contributors to our British community, but the fact is that we know that there are a few who are not, and it is extremely difficult to detect and monitor those few.</p>

<a name="90430-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09043029000192"></a>There is much literature on the internal threat in Britain. One of the best books remains <I>The Islamist</I> by Ed Hussein&#151;I recommend it to any of your Lordships who have not read it. Quillam, the new counter-extremism think tank, is a valuable, although chilling, source of information. The real danger is the spread of Islamist and jihadist teaching through the madrassas, to the extent that they now provide most of the education for Pakistan&#146;s poor. That is not a recent development. Many of those madrassas have been funded by Saudi Arabia. An excellent book, <I>Three Cups of Tea</I>, by two Americans, Greg Morteson and David Relin, sets out the evidence. To cite one excerpt:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09043029000456"></a>&#147;By December 2001 one of four major Wahabit proselytising organisations, the Al Haramain foundation, had built 1,100 mosques, schools and Islamic centres in Pakistan and other Muslim countries&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000439"></a>Surely Saudi Arabia should be a key member of any alliance to combat the jihadist threats from inside Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09043029000193"></a>Much could be done to strengthen our borders. I hope a new Government may consider whether we need a Department of Homeland Security on the American pattern, which might help to focus our efforts&#151;and, indirectly, contribute to the effectiveness with which we can use our very limited military resources. I would really like that to start now; we cannot necessarily wait until we get a new Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09043029000194"></a>I have two main complaints. First, despite new Labour's phrase &#147;joined-up government&#148;, there has been a lamentable lack of integration of our defence, foreign and homeland policies when tackling the threat from Islamism. It is high time that the policies and operations of DfID were far more integrated into the FCO&#151;indeed, I wonder whether the time may not be approaching when DfID should be put back into the FCO. We need more joined-up thinking.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09043029000195"></a>My second complaint is that our defence policy lacks the hard edge that enables our forces to be prepared for the real threats for which they are needed, rather than being allocated tasks on the basis of gesture politics. Nor am I sure that it is sensible to use special contingency reserves as the source of funding for special defence operations. That leads to huge inefficiencies, especially in procurement&#151;referred to proudly by the Prime Minister yesterday when he spoke of the extra &#163;1 billion that had been needed for emergency provision for vehicles in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09043029000196"></a>In conclusion, I fear that I must say that although the present Defence Secretary is one of the most distinguished members of the Government, I do not have confidence in the political direction of our national defence by our present Prime Minister. I believe that he has shown little interest in or understanding of the real needs of our Armed Forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09043029000198"></a>Notwithstanding the criticisms made of the political lack of co-ordination and shortcomings in respect of the Allies&#146; endeavours in Pakistan and Afghanistan, there can be no doubt that our fighting troops have exceeded all our expectations in terms of courage, endurance and success. This is despite the great demands made on service manpower.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09043029000199"></a>The make-up of the Helmand taskforce, which recently concluded its immensely successful deployment in Afghanistan, graphically illustrates the need for more infantrymen and commandos. The taskforce was commanded by, and under, the outstanding leadership of the able and experienced Brigadier Gordon Messenger. It was spearheaded by 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. It is worth listing the taskforce formations: 400 royal naval ratings, the Royal Navy Sea King and Lynx squadron and the Royal Navy Harrier Strike Wing. There were also the following Royal Marine formations, other than 3 Commando Brigade Headquarters, to which I have already referred: 42 Commando, 45 Commando, the Armoured Support Group, the UK Landing Force Command Support Group with the Commando Brigade Reconnaissance Force, 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines, and 18 members of the Royal Marines Band Service. From the Army, there was invaluable support from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, 24 Commando Regiment Royal Engineers, 1 Rifles, 1 and 2 The Prince of Wales&#146;s Royal Regiment, 1 The Queen&#146;s Dragoon Guards and last, but certainly not least, 2 Battalion Royal Gurkhas, as well as other international elements.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09043029000200"></a>This was a truly combined operation. All ranks and formations exceeded, as I have said, our highest expectations in them, with many ranks from all formations having already deployed to Afghanistan on a number of previous occasions. It is worth noting the high proportion of naval service in this deployment. I remind the House&#151;this has been referred to by other noble Lords&#151;that tragically this seven-month deployment resulted in 31 deaths on active service, together with 354 total recorded injuries, including 22 very seriously injured and 14 seriously injured. Were it not for the miracles of modern medicine&#151;I pay tribute to the wonderful work of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force medical teams&#151;there would have been many more deaths.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09043029000201"></a>In the seven-month deployment, the commando brigade and its attached ranks have seen combat of a ferocity that has not been witnessed since World War 2. Our Armed Forces now have greater battle experience that at any time since the war. We owe them, and their families, a debt of honour and gratitude which we can never repay. It is also interesting to note that the Gurkhas are, as always, playing their crucial role in this war, as they have done for centuries, in support of Great Britain. The Minister will note that, of the 31 deaths on active service to which I have referred, two were members of the Royal Gurkhas, and a number of Gurkhas were wounded. The Government must now honour yesterday&#146;s vote in the other place. Their churlish position on this matter is an outrageous insult to our most loyal and brave friends.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09043029000202"></a>Our operations in Afghanistan are crucial. Nevertheless, it is equally important that our Armed Forces retain the basic skills and capability to conduct their operations. We are likely to be in Afghanistan at least until 2015 and probably longer. It is essential that our Armed Forces have the opportunity to exercise the other skills in which they are also held internationally in the highest regard. The next war or humanitarian operation that they will be asked to fight or conduct will no doubt be different from what has happened in the past. We have always to be ready for the unexpected. An outbreak of piracy off the coast of east Africa means that we are in desperate need of frigates.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09043029000203"></a>In order to maximise the political choices available to the Government, it is crucial that our expeditionary capability is not only maintained but practised. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, is quite right; we need the two new aircraft carriers, one at sea and one in refit, as soon as possible. There should be no brakes put on this programme, nor any brakes put on the Joint Strike Fighter, which, in any event, is unlikely to come into service before 2016. I understand that the first steel is being cut in Govan on 7 July 2009. These ships will be needed fast and the Government should endeavour to bring forward the delivery dates for the Joint Strike Fighters.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09043029000204"></a>I am continually told by serving troops that the kit is good. However, they need more helicopters, especially military and heavy lift. This demand has frequently been made from opposition Benches in this House. When she winds up, will the Minister explain to the House the likely delivery dates for more helicopters?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09043029000205"></a>Finally, on the matter of manpower, our Royal Marines and soldiers, with limited numbers, are doing far more tours on active service than should reasonably be asked of them. They joined to fight; morale, I understand, is high. We need more troops. I suspect that the Army needs at least another infantry brigade with supporting arms and the Royal Marines need another commando unit. If the Government wish to expand Special Forces, we need a larger pool. That means more infantrymen and more commandos. Recruiting and retention are reasonably satisfactory. The Government should take the initiative and increase the size of the Army and Royal Marines so that our Armed Forces can more easily match the great demands that we make of them.</p>

I agree with many other noble Lords, as was said already today, that the time has come for another review.

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09043029000209"></a>Training for war needs realistic scenarios and, therefore, natural terrain. At this point, I should declare an interest; I am involved with the Ministry of Defence in the provision of land for training. Pressures have increased on traditional areas such as Salisbury Plain and Wales, particularly with troops returning from Germany. In the United Kingdom, Scotland has now become the largest formation training area, providing an ideal mix of ground and realistic training scenarios. In many places, this is a combination of Forestry Commission land, private land and Ministry of Defence land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09043029000210"></a>It has recently been estimated that approximately 70 per cent of this training is carried out on private land and Forestry Commission land. Until devolution, a licence existed between the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence on a 30-year rotational lease. In the next three to five years, this licence is due to expire, and although the security of tenure will exist in England and Wales, the Forestry Commission in

Can the Minister say whether the Government have contemplated the effects of the Scottish Government withdrawing this licence, particularly on the areas around the Dundrennan and Dalbeattie training centres, which rely so extensively on the Galloway forest? Without private and Forestry Commission land, UK large formation training costs will increase dramatically because such training would be forced overseas. All this takes tight, efficient and careful management.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09043029000211"></a>Currently, the majority of Scotland&#146;s training ground is run by regional forces through the 2nd Division, which is based in Edinburgh. A review is under way whereby this responsibility may be taken over by defence training estates. The 2nd Division controls and liaises on personal contact with the civilian population and helps considerably in conflict resolution. Defence training estates would be likely to regionalise this procedure based on Ministry of Defence centres reporting to a headquarters in Wiltshire. I should like to raise a slight caution here; namely, that this may lead to a loss of community confidence and withdrawal of this asset.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09043029000212"></a>Our forces undertake a remarkable job on our behalf. The Government should not forget that training is as important as fighting and that they should supply full equipment for both&#151;in particular, the now essential helicopters. The Cold War was funded properly. The theatre may now have changed, but the need for funding has not.</p>

At the outset, I state that as a Muslim leader I totally condemn the appalling protests against our servicemen by a small group of misled persons when our troops returned home to Luton last month. A fundamental distinction is to be made between the politicians who commit to war and the Armed Forces whose role it is to execute their will. It is therefore unacceptable to make political points to soldiers. Such points should be directed in a peaceful and non-offensive manner towards politicians.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09043029000214"></a>The UK is fortunate to have an apolitical military, which is not a political force in its own right. We must defend against any politicising of the Armed Forces. I am proud to say that my father and members of my family fought in two world wars. My uncle served in the King&#146;s African Rifles, as did the noble Lord, Lord King, who served as an officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09043029000215"></a>The military exists to execute the defence of this country according to the direction of the Government. Thus there must be a reciprocal relationship between politicians and servicemen. They are not allowed to go on strike or to join a trade union. Therefore, in return, we owe them a duty of care. For the Armed Forces to do their job, they and their families must be properly respected, equipped, resourced and looked after in the field and at home by us as political masters. Yet this pact or military covenant has not been properly honoured in the past decade, as the Ministry of Defence admits. It has said that our servicemen are continuing,</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09043029000216"></a>Afghanistan demonstrates with terrifying clarity how overstretched we are. It is imperative for us to ensure that any involvement or commitment overseas must be matched by an adequate size of our Armed Forces, which need to be suitably equipped and resourced. Will the Government therefore reassure the House that any troop increases in Afghanistan will be matched by a proportionate increase in equipment, especially in suitable armoured vehicles and helicopters? I applaud the &#163;700 million increase in funding for new armoured vehicles for Afghanistan to replace the Snatch vehicles, which have inadequate resistance to roadside bombs. Will the Minister therefore give the House a date when all the new 700 armoured Vixen vehicles should be on the ground? Will she also give an update on the delivery of the new Warthog armoured track vehicle? I have concerns that these government commitments are not reaching the front line fast enough.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09043029000217"></a>The troops on the ground rely on being able to get out to the theatres of conflict easily and quickly. However, only 44 per cent of the TriStar fleet which is responsible for getting the troops from the UK to Afghanistan is considered fit for purpose, which adversely affects troop logistics, transport conditions and leave time. What are the Government doing to ensure that we have adequate transport capacity between the UK and Afghanistan?</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09043029000218"></a>In Afghanistan, there is a need for flexible troop transport planes, yet we are seriously short of Hercules and C-17s. Furthermore, we now hear that the replacement of the A400M transport aircraft will not be with us until 2011, having been subjected to a four-year delay. What options have the Government considered for buying or leasing more troop transport aircraft? Furthermore, what discussions has the MoD had with the contractors and Airbus Military on the viability of the A400M project and on when we can expect a final decision?</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09043029000219"></a>There are also important political issues which we must work through. The Afghanistan mission is being undertaken under the banner of NATO, but the troop contributions mainly come from the US, the UK, Canada and Poland. I welcome the increase in troop and police training additions pledged by Germany, Spain and France, but what further pressure are the Government applying to our NATO allies to ensure further long-term troop deployments? It is vital that everyone carries their weight in the NATO alliance, as the security of Afghanistan is vital for our security. In addition to taking military action it is important that we win the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan, and build their institutions and infrastructure to achieve long-term peace. We should not be fighting there for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09043029000220"></a>The security of Afghanistan and Pakistan are closely linked. Therefore, what work are the Government undertaking with the Pakistani military and the ISI to bolster military capability and aid their defensive strategy?

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09043029000221"></a>It is vital that our servicemen are treated fairly and with compassion, which requires a holistic approach that encompasses a true duty of care both in the field and when they return home. On their return, it is important that our servicemen are looked after in every possible way to ensure their welfare and well-being, as well as the welfare of their families. It is essential that we provide them with financial, material, medical and psychological support. We owe it to them. Finally, I urge the Government to consider all the points raised in this wide-ranging debate. We must take stock of where we are and where we need to be heading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09043029000223"></a>I am delighted to see that great patriot the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, in her place. We have missed her greatly.

Seeing her manoeuvre her new vehicle around your Lordships&#146; premises today has only confirmed me in that belief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09043029000224"></a>On a more sober note, I echo the words of my noble friend Lady Dean about what is happening in Basra today. Any of us who saw that service must have been deeply moved by it. It brings home to us in the most vivid way exactly what sacrifices our young men and women are making on our behalf.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09043029000225"></a>I turn to the problems facing the Ministry of Defence. I was extremely pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, say that the present Secretary of State was the best that we have had in this Government. I dare not comment on that, even though my previous boss is not in the Chamber, but I will say that in the 40 years since I have been at Westminster the present Secretary of State is only the second I knew who wanted the job. He is first one who knew anything about it before he got there, as far as I can make out. He is doing a superb job. That is enough sucking up for one day.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09043029000226"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, said that she had various uses for the Gurkhas. She omitted one that it always occurred to me we should have contemplated: sending them to Northern Ireland. We would have had little trouble with the IRA within 48 hours of their arriving there, but that is a purely personal view.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09043029000227"></a>It was interesting today to listen to the generals, neither of whom is in his place at the moment, and one field marshal telling us why they wanted all the Navy assets cut for more expenditure on the Army, although they were too delicate to put it so crudely. I do not agree. If we are going to have carriers, we need two; one is no use at all, as what would we do when one is out of action?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09043029000228"></a>I am a firm believer in having a four-boat Trident fleet, even though we are told that the new submarines are going to be much more effective and efficient than the generation that they are replacing. We have come more than once close to the edge of not having a boat on patrol, even with the present Vanguard class.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09043029000229"></a>I am a firm believer in the nuclear deterrent. I took on board the remarks of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, who said that he did not believe that this country should have nuclear weapons and that we should set a moral example to the rest of the world by giving them up. The great thing about nuclear weapons is that they are not only the ultimate war-making weapon but the ultimate peacekeeping weapon. That is their great virtue: they act as a superb and ultimate deterrent. I will never cease to battle to make sure that this country keeps its nuclear deterrent in good fighting order.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09043029000230"></a>I think that we could redirect some of our resources quite drastically in the defence equipment budget, although my candidates would be some of the expenditure in the Royal Air Force, where we are committed. One has to recognise the extent to which Defence Procurement Ministers are prisoners of the past and of political decisions of which they themselves had no part. We are now spending huge amounts of money on a fourth generation aircraft when the fifth generation aircraft, the Joint Strike Fighter, will be available to us in a short space of time.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09043029000231"></a>We need to remember that we want our Armed Forces not just for peacekeeping and dealing with insurgencies; they have to be there in case we need them for serious war fighting. To that end, some of the kit that we are procuring will not be much use to us in 10 or so years&#146; time, as other countries acquire fifth-generation aircraft. The most important thing when we are talking about serious war fighting is the need for this country to maintain its capability to communicate in the battle space with the forces of the United States of America. We are close to losing that capability and there is no other member of NATO, so far as I am aware, that has it. I consider that of supreme importance to the defence posture of this country.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09043029000232"></a>Parenthetically, I want to say how much I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s renewed emphasis on the Special Forces and his intention to deliver some resources to increasing their size and capability.</p>

<a name="90430-0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09043029000233"></a>My noble friend Lady Dean said that of course we need to spend more on defence. I could not agree more. Over a few years we should increase our defence expenditure by the tune of something like 25 per cent. She also said that something would have to give way. I disagree with her profoundly on that. When we see how many resources we are finding to bail out incompetent and greedy bankers&#151;that is a serious remark; it is not intended as a jest&#151;I see no reason why we cannot find the resources for the Armed Forces, particularly when we are in a time of increasing unemployment and the resources are available. We owe it to our Armed Forces. It is a question of political courage. I hope that my noble friends in my Government or any successor Government will make the resources available to the Armed Forces, which we so easily could do.</p>

The simple fact is that only a small proportion of our Armed Forces are suitable for Special Forces, whose skill set is so remarkable. It is also worth remembering that, by the standards of many countries, our Royal Marines Commandos are Special Forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09043029000236"></a>Yesterday&#146;s policy Statement about Afghanistan and Pakistan was interesting. There was some recognition that the operation is not purely military, but we are not pulling all the levers of the state&#146;s power, both hard and soft, together in unison. Apart from the Prime Minister himself, there is no single Minister who can wield that power. The power is diluted and divided and no one controls the money. The Statement said that the number of civilian experts in Afghanistan was to be doubled. Will the Minister say what the new total will be? That is the only question that I am going to ask.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09043029000237"></a>Many noble Lords have queried whether our Armed Forces are properly equipped. In effect, have we got our threat assessment wrong and, from that, our capability management? I am not sure that we have got it that wrong. The problem lies with the strategic decisions that we have made: first, operating at double medium scale plus when only resourced for one medium-scale operation and one small operation; and, secondly, the way in which we are prosecuting the campaign in Afghanistan. On that, I will be building on the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. As for Iraq, I look forward to the conclusions of the inquiry into that campaign, which will start at some point.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09043029000238"></a>Despite the Government&#146;s protestations, our operations on the ground in Afghanistan are primarily military in nature. Moreover, there is insufficient density of military and security staff in the difficult provinces. ISAF does not compare well to IFOR in that respect. Another difficulty is that many of ISAF&#146;s troops are located in the quiet areas and operate under significant national caveats. This also gives weight to a Taliban argument that ISAF is merely a western force of occupation.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09043029000239"></a>As many noble Lords have observed, members of our Armed Forces have been prosecuting the campaign in Afghanistan with vigour and courage. They are in contact with the Taliban on a daily basis. Inevitably there can be loss of civilian life and damage to civilian infrastructure but, unlike with the Americans, reconstruction for us does not start the next day. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, explained some of these difficulties with far more authenticity and credibility than I can manage. But often the area of operations is too dangerous for conventional NGOs, and DfID does not do danger, as it appears to see itself as not having a tactical role. Thus, we can have only military and not civil effect. I am not sure how we are going to change an adverse civil culture by purely military means.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_364"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 364</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09043029000240"></a>Yesterday, the Government released their policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The policy observed that most Afghans do not support the Taliban but are waiting to see who predominates. Nevertheless, they also have a cultural position. The policy paper alluded to a decisive blow against the Taliban. I think that that is illusory and there will not be one. We need to drive a wedge between the reconcilable and the irreconcilable Taliban, which has been the policy for some time. Effective reconstruction and its delivery are crucial to this, but we must also recognise and understand the cultural issues.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09043029000241"></a>For instance, one of our objectives in Afghanistan is to empower women, which is an absolutely proper and desirable objective. But how does that fit in with the Afghan culture and do we understand it? Out of 8,000 12 year-old English girls, one will die from childbearing-related complications. We could do better because the figure in Sweden is one in 17,000. However, in developing countries the ratio is one in 450 and in Afghanistan it is one in nine. I repeat: one in nine Afghan women will die as the result of childbearing problems. On top of that, two in every 10 Afghan babies die before their fifth birthday. The figures are horrendous and hard to comprehend; indeed, only two other countries in the world have a worse record. However, it is not just poverty. As many noble Lords know, Afghanistan has very few proper midwives or decent facilities, but we know too that the culture is very complex and we do not fully understand it.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09043029000242"></a>When our troops deploy to theatre, they undertake pre-deployment training and study the culture, but only enough for a six-month tour. Apparently, Afghan men are very poor at permitting and facilitating medical intervention into their wives&#146; pregnancies or deliveries and they would certainly never allow a male doctor to attend. They will not relent even if their wives suffer diabolical pain or injury, or even if she bleeds to death over two days. It is very hard for us to understand why they allow such suffering, but I am afraid that it is in their culture. If we are honest, until recently the UK was a bit homophobic, but the Government changed our culture by a number of means. They did it slowly, but we have changed.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09043029000243"></a>When I came back from Afghanistan two years ago, having been there with the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, I came to the view that we need either a hardened and well financed NGO or something much more akin to the old ODA of the early 1990s. It could come under either the MoD or the FCO, but in both cases it would work closely with our military at the tactical level. It would have integrated communications and individuals would be trained to have good operational skills. They would need to be able to marshal a military helicopter to an emergency landing site. But what is most important is that they would have to be prepared to accept enhanced risk and deal with danger. There is no point in taking a steady stream of military casualties and not achieving our desired end state, or to do it so slowly that it does not matter. The mission would be to provide civil effect in order to encourage local Afghans to reject the Taliban and move towards a more prosperous and healthy Afghanistan. I do not think that this is a

I declare an interest in that I am a non-executive director of the Order of St John and the British Red Cross Defence Medical Welfare Service. The contribution of the Defence Medical Welfare Service is not well known. Its welfare officers go about their work in a quiet and effective way in hospitals in the United Kingdom, Germany and Cyprus and on deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, we believe that it is far more important that the people who need and use the service, members of the Armed Forces and their dependent relatives, know exactly what DMWS provides. Feedback from them and the commanding officers of those hospitals is overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09043029000245"></a>The Defence Medical Welfare Service is a charity contracted and funded by the MoD to provide a medical welfare service to hospitalised personnel and their dependent relatives. The service is held to account by the MoD at quarterly review meetings. We are the only civilian charity that serves on the front line and is accountable to military command while on deployment attached to field hospitals. Before deployment, all welfare officers undergo specialist training and, immediately prior to leaving, join the hospital medical team with which they will be working for last-minute training. While on deployment, they wear a functional uniform that differentiates them from the military and a name badge carrying the logo of St John and the British Red Cross.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para9"></a>

A rigorous performance management framework enables anyone from the board to the welfare officers to see at a glance what activity has taken place in the units. However, what is not seen in those reports, but is seen only in the letters of thanks and appreciation, is how the welfare officers rise on every occasion to meet needs on an individual basis with professionalism, compassion and respect to assist those at a most vulnerable time in their lives. Personnel from other than UK units who are treated by the hospital team are also recipients of DMWS; in fact a letter recently arrived from the head of the army in the Netherlands praising the way in which Dutch personnel had been so well cared for by DMWS welfare officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09043029000247"></a>Much has been discussed over the last 18 months on the subject of the broader provision of welfare to the Armed Forces&#151;not only the military but also other organisations. However, the service that DMWS provides is different in that it is purely a hospital-based medical welfare service. What do we mean by this? All

They are fully equipped to meet the immediate needs of the sick and injured by providing the basic necessities of clothes and toiletries as well as comforts for those requiring longer stays in the form of CDs and DVDs. They also provide intensive support for the families of the injured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09043029000248"></a>Perhaps the most important part is the listening ear for hospitalised personnel, enabling them to talk in absolute confidence away from but respecting the chain of command. They often want to share their personal worries, anxieties and fears, as well as grief if perhaps they have lost a great chum. There is also an opportunity to pick up on the early signs of mental health conditions, particularly those that lead to PTSD. This can lead to early referral and prophylactic treatment. This listening ear is also available to medical support teams, most often after a very heavy day of casualties and deaths, providing a private space for reflection and the ability to unwind from the stress of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09043029000249"></a>This organisation, consisting of a total of 50 staff, provides a small part of the total welfare commitment to service personnel, but we believe that the delivery of medical welfare plays a very important part in providing a professional and compassionate service at times of greatest need and, in so doing, contributes to the well-being of individual service personnel, enabling them to move towards a full recovery and, where possible, to return to service duties.</p>

I and your Lordships owe him a colossal debt for giving us the opportunity to have a debate on the Armed Forces today, when we have heard so much in your Lordships&#146; House and elsewhere this week about the huge spread of activities and duties of our enormously brave, successful and unique Armed Forces all over the world.</p>

He was classified as a noble and gallant Lord&#151;if your Lordships&#146; want to find out why, they should go to the end of the Royal Gallery&#151; although he did not achieve high office. From the age of four I was imbued with something like military duty, if not quite that. I am old enough to be one of, I think, four speakers in the debate today who are conscripts. There may be more and certainly others may have started as conscripts and then continued to distinguished regular professional careers. As far as I am aware, four of your Lordships who have spoken in this debate have served full-time as professional soldiers or perhaps sailors, so here we can see an enormous spread of the Armed Forces&#146; military duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09043029000253"></a>I served two years in my father&#146;s regiment. Being, as Hilaire Belloc put it, somewhat short of sight, and what is called vertically challenged, my commanding officer decided that it might be better if I were not on the Queen&#146;s Birthday Parade on 13 July 1958. Instead, I was sent to the small arms school for weapons training in infantry weapons at Hythe. Being somewhat short of sight, I borrowed the glasses of a kind Welsh Guards colleague and stunned the staff by achieving 94 out of 100. It may considerably shake up some of my colleagues, not least the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, to know that we were the first course to use the new self-loading rifle&#151;the .300 SLR. I thought this was a Mercedes sports racing car but was told that it was not. That was 51 years ago today. There was I, a young second lieutenant, taking that two-month course in weapons training.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09043029000254"></a>On 14 July 1958 the grins were wiped off our faces. At Windsor, 1 Battalion Scots Guards were dressed in public service tunics and bearskins and marching with pipers to Windsor Castle perhaps every 48 hours. We were warned for duty in&#151;guess where&#151;Iraq. I was allowed by the late father of my noble friend Lord Cathcart to be in charge of the entire weapon training for my battalion. As a 19-year-old, that really shook me but I realised I had to do a professional job. There is one thing that I ask&#151;please&#151;the Minister to do. She knows that I have the good luck to be secretary of the House of Lords defence group. Alas the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, is not in her place, but one of my colleagues&#151;I will not say where or who&#151;made a reference and comparison involving her as chairman of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, Attila the Hun and a pussycat. I will leave your Lordships to draw the necessary conclusion. She is simply a wonderful chairman of our group, we are grateful to have her and she leads me and other noble Lords to learn, visit, see and discover all aspects that concern servicemen and servicewomen.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09043029000255"></a>I will lightly and quietly breach one more convention of your Lordships&#146; House. Among the speakers who alas are not in their places is a young colleague in my regiment, the noble Earl, Lord Stair. I am thinking of 13 June 1982, when he led his platoon from 2 Battalion Scots Guards at Mount Tumbledown in the Falkland Islands against the fifth battalion of the Argentine marines. He and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, might well be the only two Members speaking in the debate&#151;there might be more&#151; who have faced enemy action and hostile fire; we are lucky to have them. It is with that in mind that I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me today or later that the standard of training that the noble Earl, the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, others and I received will continue.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09043029000256"></a>I see that I have about one minute left. Your Lordships have been kind enough to refer&#151;I would like to join in the tributes&#151;to my noble friend Lady Park, who has been an enormous help to me. I served in Northern Ireland for five and a half years&#151;six summers, I will call it&#151;and my boss was the then Secretary of State, the institutor of today&#146;s debate, my noble friend Lord King. One evening in August 1987 he had been staying with me. He moved to Tullybeagles in Perthshire where he was called from his bed at four o&#146;clock in the morning because he had to fly across to Belfast and on  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_368"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the hideous attack at Ballygawly. I cannot remember how many light infantrymen lost their lives. In April 1988 my noble friend had to fly once again to Belfast following the appalling murder of two corporals who were trapped in west Belfast. I happened to be 500 yards away&#151;little further than we are from the other place. There was a helicopter flying above my head; I happened to be the duty Minister but that was nothing to do with me. I was pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, referred to what he had seen at Omagh. The fighting that our wonderful servicepeople carry out in Afghanistan or in areas of conflict is no less important and no less vicious than what he saw in Omagh and what my noble friend Lord King and I saw and appreciated on other occasions in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09043029000257"></a>I conclude by thanking my noble friend Lord King for giving us the opportunity to speak today and praise each and every member of our Armed Forces. I apologise for taking a slightly personal view but I am a mere second lieutenant among noble and gallant Lords, including marshals of the Royal Air Force, and others who have spoken. It is crucial that even a mere timid, vertically challenged platoon commander of the Scots Guards should also be heard.</p>

As I stood with my wife this morning watching the services in Basra I felt that welling-up of sadness that almost leads to a tear in the eye. That, like the &#147;Last Post&#148;, is a sad moment. Then there is another welling-up, which is when the pride takes over. As I look around at this country I see that there is a reason for great pride in our Armed Forces. They are probably the most respected institution that we have in the world at this moment&#151;they are respected worldwide. It is sad that the Bank of England has gone downhill and that Parliament and the Government are no longer respected. But pound for pound, dollar for dollar, euro for euro, those men and women and what they represent are worth more than any others in the world. What they do today is often a result of history. What they have done has sometimes been due to the mistakes of others but very seldom has it been due to their own mistakes.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09043029000259"></a>One has to think now about the future. Over the past few weeks I have been writing a Green Paper. I like those sorts of things; you take useless information, put it all together and draw conclusions that you know no one else would ever accept. So I began with Her Majesty the Queen and her Crown dependencies, overseas territories and realms&#151;three countries, 12 countries, 15 countries. Then I took the Commonwealth, 65 countries that are British-related and, to some extent, interrelated. You might say, &#147;Well, what about these countries?&#148;. But you do not look at their population; you look at their coastlines, 44,000 kilometres of them&#151;our territories. That is a little more, by a few hundred kilometres, than the territory of the Soviet Union, and twice that of the United States.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09043029000260"></a>You then say, &#147;Let&#146;s look at the oceans of the world and these coastlines and what they represent&#148;. The coastline around the Pacific measures 136,000 kilometres;  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_369"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>around the Indian Ocean, 111,000 kilometres; around the Mediterranean, 87,000 kilometres. You say, &#147;What does that all mean?&#148;. You go back into your history and say, &#147;Why on earth did we go out into the world?&#148;. We have never been an exporting nation; we have always been an importing nation. The role of the Navy has been to protect our lives by protecting our imports. Thus, the future of our island, which was once known by the ancients as &#147;Windmill Hill&#148; because we worshipped the wind, is to go out and invest, develop and bring back some of the benefits from around the world.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09043029000261"></a>Looking at the food crisis and at the dependent territories and others, you realise that almost all those who are in trouble had investment in development that took place because of what they had to offer and the added value that could be created. So I thought that we must look not only at the added value on the land but at the added value in the sea and what lies under it. I thought that for these territories the Government should immediately declare 500-mile limits over the oceans, or at least a limit of half the distance between the island and the next mainland, that we should then protect. The problem for the world and the defence of world peace does not necessarily lie inland; it depends upon access by sea. Inevitably, having served in the Royal Navy, I would expect this to be the Navy&#146;s prime role. Can we defend the sea routes? Can we, effectively, have access? Access for defence or peacekeeping purposes is difficult on lands that are not linked to the coast.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09043029000262"></a>Of course we need the new carriers. We need other resources too, but some of them are relatively simple. Having had to serve in patrols in Cyprus where you were in inshore or coastal minesweepers that made you sick, you suddenly realise that for patrol boats in some of these territories you do not need anything much bigger than a large motor gunboat with a 40-millimetre Bofors and what they now call a chain gun.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09043029000263"></a>I was thinking of how we could defend these territories. Your Lordships will remember that there are now 45 claims to the Antarctic, because of the natural resources that are underneath it. When the Russians go and stick a flag somewhere, that is them laying a claim. We should give consideration to the resources of the sea. If I were like the noble Lord, Lord Sterling, with his ships and his lateral-thinking mind, I would say, &#147;Maybe, if we take these territorial rights, we can sell certain oil rights and other rights, which could raise significant funds that could finance further developments&#148;.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09043029000264"></a>These are just slightly lateral thoughts, but if we are to have a future as a nation, it will be trade-related. We have an enormous manufacturing balance-of-payments deficit, but we have a great opportunity at the moment. The biggest single growth area of GDP, surprisingly enough, is the health service. The public sector is what it is all about today, and that is wrong. If unemployment is rising and we need to stimulate demand, let us not give people &#163;2,000 to scrap an old car; let us spend a bit more of the reserves on creating forces. Let us not just train university students in boats on the Thames; let us put them together and send them out in gunboats. After all, I went to sea as an officer in the Navy after only 90 days&#146; basic training, which I think was due to a technological error.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09043029000266"></a>There is much that we can learn from history. I have already been forced to learn it. When you are in trade, you sit below the salt; you go to the more difficult countries and deal with the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean&#151;all parts of the world that no one wants to go to because they are hot and dusty. Then, suddenly, you find that that is where the conflict is. The conflict is not in the Channel or in the western approaches; there are both conflicts and opportunities throughout the world, and we, the United Kingdom, have the greatest opportunity that we have had in my lifetime.</p>

Listening to today&#146;s debate and reading carefully the <I>Hansard</I> of the debate on defence procurement that was held in the other place about 10 days ago, I acknowledge and appreciate the growing consensus across political parties on the whole question of defence. There is an increasing consensus that our force is severely overstretched; that there is a near impossibility, or a considerable unlikelihood, of us going to war alone in the future; that we are more likely to be part of a coalition, part of a UN force or part of peacekeeping operations; that our economic situation at present puts us under severe pressure; that we need&#151;virtually all noble Lords who have spoken have referred to this&#151;a major strategic defence review; and that we must match our commitments to our resources.</p>

<a name="90430-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09043029000269"></a>Where I slightly question what the noble Lord, Lord King, and some of my noble colleagues have been saying, however, is on the issue of whether we are prepared as a country to provide the resources for Britain to remain as a first-division power, or whether we have to accept the reality of our economic circumstances and accept that we are likely to be a very superior second-division power. On the one hand, we have at present what I would describe as first-division weaponry and equipment. We have Trident and the Typhoon, while soon we will have the Astute submarines. Two supercarriers have been ordered, and we have the outstanding Type 45 Daring class destroyers. That is first-class equipment. On the other hand, though, we have a shortage of troops, of helicopters&#151;as my noble friend Lord Burnett referred to&#151;and strategic lift capability, as well as a shortage of escort vessels, which the noble Lord, Lord Sterling, referred to.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09043029000270"></a>Unquestionably, we are trying to do too much on the 2.4 per cent or so of gross domestic product spent on defence. Whichever party wins the next general election will face some difficult choices. Indeed, I think I am right in saying that the Official Opposition have for the first time acknowledged that the defence spend, as far as they are concerned, can no longer be regarded as a sacred cow and ring-fenced. Indeed, I would suggest that the debate on defence in the Conservative Party in the next 12 or 18 months will be crucial to defence in this country.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09043029000271"></a>Of course, it would all be very different if we currently faced a major military threat. We would then have to put defence expenditure as a number one priority. However, this is not the case at present. On the other hand, we have a major conflict in Afghanistan, commitments in the Balkans and piracy off Somalia, all of which have to be properly resourced. It is particularly disturbing to hear that the Prime Minister is blocking the commitment, or the wish of the defence chiefs, to provide more permanent forces for Afghanistan and that he will sanction only a modest increase on a temporary basis. I think that we are letting down our forces.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09043029000272"></a>We cannot ignore the terrorist threat to this country. I was interested in the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, regarding a department of homeland security. We have the nuclear threat from North Korea, an uncertain Iran, a fragile Pakistan and significant increases in Russian and Chinese defence expenditure. Russia is considering using bases in Cuba, Venezuela and pushing into the Arctic. It was announced earlier this week that Russia and China are planning something like 25 joint manoeuvres. That announcement was made by Defence Ministers from what is termed the Shanghai Co-Operation Organisation, which is seen as an emerging rival to NATO. The world is still a very dangerous place and we have to keep up our guard.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09043029000273"></a>What should be the strands of our defence policy in the short to medium term? First&#151;I believe the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, referred to this earlier&#151;we must stay close to America, our number one military ally. I would suggest that we are all a lot more comfortable with President Obama&#146;s approach of more talking, less sabre-rattling and less axis-of-evil language. Secondly&#151;this came up at Question Time earlier&#151;we welcome France&#146;s return to the military structure in NATO. We must work to support greater European defence co-operation and support more joint procurement. We should try to encourage greater United Kingdom corporate activity in helping to consolidate the European defence industries. One looks at what BAE Systems has achieved in the United States. It employs significantly more people there than it does in this country. The lead towards consolidation can come from our industry.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09043029000274"></a>Thirdly, we must work towards a reduction in nuclear weapons. The right reverend Prelate referred to that. There is increasingly a questioning of Trident. A number of noble Lords, including the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Ramsbotham, referred to Trident. Is it truly independent? Realistically, are we ever likely to press the button? Can we afford the cost of anything up to  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_372"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;100 billion in today&#146;s money values over a 40-year period from 2015? Can that sort of expenditure realistically be justified? Could other delivery systems such as the Astute submarines carry a more modest nuclear capability, if we judge that to be necessary? I am increasingly undecided on Trident, and increasingly Trident-sceptic. Perhaps the time has come to set up a serious Future of Trident commission, involving senior diplomats, defence experts, naval specialists and logistical and financial personnel to look seriously at all the options, however radical.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09043029000275"></a>Fourthly, it is increasingly accepted that we need more mobile and a greater number of special forces. The Secretary of State referred to that in a speech earlier this week. A littler earlier today, my noble friend Lord Burnett spoke of the marines and commandos in action in Afghanistan. He also acknowledged the tremendous efforts of the Gurkhas and the debt we owe them. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, also referred to the Gurkhas. In Written Answers to my good friend Nick Harvey in the other place, the Armed Forces Minister, Bob Ainsworth, effectively conceded that 30 per cent of parachutists in our leading airborne fighting unit are not sufficiently qualified at present. A total of 11 parachuting course were cancelled in the past 12 months owing to lack of aircraft. So can we justify two new large carriers plus aircraft and escorts in our increasingly constrained circumstances? The suggestion in the other place made by Nicholas Soames and others was that perhaps we ought to be thinking about a number of smaller carriers&#151;perhaps the development of HMS &#147;Ocean&#148;-type vessels which can carry helicopters. My noble friend Lord Addington also questioned the role of heavy armour. Fifthly, there is the whole question of our reserves.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09043029000276"></a>We have to sensibly and intelligently handle the transition from being perhaps a superpower to being a very capable second-division player, all the while keeping up our guard and recognising that we need more mobile and lighter Armed Forces. Finally, and crucially, we have to honour the covenant with our service personnel in terms of length of deployment, training, pay, equipment, accommodation and aftercare. We must show greater awareness of mental problems that arise for those who have been in combat. We owe our brave service personnel nothing less.</p>

Daily they perform extraordinary tasks in service to our nation. As demonstrated by the death of Lance Sergeant Fasfous of the Welsh Guards, they are willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. The noble Lord, Lord Robertson, pointed out the vital role that the families of service men and women play. My sympathy goes out to them and the loved ones of

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09043029000279"></a>In an eloquent speech, my noble friend Lord Sterling mentioned the Royal Marine who had lost both legs only seven months after passing out. We are doing much to help, but the questions remain. Are we doing enough? What more could we, should we, be doing? My noble friend Lord King mentioned the mental price paid because of the difficult nature of the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to research published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, the longer military personnel are deployed, the more likely they are to be at risk of developing psychological disorders and experiencing problems at home. In light of continued deployments, what are the Government doing to better advertise help available to veterans suffering from PTSD, both to GPs and the veterans themselves?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09043029000280"></a>We also remember the 179 British service men and women who gave their lives in Iraq. This is a timely debate, given today&#146;s very moving memorial service and the withdrawal of British troops from Basra. While the Army may be coming home, the Royal Navy is still active there and we must remember the strong presence they still have in the Gulf. As my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew said, we also remember those service men and women killed in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09043029000281"></a>We have had an excellent and authoritative debate with contributions ranging far and wide over the tasks which our Armed Forces are expected to perform. Putting all the views together it is clear that the situation is critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09043029000282"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark both mentioned the Trident replacement. As was made clear in the defence procurement debate in the other place last week, we on these Benches welcome the decision to proceed with the Trident replacement. As the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, said, this is the ultimate peacekeeping weapon. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and my noble friends Lord Marlesford and Lord Attlee pointed out that there could be no satisfactory peacekeeping while there is such a wide disconnect between the MoD, DfID and the FCO. I went to Afghanistan a month after the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham&#151;I thank the noble Baroness&#146;s department for all its help in putting the visit together&#151;and I share the admiration of the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Burnett, for the Royal Marines I met out there, from Brigadier Gordon Messenger down. Many soldiers and Royal Marines I spoke to there wished that DfID could be less risk-averse and have a better understanding of the military outlook and culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09043029000283"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnett called for assurances on the two carriers and the JSF. He will be pleased to know that we on these Benches are publicly committed to both. My noble friend Lord Selsdon pointed out the important role the Royal Navy plays for this nation as a maritime nation. My noble friend Lord Sheikh pointed out that we owe members of the Armed Forces a duty of care. The military covenant

My noble friend also mentioned the problems of the air bridge. The Minister is aware of my concerns on this issue and the number of service men and women who are being seriously inconvenienced and losing leave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09043029000284"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, and my noble friend Lord Attlee mentioned the vital role that the Special Forces carry out. I agree and I give them all my support. The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, mentioned the Defence Medical Welfare Service and I pay tribute to the very important work that it does.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09043029000285"></a>Many noble Lords mentioned the Gurkhas. Having served in Gurkha brigades in Malaysia and Hong Kong, I was delighted, like the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, at yesterday&#146;s decision. I congratulate Joanna Lumley on the incredible campaign she has fought with these brave Gurkhas, coming to Parliament again and again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09043029000287"></a>Afghanistan has, naturally, been mentioned by many noble Lords, as has Pakistan, particularly in a very interesting speech by my noble friend Lord Marlesford. On preparations for the August elections in Afghanistan and the planned increase in troop numbers, we have said that we would support an increase for the elections, as long as it was clearly justified and backed up by extra equipment, such as helicopters, and adequate force protection. Will the Minister confirm that this will be the case?</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09043029000288"></a>Yesterday, the Prime Minister talked about our NATO allies sharing a fairer burden in Afghanistan, as was announced at the recent NATO summit. Will the Minister tell the House when this commitment will be delivered and how many of the extra troops will be based in southern Afghanistan? Will the Minister give the House her assurance that personnel withdrawn from Iraq this year will be given sufficient rest, in line with the harmony guidelines, before they are deployed to Afghanistan? The Grenadier Guards&#146; last tour interval, for example, between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was only eight months.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09043029000289"></a>The Government&#146;s neglect of the defence industry has been mentioned. The industry has become so concerned that the National Defence Industries Council plans to undertake a lobbying exercise to persuade Government that this sector does matter. Not only does the defence sector provide some 305,000 jobs&#151;10 per cent of Britain&#146;s manufacturing workforce&#151;it also contributes enormous revenues to the Exchequer. The United Kingdom is gaining a reputation as an unreliable partner. We hear that the Treasury will not sign off on the order for the 16 tranche 3 Typhoons for the Royal Air Force at a cost of &#163;1.44 billion. What implications will there be for the maintenance of key technology skills in this country if this deal does not go through? The Government cannot presume on the continued presence in the UK market of the international investors they want to see here if they are not given work. Maintaining design teams and preparing bids is not a

Industry must recoup its costs.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09043029000290"></a>Will the Minister say something about the assessment work on the FRES Scout reconnaissance vehicle? Not stalling on this, but replacing the antiquated CVR(T)s quickly, would send a positive message to our troops. With all the add-on equipment, they have now become totally unfightable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09043029000292"></a>It is right that we debate the big issues of defence and security policy, but it is fundamental that, in so doing, we should always keep in mind the demands that such policies make on the people who carry them out.</p>

I add my welcome to the noble Baroness, Lady Park. We did&#151;perhaps surprisingly to some people&#151;agree on one issue some time ago when we mounted a little campaign together. We will not, I am sure, agree on everything, but I welcome her back to the House, having admired her resolution and determination during my presence here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09043029000294"></a>As has been said, this is a very appropriate time to have a debate on defence. Mention has been made of events in Iraq, quite rightly, but there are also some anniversaries which we might perhaps take a moment to recall. Some of your Lordships may recall that it is 40 years to the day since HMS &#147;Resolution&#148; set ready on 30 April 1969, beginning the continuous at-sea deterrence. I know that we have had different views in the House today on the replacement, views which have been robustly countered by the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, and the noble Lord, Lord Astor. Interestingly, the Prime Minister also touched on this yesterday at Prime Minister&#146;s Questions and talked about hopes for non-proliferation and hopes for progress, but also the need for us to be careful about our own defence.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09043029000295"></a>Earlier this month, we had the celebration of NATO&#146;s 60th birthday. Very few people who were present at NATO&#146;s creation would have thought that this alliance would not only outlast the Cold War conditions that brought it into being, but successfully oversee the redrawing of the map of Europe and arrive at the new situation, the post-9/11 situation, and the dramatically different security environment that we now face. I have just returned from talks with people in Croatia and Albania, NATO&#146;s newest members, and they, of course, come from an area that, only a decade ago, was actually at war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09043029000296"></a>Mention has also been made today, by the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, and others, of the decision by France to return to NATO&#146;s integrated military structure, something that I hope we can all welcome. Mention

Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, quite rightly drew attention to the challenges facing the new Secretary-General&#151;no doubt with some sympathy on his part&#151;with regard to the need further to develop the transformation and reform agenda within NATO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09043029000297"></a>On 6 June, it will be the 65th anniversary of British and allied servicemen coming ashore on the beaches of Normandy, and there will quite rightly be an international commemoration. These anniversaries are important in their own right, and because they underline some of the themes that have been raised in the debate: the variety of threats that we face; the crucial importance of NATO&#146;s mission in Afghanistan; and&#151;a unifying factor&#151;the support that we must provide to those who are serving or who have served our nation with such distinction in so many ways.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09043029000298"></a>Mention was made of the events this morning in Iraq, where the Defence Secretary attended what has rightly been described as a moving and important ceremony to mark the successful completion of the British combat mission and the transition to a close and, we hope, enduring bilateral relationship with Iraq. After a commitment lasting more than six years, British forces will now start to leave southern Iraq, with Basra transformed from how they found it six years ago. The commanding general of the coalition forces said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09043029000457"></a>&#147;The accomplishment of the British forces across Iraq, and especially in Basra, has been nothing short of brilliant&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000441"></a>Brigadier Tom Beckett, commander of 20 Armoured Brigade, said today:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09043029000458"></a>&#147;We leave knowing we have done our job and done it well&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000442"></a>The importance of this should continue to be in our minds, which is why the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary have made a commitment to bring the Basra memorial wall home to a fitting resting place in Britain at the National Memorial Arboretum, which is an appropriate venue.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09043029000299"></a>Noble Lords have talked about some of the challenges that we face, and we have had calls, not for the first time, for a defence review. Rightly, the Prime Minister has made it clear on more than one occasion that no one could have foreseen the sheer scale of the new global challenges that our growing interdependence brings; their scale, diversity and the speed with which they emerge. That is why the Government have launched the national security strategy, a new approach which is important for various reasons. It brings home the range of the threats and challenges and makes it clear that the distinction between defence and security is now more difficult to define than ever before. Security is not just about our forces in the conventional way that people think, but about the critical roles that they have to play all around the world.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09043029000300"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and my noble friend Lord Judd also mentioned the importance of the role that we play in conflict prevention, helping other countries to tackle some of the serious security challenges that exist around the world which could have implications for us as a nation. That is why we in the UK have trained more than 12,000 African peacekeepers since 2004-05. We should acknowledge

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09043029000301"></a>I will now say a little about the work going on in operations. I have mentioned the events in Iraq today, which were important and impressive. It is right that we now move on to a new relationship. United Kingdom forces still have, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor, suggested, an important role to finish there. They are now focusing on completing the task of mentoring and training the 14th division. Importantly, the Royal Navy will continue to help to provide security for Iraq&#146;s offshore energy infrastructure, as well as trying to help to train the Iraqi navy. The Royal Air Force provides essential support for Iraqi security forces as part of the coalition effort. We should commend what our troops have done in Iraq and recognise the continuing role that some will have to play.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09043029000302"></a>Mention was made of the work on piracy around the Horn of Africa. The United Kingdom is at the forefront of the EU mission, with the operational headquarters at Northwood. The noble Lord, Lord Sterling, acknowledged the work that goes on there. It is important that we also acknowledge the United Kingdom&#146;s lead on international co-ordination through the international contact group, which brings together civil, maritime, NATO and EU missions going on in that area. It is a United Nations-sanctioned approach, because it is important that everyone works together in that way.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09043029000303"></a>When it comes to operations, our main thoughts at the moment are with Afghanistan. Mention has been made of the importance of the Afghanistan-Pakistan dimension, of which we in this country were always aware because, as was said earlier, we have to learn from our history. Yesterday&#146;s Statement made it very clear that our main responsibility is to provide security for the area. We have to train the Afghan police and army. We have to establish the rule of law, and we have to help Afghans to tackle corruption and then to move on to economic development.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09043029000304"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, mentioned other important issues, such as the rights of women. He had horrific statistics. That motivates us to help in many countries where there are problems of that kind. It is important to remember that we do not have a military operation there because of that. We have a military operation in Afghanistan to underpin our own security, because of all the threats that have emanated from there in the recent past. The noble Earl is right that we need a comprehensive approach to these issues, and we need to have joined-up government both here and on operations to maximise what we can do.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09043029000305"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, suggested that our Armed Forces needed to know the answer to the old question, &#147;Is our country behind us?&#148;. I think that the country is behind our Armed Forces, but the noble and learned Lord is right to suggest that sometimes we have to remind the public of the dangers of not participating, not taking control and not re-establishing security in that area. The origins of 9/11, the Madrid bombing and the London Tube bombings can all be traced back to that area, and we have to make progress in our own interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09043029000306"></a>Equipment, training and support are all extremely important. On numbers, this is never a static situation, because we always keep these under review. We intend to go up to 9,000 for the election period, of course with the kind of support and force protection that is required to do the job properly. As the Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, in the region of 5,000 other troops from European NATO countries are being considered for that kind of role. Some people are looking to provide extra police training through the gendarmeries that exist in some countries, which could be very important. It is now generally agreed that we have done well when it comes to delivering equipment to operations. The &#163;10 billion that we have spent has produced very dramatic results, and our operational experience has been an important driver in terms of making sure that we are at the cutting edge of new equipment, and it has brought new ways of working.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09043029000307"></a>On the Armed Forces security commitment, we have made progress with Kestrel and Osprey, but we do not stop there. Now we want to improve that to make lighter equipment of that kind to make movement easier, especially in that climate. The subject of vehicles, on which we have a good story to tell, has already been raised. More than &#163;1 billion of new money has been approved for new vehicles for operations, including &#163;350 million for more than 400 new light and medium vehicles: the Coyote and the Husky&#151;the ones with the exciting names. We also have the experience of some of those which we have developed so far, such as the Mastiff, which has been a tremendous success. They are getting into the field very quickly; I was asked about that earlier. However, I remind the House that we are not simply buying these vehicles off the shelf. They often have to be developed to meet the challenging conditions we face in Afghanistan. We must commend industry and those in the MoD working in this area. They have turned the speed of development around, which is important.</p>

<a name="90430-0008.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09043029000308"></a>We have also made significant progress in the air. We have managed to maintain extra flying hours: helicopter flying hours in Afghanistan are now 84 per cent higher than in November 2006. There are a whole variety of initiatives for upgrading helicopters and working with other countries on them. It is significant that real progress has been made. Of course, we could always use more helicopters on operations, but it is important to realise that those in charge in the field have sufficient resources for their requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09043029000309"></a>With five minutes to go, it is difficult to cover all the issues. Some other equipment matters were raised. Noble Lords have discussed the wisdom or otherwise of aircraft carriers. Our problem with equipment is that we will always want the best of everything. The noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, talked about which fast jet we need. However, different vehicles have different attributes. We must ensure that we get the best value for money and work with partners where we can, and learn from the urgent operational requirements that sometimes getting something relatively simple and straightforward that we can build on later can be of great benefit even though that is not often how we do things.</p>

We are worried about this and seeking to make progress. We cannot allow a gap in our capabilities and are therefore exploring a number of options including the procurement or lease of additional C17s or C130Js, or extending the life of some of our C130Ks. The issue is causing concern, but will not be solved by this country alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09043029000311"></a>In the few minutes remaining, I will say a word about our Armed Forces and our work on the service command paper issues. I remind the House that this was a first: an unprecedented piece of cross-government work, bringing together all the issues affecting our service personnel. It is important to remember the two key principles upon which it was based. First, no disadvantage should flow from service in our Armed Forces. Secondly, in certain circumstances, it is right and proper for our Armed Forces to be treated in a special way, particularly when they have been injured in the course of duty.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09043029000312"></a>We are investing in a whole range of issues and working with other government departments and devolved Administrations. On accommodation, for example, the Chancellor announced last week that &#163;50 million will be brought forward to build new MoD houses to tackle the legacy of underinvestment in that area, which is important. The pay review board is out, and people will welcome that settlement. Health was mentioned today. The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, said that the Defence Medical Welfare Service was not well known. She makes it very well known on many occasions in these debates. Others have spoken of the fantastic service at Headley Court. It is significant that the chair of the Healthcare Commission said recently that there is absolutely no question that personnel injured in battle have a better chance of survival than ever before, and that this is entirely due to the efficient and innovative care delivered under exceptionally difficult circumstances.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09043029000313"></a>That is something that we should be and are doing&#151;as, indeed, we are doing more on mental health. It is important to recognise that the community-based veterans&#146; pilot health schemes are important and could show us the way forward. As with mental health generally, this has been a neglected area in the past and a great deal of attention has been paid to it since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09043029000314"></a>Lastly, on recognition, the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, mentioned the reception in the House of Lords and the fantastic response of colleagues, although she said that they were sometimes surprised. We have all welcomed the tremendous public turnout at the homecoming parades and civic receptions. That is a tangible expression of the public support and appreciation of our Armed Forces. We all have a responsibility to ensure that there is no dislocation and that the public understand that our Armed Forces are working in order to help and protect them. We also all have a responsibility to the families of our armed servicemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09043029000315"></a>I welcome a debate of this kind. It has been timely. In many ways, it has united this House in appreciation of and respect for the work of our Armed Forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09043029000317"></a>I am not surprised that a lot of people wanted to take part in the debate. That underlines our present deep concern. Many noble Lords have said that this was an appropriate time for this debate and have alluded to the events in Basra this morning, and the recent developments with the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement on Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Statement on the reserves referred to by my noble friend Lord Attlee. Against this background, I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, launched the theme of a need for a strategic defence review. That, in different forms with different words, was picked up widely around the House. There is now absolutely no question that we face a serious situation, undoubtedly made even more grave by the current financial position. However, as I said in my opening remarks, we went into this financial problem already in a difficult situation. The challenges are there.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09043029000318"></a>This debate was about our Armed Forces. Everybody has paid tribute to their courage, fortitude and achievements. In those circumstances, and in recognition of that, we owe it to them to ensure that the policies, provisions and the circumstances in which they operate are the very best that we can provide for them to do their outstanding work. Against that background, with great appreciation for all those who have taken part, I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09043029000320"></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, with your permission I will make a Statement about the civilian crisis in Sri Lanka. I returned this morning from a visit there with the French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner. I regret that the Sri Lankan authorities declined to allow our Swedish counterpart, Carl Bildt, to join us. Our visit to Sri Lanka was prompted by our increasing concern for civilians in the north of the country, particularly the plight of the civilian Tamil population. There are in fact two crises: that of the civilians trapped in the conflict zone as the Government enter the final stage of their fight with the LTTE terrorists, and that of the tens of thousands of civilians who have crossed over the front line in recent days.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09043029000321"></a>The purpose of the visit was twofold: first, to highlight the need to bring the conflict to an end in a way that minimises further civilian casualties; and, secondly, to press the need for a long-term political settlement that meets the aspirations of all communities in Sri Lanka. Foreign Minister Kouchner and I met  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_381"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 381</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>President Rajapakse, Foreign Minister Bogollagama, the leader of the Opposition and Tamil and Muslim mainstream politicians. I am grateful for the way the Sri Lankan Government facilitated our visit. We were briefed by the heads of the main UN agencies and the ICRC. We also visited a government-run camp for internally displaced people at Vavuniya and visited a field hospital donated by the French Government. I heard a number of personal testimonies from recent arrivals in the camp.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09043029000322"></a>The fog of war makes it difficult to be certain of the facts of the present situation. That is compounded by the lack of access for international agencies and the media. I heard widely different estimates of the number of civilians still trapped in the conflict zone. Government estimates ranged from 6,000 to 20,000; the UN, ICRC and most others reckon that there were at least 50,000, and some thought that the number could be as high as 100,000. Whatever the truth, it is clear that significant numbers remain, living under appalling conditions, undernourished and in fear for their lives. I heard reports of civilians hiding in trenches to escape the shelling and of horrific injuries. I also spoke to people in the IDP camps who recounted how the LTTE had forced them to stay in the so-called no-fire zone against their will, and shot at them when they tried to flee.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09043029000323"></a>We were told that 30 tonnes of food were delivered to the conflict zone between 1 April and 27 April, apparently enough to feed 60,000 people for just one day. A further ship delivered limited supplies during our visit. The ICRC has only been able to send in very limited medical supplies, despite having plentiful stocks in Sri Lanka. The block on deliveries of food and medical supplies hinges on security. To deliver these essentials to those innocent civilians trapped in the conflict zone, there needs to be safety. Ships take time to unload and the pauses provided by the Sri Lankan Government have not been long enough. As the House knows, the Government of Sri Lanka declared an end to combat operations on 27 April; the President and Defence Secretary confirmed that to me personally and in definite terms. Those commitments must be upheld.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09043029000324"></a>In our discussions with the President and the Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner and I made it clear that the protection of civilians must be paramount. We emphasised that if the LTTE had any heart at all, it would let the civilians leave the conflict zone. As G8 Foreign Ministers said in their statement of 25 April, we were very clear that the time for the conflict to end is now. We were briefed in detail by the Sri Lankan authorities on their humanitarian relief efforts outside the conflict zone. We welcomed that exchange of information, the extensive work that was under way and the commitments made. Nevertheless, some of what we were told contradicted the information given to us by the international humanitarian agencies.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09043029000325"></a>According to the UN, 161,765 Tamils have left the conflict zone since October last year, including 119,000 in the last 10 days. This is very welcome, but the numbers have seriously challenged the Sri Lankan authorities. The UN agencies were frustrated that the   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_382"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government appear to put unnecessary obstacles in the way of them and of others trying to assist the Government in dealing with this crisis. The agencies lack any access to IDPs until they have already been through a preliminary screening process, and do not have full access to the camps; visas and authorisations to move people and goods into and around the country are too limited. Meanwhile, people are not being allowed out of the camps and many families have been separated. Some men, alleged to be LTTE cadres, have been taken from families and placed in so-called rehabilitation camps. All of this reinforces the need for full and unhindered access by the UN and other agencies.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09043029000326"></a>We therefore returned again and again in our talks to five specific needs in respect of the humanitarian situation: first, for visas to be issued to international humanitarian staff swiftly; secondly, for travel permits for staff working on approved projects inside Sri Lanka; thirdly, for full access to IDPs as soon as they have crossed the front line and monitoring of all stages of screening; fourthly, for a proper resettlement programme with specific deadlines to fulfil the Government&#146;s commitment to 80 per cent of IDPs resettled by year&#146;s end; and, fifthly, to allow the distribution of sufficient food and medicine to meet the needs of civilians trapped in the conflict zone. We were promised intensive follow-up by the Sri Lankan Government and we will continue to engage with them on those issues.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09043029000327"></a>At present, the Sri Lankan Government are engaged in a war without witness in the north of the country. Civilians have fled the terror of the LTTE, but are afraid of what awaits them at the hands of the Government and unsure whether they will ever be allowed to return home. We were given assurances by the Sri Lankan Government that they had nothing to hide; we responded that it could therefore only be to their benefit to work with the international community in a fully transparent way. By giving UN agencies and international NGOs the freedom to operate to capacity in all areas, the Sri Lankan Government would bring much needed relief to many thousands of traumatised people, but also bring the confidence of the international community.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09043029000328"></a>My right honourable friend for Kilmarnock and Loudoun will be taking up the invitation of President Rajapakse to visit Sri Lanka as part of a cross-party group of MPs next week, and will pursue those five points. The other members of the group will be the right honourable Member for Gordon and the honourable Members for South Down, for Buckingham and for Glasgow Central. I share the gratitude of my right honourable friend for Kilmarnock and Loudoun that they have agreed to take part in this important visit. I will be visiting New York on 11 May and will pursue further UN involvement in the crisis. I will be discussing with Hillary Clinton and other like-minded colleagues how we can work more closely together to find a way to bring the fighting to a stop.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09043029000329"></a>I am grateful to all Members of the House who contributed to the debate yesterday. No one should underestimate the murderous damage done to Sri Lanka over the past 26 years by the LTTE, or the sheer hatred felt for its leadership. That is recognised   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_383"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 383</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the international community. But while terrorist organisations work by killing people, democratic Governments exist to protect them. That is why the fighting in Sri Lanka must end now. The LTTE is apparently cornered and trapped, having inflicted grievous suffering on the people of Sri Lanka, primarily Sinhalese and Tamil but also Muslims. How the conflict is ended will have a direct bearing on the prospects for long-term peace in the country. The Government must win the peace as well as win the war. That will be the continuing focus of this Government's activity, hand in hand with international partners, in the days and weeks ahead&#148;.</p>

The Conservative Benches share his deep concern about the desperate humanitarian crisis in northern Sri Lanka and the suffering of innocent civilians who have been trapped by the fighting. We reiterate his calls for a lasting ceasefire. It was surely right for the Foreign Secretary to travel to Sri Lanka with the French Foreign Minister. In the words of the Red Cross&#151;here I declare an interest as being a vice-president and a former working member for more than 30 years&#151;the situation in the north of the country is &#147;nothing short of catastrophic&#148;. Civilians trapped in the tiny enclave are desperately short of food, water and medical care and remain in the firing line. The United Nations estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the Government&#146;s offensive this year.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09043029000331"></a>I would like to raise three sets of questions relating to the Minister&#146;s three points on the humanitarian crisis, the efforts to secure a ceasefire and the long-term prospects for a political solution in Sri Lanka. We welcome the additional UK humanitarian aid for Sri Lanka that the Minister has outlined. According to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, at least 50,000 people are still trapped in the conflict zone, which has shrunk to less than 10 square kilometres. Is he fully satisfied that the Sri Lankan Government have heeded international calls to show the maximum possible restraint in their operations in the area?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09043029000332"></a>There seems to be some confusion regarding the use of heavy weapons by the government forces. Can the noble Lord assure the House that the Sri Lankan Government have heeded international calls to stop all use of heavy weapons in the fighting zone, and that it has been possible to verify this? For the record, is he confident, too, that no UK-supplied defence equipment or technology has been used in attacks on civilians during the conflict, and have efforts been made to ascertain this? Have the Sri Lankan Government agreed to permit aid convoys to reach the fighting zone by road, which we understand has not been possible since 20 January?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09043029000333"></a>We strongly support the UN Secretary-General&#146;s decision to dispatch a humanitarian team to the conflict zone, and support his call for the mission to be allowed into the area as soon as possible. Has that been  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_384"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 384</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>possible? Aid workers have told UNHCR that some of the people in the camps have not eaten for days, and cite growing problems of hunger, lack of transport to move the sick to hospitals and a shortage of medical personnel. Has the Foreign Secretary raised these issues with the government officials whom he met in Sri Lanka? Can the noble Lord update the House as regards the 13 UN staff members who have been prevented from leaving IDP camps despite repeated promises from the Government that they will be  released?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09043029000334"></a>My second set of questions concerns the efforts to secure a ceasefire. Does the noble Lord see a need for formal UN Security Council involvement&#151;for example, a UN resolution&#151;to persuade both sides to lay down arms? Earlier today, the Foreign Secretary said to my right honourable friend the shadow Foreign Secretary that he would speak to the US Secretary of State, Mrs Hillary Clinton, today. I wonder whether he has spoken to her yet and what the outcome of those discussions was. What discussions have the Foreign Secretary or the Prime Minister&#146;s envoy had with the Commonwealth about using that organisation&#146;s weight and influence to encourage Sri Lanka to ends its operations and bring about a long-term ceasefire, called for by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative and Human Rights Watch?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09043029000335"></a>Thirdly and finally, does the Minister agree that there can be no military solution to this conflict, and that the only way forward is a negotiated settlement that satisfies the concerns and legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans and preserves democracy in the country? What assurances has he received from the Sri Lankan Government about their commitment to such a political process? Has he received any indication from the Sri Lankan Government that they will be prepared to accept the UK&#146;s nominated special envoy? Are the Government confident that the envoy is able to make a meaningful contribution to resolving the conflict without acceptance by the Sri Lankan Government?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09043029000336"></a>The distinction between foreign and domestic policy has nowadays become blurred. A growing number of our citizens live simultaneously in many homelands. What happens in Sri Lanka yesterday may well have an impact on Britain today. This means that we have to take into account that our own domestic policy has to be foreign policy as well. Again, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. In the same spirit, I hope he will continue to keep the House informed through Oral and Written Statements.</p>

The Foreign Secretary&#146;s visit to Sri Lanka is very welcome, although I am sorry that the Swedish Foreign Minister was not given a visa. I am glad that it is to be followed up by the cross-party delegation of MPs, including my right honourable friend Malcolm Bruce, chair of the International Development Select Committee.</p>

Surely this is a case where the UN has a duty to protect. How, in practice, can this be carried through in such circumstances? What role can international humanitarian law play here? Both sides are accusing each other of atrocities. What independent investigation of possible atrocities might be undertaken and would the UK Government support it? Does the Minister agree that both sides should be warned that they are personally accountable in this area? What will be done to ensure that things do not now spiral into revenge killings?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09043029000339"></a>It is appalling that the UN humanitarian organisations and the media have been so restricted. As the noble Lord pointed out, it is surely in the interests of the Sri Lankan Government to allow them through, given the claims that they themselves have made. This is yet another conflict where accounts from one side simply do not tally with the other and we must rely on the neutrality of the UN and ICRC. Given what the Sri Lankan Government have said about a ceasefire, what plans are there for getting civilians out and aid in? The Tamil Tigers should immediately allow civilians to leave and cease forced recruitment. Civilians and fighters who agree to lay down their arms need strong international guarantees of their safety. Only international supervision, unhindered by the Government, can provide the necessary level of protection.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09043029000340"></a>Some have expressed a fear of genocide. Is Britain meeting all its obligations under the 1948 Convention on Genocide, given that these accusations have been made? The UN and the ICRC must become responsible for supervising all stages of the screening process when people enter and leave any IDP camps. This must be fully documented. We hear some very worrying stories. What will be done to ensure that people can then return home and that areas will not, for example, be designated as militarily sensitive zones, to which people cannot return?</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09043029000341"></a>As we look at points of pressure, what is happening to put pressure on the LTTE to let civilians go? What further pressure can be put on the Sri Lankan Government, who, as the noble Lord said, are not a terrorist group but a Government with particular responsibilities? What is the Government&#146;s position on Sri Lanka&#146;s request for a significant IMF loan? Surely Sri Lanka must first listen to the reasonable humanitarian requests of the international community.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09043029000342"></a>What discussions has the Minister had with other Governments to produce a package of other financial sanctions, such as the end to all non-emergency development aid, which might be imposed on the Government of Sri Lanka if they fail to listen, as has been suggested by the International Crisis Group and others? Beyond that, does he agree, as the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, said, that no lasting peace will be possible if the concerns of both communities are not addressed? What plans are there for full international engagement to ensure that a just peace follows the bloodshed of this period? Without that, Sri Lanka will continue to be extremely unstable, which is in no one&#146;s interests, from whichever community they come.</p>

I shall try to respond to the many questions they have posed with the caveat used by the Foreign Secretary of the &#147;fog of war&#148;. Frankly, much of the detail of this conflict, such as the number of casualties or whether war crimes have been committed, is very hard to establish at the moment. The international agencies, not having the degree of access that they might normally have in such a situation, are forced to make guesstimates and to acknowledge that on certain issues they do not have enough information on which to offer a judgment.</p>

<a name="90430-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09043029000344"></a>On the number of civilians still trapped in the conflict zone, although the Government believe that the number may be as low as some thousands, and perhaps up to 6,000, the United Nations believes that the figure is more than 50,000 and has said so publicly. There is no agreement even on the size of the remaining civilian problem. Certainly the Foreign Secretary and his French counterpart urged the maximum restraint on the Government of Sri Lanka and they have just announced that there would be an end to the use of heavy weapons. That issue came up in the two Foreign Secretaries&#146; meeting with the Sri Lankan defence minister, where it was observed that suspending the use of these weapons came as a surprise because people thought that they had already stopped using them. There is continued uncertainty about exactly the type of fighting that is going on. The Government insist that it is now in a last-phase operation and others allege that there is still very heavy fighting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09043029000345"></a>On the access of aid convoys by road and by sea, the two Foreign Secretaries insisted to the Government that there was now plenty of aid, both food and medical supplies, in the country and that the key issue is access&#151;the ability to deliver the aid. Not nearly enough food, medical supplies or indeed aid workers have been able to enter the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09043029000346"></a>I turn to whether British military assistance has been used in the conflict. As this conflict is not a new one, we have issued export licences for military equipment in a very limited and, I hope, judicious way. Although we have not investigated the matter, I very much hope that no such materiel has been used.</p>

At the previous one, Sri Lanka was raised under other business. He is determined that it should be raised. Sri Lanka itself is currently a member of CMAG, which is about the breakdown of democracy in terms of the Harare principles that it seeks to enforce. The case needs to be made about the grounds and terms on which this discussion can take place, but the Commonwealth secretary-general has been clear in condemning the

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09043029000349"></a>On the issue of there being no military solutions, we confirm that there needs to be a political process of reconciliation. We also need to be clear that this conflict has reached a point where one side has won in all but final name. Therefore, the conclusion of the fighting needs to be organised around that fact of life on the battlefield. We need to get an orderly end to the conflict followed by a process of political reconciliation and a meeting of the legitimate need for a say in their own government for the Tamil people. Otherwise, one can only fear that this conflict will resume in different, equally viral and pernicious forms in both Sri Lanka and abroad at a later date. We have been very clear that, while these two processes may be separate, there must be an end to the fighting and then a process of political reconciliation to address the roots of the conflict. The UK special envoy will be visiting next week as part of a parliamentary delegation. He has already been very active both internationally and with the Tamil community here in the UK, so we hope he is going to play an important part in the next steps of this process.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09043029000350"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that there is a clear UN duty to protect. It seems, in many ways, to meet the conditions of the responsibility to protect whereas the Government, because of the conflict, may not have properly met the need to protect their own civilian population. As always with a doctrine of international humanitarian law, the real issue is enforcement or implementation of that concept. The UN Secretary-General has been enormously active, as has his Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, in terms of seeking to secure entry to the conflict zones for a UN team to assess what is going on and, subsequently, to contribute to providing humanitarian assistance in that zone, arriving at a ceasefire, and improving the conditions and protection arrangements for civilians in the transit camps. The commitment that the UN Secretary-General thought he had for such a deployment has been challenged and delayed, so the UN is frustrated at not having more access at this time. It is seized with this and there have been urgent discussions in both New York and Colombo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09043029000351"></a>As to the role of the IMF loan, the preparations for that are continuing. It is due to be considered by the IMF board in the middle of the month and at that time it will be important to arrive at a view on it. Obviously, we have been trying to ensure that the IMF financing of countries caught up in the global economic crisis is done in as urgent and felicitous a way as possible, but we cannot look at this in isolation from the broader conflict currently underway in the country.</p>

If nothing else, it must have been a reality check for him. Does the Minister agree, however, that whatever way we look at it, the Tamil Tigers are a terrorist organisation?

Furthermore, the Tamil Tigers could have released all those people at any point but still today they refuse to let them go. Is it not a fact that the only people who have managed to escape have done so because of the smashing of the bund by the government forces ensured that refugees could come through? It is a war, not a conflict. It is a war that has gone on for 25 years and must be brought to an end when the Tamil Tigers either surrender or are eliminated.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09043029000353"></a>Turning to humanitarian matters, is it not time that the international community recognised that there are a quarter of a million refugees there in temporary camps who must be resettled? Should we in this country not now take a lead? Why could we not take a lead in restoring Kilinochchi, the provincial centre for Sri Lanka, and encourage others to join us so that we can resettle those poor people&#151;not just Tamil, not just Sinhalese, not just Muslims? There are nearly 250,000 in the current camps and 100,000 left over from the earlier stages of the war. If this country believes in its special relationship with Sri Lanka, can we not give a real lead? Although the &#163;2.5 million promised by the Prime Minister on Sunday is welcome, it is only a drop in the ocean. Should we not be talking about substantial sums to achieve the resettlement of those poor people?</p>

He said that plenty of evidence was confirmed to him directly in his interviews in the transit camp that he visited that people who had tried to escape had been shot at and, in many cases, killed. There is no condoning, excusing, apologising for or defending the behaviour of the LTTE. Given that, fortunately and to the great relief of everyone, the democratic Government of Sri Lanka have the upper hand and are on the verge of finishing this conflict, it is perfectly proper for us as allies of that Government to expect from them the standards of a democratic Government: that they allow access and ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches the victims of the conflict; and that, in their military operations, they act prudently to protect civilians&#151;on the simple principle, if no other, that two wrongs do not make a right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09043029000355"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion that we commit more resources for the resettlement of Tamils and others, I have no doubt that the time for that will come and that the UK will be a generous donor, but let me again say that at the moment the issue is not resources, which are available for this phase, but access for that humanitarian assistance which is in-country but cannot reach the victims. Most critical in future will be the willingness of the Government to live up to their pledge to resettle 80 per cent of those in camps by the end of this year. Then there will be something that we can support in long-term rehabilitation. At the moment, the people remain in camps.</p>

The last remaining young hunger striker today suspended his hunger strike and has been taken to hospital. More broadly, there has been a welcome by those outside to the visit of the Foreign Secretary and to the efforts of my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to address this issue and this crisis with the vigour that we have. We have sought to do what we think is proper in terms of the humanitarian case that we have made in Sri Lanka and what is proper in terms of British national interests. We have sought to communicate intensively with the British Tamils outside here in terms of those objectives. Equally, we have tried to take pains not to allow British policy to somehow be held hostage to these demonstrations. The critical thing has been to do what is right.</p>

I affirm what the right reverend Prelate says; the great majority of Sri Lankans do live in peace with each other, are proud of the tolerance that they show towards each other and are as concerned as any outsider about the loss of tolerance that has resulted from a brutal civil war that has sharpened and hardened what has been a very compassionate, tolerant and inter-ethnic understanding.</p>

It must not be assumed that because we draw attention to the undeniable fact that some patients are very badly treated and beg for deficiencies to be remedied we are condemning the whole NHS. We certainly are not. But there are thousands of cases where clear proof of bad, even inhumane, treatment has resulted in suffering and death. We have a duty to bring those cases to public attention and to try to put things right, which is appallingly difficult.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09043029000362"></a>Since 2002, I have been trying to ensure that hospital patients are routinely given food and water. In 2003, my Patients&#146; Protection Bill put forward some solutions; for instance, asking relatives and friends if they could come in and feed or give a drink to helpless patients, which is quite common practice in many European countries. That and other suggestions fell by the wayside. The Bill was allowed no further than Second Reading. Six long years later it is reported that patients in Stafford Hospital are so desperate to have a drink that they pull the flowers out of the vases and drink what is left. It is also reported that many have become severely dehydrated. I cannot bear to think of the suffering that they must have endured, nor that if warnings had been heeded and acted on, that suffering need never have happened.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09043029000363"></a>The past six years have made no difference for the patients who do not get fed either. Only last month, figures came out showing that almost 30,000 hospital meals are thrown away uneaten and untouched every day. Is that because they are inedible or because some are not fed to patients? Or is it because the plate was put too far away for the patient to reach and whipped away with no help offered in either reaching or feeding, which is extremely common? Some hospitals throw away more than one-third of prepared meals. Some are even worse: the Middlesbrough primary care trust threw away 43 per cent of all prepared meals. What a wicked waste.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09043029000364"></a>When asked about this, a health Minister in the other place blithely commented that no one should be concerned and that the situation merely reflects the need to give patients a choice. But I understand that those meals had already been ordered by the patients. They had made their choice. That excuse will not wash: figures released show that more than 8,000 people left hospital last year clinically malnourished. More than 240 people die in hospitals and care homes in England from malnutrition every year, which is truly shocking.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09043029000365"></a>It is very wrong that there are still instances of MRSA, C. difficile and<I></I>other killer bugs in our hospitals.  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_391"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Great efforts have been made to make the wards clean. Billions of extra pounds have been spent, but 24 trusts still fail basic hygiene tests. Wards are too crowded, with beds often packed tightly together. Nurses go out and about in the towns nearby, still wearing their uniforms. They pick up germs everywhere and go straight back to deal with patients in the same uniforms&#151;which matron would never have allowed. Some hospitals allow too many visitors.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09043029000366"></a>I am extremely concerned to have heard from several sources that the true numbers of deaths from these bugs are deliberately hidden and that death certificates often state the cause of death to be something other than MRSA et cetera. Trusts do not want the true cause known. No questions are asked if a person dies of pneumonia or a heart attack, but they do not want to let it get out that people are still dying of MRSA. Surely falsifying a death certificate is illegal.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09043029000367"></a>Replacing matrons with managers was a mistake. I am sure that many hospital managers could run businesses brilliantly. But a hospital is not a business. One needs to have some medical knowledge in the task. Managers are not matrons. The former cannot be expected to run a hospital as efficiently as the latter.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09043029000368"></a>I have raised other cases of bad treatment. For example, some patients are left in a cold ward with windows wide open and no warm coverings. Their deaf aids are taken or lost, which can make them seem confused and subnormal, and stricter discipline can be enforced. Ignoring repeated cries for help in getting to the bathroom is also common. A dossier of 25 cases, all of which I checked personally, was submitted to Ministers in this House. Those Ministers were helpful. They listened and the details were passed to the trusts concerned&#151;where they met a blank wall<b>.</b><b></b>The allegations were either ignored or denied. Some of them were not investigated at all. The only thing that came out of the exercise was the introduction of a mysterious thing called a red tray. No one explained what it was, how it was proposed to use it, or what instructions to staff went with it. The noble Baroness, Lady Wall, kindly told me of her own personal experience, but none of the officials explained. So we never got far with the dossier.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09043029000369"></a>The big question is whether this new body, the Care Quality Commission, will do better. Well, it is not exactly a new body, more a grouping together of three old bodies. The trouble is that, none of them, individually, has managed to right the wrongs that exist. In the introductory papers about the new body there is no admission whatever that there ever were any wrongs. The document says that the CQC will build on the good work of the existing commissions. That is the same old refusal to admit there is anything at all amiss&#151;no hint of acceptance that improvements are needed. Sack the whistleblower: ignore the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09043029000370"></a>Another quote from the document that the CQC put out says,</p>
<ul><a name="09043029000468"></a>&#147;our job is to make sure that providers continue to meet ... quality standards&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043029000443"></a>What does it mean &#147;continue&#148;? What quality are we talking about? It has not even started.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09043029000371"></a>The setting up of the CQC will hardly improve matters, since the lady named as chief executive is the very same person who was responsible for checking the standards of care at Stafford Hospital, to which I have already referred. That has a dreadful record. It is reported that hundreds died there needlessly because standards of healthcare were so bad. It is reported that the number was somewhere between 400 and 1,200. That does not sound as if her checking was up to much. Whatever excuses may be made, whatever denials or apologies, the Government cannot expect that this chief executive, with this record at Stafford Hospital, comes into her new job with any confident backing.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09043029000444"></a>That excellent organisation, Help the Aged, is currently campaigning for sick and elderly people in hospitals to be treated with dignity. It has my strong support, especially its demand for an end to mixed wards. There is no dignity, and small protection, for those finding themselves in the next bed to a stranger of the opposite sex at night, when there are not many staff about, and the ward is dark and undersupervised. Ministers seem to have given up on the problem. They say the sexes cannot be separated. Why not? They always were. Unless we are talking about intensive care and patients who are unconscious, mixed wards are an abomination.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09043029000445"></a>There is no dignity in being left to lie for hours in a soiled bed. On 31 March, the BBC reported the case of a pensioner who snatched her elderly husband from a Stevenage hospital. She was so upset at his bad treatment, including being left in a wet bed, that she resolved to take him away&#151;and she did. There was a row with the staff, who threatened her with the police. That should never have happened, but it has happened since. The staff have no right to threaten such people with police action and give them a police record. That is appalling. Since then, that lady&#146;s husband has been fine, much more comfortable and happy. I understand that following the programme, the BBC was deluged with listeners who knew from experience exactly why the wife was determined to take him. His was not an isolated case. I could mention other wrongs, but time is short and others wish to speak.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09043029000372"></a>How sad that, while medicine and pharmacology have made such enormous strides, the standards of care and respect for patients as human beings has declined almost past belief. Our brilliant surgeons can do heart, liver and kidney transplants&#151;soon they will be doing whole face transplants, apparently&#151;and our marvellous scientists can produce drugs that can combat almost every known disease. We have thousands of excellent nurses, but we can no longer ensure that people who go into hospital will receive the most basic care or keep their dignity. Does the Government&#146;s public health agenda include any resolve to tackle these problems?</p>

I often feel that I have to talk by myself on this subject and that people do not relate to me, but now I have the happy experience of being able to refer to an NHS document. I shall give the full title: <I>A Systematic Review of the Evidence Base for Developing a Physical Activity and Health Legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games</I>. What the document shows as you go through it is that there is a huge public health benefit to be derived from getting people to take exercise. That is not a revelation, but the fact is that we should exercise because it is one of the most effective forms of, let us say, self-maintenance.</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09043029000374"></a>The problem is that the Olympic Games have gone from being a dream to a cure-all in many fields. The document goes into how things should be implemented and lists local authorities, primary care trusts, schools, colleges and stakeholders. Later it mentions local government, LOCOG, national stakeholders and so on. Noble Lords will get the idea. I have spoken about the benefits of exercise before, which has produced interesting exchanges. I have often asked the noble Lord, Lord Davies, which department is responsible for increasing the take-up of exercise. He has responded by saying that it is the NHS or the Treasury. When I ask who will do it, one or other of those two departments will be quoted, but how do they work together and where is the guidance?</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09043029000375"></a>I suggest that in encouraging people to take exercise and play more sport, we should note the difference between what is exercise and what is sport. It is rather odd. Sport is something that you decide is a sport. Going for a run can be thought of as a sport, but people may regard it as a way of trying to keep their waistline down because the doctor told them to or they want to fit into last year&#146;s clothes. Is running a sport or is sport something that needs a different type of support structure?</p>

<a name="90430-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09043029000376"></a>Having indulged myself for a few minutes, I come to the essence of what I am trying to get at today. How are the Government going to support both the Olympic movement and other bodies that work with sports at the participation level, where we are not talking about elite athletes? How is the Department of Health encouraging people to get involved? For instance, is the department going to develop a policy of naming and shaming local authorities that do not provide sufficient parks in which to take a pleasant walk? That is basic exercise rather than playing a sport. A good walking strategy for each town centre should be provided because it certainly would cover an exercise agenda. Will we make sure that local authorities have to comply or, if they do not have to, will we shame them if they do not? Are we going to ensure that there is sufficient open space to walk dogs, for example? The great excuse for taking exercise in our society is walking dogs. In rural areas, will we ensure that all footpaths are open? Will this be monitored? Will this be driven forward? If the Department of Health is not doing it, who will do it? The big beasts of the departments are involved here. Sport lives in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, but I would have it transferred to the Department of Health. There is disagreement in my party about this, but I like to nail my colours to the mast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09043029000377"></a>The question here is how we will achieve this aim. The document about the Olympics gives examples of how it might be achieved. However, the fact that we have a huge event that people watch on television will not guarantee greater participation, although it may encourage it in a few areas. It became blindingly obvious to me when it was pointed out that it may encourage people to take sport more seriously and push on to the next level but it will not necessarily encourage people to take up sport. This may be because it is discouraging to see the world&#146;s best when you are wandering around without the basic skills.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09043029000378"></a>How will the Government tap in and allow greater participation? Will the Department of Health make sure that there is better funding for basic-level coaching? This could be about movement and the ability to participate in sport occasionally. If you occasionally play five-a-side football and keep yourself fit enough to do so, exercise and sport will combine.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09043029000379"></a>Do the Government have a definitive method for counting the increase in exercise? The same applies to interest in sport. If there was such a measure, at least we could tell whether we were succeeding or not. There is no guarantee. If the Government turn round and say, &#147;Our gains are more successful than anyone&#146;s in the past for increasing participation&#148;, we will have a good excuse for bringing to account the relevant Minister, because this is the first Olympics where the Government have said that this is one of their goals. We must have realistic, minimum targets.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09043029000380"></a>I now turn to a matter for which the Department of Health must bear sole responsibility: the provision of sport and exercise medicine. I asked about this a couple of weeks ago&#151;the exact date escapes me&#151;and the Minister pointed out that in 2005 the Government gave a commitment to provide enough consultants in sport and exercise medicine. The figures that I have are that there are eight trained individuals, whereas it is reckoned that we need 72 as a basic requirement. In the medical system, consultants are required to pass on information and to make sure that people have the necessary support.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09043029000381"></a>There is a movement to replace certain kinds of drug therapy with exercise therapy. That relates to the obesity strategy and so on, but I will not go into that. The noble Baroness can take as read my criticism of the body mass index as a guide to obesity. The index fails to take into account that someone may be heavier built and that muscle per volume is much heavier than fat. My favourite statistic relates to Pinsent and Redgrave. When they won their last medal, they were simply heavily overweight as opposed to obese. The body mass index is a blunt instrument, which does not apply to anybody who is taking exercise that allows an increase in muscle mass. People can get heavier and fitter. This kind of exercise does not apply to this chart.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09043029000382"></a>Why is it important that we have this extra guidance? One of the younger Members of this House&#151;he is not in his place&#151;who along with me is regularly required to compete with another place at various silly events, damaged his knee. It was a muscle tear&#151;nothing serious. The doctor told him not to exercise for six weeks. If you leave a muscle not working for six  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_395"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 395</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>weeks, it gets weaker, the tendons and ligaments around it are left in worse shape and, when you go back to using it, it is more likely to be damaged. That is a basic level of ignorance that is shocking in a doctor. How can we get people at the top who will ensure that when this occurs, if the doctor does not know what to do, he will consult on up&#151;or indeed sideways, for physiotherapists?</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09043029000383"></a>We need people in place. If we take into account that these doctors are necessary for the implementation of the strategy, what are we doing to make sure that they are there? We have provided the training posts&#151;usually by shifting funds around, or so I am told&#151;but we are not providing the consultancy posts. People have dropped out of the training because there is no end place for them. If you are a registrar and you want to train, you might think, &#147;I&#146;ll further my career&#151;oh, there&#146;s nowhere to go, so I&#146;ll stop doing the training&#148;. That is perfectly natural in that situation; I am sure that if any of us was in a similar one, we would do the same. What are we doing about this?</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09043029000384"></a>I see that my 10 minutes are up. I suggest to the Minister that we need answers on this. Without them, much of what the Government are doing here becomes simply meaningless.</p>

<a name="09043029000385"></a><b><a name="90430-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043029000662"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, for giving us the opportunity with this debate to raise issues of public health that are sometimes rather difficult to get into that context. I shall concentrate entirely on the issue of prison healthcare because although it is not currently in the public health agenda, I submit that it should be. Prison health is a public health issue.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09043029000386"></a>When I took over as Chief Inspector of Prisons in 1995, I was surprised to find that, in the whole of the United Kingdom, only prisons were not part of the NHS. Prisoners were in the NHS before they went into prison and when they left prison they went back into the NHS, but while they were in prison they disappeared from the NHS radar. Prison Service healthcare used to claim equivalence with the NHS for maintaining this, but how could that be when only 10 per cent of prison medical directors were qualified to act as GPs in the NHS?</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09043029000387"></a>There was no properly structured nursing force, particularly for psychiatric nursing, not least because there were no career opportunities for people to develop careers inside such a small organisation as prison healthcare. There were therefore far too many short-term agency nurses, employed at great expense, which did not contribute to consistency or continuity of improvement, if such a thing was possible. What is more, prison doctors did not have access to notes on people before they came into prison, nor did doctors, after someone had been released, have access to notes made in prison almost without going to the trouble of getting an affidavit.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09043029000388"></a>There were particular problems with the lack of professional oversight from all the NHS arrangements for such oversight that exist in hospitals and elsewhere. The only oversight was from my own inspectors, among   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_396"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 396</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whom I had a doctor and a nurse, but then we inspected only every five years. That was not good enough for overseeing the whole system.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09043029000389"></a>Why is this a public health issue? Because every single prisoner, with the exception of about 30, is going to come out. The physical and mental health of that person is therefore a matter of interest for the public among whom they are going to be released. They may have physical ailments that, unfortunately, flourish in the prison environment, such as varieties of TB and all the blood-transmitted viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. People age in prison; indeed, they age much more quickly in prison than they do outside. Children in prison can stay with their mothers until they reach the age of 18 months.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09043029000390"></a>Then, there are the dreadful mental health statistics, with at least 70 per cent of prisoners suffering an identifiable personality disorder and about 500 requiring transfer into secure mental health accommodation because their condition is such that prison is wholly inappropriate as a place to hold them. Thankfully, since 2004, prisons are part of the NHS and healthcare provision is offered by primary, secondary and mental healthcare trusts. This is not the place to comment on the patchy nature of that provision, particularly in mental health, but it is important to have an overall direction and strategy for how healthcare is delivered. There is a great danger that unless you have consistent oversight of what is done, particularly for those with mental health problems, they will come out of prison worse than they went in. That is avoidable and inexcusable.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09043029000391"></a>I say as an aside that I have always thought that one reason why prisons should be regionalised&#151;as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, recommended in his report following the Strangeways riots in 1990 and as picked up by the only White Paper on prisons, <I>Custody, Care and Justice</I><I>,</I> published in 1991&#151;is to avoid prisoners having to leave their own region. That would give regional NHS authorities an opportunity to have some control over what is done with and for their own people, whose treatment will be their responsibility on release. Prisoners should have a proper physical and mental health assessment when they enter prison and plans should be made to treat anything discovered while they are there, taking the opportunity of the sentence to make real progress. For people with mental health problems, that can include the development of a sustainable lifestyle with the clear understanding that what is established should be carried on elsewhere. This is where I believe that public health clicks in. It would be irresponsible to do less than I have outlined. It would be irresponsible to the public to whom the prisoner is returning.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09043029000392"></a>Today the Bradley review on diversion was published. It concentrates largely on people in prison who have mental health problems. It contains 82 recommendations, and the Government have announced that they accept all of them in principle. However, there is obviously work to be done. I was fortunate enough to speak to the noble Lord this morning but I have not yet read the report. I asked him particularly whether his report contains signposts suggesting that public health authorities need to get on to what he is proposing and make it their responsibility for carrying it out. He said that it  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_397"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 397</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does. One of the things that he has recommended is a national programming board with an advisory board to serve it. That national advisory board will not achieve anything unless there is a part of the NHS which is responsible and accountable for seeing that those recommendations are delivered.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09043029000393"></a>Prison healthcare is comparatively new to the NHS, and many different trusts are involved in contract work in different prisons, but what matters is that one part of the NHS should be responsible for overseeing the consistency of that treatment, wherever it is given. Oversight of the provision from these various trusts also is needed to ensure that every prisoner has the assessment needed to ensure that this opportunity is not missed. It makes absolute sense for public health authorities to be given that responsibility. I urge the Minister to pursue this matter with her department after this debate.</p>

<a name="09043029000394"></a><b><a name="90430-0011.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09043029000663"></a>The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, for her perceptive intuition in inspiring this debate at this crucial moment when the press is dominated by the possibility of a flu pandemic which would challenge considerably our public health agenda. I want in that context to draw attention to the Department for Communities and Local Government paper issued this week on <I>Faith Communities and Pandemic Flu</I>. I thank Monsignor John Devine and the Faith Communities Consultative Council for their input, and I stress the crucial importance of faith communities in any pandemic.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09043029000395"></a>I am very grateful for the measured government response to the current flu threat, both in calling for vigilance and in combating irrational panic. It is crucial that, should there be a pandemic, anyone infected stays at home. It is equally crucial that those not infected continue both to work and to support those who are ill. Basic respiratory and hand-hygiene standards, such as the use of tissues and careful hand washing, are key to our care for one another. That fits in closely with the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, about hygiene in hospital. It applies also to hygiene within our communities and would do so very particularly were there to be a pandemic.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09043029000396"></a>I also welcome and affirm the ethical framework of the DCLoG document: that in a pandemic all people matter equally. In that context, the prayer and worship of faith communities matters crucially. That would provide support for those who are ill and strength for those not infected to provide help for others. I particularly commend, from that document and elsewhere, the development of flu-friend networks which can be based in churches, mosques or other faith communities or elsewhere whereby there is organised provision to collect antivirals for vulnerable people. That is something that can be set up locally&#151;it must be set up locally; it cannot be set up in any other way&#151;and would provide a structure whereby help can be provided in the event of a pandemic.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09043029000397"></a>Imaginative ways of contacting people with prayer and support need to be developed locally, including internet prayers and phone numbers advertised alongside  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_398"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those provided through the NHS. It is also important that faith communities consider how to adapt their own ceremonies should a pandemic arise, such as, in the Christian community, the receiving of communion in bread alone without the use of a common cup during such a period.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09043029000398"></a>I remain haunted by that government assertion that everyone matters equally. There are many in this country for whom it does not feel like that. This Sunday, I shall be worshipping at St Hilda&#146;s, Cross Green, in Leeds, where there is a particular ministry to asylum seekers, some of whom are terrified by fear of the authorities. In a situation such as that of a pandemic, there will be a particular responsibility on faith communities both to affirm that ethical affirmation of DCLoG and to care for those who often feel themselves to be rejected by others.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09043029000399"></a>I also want to make a quite different contribution to this debate. If the threat of a pandemic is an immediate concern&#151;and it is, and the public health agenda needs to deal with it&#151;so there is the longer-term threat to our public health of alcohol abuse. How are the Government developing their policies to combat such abuse? In the city of Leeds alone, the cost to the local economy of alcohol-related harm is estimated at &#163;275 million a year. The cost to the NHS is vast. The cost to individuals, both temporary and long term, is encountered in damaged lives. I suggest that this is one of the most significant current threats to public health and that we have developed a culture of alcohol abuse that needs determined combating.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09043029000400"></a>I take noble Lords, as I have been, to the accident and emergency department of St James&#146;s Hospital in Leeds. A chaplain has been called to support a family where the grandfather has just died; a precious moment of farewell and commendation that we have all experienced in one way or another. It is Friday night, and this is the casualty unit in a large city, so that farewell takes place in the context of staff struggling in a battlefield, responding to the needs&#151;the genuine needs&#151;of intoxicated strangers. It is not a farewell that I would wish on anyone.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09043029000401"></a>Those who work as professionals in public health are in my experience convinced that action must be taken to limit easy access to cheap and destructive alcohol. The Government seem to have turned their back on Sir Liam Donaldson&#146;s call for significant price rises in this area, but it is not clear to me what other strategy will be able even to begin to deliver us from the human and financial costs being incurred. Responsible drinkers would be little affected by price changes. For those given to abuse, there needs to be a progressive impact to encourage a speedier return to personal health and stability. We have found ways&#151;we could probably find better ways&#151;of doing that for tobacco. Perhaps amendments to the Health Bill on Report will strengthen our response to that particular problem. There needs to be a similar strategy on alcohol.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09043029000402"></a>So much of the human tragedy in our society has alcohol abuse as an element within it, whether it is domestic violence; whether it is increasing numbers of people going to prison and therefore becoming subject to the issues that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_399"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has raised; whether it is to do with broken relationships, or with our ability to take that exercise that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, so ably advocates. There needs to be local work involving primary care trusts and faith communities. There also needs to be government action to promote behaviour that serves the community and to foster personal responsibility. The Government are rightly determined to do that in the case of a pandemic. I look forward to similar commitments on the much longer-term damage of alcohol abuse.</p>

I do not think that the debate was planned to take place in the very week when the world is plunged into the vital need of public health across the globe due to swine flu. It may be better referred to as Mexican flu, named after the country of origin, as were Spanish flu and Hong Kong flu. This is a complicated virus, containing pig, fowl and human viruses. The fight to control a flu pandemic will involve many professional bodies, and the public should be kept informed with the correct information and guidance to take the necessary precautions.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09043029000404"></a>Having visited Mexico some years ago and having succumbed to Montezuma&#146;s revenge, resulting in the most violent diarrh"a and sickness, I wonder whether Montezuma has done something to make this virus worse in Mexico. When I flew over Mexico City, there were miles of shanty town on the outskirts of the city and a cloud of pollution hung all around. Many of the so-called houses were tin shacks, and many people were living in poor conditions. Poor housing often contributes to poor health.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09043029000405"></a>The virus seems most complicated. I have a few questions for the Minister, as we did not have the planned Statement yesterday. Does the virus have a window of about three weeks when a person may be infected, but the test does not show positive? Does the manufacture of the quantities of vaccine needed not require thousands and thousands of eggs? Do we have enough eggs? Does Tamiflu have a sell-by date? If so, is our stockpile still in date?</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09043029000406"></a>The fourth report of the 2005-06 Session of the Science and Technology Committee, <I>Pandemic Influenza</I>, asked the Minister whether the Health Protection Agency, responsible for frontline management and the emergency strategy on the flu pandemic, will have enough funds and capacity as some of the agencies have been merged. Is it adequately equipped to manage if the pandemic spreads? Will there be enough testing capacity? Will more people be drafted in to help, and will funds be made available to cope? What are the plans for distribution of antivirals?</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09043029000407"></a>For some years, the World Health Organisation and our Chief Medical Officer have been telling us that there will be a flu pandemic. The world is now on full alert. The importance of public health and other organisations coming together and working for the good of society is absolutely vital. There must be good communication with the public and honest, transparent networking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09043029000408"></a>As a precursor to my Question on 13 May about the cases of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin&#151;PVL&#151;positive staphylococcus aureus, I am concerned that this public health matter which can come in from the community and affects young, fit people and children who pick it up from playgrounds, sports halls and military camps, can be missed through a lack of knowledge by GPs and hospital doctors. The symptoms are flu-like. The body&#146;s immune system packs up and white cells stop fighting. If not treated, victims can die in a few days. The last case that I heard about was that of a student from Harrow School a few weeks ago, who became very ill with PVL MSSA. This has been a serious problem in the USA. There needs to be very good surveillance and awareness, as there are so many different strains of MRSA. Another concern is that of pigs infecting humans in countries such as Holland. Does the Minister agree that there should be a close working relationship between veterinarians and microbiologists? There should also be close co-operation over the serious problem of variant CJD and blood safety.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09043029000409"></a>Public health is of huge importance in our prisons, as my noble friend has said. With conditions such as HIV and tuberculosis, prisoners need to be on courses of medication. There is no guarantee that they will continue treatment or seek medical care once they are released into the community, especially if they are homeless and have multiple diagnoses. Prisons have different systems that do not communicate with each other, making it difficult to establish an offender&#146;s medical history. Only a few prisons use online systems. On a recent visit to Pentonville prison, which has a high incidence of tuberculosis, it was good to meet a dedicated nurse specialising in TB, who works between prisons. She told us that multidrug-resistant TB was a great concern. With the homelessness and chaotic lifestyle that many prisoners have on discharge, that is a serious public health risk. Drug and alcohol misuse is also a huge problem. When asked how the prison contains an infection outbreak, they recommended that screening within 24 hours of arrival is crucial to safeguarding the prison against the spread of infection.</p>

<a name="90430-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09043029000410"></a>For many years, I have felt that there should be a good, all-round health education in all of our schools. Children should learn that healthy eating and exercise will give them the best chance in life. They should learn about the dangers of type 2 diabetes and how to avoid it, about the result on their health if they smoke, and about sexually transmitted diseases and substance misuse. There should be more testing in the community for conditions such as venous thromboembolism, or VTE, which accounts for more than 25,000 deaths in England alone, and for so many others which, if detected in time, will save people from having long-term conditions as well as from dying early. Prevention of illness is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09043029000411"></a>I shall end on a positive note. On Tuesday, I went to an exhibition at the Design Centre, &#147;Design Bugs Out&#148;. The Design Council, the Department of Health and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency brought designers together with clinical specialists, patients and front-line staff to test an innovative approach to

They should be congratulated on that excellent initiative. There was equipment there such as bedside cabinets, a commode with rounded edges and disposable pan, a patient bedside system, a patient&#146;s chair and a porter&#146;s chair&#151;all with curved, smooth edges&#151;an intelligent mattress with an inbuilt early warning system, which allows soiled mattresses to be identified and replaced as soon as they become contaminated. There was also equipment for doctors and nurses, such as blood pressure cuffs and a cannula time tracker. All were easy to clean, to help overcome health-associated infections such as MRSA and C. difficile. This is to promote good clinical care. Equipment is likely to be cleaned properly if it is easy to clean. This exhibition will be taken around the country and I hope that orders will be placed.</p>

The question asked by my noble friend Lord Addington on sport and health prompted me to think that, if you were to ask three different government Ministers what a boxing match was, you would get three different answers. The Department of Justice would say that it is a means of reducing youth offending; the DCMS would probably describe it as a noble art; and the Department of Health would point out its potential for causing sub-cranial neurological trauma and consequently the necessity for it to have a risk management programme attached to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09043029000415"></a>A few weeks ago, a fast-food chain announced that it would create 6,000 jobs. At the same time my colleagues on Leeds City Council explained that they were going to make about 300 staff redundant. When they were challenged on the &#147;PM&#148; programme, they explained that a number of their sources of funding and revenue from central government had been cut but that they were also suffering other losses of income, including loss of revenue from their swimming pools because people cannot afford to use them. That is a deeply depressing symptom of a recession, but I want to stress the importance of the public health agenda now and in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09043029000416"></a>The Faculty of Public Health defines public health as:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09043029000459"></a>&#147;The science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through organised efforts of society&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000446"></a>To that one can add that the politics of it all is about providing the means to do so. At times of economic recession, it is easy to see public health as a soft target and an easy place in which to make cuts. However, I want to try to persuade the Minister that to do so   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_402"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 402</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be false economy. I do not want to repeat at length the details of the Budget. I am sure that noble Lords will have absorbed all that for themselves by now. However, I should point out that for the next two financial years Department of Health funding will stay broadly the same. People in the NHS have breathed a sigh of relief about that. However, we should encourage them to see those two years as a very short window of time within which they, as health professionals, should work with the Government to reorient the NHS to be a major bedrock of public health development. If they do not, in about four or five years&#146; time we will be left with the remnants of a health service that may well have been fit for purpose in times of affluence but is not so in times of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09043029000417"></a>In February 2009 the Health Select Committee in another place produced a fascinating report on health inequalities. It is a fair report and acknowledges that the Government have attempted to tackle health inequalities, have bravely set themselves demanding public health targets and have targeted resources at areas of deprivation. However, one of the most striking and compelling points made by the committee is that there is a lack of evidence with which to judge the effectiveness of the programmes that have been funded and their cost-effectiveness. The report says that, all too often, the Government rush in with insufficient thought and do not collect adequate data from the beginning. Frequently, objectives are unclear and policies are changed or implemented with such short timescales that meaningful evidence cannot be gathered.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09043029000418"></a>If anything, the Health Select Committee understated the case. The ability to evaluate public health interventions and the lack of an evidence base for doing so not only affects the NHS and other government departments but hampers the work of the voluntary sector. I point out to noble Lords that the great bulk of public health and preventive work is carried out not by the NHS, or even by the state, but by charities and the voluntary sector. Their work is also seriously impeded by the lack of an evidence base.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09043029000419"></a>Politicians of all parties are under no illusions whatsoever that, in future, public services will be under increased pressure. There will be an imperative to make sure that funding of services goes to the most efficient and effective. I particularly ask whether the Government agree with the Health Select Committee that Professor Sir Michael Marmot&#146;s forthcoming review of health inequalities is an ideal opportunity to introduce new evaluation methods that are ethical and economical. Do the Government also accept that Sir Michael&#146;s review should include work on inequalities in secondary care and, therefore, should review the payment-by-results framework?</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09043029000420"></a>The Government have done a tremendous amount of work on such matters as coronary heart disease and cancer. Not to acknowledge that would be churlish. We need from that work the evaluation data that enables us to see how the NHS can become more productive in future. My noble friend was right: the majority of work on public health is not done by the NHS at all; it is done by other government departments. The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health recently stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09043029000460"></a>&#147;Communities, neighbourhoods and cities that ensure access to basic goods, that are socially cohesive, that are designed to promote good physical and psychological well-being, and that are protective of the natural environment are essential for health equity&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000421"></a>Social reformers since the 19th century have been trying to persuade Governments of just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09043029000422"></a>My colleagues in another place, Vince Cable and Nick Clegg, have stated repeatedly that a key part of our economic recovery will be investment in green technology and in such matters as environmentally sustainable housing. If there is to be a silver lining&#151;and I am not Pollyanna, by any means&#151;it will be that Governments rise to the challenge of making radical changes to the planning system and infrastructure development to bring about communities that have better health outcomes and reduce health inequalities.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09043029000423"></a>In the short time available, I will mention one further matter. The Healthcare Commission, under the leadership of Anna Walker, ceased to be at the end of March. Its final report was on mental health and older people. It is an excellent report, which I commend to the House. I mention it because it is a public health matter to which very little attention is paid. As with other services, there is a lack of data, but the Healthcare Commission found in its research that, for older people, access to mental health services&#151;and particularly to crisis and emergency mental health services&#151;is wholly inadequate, just because those people are aged 65 and over. In times of recession, it is understandable that Governments put the bulk of their resources towards those members of the community who are most economically active, such as younger adults. However, older people are the biggest users of public services. I hope that the noble Baroness will encourage the department to look at the report&#146;s recommendations, which are not really for large-scale further public funding. They are for better data and systems, so that existing services can be made better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09043029000424"></a>In 2004, Derek Wanless pointed out in his report on the National Health Service that, for the health of the nation to be drastically improved, public health and the awareness of individuals about what they could do to lead healthy lifestyles would be important. Five years on from that and standing as we are on the brink of a recession, it is even more important that his message about the priority of public health should be taken up by the Government.</p>

I am grateful to her for giving us the opportunity to debate it because, far-reaching as it is, public health is an area of policy that tends to receive less than its fair share of discussion in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09043029000426"></a>When defining &#147;public health&#148; to myself, I tend to go back to the words quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. Those words originated with the former Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, who, I remind the House, spoke of public health as,</p>
<ul><a name="09043029000469"></a>&#147;the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organised efforts ... of society&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_404"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09043029000447"></a>That definition has been tweaked by the present Chief Medical Officer, who has brought in the more current subject headings of health inequalities, clinical governance and the management of risk. The distinguishing feature of public health is surely that it relates to initiatives that reach across populations and groups as opposed to the curative treatment of individuals. One could range far and wide to topics such as housing and education, even taxation, and still not stray off the subject of public health, but I should like to focus today on issues that fall directly within the Minister&#146;s purview and on one in particular about which we have heard this afternoon: health inequalities.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09043029000427"></a>If we seek to identify improvements in public health over the past 20 years, we can point to a number of successes. On what might be called the big ticket issues, life expectancy across the population is improving and infant mortality is falling. The rate of improvement is not as great as it is in some other western countries, but it is still an improvement. Among the major targets in public health policy, we can look with some satisfaction at the trends in smoking prevalence and the consumption of salt in the diet where, taking the bald averages, both are both going down.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09043029000428"></a>However, there are other areas of public health where success has been more elusive. Sexual health is one, dental health is another and the one about which we hear quite a lot, obesity, is proving a very difficult nut to crack. The evidence on these three areas is that they are much more of a problem among lower socio-economic groups. That is the reason why part of the Government&#146;s public health strategy has been to target specific areas of health inequality&#151;that is to say, disease areas that affect certain subsets of the community most damagingly.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09043029000429"></a>Health inequalities are a stark measure of a Government&#146;s success in delivering good public health, so it is welcome that the Health Select Committee in another place has recently subjected this aspect of the topic to close scrutiny. Its report makes fascinating and sometimes depressing reading. Over the past 10 years, health inequalities have in fact widened, not only between the rich and the less well-off but also between the population as a whole and other sectors of the community who are seen as being harder to reach: ethnic minorities, those with mental health problems and the elderly. To call the Government&#146;s record a failure because of the widening gap in inequalities would perhaps be overly harsh, because it is a tough test, but unfortunately the charge of failure begins to stick when we look at the committee&#146;s findings elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09043029000430"></a>The committee&#146;s most damning criticism relates to the Government&#146;s whole approach to policy in this area. I would describe it as a lack of intellectual rigour. It is a story of eye-catching initiatives which are poorly designed and rushed into being without proper baseline information or clear objectives. Evaluation of these initiatives too often consists of simply examining the processes that have taken place and asking people what they thought of them. To compound the sin, there has been short-termism&#151;changes of direction and a failure to maintain policy long enough to know whether it has worked. The net result, in the words of one witness, has been that,</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_405"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09043029000470"></a>&#147;we have wasted huge opportunities to learn&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043029000448"></a>Indeed, large amounts of money have been poured into initiatives such as health action zones, healthy towns, healthy schools and the expert patient programme. What we get at the end of them is a series of inputs, throughputs and customer satisfaction measures. None of them has produced results that tell us what we need to know, which is what interventions actually work. Professor Ken Judge of the University of Bath put it quite brutally when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09043029000461"></a>&#147;We end up with rich descriptions of what people are trying to do. These ... are then used as evidence of good practice because we do not have anything else and we slide inexorably from setting these things up essentially to the production of propaganda&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000449"></a>The committee was uncompromising in its conclusions. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09043029000462"></a>&#147;Such wanton large-scale experimentation is unethical, and needs to be superseded by a more rigorous culture of piloting, evaluating and using the results to inform policy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043029000450"></a>Of course, much of the public health agenda is delivered locally through PCTs, but here again there is cause for concern. The committee found that strategic health authorities and PCTs are not providing satisfactory leadership in public health. The number of senior public health specialists is falling. We have seen funds for public health siphoned off into other areas during times of budgetary pressure. My own view is that we need to look again at the idea of ring-fencing a goodly portion of the public health budget to prevent the same thing from happening again.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09043029000431"></a>More than that, when tackling health inequalities, there is a perception that many PCTs are simply unsure of how to spend their funding allocations to the best effect. If that is true, it again reflects poorly on the quality of leadership, not least national leadership. There is a drive by the Government to improve access to GP services, which is welcome. Equally welcome is the intention to rebalance the QOF towards public health goals. But other things have suffered. I am thinking particularly of early years intervention with mothers and young families, where the scope to combat health inequalities is considerable; yet the number of health visitors and midwives&#151;the very professionals best placed to deliver help&#151;has also been falling. NHS dentistry has been one of the Government&#146;s stated priorities; yet, again, reality belies the rhetoric. Access to NHS dentists has gone down since the introduction of the new contract. None of this is exactly a story of stunning success.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09043029000432"></a>Central to much of the effort in this area are health promotion campaigns. We have seen a succession of such campaigns over the years, a lot of them related to healthy eating. On the plus side, there is evidence that some of the key messages are getting through. As a nation we are eating more fruit and veg than we used to and taking more exercise. Our intake of alcohol is going down. But the key issue here is not the averages; it is whether enough of the right people are permanently changing their behaviour. The Minister will be aware that the King&#146;s Fund has levelled some serious criticisms on exactly this point. It and others have stressed that one-off advertising campaigns cannot hope to change   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_406"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deep-rooted attitudes and behaviour. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister how the latest TV campaign, &#147;Change4Life&#148;, hopes to overcome that criticism.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09043029000433"></a>The rise in obesity continues, as does widespread alcohol abuse among teenagers. More than two-thirds of adults still do not know what exercise they should be doing, what amounts of alcohol are unsafe and even what a portion or fruit and veg consists of. If we are aiming to create, in the words of the Secretary of State, &#147;a lifestyle revolution&#148;, what can make us confident of doing that? In the final analysis, if we cannot improve public health, we will not be able to afford the NHS. That is why this debate is vital and why, in one form or another, we shall return to it over the months and years ahead.</p>

I congratulate her and other noble Lords on an interesting debate. She has drawn attention to issues of which the NHS is aware and is acting on, from matrons to the organisation of wards and infection control, which are of course of great importance.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09043036000002"></a>I do not accept the failures in regulation alleged by the noble Baroness, given that in the past there was virtually no accountability for doctors and other medical professions at local level, which is why we have focused during the past 10 years on giving our regulators a wide range of toughened enforcement powers and have enabled the new commission to take direct and independent action against service providers that fail to meet essential levels of safety and quality which people are entitled to expect.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09043036000003"></a>I entirely agree with the noble Baroness that we need to deal with mixed-sex wards. The Government have never denied that. The Secretary of State announced in January a six-month drive to eliminate mixed-sex wards in hospitals. Three cornerstones underpin the programme: a &#163;100 million privacy and dignity fund; improvement teams established to help those hospitals with challenges in this area; and working to establish financial covers in the context of the contracting framework between PCTs and hospital trusts.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09043036000004"></a>The Government&#146;s approach to public health cannot be described simply by a list of initiatives. It is about how we deploy our health resources and the leadership that we provide in this area. Our leadership is a response to our passionate belief that good health is a shared priority from the bottom to the top of the nation. Our starting point was that in 1999, only 1.8 per cent of total health expenditure went on prevention and public health. We now spend more than 3.6 per cent&#151;double that spent 10 years ago.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09043036000005"></a>Not everyone sees that as a good thing. Earlier this year, my right honourable friend Dawn Primarolo, the Minister for Public Health, pointed out that there is a school of thought that there is no such thing as public health. According to that view, any intervention in public health and any act to give individuals or groups support, guidance or safeguards is somehow an attack on their liberty. She rejected that argument, and so do  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_407"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I. Choice and control can be an illusion when you are very poor and in ill health. For those living in such communities, it is practical, tailored, focused support that makes the difference. That is our aim. For example, the health of communities collaborative programme is working in 28 sites among the most disadvantaged communities to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer and cardiovascular disease and to encourage people who may have those symptoms to seek help early. It is a community-based approach to public health that can be tremendously successful.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09043036000006"></a>We believe that we have come a long way towards our aim to provide services that reflect changes in people's lifestyle, habit, environment and society. We believe that our campaigns are now much more sophisticated than they were in their targeting and their understanding of people's motivation to change. For example, the smoking campaigns funded by the Department of Health have been widely acclaimed by marketing experts in both the public and private sectors. However, as noble Lords have mentioned, those campaigns cannot work on their own. That is why Change4Life is rooted in research about people's behaviour and how they change their lives. It tells people how they can make positive changes as well as warning of the dangers of obesity. Clearly it is up to individuals what they eat, drink or smoke. It is not the Government&#146;s intention to intervene unnecessarily or stand at their shoulder in the kitchen, as it were.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09043036000007"></a>Our sexual health campaign has generated almost 1 million visits to the Condom Essential Wear website. More than half of 16 to 24-year-olds say that they are more likely to have a check up for a sexually transmitted infection as a result of seeing the advertising. We have already heard from the public and the media of lives saved following our stroke awareness publicity. Some may remember that I described FAST in your Lordships&#146; House, with visual aids. One clinician in Kent has reported seeing around 200 patients as a result of the campaign&#146;s message. We estimate that the new cervical cancer vaccine will save the lives of up to 400 women a year.</p>

<a name="90430-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09043036000008"></a>There are other campaigns aimed at informing, supporting and empowering individuals and families to make healthy choices. These include seasonal flu immunisation, pandemic flu preparedness&#151;I will refer to that again in a moment&#151;stroke awareness, sexual health, HIV and having an NHS life check. All our major campaigns are evidence-based and subject to evaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09043036000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, raised the issue of sporting and physical activity. Change4Life, launched in January 2009, focuses on pregnant women, parents of babies and toddlers and parents of pre-school and primary school children. In future years, we will see the development of programmes targeted at young people and adults. For example, &#163;140 million was invested in our free swimming programme. The walking your way to health scheme, led by the Department of Health, Natural England and the British Heart Foundation, delivers nearly 2,000 walks to more than 30,000 people each week. We are determined that as part of our legacy for the Olympic Games, 2 million adults should be more active in 2012. This will include active travel, dance, gardening, and active conservation.

The Department of Health, for whose activities I am partly responsible for, has its part to play, as do all the other departments mentioned by the noble Lord. He also mentioned the sports and exercise consultants. We had an exchange about the importance of the provision of sufficiently qualified medical experts for the Games and about establishing consultants and medical facilities as part of the legacy of the Games.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09043036000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, made an eloquent comment about health in prisons. Like him, I am looking forward to reading the report of my noble friend Lord Bradley. I know that the Government will look very carefully at his recommendations. The challenge that we have&#151;the noble Lord will be only too aware of this&#151;is that, since 2006, all prison health services have been transferred to the NHS; we are mainstreaming their services. Therefore, our target is that prisoners receive the same standard of healthcare as we would expect in the rest of the community. However, we know that that is easier to say than deliver. Indeed, there is a great deal more to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09043036000014"></a>I thank the right reverend Prelate for being so on message about the Government&#146;s work in these uncertain times of the threatened pandemic. I take on board his comments about the need to be aware of the challenges of the asylum-seeking communities and other communities at this time of uncertainty. I also thank him for his support for our forthcoming debate on point of sale for tobacco. We take very seriously the issues of alcohol raised by the right reverend Prelate. There is good evidence that cheap alcohol is linked to people drinking more and subsequent harm to their health. It is important that any Government intervene to reduce harm without, as the right reverend Prelate said, unduly impacting on the majority of responsible drinkers. We are looking to develop the evidence base on that issue.</p>

Every resilient forum in England has validated pandemic-specific plans, which were outlined by my noble friend on Tuesday in the Statement and yesterday in answer to a Parliamentary Question. I will not go into a great deal

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09043036000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, made a very good point about how we will use the next two years, and about the importance of investment in the public health agenda. We are considering the Marmot review and taking it very seriously. I agree with her that the Healthcare Commission&#146;s final report was very important. I undertake to follow this through and to make sure that it is given proper consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09043036000017"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised a variety of issues about healthcare, public health targets and the various programmes that we are undertaking. The health and equalities targets were deliberately set to be ambitious and some progress has been made, although there is a great deal more to be done. We believe that there is a lot of headroom within the system for improvement. Our focus now is to provide tailored, intensive support to deal with issues such as high infant mortality, new GP practices in the most deprived areas, additional support for the early presentation of cancer and CVD, the take-up of vascular checks in disadvantaged areas and programmes to support communities, such as the improvement development agencies, healthy communities and communities for health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09043036000018"></a>One of the noble Earl&#146;s colleagues in another place criticised Change4Life as a campaign that was an attack on the video games industry. Would the Conservatives spend more or less than Labour on public health information campaigns and do they support the Change4Life campaign, or does the noble Earl agree with his honourable friend that this is just a campaign against video games and that they are bad for you?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09043036000019"></a>Finally, some time ago my right honourable friend Alan Johnson, the Secretary of State for Health, said that we are committed to examining what the future of public health policy should look like. We have a good record of success. We continually try to improve. Throughout my response I have highlighted some obvious examples of how we are making a difference to people&#146;s health and well-being. We are investing in health; we are concerned about what health means and what public health is all about. I am grateful that we are able to continue this shared debate and look forward to hearing from colleagues in the future about this matter.</p>

There are doubts in many places about that matter. The House was most interested to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. From his great experience he made a strong case for some fundamental changes in the way that sick prisoners are treated and under whose ambit they should come. I hope that his remarks will be taken on board, because they were thoughtful. Springing as they did from experience, they were worthy of great concentration and thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09043036000022"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds drew attention to something that no one has mentioned until now: the work and the willingness of faith groups. That is an important point that we often miss. I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the amount of good will and good intentions to help difficult areas in the health service. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, talked not only about the pandemic but about the education that was necessary. I thought that that was a different and important point in the area of healthcare.</p>

I hope that we shall not be put off in the way that we have been in the past by saying that mixed wards have changed. At one point the Minister told me that 92 per cent or 93 per cent of all patients were not in mixed wards. I found out that the truth was that they were not in mixed wards because the name of the ward had been changed to an assessment ward. So one could say that they were not in mixed wards, but the wards were mixed: men and women were there together. They were not intensive care wards.</p>

I am happy to report that there is common agreement on this across the Committee: between us and the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09043036000029"></a>The purpose of Amendment 1 is to increase the minimum period of cohabitation required before cohabitants without children will be able to make a claim for a financial settlement order. A discretion to waive the qualifying period is dealt with by Amendment 4. As noble Lords know, the Bill is designed to protect cohabitants who demonstrate a certain level of commitment and likely interdependency. Where existing law recognises the rights and responsibilities of those living together, a minimum period of time is usually required before cohabitation is established. Schemes in other countries take this approach and it reflects the proposals made by the Law Commission. It also avoids the use of less definitive eligibility criteria which may cause uncertainty and complexity, and does not open the floodgates to people in very short-term relationships.</p>

My understanding is that Amendment 1, grouped with Amendment 4 in the name of the noble Lord and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is tabled in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, then myself, and then the noble Lord. I do not know whether the noble Lord has spoken to the Lord Chairman, but for some inexplicable reason the noble Lord has been asked to move it. Would it not have been right for the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, to move it, since her name appears first on the Marshalled List, followed by mine, then his, and lastly that of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss?</p>

However, having begun to explain the main purposes of the amendment, and as the controller of the Bill, I would have thought that this was always what we wished to do. I would have thought that it would be more efficient and less wasteful of time if I completed my speech. If the noble Lord feels hurt by that, the last thing that I would want to do is to cause such hurt, and I shall sit down. However, in terms of understanding our purpose and for the debate, it would be more courteous to the Committee if I spoke. If the noble Lord, Lord Henley, disagrees, I shall sit down. Does he disagree?</p>

I can only speak for myself, but I am sure that we will leave the noble Lord to explain this amendment and in due course we will speak to it. We shall also speak to his Amendment 4 which is grouped with it, and about which we have some considerable concern. No doubt the Government will respond in due course. We will then have to work through all the other amendments on this Thursday evening and see how we get on with the Bill. I shall leave the noble Lord to speak, but it would have been polite of him, to say the least, if he had spoken beforehand either to myself or the noble Baroness, Lady Deech.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_412"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 412</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Committee who support the amendment to speak. We can then deal with the later amendments as speedily as possible.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09043036000034"></a>I think I have explained that the Law Commission has suggested that a period of two to five years would be appropriate. A five-year period would protect those in longer-term relationships, and it is arguable that there is more likely to be a financial imbalance in such a relationship. There are arguments in favour of the two-year period because there can still be significant unfairness and hardship where people have lived together for less than five years. We would support this amendment, but alongside Amendment 4 which provides a discretion to waive the five-year qualifying period in cases of exceptional hardship.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09043036000035"></a>It is important to be clear that the Bill also protects cohabitants with children. Under the Bill, a child&#146;s primary carer can apply for financial support whether or not they have lived with the child&#146;s other parent for five years. That is vital for the following reasons. First, the number of people cohabiting is continuing to increase, as is the number of children being born to cohabiting couples. Cohabiting is now the fastest-growing family type, and by the second quarter of 2008 the proportion of dependent children living with cohabiting couples had increased to 13 per cent from 8 per cent in the same period during 1997.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09043036000036"></a>Secondly, the existence of children makes it more likely that one partner will suffer the economic disadvantage if he or she is the primary carer of the children. The current law affecting cohabiting couples takes no account of their relationship and does not aim to achieve a fair outcome between former partners. The vast majority of unmarried primary carer parents cannot secure provision for childcare costs from the child&#146;s other parent to enable them to work. Thirdly, children&#146;s financial wellbeing is dependent on that of their parents. The risk of poverty is exacerbated for children of separated cohabitants because of the current lack of financial protection for dependent partners.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="09043036000037"></a>So, that is why we originally put in the two years. We seek to increase it to five years because we are very anxious that this Bill should be as cost-effective as possible and there should not be any unnecessary public expenditure incurred. We well understand the Government&#146;s dilemma because of the current economic recession. That is why, subject to the discretion in the other amendment with which this is grouped, we are strongly in favour of adopting a more conservative approach of extending the period from two years to five years with the discretion. I beg to move.</p>

I have tabled this amendment and many others in order to reduce litigation. This is for the sake of our daughters, and sometimes our sons, and for the sake of our grandchildren and their stability. This is against the background of the bitterness always engendered in family proceedings between two people who once had a good relationship. It is against a background of an industry of mediators who may not have had as much success as was promised 10 years  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_413"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ago, and against a background highlighted again only today in newspapers that fathers simply will not pay for their children. We know about the organisations that fathers support and the inexplicable refusal of men to take care of the families that they have left behind and the inability of the state to get that money out of them. We have to be realistic.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09043036000039"></a>I speak to this amendment also against the background of the change, only this week, of family proceedings being heard in open court. The details that come up later on in the Bill, those in Clause 9&#151;indeed, the whole situation&#151;will be heard in open court. The judges may throw out the journalists, but every couple caught up in this situation will have to say to themselves that the details of their commitment, the details of their relationship or non-relationship, may be all over the press. They will have to recite all of that in front of a courtroom full of journalists. I also say this against the background of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the right to respect for private life, and the fact that we all have a human right to follow a path of relationships that suits us. This is sometimes outside the law. There is no disapproval of that. If we wish to stay outside the law and to have a private life, we have that human right.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="09043036000040"></a>Professor Stephen Cretney, former Law Commissioner with responsibility for family law some years ago, brought his mind to bear on this situation, in particular the length of time as set out in this amendment. He said that his approach was strongly influenced by the belief that litigation in the context of intimate relationships is very frequently if not always destructive. Of course it is right to provide a remedy for injustice, but care must be taken that the cure is not provided at too great a cost. I do not believe that it is the function of the legal system to provide a remedy for every situation in which someone could plausibly argue that he or she has suffered loss. Certainly, the legal system should not provide an opportunity for what can easily become a form of harassment. That is the problem with both the amendments in this group. The question is not so much whether in the end a claim would succeed but whether it could plausibly be put forward, and the cost is financial and emotional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09043036000041"></a>Surrounded as I am by noble and learned Lords, I still feel that I should point out that the cases that appear in court are only the tip of the iceberg. The power of the Bill, were it to be passed, would lie in the possibility of one of two people who had spent a short time together being able to say to the other, &#147;Unless you pay me x, I am going to court&#148;. Those are the negotiations and the blackmail that the judges will not see, in the end. No doubt they will make sensible decisions in court, but they will not see what is going on beneath the surface and how this could be used as a weapon and a threat.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09043036000042"></a>It will emerge in discussion about later amendments that there is already an amplitude of law to meet the needs of a former cohabitant who falls on hard times. Schedule 1 to the Children Act exists and is underused. The only gap I have been able to find is the example of a polygamous wife who never really got married in this country and who has no children. It has been argued  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_414"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in this House that there is no help for such a woman. Only the other day, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said in response to an Oral Question that this nation does not approve of polygamous marriages. I would find it hard to believe that the House would pass a Bill that would have the effect only of supporting this narrow range of women who may have believed themselves to be married but in fact were married polygamously and left destitute.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="09043036000043"></a>It is right that the number of years goes up to five. In fact, had I thought about it longer, I might have said 10. Only 5 per cent of cohabitation lasts more than 10 years. Too often, to open the floodgates at two years, or even five, would have the bad effects that I have mentioned, quite apart from the ill effects of cohabitation law in general.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09043036000044"></a>There are two groups of cohabitants, research shows us. There are young couples, often just beginning their working lives and not committed. Over half the cohabitants in recent years until 2007 were under 35. They are capable of sorting out their own affairs, they are unsure about commitment and we should not penalise them for trying out a relationship. The other half are older and perhaps underprivileged. They will be hallmarked by children, early breakdown and lack of resources, and there is no point in passing a law to effect the transfer of resources where there are none and where people will end up living on social security.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="09043036000045"></a>This is not the Law Commission Bill. I remind your Lordships that the Law Commission report did not, as in this clause, suggest automatic eligibility just because two people lived together; there needed to be evidence of qualifying contributions, and long cohabitation, however long, was insufficient. The Law Commission wanted a situation quite different from marriage. In fact, the problem with this clause is that if it is amended, the period will not even be five years because periods of separation will be allowed to count. If a couple live together for a year, separate for a year and come back together, that will still count. Indeed, in the Bill as it stands, almost any short period of cohabitation will be enough to send the deserted cohabitant to a lawyer or Citizens Advice to start a period of argument and hassle that can ill be afforded in this era of economic downturn. We must take account of how this will affect potential litigants as they separate. Many of the qualifications are impossible, such as the nature of commitment, but we will come on to that. This is an attempt to get some sort of cohabitation law on to the books in a way that will set back the cause of working women by many decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09043036000046"></a>A period of two years would have promoted a walkout at one year and 11 months. I fear that a period of five years will stimulate men into walking out after four years. If, heaven forfend, the next amendment were to be passed, it would mean a complete collapse in stability because a man might well know, given the publicity that would no doubt attend this, that any short period of living with a woman may well lead to a claim for money. What we all want is stability for our children and grandchildren. Giving these rights promotes instability, as much research shows. In other words, it will be detrimental to children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09043036000047"></a>The median duration of cohabitations now is just under two years. Less than one-fifth survive five years. Many go on to get married. These figures were given by Ermisch and Francesconi in 2000 and in the Cabinet Office&#146;s own paper by the Strategy Unit in December 2008 called, <I>Families in Britain</I>. The Office for National Statistics says that a first cohabitation lasts for 39 months. That is the mean length. In other words, anything less than five years would be wrong and too short in my opinion.</p>

<a name="90430-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09043036000048"></a>In the end, it is not a good idea to encourage cohabitation, let alone when it is followed by break-up. A great deal has been written about high rates of abuse by men living with women who have children who are not his. The Law Commission said that it did not want to entertain trivial or farfetched claims. I fear very much that the amendments in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, which cover anyone who had lived together for the shortest possible period, will certainly open the door to farfetched claims.</p>

I am not sure that it has ranged wider than Amendments 1 and 4. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has been here for some time; it is not unusual for that to happen on the first amendment to a Bill as we clear the air before getting on to the issues. I am sure that every word that the noble Baroness has said on Amendments 1 and 4 has been on the subject. No doubt every word she still has to say will be on the subject, and no doubt others will want to speak.</p>

I wish to explain that by saying some of these things now we will save time on later amendments. In essence I want to say that five years is quite short enough and that Amendment 4 would simply open the door to litigation as soon as two people had lived together. We must realise that cohabitation tends to be a very short event, followed by marriage or separation. There are likely to be children with older couples who are already taken care of under Schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09043036000053"></a>Amendment 4 is in the same group, but it is fundamentally different. It undermines the period of five years. It virtually sweeps that aside and says that for any two people who claim to have lived together for only a short period&#151;note that there is no definition of living together, as the Bill does not even refer to living together in one household&#151;one of them could go to court and say, &#147;Well, this is an exceptional case and I want this right&#148;. It would extend the possibilities of harassment and blackmail as pointed out by Professor Cretney. Indeed, any cohabitants excluded under any definition will complain. Amendment 4 might provide something for polygamous wives; though very many of them will be taken care of by the provisions that already exist to give financial provision for &#147;wives&#148; of void marriages. It is not the policy of this country to provide for such situations and there will be extra, expensive litigation over whether or not this new clause, were Amendment 4 to be passed, should apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09043036000054"></a>To conclude on this point, most commentators on this have pointed to a 10-year period as the right one. The public, when surveyed, think there is such a thing as common-law marriage. However, when questioned in more detail, it is only when you get to a 10-year period that the public think that there should be rights. When the period of cohabitation in the scenario put to the public is reduced to two years, only 38 per cent of respondents think that a cohabitant should have a right to financial provision on separation. I support this amendment, but would extend the period to five years. However, I put it to the Committee that Amendment 4 is extremely dangerous and expensive in time, in stress, in legal aid and in private funds.</p>

I support it because it makes a bad Bill a slightly less bad Bill, but I certainly do not support Amendment 4, to which we will come later, which seems to undermine the very purpose behind Amendment 1. I also have to say that I am now in a state of slightly greater confusion on the whole matter of that period of two years or five years. I always thought it would cause problems and therefore create work for the lawyers&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, always denied&#151;because there is always the problem of defining when that period of two years started. Did it start with this one-night stand, as it were, or that one-night stand, or whatever? Does it start when the toothbrush moves into what becomes the joint home? We all know what these things are like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09043036000056"></a>I am now told that it is not just a continuous period of two years or five years; it can be a whole series of a week here, a week there, a week whenever; so we have even greater evidential problems of defining how and when that two or five-year period lasts. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Lester, who seems to have grabbed this group of amendments, will, when he comes to respond, let us know something about those evidential problems of defining the two years and the five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09043036000057"></a>I move on to Amendment 4. I shall try to be brief, bearing in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, had to say. As I said, I believe this undermines what the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and I are trying to do in Amendment 1, and therefore, I will oppose the amendment. I appreciate that the two amendments are grouped and they appear together in the groupings, but I will just remind the noble Lord, Lord Lester, of the mantra that is attached to the list of groupings produced every day by those who serve us in this House. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09043036000144"></a>&#147;Although every effort is made to secure agreement to these groupings, they remain informal and not binding. It is therefore open to any Peer to speak to an amendment in its place on the Marshalled List&#148;.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09043036000058"></a>Therefore, I will&#151;along, I presume, with the noble Lord, Lord Lester&#151;support Amendment 1, because I think it will improve the Bill. However, when it comes to Amendment 4, I certainly will not support that amendment and I do not feel that I am bound by the groupings to accept it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="09043036000072"></a>Children are obviously born to those who cohabit as well as to those who marry and they generally suffer when parents part. There is a group of women&#151;and, occasionally, men&#151;who are left, usually by the man, with children and no maintenance or other support. These women find that they have no right to the house, because it is in the man&#146;s name. There is a major  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_419"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>problem for the state as well as for the children and their carer, because the state picks up the bill where the man should. He should pick up the bill not only for the children, which certainly comes under the Children Act 1989 and subsequent legislation, but also for the mother&#151;or, occasionally, father&#151;of the children who is left to look after them; he should pick up the bill not only for maintenance but, at least, for a roof over their heads while the children are young.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="09043036000073"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has made the point that Schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989 appears to provide for the carer of children as well as the children. However, that must be read subject to Section 8 of the Child Support Act 1991, which does not permit a court to deal with maintenance for the benefit of children where the respondent to the application earns less than &#163;104,000. That is not the group of families with which the Bill is concerned. There has been the occasional case where money has been paid. A Sudanese woman wanted to see her child in the Sudan and got her air fare. However, actual maintenance for the woman for the benefit of the children where the man has only modest means is not met by Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act. I respectfully disagree with the distinguished and learned academic the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, but my experience as a former judge and, much more important, that of family barristers and solicitors is that this schedule is scarcely used and has scarcely been of any effect. The Bill would cover that problem. It would take the children off the state, which is one of the most important things.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="09043036000074"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, spoke of the importance of there not being litigation and said that the Bill would promote it. A later group of amendments to the Bill deals with alternative dispute resolution. The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, as the promoter of the Bill, supported by me and those behind us&#151;the Resolution Foundation and the Family Law Bar Association&#151;think that ADR is extremely important. The draft rules for family proceedings have family dispute resolution. You would not be able to take advantage of that unless we had ADR in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="09043036000075"></a>The suggestion that being in open court will cause a flood of the public is, if I may say so, pitching it a bit high. The public are not entitled to be in the court, only the press. I cannot believe that the press will attend every county court case, which is where those cases will be heard before circuit or district judges. There will be no publicity, because the rules put forward by the president of the Family Division in his recent practice direction say that the press can say nothing that is not approved by the judge; one of the most important points that you cannot have will be the names of the family. If the Bill goes through, it will get the benefit of that practice direction and, whatever blackmail there might be behind the scenes, it will not be on publicity. I must ask the noble Baroness: what sort of blackmail goes on by the men? Women suffer from blackmail as much as men. I do not see these as the floodgates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="09043036000076"></a>Another point in Clause 8, to which we will come and which is not in dispute, shows that the woman will only get enough money for her &#147;reasonable needs&#148;, not a footballer&#146;s girlfriend&#146;s bonanza. It will be for a

A better approach would be to seek to correct the mistaken perception, rather than to change the law to match the mistake. We also believe that the approach adopted by the Bill would generate large-scale litigation, with a vastly increased burden on the parties, the Legal Aid Fund and judicial resources.</p>

I find this inexplicable. The purpose of my set of amendments is to extend whatever law we end up with to those who are in family relationships. There is no definition of cohabitants contained here. Sexual relationship is presumably not necessary, or fidelity or any particular relationship save an assertion that two people are cohabitants. It seems to me wrong to omit from any benefits that might flow from this the elderly daughter who has looked after a father for many decades, or two sisters who have cared for each other and shared a home. Indeed, to omit those who are within the prohibited degrees piles discrimination on discrimination. Our human rights say that there should be no distinction drawn in law in the rights offered thereby depending on marital status. To deny any of the benefits of this Bill to, say, a brother and sister living together seems to me to discriminate against them, and I cannot see why this should be. The point about prohibited degrees is to prevent people from forming a sexual relationship that is unhealthy and bad for children genetically, but it has nothing to do with the financial support that one person may demand from another, or, much more importantly, what the situation might be on death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="09043036000087"></a>I have spoken before in this House, as have others, about the two sisters, the Misses Burden, who are in their 80s and have lived together and shared a house throughout their entire lives. They have argued repeatedly, including in front of the European Court of Human Rights, that they should have the benefits that married couples and civil partners have, particularly on death, and that they should be allowed to postpone inheritance tax when one of them dies so that the survivor does not have to find a sum&#151;&#163;60,000 in this case&#151;which would probably mean that the house would have to be sold and the remaining sister would become a burden on the state. There is agreement around this House that this should not be the case.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_422"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="09043036000088"></a>This House has tried before, during the passage of the Civil Partnership Bill in 2004, to include people who are within the prohibited degrees in some of the tax benefits that are given to others. The proposal was passed but fell later on the ground that that Act was not the place to do it. This Bill therefore seems to be the place to do it. We all have a great concern for the burdens shouldered by carers, who are often close family members within the prohibited degrees. They could not marry or enter into a civil partnership, will not be deemed to be cohabitants and will get none of the benefits, such as they are, in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="09043036000089"></a>By debating cohabitation, this House shows that it supports unions and commitment and that it thinks that support should be given to cohabitants who have fallen out. Surely it must be the same for&#151;let us imagine&#151;two sisters who have expressed fidelity to each other, supported each other and become dependent on each other. Article 14 says precisely that there should be no distinction based on birth or other status. I have mentioned it before. In the case of two family members, the length of commitment goes on until death. It has never ended; there is no question about it. One needs to avoid upsetting them and making them feel bitter and resentful because benefits are given to cohabitants.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="09043036000090"></a>I simply cannot understand why the possibility&#151;not even the existence&#151;of a sexual union is of such importance. It is very odd indeed that only a sexual union should attract the benefits of the Bill. The Government took down the barriers between marriage and other forms of association by giving advantages to civil partners of the same sex. Now that that barrier has been taken down, there is no logical case for not including in the Bill two family members, such as two sisters or a father and daughter. Of course, what they get will be at the discretion of the court. It has nothing to do with anything unpleasant, which is what prohibited degrees are normally associated with, but it is discriminatory to deny relief to two people whose companionship has lasted for decades.</p>

<a name="90430-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="09043036000091"></a>To illustrate the discrimination that arises from the Bill, imagine three sisters. One is very pretty and lives with a footballer for a while. One marries a vicar and their union lasts for many years. She works extremely hard, but they have no money. The third sister never marries and looks after her elderly father for decades. Under the existing law and the Bill, we will end up with a situation where the vicar&#146;s wife, on divorce, will probably get nothing because there is nothing to go around. The lady who lives with a footballer for a while will get a great deal. I do not believe that reasonable needs are treated meanly by the family courts. There is the recent, extreme, example of Sir Paul McCartney&#146;s wife, whose reasonable needs were estimated at &#163;28 million. The courts have full discretion. We do not know at all how that will come out. The ones who get the benefits are the ones who find rich men. That is what is so upsetting and why family members should be included.</p>

The House of Lords has made it clear that the phrase

The words &#147;reasonable needs&#148;, which used to be the law between husbands and wives, is no longer the law between them. That is why the phrase is in the Bill. It takes us back to a situation where a moderate sum is paid, not a footballer&#146;s wife large sum. They come under House of Lords decisions, which are a completely different state of law.</p>

There is no telling what those reasonable needs will be. Two sisters or a father and daughter cannot, of course, take advantage of Schedule 1 to the Children Act, which allows for support for the mother of a child. If there is anything wrong with it, it could be amended, but it would be a pity when all that is necessary is a small amendment to Schedule 1 to bring in this whole panoply of cohabitation law, which as it stands will simply lead to family members, such as sisters, who have lived together feeling hard done by because their contribution is not recognised. I see no reason why they should not be included. Later I hope to speak to an amendment about inheritance tax, but for now I think that family members should be included.</p>

I do not for a moment suggest that we should create a loophole whereby any two family members can use this to avoid inheritance tax. The Committee will know of the much debated and much discussed case of the Burden sisters. That is the one situation which I have in mind. I also cannot see the logic of knocking out prohibited degrees of relationships at this stage. We are not talking about people forming a sexual relationship; we are simply talking about a situation in which two, possibly elderly, members of one family live together. They alone will be excluded from the benefits now given to divorcing couples and civil partners.</p>

In the end, the reason why we decided to limit the scope of the Bill as we have to cohabiting couples in a sexual relationship was because we realised that if we tried to widen the Bill to cover siblings and carers of all kinds, it would be inconceivable that any Government, including a future Conservative Government, if there were one, would ever accept such a measure. We remembered Rab Butler's famous reference to politics being &#147;the art of the possible&#148;. There is no fundamental difference in principle about the need to do something for people like the Burden sisters. Of course, they lost their case in Strasbourg, where the court said that there was no obligation to deal with the difference of treatment from which they suffered.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="09043036000099"></a>I apologise for referring to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, incorrectly as &#147;Viscount&#148;. I meant no disrespect at all, rather the contrary. The noble Lord will remember that we have been here before. During the passage of the Civil Partnership Bill, an attempt was made to widen it beyond civil partnerships to all carers, a topic which was put again and again by those who sought to oppose or wreck the Bill. The Government firmly resisted that. I should be interested to know whether that would be the position today, although I know the Government have reservations about the Bill as a whole.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="09043036000100"></a>We have been very careful about how the Bill is now framed and the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has not complained about this on any earlier amendments. The Long Title makes it very clear what the Bill is about. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09043036000146"></a>&#147;Provide certain protections for persons who live together as a couple or have lived together as a couple.</p>

<p><a name="09043036000136"></a>Clause 1(1)(a) says,</p>
<ul><a name="09043036000149"></a>&#147;in the event of their ceasing to live together as a couple&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09043036000137"></a>and in the definition of &#147;cohabitant&#148;, Clause 2(1)(a) says,</p>
<ul><a name="09043036000150"></a>&#147;live together as a couple&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043036000138"></a>So the scheme of the Bill is that there is a sexual relationship between a cohabiting couple. The condition in Clause 2(3)(b), which the noble Baroness wishes to delete, is that the cohabitees,</p>
<ul><a name="09043036000151"></a>&#147;are not within prohibited degrees of relationship in relation to each other&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043036000139"></a>In other words, although the Bill is dealing with a cohabiting couple, what is being proposed is what in marriage would be regarded as incest. I know that is not the noble Baroness&#146;s proposal but that is what it comes to. We have been extremely careful to make sure that the only people who can benefit from the Bill are those who are not in prohibited relationships in the same way as would apply to marriage.</p>

This definition is not in the Bill; it is novel and I do not think that all of us would assume that living as a couple entails a sexual relationship. What about two people aged 90 in an old-age home&#151;where, no doubt, all of us will find ourselves one day&#151;who decide to share a home with a

I do not think there is any requirement in this Bill for a sexual relationship and we cannot presume that it is there or that it should not be.</p>

<a name="09043036000102"></a><b><a name="90430-0015.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09043036000242"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, should do justice to herself. She knows perfectly well that the reason why she is seeking to delete the paragraph on prohibited relationships is because she wishes it not to be confined to a sexual relationship. She is under no doubt that the Bill is dealing with a couple living together in a sexual relationship. If that were not clear, we could make it absolutely clear later in the passage of the Bill. She is seeking to apply it to brothers and sisters and everybody else implied by &#147;within prohibited degrees&#148; because she wants to do justice to the Burden sisters and to carers generally. She also wants to deal with inheritance tax. She does not want to abolish inheritance tax; she wants to treat a cohabiting couple in a non-sexual relationship in the same way as a married couple, but giving a discretion instead of a right, so that when, let us say, the man dies and the wife&#151;or in this case the cohabitee&#151;would normally be liable for inheritance tax, that can be postponed. I understand why she is doing that but it is wholly outside the scope of what is in intended and would kill the Bill. Since I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, is an enemy of the Bill, I suspect that is her true object, but I strongly oppose the amendment for the reasons I have just summarised. It would not be possible for any Government, including a Conservative Government, to approve a Bill of this nature, dealing with it in this way. I hope to hear from the Minister on that point.</p>

I assure the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, that I also remember the Civil Partnership Bill on which my noble friend Lady Wilcox spoke for our party. That was a government Bill, which seemed appropriate for a matter of this sort, and we explored&#151;although I do not think at any stage we voted on&#151;the question of what, for reasons of simplicity, we will refer to as the case of the Burden sisters and others. I would not suggest pressing this amendment to a Division at this stage, partly because, although I am speaking from the Front Bench, I am not speaking for our party, as we do not do that on Private Members&#146; Bills. I am responding for myself and I imagine most right-minded people in the Conservative Party would agree with me, but I have no idea what any future Conservative Government are likely to do in relation to a Bill of the sort that the noble Lord has put before us.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="09043036000104"></a>What I know is that most of us would think that a matter of this sort is more appropriately dealt with by a government Bill, as was the Civil Partnership Act 2004. It might be that this Government, in their dying days, if they can find nothing else to do, will bring forward such a Bill and we could have some fun discussing it.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="09043036000105"></a>At this stage on a Thursday evening to be discussing matters of this sort when we have another 30 or 40 amendments and we are quite obviously not going to finish the Bill seems pointless. All I can say is that I  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_426"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 426</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have extraordinary sympathy for the amendment; that is why I added my name to it. It is right that one should do something to help with inheritance tax or other matters relating to financial support those who are living together but are not necessarily cohabiting in the noble Lord&#146;s sense of the word. I therefore support the noble Baroness on her amendment; it may not be the right amendment to divide on, but there may be other amendments later on which we want to divide, because there are major financial implications. At this stage, we would all be very grateful if the noble Lord, Lord Brett, could explain to the House what those are and give the Government&#146;s view, because this is one amendment&#151;there will be others&#151;on which the view of the Government is very important.</p>

I first declare an interest as counsel for the Burden sisters in their own successful claim in the European Court of Human Rights. Some counsel invariably convince themselves, if not the court, of the justice of every cause that they are advancing. I am not in that category, but I share the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, that the Burden sisters and others like them are unjustifiably discriminated against by the state in being denied similar tax and other benefits to cohabiting partners who are not related. I very much hope that the Government will listen to the repeated concerns expressed by the noble Baroness and others that a step should be taken to amend inheritance law to remedy the injustice to the Burden sisters and others in their circumstances.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="09043036000107"></a>However, the Bill is not an appropriate vehicle to secure that aim. The Bill is intended to remedy a specific social mischief. To expand its aims would inevitably make it even less likely that it will be  enacted.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said, I should like to think that the Government will look at the matter, because there is a manifest injustice to the people involved, but it is not appropriate that it should be in the Bill. The Bill is intended to deal with men and women and single-sex couples living in a relationship which has some analogy with marriage. It is a relationship, whether it is sexual or not, which is treated as a couple in a way that two sisters or father and daughter are not so treated or so understood in ordinary language. I hope that the noble Baroness would not feel it necessary to press the amendment for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has already given.</p>

The way it has just been put by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is the correct way of putting it, which is that it is in many respects analogous to marriage.

These linked amendments effectively include Amendment 26, which also was spoken to. These amendments change the conditions that must be met for the Bill&#146;s provisions to apply. The requirement to live as a couple remains, but the requirement that couple should not be within prohibited degrees of relationship is removed. This, as has been said, would appear to mean that, for example, a brother and sister could live together as a &#147;couple&#148; and be considered &#147;cohabitants&#148; within the meaning of the Bill, so that the provisions of the Bill would apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="09043036000113"></a>That would seem to me to raise at least several major issues, not the least of which is the difference between family members&#151;brothers and sisters&#151;and those who are married or in civil partnerships. The latter have made a formal public commitment with legal consequences, while brothers and sisters and other family members simply have not. Also, the families about which the noble Baroness and others have spoken may be the kind of families that are totally at one in understanding outcome and outlook and that never have even have a tiff. However, that is not necessarily the situation in all families in the United Kingdom. It is quite possible to have someone living together as sisters or brothers, or a mixture of both, that fall out violently. The consequence of this, if it were to be enacted, would be the possibility of litigation once they have ceased to live together. The Committee will therefore understand why the Government are not supportive of these amendments.</p>

As the Committee knows, in 2006 Scotland introduced provisions similar to those recommended in the Law Commission report. We wish to learn and assess from its experience before we move down that track in any way. The noble Lord, Lord Henley&#151;a near neighbour of mine in the beautiful county of Cumbria&#151;and I are both quite proud of the size and quality of the chickens that we have in

One of the striking features about the Bill&#146;s drafting is that it is retrospective in looking at cohabitation that occurred before the commencement date while at the same time ignoring agreements that might have been made before the commencement date. It seems to me not right that the law should apply to two people who started to live together before the Act, especially as they will have made no formal commitment, as the Minister has just pointed out. That is the whole trouble with the Bill. People who have deliberately avoided making a commitment are to have a law placed upon them. Yet, at the same time, in English law, when adult married couples make a prenuptial or post-nuptial agreement it is largely ignored by the court. It is an extraordinary situation.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="09043036000117"></a>Certainly, the law should not be retrospective. The retrospective application of the law is nearly always against the rule of law. This goes back into history. Citizens should know, in advance, before they take any action, what law will be applied to what they are doing. In the past, people will have entered cohabitation in the belief that it is a private affair between the two of them. They chose it deliberately because there would be no consequences. To come along at this stage and catch that previous cohabitation seems very unfair and contrary to what we normally understand the reach of the law to be. Blackstone and the Athenians were against retrospectivity. Allah is said to have been against retrospectivity. He allegedly said, &#147;We never punish humankind before I have sent in a messenger&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="09043036000118"></a>This amendment will prevent the clause operating at a time prior to the enactment of the Bill, which would therefore cut down that which I fear&#151;namely harassment, blackmail and threats of litigation. It seems to me that the legal consequences of actions taken in the past should be determined by whatever law applied then and not be subject to law which was not discoverable at the time. After all, even in the case of Sir Fred Goodwin, did we not all cry out in outrage at the thought that something might be taken from him retrospectively? European law says that a,</p>
<ul><a name="09043036000152"></a>&#147;state cannot retrospectively remove a right without a transitional period&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90430-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="09043036000119"></a>We should be careful throughout this Bill to make sure that there is no counting of previous cohabitation and that where we are counting a two-year period, beyond which one would not be able to bring an

It is extremely important that if a Bill like this is passed, people should get the maximum publicity and should know what they are letting themselves in for. We should not open the floodgates.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="09043036000120"></a>When I taught at Oxford University, I used to warn my male students that if they ever lived with a girl they should be very careful not to say anything like, &#147;Come and live with me. You will be safe. All this will be yours&#148;. That was because they would launch themselves into an estoppel or constructive trust situation. I must have produced a generation of very silent lovers, but I did at least warn them. It is extremely important in this situation to know what you are doing and that extremely informal arrangements of the past should not be, as people would see it, penalised. I am very concerned about the shortage of legal aid for cases like this.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="09043036000121"></a>In recent months, the Family Law Bar Association and others have protested vigorously that some of the most serious cases we face of vulnerable battered women and babies are not getting proper legal attention because the family legal aid bill is being cut by &#163;6 million. I cannot find it just that we should open a door to cases between cohabitants who in the past had no idea that this would happen while at the same time cutting legal aid for genuine physically dangerous situations that exist now.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="09043036000122"></a>This Bill needs publicity and needs to allow people to think about what they are doing. That is the purpose of this amendment, which I hope the Committee will support. I beg to move.</p>

I shall be very interested to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has to say on this in due course. I imagine that, as a good lawyer and a good human rights lawyer, he will be opposed to retrospection as much as we are. When the noble Lord comes to reply, perhaps he could also deal with the points I asked earlier on the commencement of the two or five years. I still think that it is a difficult evidential problem that will create a lot of joy for the lawyers and which we would like to have dealt with before we see the departure of this Bill.</p>

If we make this provision as from the date when the Bill becomes law, they will have to wait another five years before they and their children, who may by then be grown up, get any help of the kind that I hope the Bill could give.</p>

<a name="90430-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="09043036000126"></a>It is intended that the Bill should be retrospective because it is there to help that comparatively small but significant group of vulnerable people, mainly women. A large number of battered women are cohabitants. They need not only injunctions on non-molestation orders but financial support. One without the other does not go far. So the legal aid that was being given, if it is given, to the battered woman would not be a great extension for her to obtain a certain amount of money to help her bring up the children.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90430-0016.htm"/>


<a name="90430-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="09043036000127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, made a point about the law. Under Clause 8,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09043036000153"></a>&#147;The court may make a financial settlement order if ... having regard to all the circumstances, the court considers that it is just and equitable to make an order&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043036000140"></a>Having been a judge, I declare my interest. If we are talking about a woman having a series of one-night stands, with the toothbrush moving from one place to another, she would not receive any money. That is the short answer to the point of the toothbrush. In addition, judges are perfectly accustomed to dealing with commencement dates and final dates of relationships; they have had to do it for years and years under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. I have had to work out when people started to live together and in particular, because of marriage, when they parted. The date of parting was often extremely important in assessing whether they fulfilled the requirements of having been separated for a sufficient number of years.</p>

<p><a name="09043036000141"></a>It is a judge&#146;s job to evaluate the evidence and come to the conclusion about whether either of them was telling the truth. In many cases between couples who have been living together, no one is telling the truth; as a result, the court comes to a practical conclusion. I see no difficulty; I am slightly surprised that the noble Lord, who has some experience of legal matters, should believe that this was a difficult matter for a judge at any level to work out when they started together and when they finished. They are all practical facts that can be found by the judge.</p>

<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="09043036000128"></a><b><a name="90430-0016.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043036000255"></a>Lord Pannick:</b> I declare another interest. I was a pupil of my noble friend Lady Deech at Oxford. I always listened carefully to what she taught me about the facts of life as well as the content of the law. One of the legal principles she taught me is that the courts will interpret legislation to deny retrospection so far as fairness and human rights principles require it to do so. That is sufficient protection in addition to the points with which I agree, made by my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="09043036000129"></a><b><a name="90430-0016.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09043036000256"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> I shall deal with a number of points. First, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked how the court would assess a continuous period of five years. The answer is that the court is perfectly  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_431"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column 431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capable of dealing with it as a question of fact. The evidence would be put forward in the ordinary way, as it is whenever a continuous period is required to be determined. I see no difficulty about that and do not understand why there should be.</p>

<a name="90430-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="09043036000130"></a>Secondly, I want to make a point that has not so far been made. Couples who live together for five years before the Bill comes into force but did so without wishing to accrue rights and responsibilities in respect of each other will, under the Bill, be able to opt out during the lead-in period. In that way, the Bill avoids imposing obligations on couples who do not wish to be bound by the Bill&#146;s provisions, but it would cover those who do not so object and who deserve protection. There was very strong support in the consultation on the Bill to cover existing couples, and so far as retrospection is concerned, it is commonplace in dealing with remedial legislation&#151;such as equal pay legislation, to take an obvious example&#151;to give the benefit &#147;retrospectively&#148;, if one wants to use the word, in a period before a Bill comes into force to someone who is the victim of discrimination in some context.</p>

<a name="90430-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="09043036000131"></a>It is absolutely clear that in the criminal law no retrospective penalty should be imposed because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has said, it is part of the rule of law and the principle of legal certainty. There is no problem about that. We are dealing here with remedial legislation with a full capacity to opt out. Therefore, my own hope and belief would be that this is fully compatible with human rights. Indeed, it actually promotes the rights of a willing cohabiting couple who want their accrued rights and responsibilities to be taken into account under the Bill. As I say, there was strong support for this.</p>

<a name="90430-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="09043036000132"></a>However, I agree with the noble Baroness in her concern about legal aid in family proceedings, including public law family proceedings. Of course the costs of lawyers and litigation arise in the family area particularly when dealing with the ghastly complexities of, for example, trust law and matters of that kind. This Bill does not give rise to complicated legal issues of the kind seen in the principles of equity and trust law under the bad law that exists at the moment&#151;bad law in the sense that it is unusable for working-class couples without the ability to pay for expensive lawyers. Therefore, I join with those who are opposed to the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="09043036000133"></a><b><a name="90430-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09043036000257"></a>Baroness Deech:</b> A couple who found themselves before the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, would be fortunate, and her experience is valuable. But I must remind the Committee that if this were to become a retrospective law, most of those couples would never find themselves in a court. Rather, it

All that will be going on and form 99 per cent of the cases. Only very rarely would such a case make it into court, but retrospection will reopen the bitterness of old relationships. That is the danger, not what happens in court, where I have every faith in what the judges will do. Threats will be made and expenses incurred that will not be seen in court because of retrospection. There are also problems with an opt out, although this may not be the time to go into them.</p>

<a name="90430-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="09043036000134"></a>I must appeal to the important principle that something as deeply profound in its effect as this law should not be retrospective. There needs to be publicity. I should like to test the opinion of the Committee because I believe it to be a very important principle.</p>

The amendment will allow this negotiation even if the commission is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of an offence or contravention and/or the person concerned does not accept that such an offence has been committed.

<p><a name="09043028000009"></a>However, there are some important differences that we are unable to accept. First, these amendments move the word &#147;prescribed&#148; from these sections when referring to offences. We dealt with this in Committee yesterday. We do not believe that this approach is desirable as the full details of which offences may be punished with a civil sanction should be set out in secondary legislation, subject to affirmative resolution and thus to full scrutiny of both Houses.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000010"></a>Additionally, the amendments significantly depart from the current drafting of the Bill by adding a new heading (b), which states that a discretionary requirement may be imposed &#147;with the express agreement&#148; of the person or organisation involved. In effect, the amendments propose that a person could come forward and give their agreement to the commission to impose a discretionary requirement. We are not sure that the provision of such a step is logical in procedural terms. A civil penalty, by its nature, should accompany a breach as defined by the commission, and it is for the commission, not for the person concerned, to decide whether a breach or contravention has taken place. If a person should be allowed to volunteer themselves for a sanction in this way, the commission would presumably need to investigate the claim in order to determine the level of the penalty, but it might in fact decide that an offence had not occurred. It appears that these amendments could create potential for unnecessary administrative burdens on the commission where there was no need.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000011"></a>If the commission were presented with evidence of a breach, it could decide to act on that evidence. As a regulator, it should not be seeking &#147;express agreement&#148; from those regulated in order to perform its duties. Moreover, if the purpose is to provide an option to encourage co-operation and compliance, that is of course admirable. However, we argue that it is unnecessary as the Bill already provides for such co-operation in the form of enforcement undertakings, to which the noble Lord, Lord Henley, referred. An enforcement undertaking is where a person enters into agreement with the commission and gives an undertaking to take a particular course of action. The amendments seem

We do not think that that is either necessary or desirable.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000012"></a>So far as concerns the commission&#146;s view on this, as we understand it, it agrees that removing the word &#147;prescribed&#148; would give flexibility, but it expects that Parliament would want to give a view, which is the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000013"></a>I am grateful for the short debate on this and for the amendment moved by the noble Lord. However, it is not an amendment that we can accept.</p>

If I heard him correctly at the beginning&#151;perhaps he would nod to confirm it&#151;in due course regulations will come before the House dealing with how the commission should operate in this matter and these will be affirmative. The noble Lord referred to some affirmative regulations and we will be seeing those some time after the passage of the Bill. Is that correct? For the sake of the record, I state that the noble Lord nodded and made noises that sounded as though he affirmed my statement. That being the case, we will have a further chance to look at these matters in due course, and I am grateful to the noble Lord for making it clear that the regulations will be affirmative.

<p><a name="09043028000016"></a>As the noble Lord will see, the amendment inserts &#147;promptly&#148; after the word &#147;shall&#148;, so that the commission imposes a discretionary requirement on someone promptly. I hope that that is as simple and self-explanatory as possible. It stems from a desire to ensure that the commission demonstrates good practice if it hopes for similar good practice in return from those with whom it deals. Having said merely that, I would be grateful to hear what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000018"></a>It is already clear that the commission will be required, in accordance with general public law principles, to apply these sanctions in a &#147;reasonable manner&#148;. Were it to act in a way that is not proportionate and timely, it could form the basis for grounds of appeal against the resulting sanction. This constraint is more powerful and effective than amending the provision in the way suggested by the amendment.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000019"></a>The commission is well aware of the need, with these new sanctions, not only to act cautiously but also to proceed in a timely fashion. However, we are wary that any attempt to be more prescriptive over the commission&#146;s procedures, however well intentioned, may produce unintended and unwanted consequences. For instance, could inserting this kind of language in the Bill create the possibility of the commission feeling that it must make a hasty decision on prosecution rather than a correct decision?</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000020"></a>In drafting this schedule on civil sanctions, we have sought to follow as closely as possible the framework established for other regulators by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act. As my right honourable friend the Minister of State has maintained throughout this process, and as I said yesterday, we do not think it appropriate to depart from this model unless it is absolutely necessary. After all, why should the regulator that enforces the law for those of us involved in politics be subject to a set of provisions different from those for regulators in other fields? I again thank the noble Lord for raising the point, but we do not feel that we can accept his amendment.</p>

I understand clearly that if one puts &#147;promptly&#148; in one piece of legislation, it changes one&#146;s possible interpretation of other legislation, because the use of &#147;promptly&#148; in the former would imply that there was no need for promptness where the word was not used.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000022"></a>Nevertheless, it was a point worth briefly making, because I think that all of us think that it would be good practice for the commission to act&#151;the Minister put it better than me&#151;in a timely manner. However, &#147;promptly&#148; is perhaps is overprescriptive. I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and shall therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We are troubled by the potential

If the commission has quite so much flexibility to alter its use of penalties, it may be tempted to hand out more than are due.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000024"></a>Early payments would precede the final notice of penalty, so the notices that we are discussing are intended to notify a proposal to implement a penalty rather than the final penalty itself. We fear that while a discount may encourage early payment, it could also diminish the authority of the commission and trivialise the very important message that it sends out. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="09043028000415"></a>12.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09043028000025"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09043028000441"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> I understand why the Electoral Commission opposes this amendment. It suggests that it may ultimately cost more to the public purse if it has to pursue through legal avenues recovery of what is owed to it, as opposed to the payment of late penalties. However, if you had sufficiently large late penalties, you would get more money in, so it depends on what your legal costs would be as against the amounts from the late penalties. I think that it is better to have a system of late penalties&#151;and I say that as someone responsible for running a party&#151;because it is clearer and simpler. You know where you are; if you do not pay on time, you effectively pay more. I would not like to encourage the commission to think that it had time to get into legal arguments to pursue the payments; you should know that if you do not pay on time, you pay more.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000026"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09043028000442"></a>Lord Bach:</b> This amendment and Amendment 71 grouped with it both relate to provisions in the Bill for the commission to offer early payment discounts and late payment penalties. Amendment 61 removes reference to early payment discounts or late payment penalties for compliance with discretionary requirements. Amendment 71 would remove paragraph 18 (1)(a), which allows the Secretary of State to make a supplementary order to allow the commission to offer,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000397"></a>&#147;provision for early payment discounts&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000314"></a>for any of the monetary penalties contained in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000027"></a>These incentives are replicated from the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, which give those on whom a sanction is imposed an incentive to accept it, and deal with it in a timely fashion. This may encourage compliance, reduce the workload that late payment would create for the commission, and is a proportionate mechanism to help encourage compliance with these penalties. While the Bill may provide for these procedural discounts and penalties, the commission is not compelled by the Bill to offer them in all instances. It is a matter for the commission&#146;s judgment, to apply its expertise and experience to decide where and when they would be appropriate. We believe that the availability of these options provides a tool that they may decide to use to ensure this. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, suggested, the commission has said that it does not support Amendment 61 because,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000398"></a>&#147;such penalties are likely to encourage prompt settlement and reduce the need to use public funds to pursue payment&#148;.</ul>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000028"></a>I do not believe that the availability of these provisions degrades these sanctions in any way. It is important to see the financial penalties contained in the Bill as just part of an overall package. The commission will also have access to other discretionary requirements of a non-financial nature&#151;for instance by requiring a person to take particular actions to ensure compliance, or by entering into an enforcement undertaking with the person concern, or, in extreme cases, by using a stop notice. Again, we are following closely the provision of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, which includes provisions for early payment discounts and late payment penalties. We have sought to provide the commission with a proportionate and flexible system which is available for a range of other regulators. It is precisely to ensure that the commission is able to act in a proportionate way according to the facts of the circumstances of individual cases that we have followed this model and we think that there are no compelling arguments, on balance, to move away from it in this case.</p>

Obviously, there are arguments for both. I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, from the Liberal Democrat Benches, was saying that they agreed with us that late payment penalties was the route to go down and there was no need for early payment discounts as well.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000030"></a>I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I will read it with some care. It might also be worth having discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, before we look at this again at Report. At this stage, the best thing to do is to withdraw the amendment but say that we may want to return to it at a later stage.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000032"></a>Amendment 72 would insert &#147;reasonable&#148; so that the report becomes the reasonable opinion of the Electoral Commission. On Amendment 73, we felt that rather than,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000399"></a>&#147;might adversely affect any current investigation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000315"></a>we should make the provision somewhat stronger and say that it,</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000033"></a>It is obviously very important that the commission should have some form of flexibility and, in terms of reporting, that is very useful. However, this could go too far because as it stands there is no requirement that the commission's opinion as to the lawfulness or any adverse effects of publishing certain information  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be reasonable. We feel that an opinion to this end should be reasonable. Amendment 73 would strengthen the wording in the Bill to make it absolutely clear that the commission should not include anything that would adversely affect investigations. I would be grateful for the noble Lord's comments on those amendments. I beg to move.</p>

I am sorry to disappoint the noble Lord in telling him that I will resist the amendments on the grounds that they are unnecessary and would hamper in one case the commission&#146;s operational effectiveness.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000035"></a>Amendment 72 would add the word &#147;reasonable&#148; to the provision relating to the application of the commission&#146;s opinions. At the risk of repeating myself, the commission must already act in a reasonable way. Failure to do so risks judicial review. It is implicit in the drafting that any opinion that can be taken into account must be one that is reasonably held.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000036"></a>It would not be open to the commission, as a body subject to the usual principles of public law, to form a manifestly unreasonable opinion and then act on that, so I do not think that we need to add this here. It might set a slightly unhelpful precedent and imply that other regulators in a similar position would be able to hold and act on &#147;unreasonable&#148; opinions.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000037"></a>Amendment 73 causes us greater concern, because this could have an adverse effect on the commission&#146;s operational effectiveness in some cases. The Bill states that the commission may leave out details from its report on sanctions if including them,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000401"></a>&#147;might adversely affect any current investigation or proceedings&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000316"></a>Perhaps the word &#147;might&#148; is not specific enough for the noble Lord, but we use it with good reason.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000038"></a>We use it because it allows the commission to apply its general judgment and knowledge of specific cases to make decisions about what &#147;might&#148; subsequently impact on an investigation. At the time that a judgment is required to be made about what to include in a report it may be very difficult or impossible to say whether something definitely would have an adverse effect on the potential outcome of an investigation or proceedings, particularly if the investigation or proceedings are at an early stage. In its latest briefing on the Bill, the Electoral Commission, in opposing Amendment 73, notes that it may not always be possible to be certain whether or not such information could affect a current case.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000039"></a>Positively requiring the commission to identify whether information &#147;would&#148; have an adverse effect could be highly damaging. It is only right that the commission be given a reasonable degree of latitude in making potentially fine value judgments in these sorts of circumstance. Our proposal to retain &#147;might&#148; will achieve the correct result without fundamentally reducing the level of transparency that the reporting requirement is, of course, intended to provide.</p>

The use of that word is also inelegant. However, I feel slightly more strongly about adding &#147;would&#148; instead of &#147;might&#148;. Despite what the commission said, that would refocus it when deciding whether publication of information would damage its investigation. In accommodating the mere subjective opinion requirement, which we have identified, this section would allow for a very cautious report indeed, which might not be fully informative and might not truly reflect the reality of the commission&#146;s work. However, I shall look very carefully at what the noble Lord said. I am pretty sure that I will not come back on Amendment 72, but we may want to have another look at Amendment 73 in due course.

<p><a name="09043028000042"></a>We turn to a very important issue that has preoccupied a great many people: whether or not there should be at the highest level in the Electoral Commission people with direct political experience. Clause 5 in an important way modifies the previous Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. I should say at the outset that I was agnostic to this proposal, partly because of my experience in the informal group of parliamentarians. I have come around to it and, therefore, I have the merit of conversion, having looked at the arguments very carefully, which are more balanced than perhaps some are prepared to admit.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="09043028000416"></a>12.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000043"></a>I have looked carefully at the evidence given to the Committee on Standards in Public Life on this issue, and at the conclusions reached by Sir Hayden Phillips. These are important issues and I hope that the Grand Committee will forgive me if we spend time on them, because this is our only opportunity to discuss them. This is our only amendment on the body of Clause 5 and it is important that we examine it with some care.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000044"></a>I was struck by some advice given to the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Those who were doubtful about the proposition made much of the fact that commissioners might see themselves as representatives of political parties, and indeed of the leaders of those parties at the time, rather than feeling that they were bringing to the corpus of information and experience of the commission a more practical approach than perhaps has been apparent in the commission&#146;s relatively short life. The argument was made to the committee that the Electoral Commission should not only be above party political wrangles, but should be seen to be above them. The previous chair, Sam Younger, made the point strongly. In his evidence to the committee, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000402"></a>&#147;the one thing we&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000317"></a>that is, the commissioners&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000403"></a>&#147;do not have is the experience of operating as either elected politicians or actively within parties. Therefore we need to have access to that expertise and experience, and that we recognise ... There are various ways we have tried to plug that gap. Most recently, and I think probably this is overdue, and I hope it will work and is without prejudice to what might happen in the future either statutorily or otherwise&#151;but we have established a small reference group of three members of the House of Lords, three members of the House of Commons, from each of the main parties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000318"></a>That is the group to which I referred. It was clear that the commission and the chairman saw that there was a gap there, but they were not enthusiastic about filling it on a statutory basis.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000045"></a>There were others who gave advice to the committee. My right honourable friend Alan Beith MP, who was probably then the chairman of the relevant Select Committee&#151;this was a few years ago&#151;said that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000349"></a>&#147;There were other cases where I think the Commission did not understand the distinction between those things which confer advantage on a candidate in an election, and therefore should be looked at and costed by them and declared to them, and those things which are part and parcel of being a member of parliament and carrying out public duties ... All of these things, I think, illustrated a lack of awareness of what went on in the real world of being a politician and not of a partisan character&#148;.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000046"></a>The committee took a great deal of evidence from active politicians and others on this issue. I have one more quotation, this time from Lord Holme, who sadly is no longer with us. He gave a great deal of thought to this and, as chairman of the Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146; House, was very exercised by the failure to take account of the experience of other countries. He said, in evidence to the committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000350"></a>&#147;I think there is a danger that you get what has happened with the Federal Electoral Commission in the States, which has really just become a forum in which the parties negotiate. It is really no more than that; it is a place, as you have no doubt observed, where the parties cut their deals. I think that would be extremely undesirable ... There is a danger, if the party nominees bounce in  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the traditional way, that you are implicitly saying to the other members of the Commission, &#145;You sit back while the politicians do the deals&#146;. I do not think this should be a deal-led body; I think it should be a public-interest, rule-led body&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000319"></a>I am sure that all Members of the Committee would say amen to that. Clearly it would be the wrong way to go.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000047"></a>The recommendations of the committee were firm: if there was going to be change&#151;and this was very much the desire at the time&#151;the new commissioners should be appointed as individual members of a unitary board, not as representatives or delegates of a particular political party. The committee set out some proposals to try to achieve that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000048"></a>Turning to the Hayden Phillips investigations of these issues, much of that evidence was again reflected in the analysis that was the subject of that inquiry. His conclusion was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000351"></a>&#147;Would the addition of these four Commissioners unbalance the Commission itself, causing it to be divided along party lines? ... The majority of Commissioners would not come from the political parties and the four with party experience would not be representative of their parties. For the most part, I would envisage that they would be former politicians, men and women who understand party politics but whose primary allegiance as Commissioners would be to the public interest, rather than to the partisan cause&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000320"></a>That is the point that we address in Amendment 74. Frankly, the way in which that is currently set out in the Bill gives no guidance to the party leaders, let alone to the general public, regarding the sort of experience and expertise that will be expected of these four commissioners. The last thing we would want is four splendid individuals who are redundant politicians and who have ceased to have any real value but may be rather difficult to satisfy in terms of something to keep them out of the way&#151;people such as myself. That would be entirely inappropriate. We have to be extremely careful that the party leaders, individually and collectively, are given guidance about what will be expected. Hence, our emphasis on diversity. We see it as important that the party leaders talk to one another so that the four representatives are not all from the same sort of stable&#151;all elderly, male, white, former party apparatchiks. As we say very clearly in our amendment, we are looking for a number of people who have relevant experience in the conduct of elections and the organisation of political parties but who also bring to the commission some diversity of representation.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000049"></a>As I said at the outset, it is extremely important that, once someone is nominated, he or she is not seen as the representative of a party, let alone a party leader. Party leaders change, and the last thing we want is for someone who is put on to the commission to feel that they are there at the mercy or whim of the party leader. As I said, party leaders change, and we do not want a lack of continuity or consistency in the contribution that can be made.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000050"></a>Just as dangerous would be to have a yes man or yes woman who was simply there to represent the views of the party hierarchy. If we are going to try to ensure that there is direct experience of the way in which elections happen at the grass-roots level, that is not the sort of person who should be eligible for this purpose.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000051"></a>It is not entirely clear&#151;I hope that in responding the Minister will be able to give us some guidance&#151;whether the term of office and general responsibilities of these new commissioners will be exactly the same as set out in Schedule 1 to the PPERA. If so, we might find that they are rather too much at the mercy of their nominating party leader. This is a good moment to ask the Minister whether there will be security of tenure. This is a dangerous thing to say, I know, but we are all aware that at the moment in your Lordships&#146; House we are here for life; we are not in any way&#151;I shall have to be very careful where I tread here&#151;at the mercy of our party leaders. There may be other considerations as to whether or not we remain here, but that has its own merit and it is a hostage to fortune, not least in the terms set out by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. However, it is important that the commissioners are not seen to be there simply for a temporary period while a particular party leader thinks that they will be good representatives of his or her interests and his or her party. Therefore, the whole issue of security of tenure is extremely important.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000052"></a>We hope that the Minister and other Members of the Grand Committee will see this as a practical way to face up to an important issue. It is an important change to the mode of operation of the Electoral Commission. Just as important is the change to perception that the public and those active in the political world have of the commission and the way that it operates. Given experience since the PPER Act, there are anxieties about the extent to which the commission has its feet on the political ground. However, we would be stepping in the wrong direction if in the process, either in practice or in perception, we gave it the impression that it was to be the creature of the political leaders. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000053"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043028000450"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I have a little problem with the amendment. It is not that I disagree with it, because in a sense I do&#151;I agree with the fundamental feeling behind it&#151;but I am not certain whether putting only this provision in the Bill is right. Would it not be better to pick up the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on the wider issues around the role of the commissioners? Perhaps some guidance can be given to the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which is ultimately responsible, on what we expect of those commissioners, rather than having selective points included in the Bill. I agree that we must take notice of diversity and that we must have people with experience.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000054"></a>I want to pick up a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that he repeated two or three times. When he talked about people with experience, he talked about politicians. There are many other people who are not politicians and who have an enormous amount of experience, and who therefore may be better people to do this job. We must ensure that we do not see the situation only in those terms.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000055"></a>I support the Government&#146;s proposal on the four places. As the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, and others know, we spent a lot of time on this issue in the 2000 Bill and failed to persuade the Government, even though everyone around the House thought that it  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was a good idea to have some political involvement. The suggestion then was that we should have a second committee, meeting as and when, but not having an enormous amount of influence on what was happening.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000056"></a>Perhaps I may give an example and also declare an interest that I failed to declare yesterday. I am chair of the HS Chapman Society, a body that looks at election organisation and of which the Electoral Commission is a part. The society frequently received reports from the commission about its work, and I felt very sorry for a young man who appeared when the commission produced a series of educational documents for review. He was telling us how wonderful it all was, that all the documents were going out and that one had a week to reply. There was also all the nonsense that was going on at that time. I asked him, &#147;And who actually decides the response to those documents? Who actually goes through the responses and says what is right or wrong?&#148;. He said, &#147;Oh, well, as officers, we sit and do this&#148;. I asked, &#147;And do you have any involvement in the political parties?&#148;. &#147;Oh, no, never&#148;, he said. That could not have been a better example for having some political involvement. I have to say that I felt sorry for him because I felt that I had been a bit cruel to him.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000057"></a>Nevertheless, I believe that the Government are absolutely right to make these provisions: it is also absolutely right that there has to be experience of the democratic process. I make the point about politicians because a wider spectrum of experience is needed. The process would help the political parties to feel more comfortable with the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000058"></a>I have one little query on how the appointments are made. The review of the Electoral Commission by the CSPL makes the point that although individuals may be encouraged to apply by political parties, each post should be publicly advertised and candidates must satisfy all other criteria that apply to commissioner posts. It says that they must also be subject to a selection process based upon merit following the Commission for Public Appointments&#146; code of practice. I hope that that will be the process by which appointments are made. It is interpreted that this will somehow be a direct appointment from the leader of the party. I really have some reservation about that. It is not that I do not think for one moment that people cannot be independent&#151;I am sure that many people around this Chamber have been appointments of their own political parties, but have ultimately stood in an independent capacity in those appointments. I do not feel that they would end up being the voice of the leader; I feel that democratically we ought to look seriously at how those appointments are made.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000059"></a>I repeat that I support the Government&#146;s proposals, but I feel that what is in the Bill is not quite right.</p>

We are extremely fortunate that she is serving in this Grand Committee. On a wider front, we are extremely fortunate that she is the chairman of the HS Chapman Society, an organisation with which I am familiar not least also in Australia. It is an organisation of considerable value to the general body politic.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000061"></a>I have to declare an unusual interest. My wife is the administrator of the fellowship of retired Conservative agents, whose membership is thrice the number of agents the Conservative Party could afford to field at the last general election. But it means that from time to time I am brought up sharp on election law.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000062"></a>I want to make two comments. One relates to paragraph (a) and the other to paragraph (b) of the amendment. First, I was the first headhunter in the United Kingdom nearly 50 years ago. I planted an acorn and there is now a very substantial forest throughout the recruiting world. One of the areas in which you had to exercise considerable discipline was in ensuring that the client was quite clear what they wanted before we set out to look for the person. Periodically, we had to disagree with their specifications and had to persuade them to change. But it was absolutely essential to do that at the beginning of the process, which is why I find paragraph (a) a wholly worthwhile contribution to the debate. I have no reservations about it being in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000063"></a>However, I do have misgivings about paragraph (b). It seems to me that under American anti-trust law, you would have to be managing a cartel to know how your nominee would fit into the creative diversity of appointments by the other members of the team. If the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is contemplating that such meetings will occur to facilitate discussions on how parties could help the diversity by the choice of their person, that should be referred to in the Bill. It is difficult to imagine how you would do it otherwise. Frankly, without some degree of mutual conference, choosing your candidate against the terms of paragraph (b) would be like sticking the tail on the donkey at a village fete.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000064"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09043028000452"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I want to ask a very simple question. With the permission of the Committee, I shall do so now so as to avoid doing so in the clause-stand-part debate. What would the role of the party-appointed commissioners be when decisions on penalties are being considered? Even though a commissioner had made every effort to be utterly independent in judgment, if they have such a role, surely the Committee should be considering it at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000065"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09043028000453"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> That is an important point. There may have to be occasions when the commission does not participate. That is why I return to the point that we need proper guidance. We need something properly written down about the role of those commissioners and the terms of their appointments to make sure that all these points, which could be fundamental, are actually covered.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000066"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09043028000454"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> My noble friend, who has great experience in these matters, referred to guidance. Do we not need a little more than that? Guidance can be ignored.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commissioners put forward by the leaders of the three largest nominating parties&#151;like the three parties represented in this Room. This has been a useful debate and I am looking forward to the Minister's response, particularly to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on the dismissal of subsection (3) commissioners. I presumed that it would be the same process as the other commissioners, but no doubt the Minister will let us know that they have the appropriate independence once they have been appointed. This debate has enabled us to discuss the sort of people who the leaders of those parties should put forward. However, in the end, as subsection (3) makes clear, the party leaders will decide who they will appoint.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000069"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Brooke, I have problems with the second part of the amendment which seeks diversity. It might be an admirable thing to do, but as my noble friend pointed out, it is difficult to go for diversity when you have the sole right of appointment of one commissioner, someone else has sole right of appointment of another and the third is appointed by a third person&#151;unless the three leaders get together to discuss their appointments to see that they are being diverse. I would have thought that there would be sufficient diversity in the fact that the three appointees will be of the three different political parties, which would make them sufficiently diverse for the noble Lord. That is what we expect from appointees from the leaders of the three parties. We broadly support Clause 5 as drafted, so I do not think that I can offer any support at this stage for the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000070"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09043028000457"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I offer a few words before the Minister responds. Like my noble friend Lady Gould, I agree with so much of the principle that lay behind what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. In particular, I agreed with what he said about party representatives and the others. The Bill makes it clear that the party representatives are intended to be a minority of the total commission. Clearly, they must all work together. They would not work together very well if the party nominees regarded themselves as representatives of parties, let alone representatives of the party leader. I agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000071"></a>However, like my noble friend Lady Gould, I am doubtful about the amendments. I realise that the noble Lord had to table amendments to enable discussion about the Bill, but with the best will in the world, and no doubt he has looked at the drafting carefully, the wording of his amendments to Clause 5 is not apt at all. Perhaps that is being a little harsh. Paragraph (a) would</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000404"></a>&#147;ensure that the nominated person has relevant experience in the conduct of elections&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000321"></a>and so forth, But that is much too narrow. It would no doubt be delightful and excellent to have someone of the huge experience of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, and if that could be equated in the other parties, that would be fine, but that is only one version of what is meant by,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000405"></a>&#147;relevant experience in the conduct of elections and the organisation of political parties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000322"></a>I think that is much too narrow. It would be delightful and excellent no doubt to have someone of the huge experience of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. If that

<p><a name="09043028000323"></a>That is really much too narrow.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000072"></a>Others have commented on diversity. I very much agreed with the cartel points that seemed to resonate through my mind when the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, spoke. But diverse does not necessarily mean what has been intended. I am familiar with the fact that in recent changes made by the Government in judicial appointments emphasis has been made on diversity to ensure that more people enter the judiciary who are not white and more women than we have had in the past, particularly at the higher levels. That, I suppose, is what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, means&#151;but on the face of it, it could mean &#147;diverse representation&#148; from those experienced in the conduct of elections for the European Parliament in devolved parliaments and local government. It could mean diversity across a whole range of fields; diverse does not necessarily have the meaning that the noble Lord seeks to give it, so I think that paragraph (b) is too vague.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000073"></a>For a whole number of reasons, but principally for the one enunciated by my noble friend Lady Gould of Potternewton, it would not be appropriate to try to do this in the Bill, even though a much better outcome could be reached than the original wording chosen by noble Lords opposite.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000074"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09043028000458"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I raise one point that has not been touched on. I have considerable sympathy with the substance of paragraph (a), although it may be important to stress the desirability that someone has that background, rather than prescribe it. I also have sympathy with the point made in paragraph (b), although I recognise the problems that have been identified when you are appointing only one person. The problem I would draw attention to is the relationship between the two; it might be a bit depressing to do so, but paragraph (b) supposes that paragraph (a) encompasses a fairly diverse body of people already. You would have to do a study of those who have actually got the experience of the electoral system in this country&#151;electoral administrators. It may be that we find that, with regard to the diversity to which the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, refers, we do not have a very diverse group from which to draw, which might limit it. There would be dangers of putting in the Bill, even though it is in very general terms of having regard to. In practical terms, there may be a problem with the relationship between the two paragraphs, and therefore a danger in putting those two proposals together in the Bill.</p>

I note that those who participate in the debate all support the basic principle of nominated commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000076"></a>Clause 5 makes provision which enables the appointment to the commission of four commissioners with recent political experience. These commissioners are referred to as nominated commissioners. Clause 5 requires that three of the four nominated commissioners must have been put forward for appointment by the leaders of the three largest political parties in Parliament, with the remaining nominated commissioner put forward by the leader of one smaller party. This amendment seeks to insert criteria which the registered party leaders must satisfy themselves would be met in putting forward their nominee for the post of nominated commissioner. These criteria are that:</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000407"></a>&#147;registered party leaders must ensure ... that the nominated person has relevant experience in the conduct of elections and the organisation of political parties; and ... have regard to the desirability for the overall composition of the Commission to benefit from diverse representation&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="09043028000418"></a>1 pm</h5>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000077"></a>I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment, which I believe is to ensure that the individuals who are put forward by the leaders of their parties have the relevant experience and skills that would enable them contribute positively to the overall effectiveness of the commission, with the advantage that an organisation gains from a diverse membership.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000078"></a>Given the Electoral Commission&#146;s role in relation to elections and party financing, there will no doubt be general agreement in this Committee that the nominees should have relevant experience in these fields. Noble Lords will also agree that diversity is important and should be appropriately taken into account in making these nominations. There will be other essential and desirable criteria which the Committee believes should be met by a person before he or she is put forward for appointment as a nominated commissioner.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000079"></a>However, I do not think that the best way forward would be to set out these criteria in legislation. Through Clause 4, we have made it clear that responsibility for the recruitment and selection process of the electoral commissioners lies with the Speaker&#146;s Committee. It should therefore be a matter, first, for the party leaders, and then for the Speaker&#146;s Committee working in conjunction with the Electoral Commission and relevant stakeholders, to decide the necessary criteria and appropriate candidates for the post of nominated commissioner. I have no doubt that party leaders will consider, in putting forward candidates for appointment, whether the nominees have the requisite skills, experience and other attributes.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000080"></a>In addition, we have every confidence that the Speaker&#146;s Committee will give careful consideration to agreeing robust and relevant criteria for the post of nominated commissioner. The Speaker&#146;s Committee will no doubt communicate these criteria to registered party leaders to ensure that they are able to make informed nominations.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000081"></a>For these reasons, we do not believe that setting separate criteria in legislation would serve any useful purpose. Doing so would seem to prejudge the outcome of any consideration that the Speaker&#146;s Committee might want to give as to what the appropriate criteria should be before it has had the chance to consult the relevant interests. It would reduce flexibility if there

In addition, it could be misleading, by giving the impression that it is only these specified criteria which must be met before a person can be considered for appointment.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000082"></a>The point of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about the committee cutting deals was well made. It is essential that it is not that kind of committee. It is important to realise that appointing nominated commissioners does not alter the role and functions of the Electoral Commission. Nominated commissioners are not intended to represent political parties and will, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, be in a minority.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000083"></a>The terms of office for nominated commissioners will be the same as for other commissioners, the only difference being that the restriction on political experience is lifted. Terms of office and other criteria will be set by the Speaker&#146;s Committee.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000084"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, asked how the Speaker&#146;s Committee selects members of the Electoral Commission. In practice, the committee has always recruited electoral commissioners on the basis of open competition in accordance with the OCPA principles, despite not being bound by statute to do so.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000085"></a>The commission&#146;s staff make decisions on penalties, seeking approval of commissioners as appropriate. Nominated commissioners from the four different parties will not be in a majority and will be expected to act in a non-partisan way.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000086"></a>The reason that we feel that we need to resist the amendment is, first, the level of consensus that sits behind this part of the Bill and, secondly, that we do not see the value of having criteria in the Bill; we think that the Speaker&#146;s Committee working with party leaders and other stakeholders is the appropriate place. On this basis, I hope the noble Lords will agree to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000087"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043028000460"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> My noble friend said that commissioners are expected to act in &#147;a non-partisan way&#148;. He did not manage to deal with my question about the extent to which commissioners might be involved in decisions on penalties. If he does not have an answer now, can he let the Committee know?</p>

<p><a name="09043028000088"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09043028000461"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> I said, although I may have mumbled it, that the commission staff make decisions on penalties, seeking the approval of commissioners as appropriate. That is a very important point and it would be appropriate that I consult further and we will either bring it into the debate on Report or I will write to Members of the Committee.</p>

I should like briefly to respond to some of the points that have been made. First and foremost, like the noble Lord, Lord Henley, I should make it absolutely clear that I and my noble friends very much support the appointment of the new commissioners. That is not our concern. The concerns that we are seeking to express in this amendment, which have been reflected by all sides, are precisely how those commissioners may operate. I shall come back particularly to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000090"></a>We support the clause, but we want to make this change which is significant to the role of the commission. We want to make sure that the change is implemented carefully. I turn to one or two of the points that have been made. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, who has long experience, and to have support from her is a consolation to an amateur like me. Similarly, I received support from a different perspective from the noble Lord, Lord Norton. I do not regard those who are working for the political system in any capacity, be it for a party or outwith, as being somehow a lesser breed. I do not regard the elected or unelected politicians&#151;the people who get kicked out&#151;as being somehow more experienced&#151;far from it. If I in any way gave the impression that I thought that the people we might seek to have nominated should be party politicians in the traditional sense, I did not intend to. That is not the case at all. Indeed, our new paragraph (a) is intended to reflect the need for people working, perhaps at a grass-roots level, who have never sought election and are not politicians.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000091"></a>I take up the point that the noble Baroness made about open competition. From what the Minister has said, we must be clear that these nominees will not be subjected to the normal process of open competition, because of course the party leaders will in the end be the nominators. At the very least, they will be able to blackball any potential person who could be nominated to this role if they do not think that that is the sort of person who will reflect the objectives, purposes and partisan interests of that party and that party leader. I was glad to have the support of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000092"></a>We must be absolutely open about this. I am sure that the Minister in his response was clear: this is not comparable to the open selection interview criteria that are in place for the other non-party commissioners. The nominated commissioners are a different breed and we have to be clear about that. That is why our amendment and this discussion are relevant and appropriate.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000093"></a>I was also grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, for at least half of our amendment. However, I take some exception to his reference to &#147;cartel&#148;, which has pejorative overtones. I believe that it is quite good, occasionally, for parties and party leaders to work together. I know that it is traditional at the other end of the building that we should multiply the disagreements; but even there, yesterday, there was agreement between two parties and the Government were defeated on a Liberal Democrat Motion. We should not fool ourselves that it is a bad thing for politicians occasionally to agree. That happens at this end of the building, too. I do not think that it would be a bad thing for party leaders occasionally to sit down and think about the corporate responsibilities of the Electoral Commission and to try to make sure that there is a good balance of representation, not just in terms of party, but in terms of experience. Therefore, I resist the idea that if our new paragraph (b), seeking to get a broader diversity, were to be passed, that somehow would lead to a cartel. All kinds of areas of diversity have to be addressed, as has been made clear in the debate, but I do not think this is pinning a tail

Many other things happen in this building which look much more like that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000094"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, raised an important issue to which I should have referred at the outset. The Electoral Commission is not like the Committee on Standards in Public Life, where there are, of course, party-political nominees. There will be occasions when the body acts not only as an investigator, or at least as a supervising investigator, but as a decision-making body on penalties. In such cases, it will not be only the party representative of party A who will be interested in whether or not local party A is penalised in a particular way; but representatives of party B, party C or even party D will have a direct interest in that decision and that penalty.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000095"></a>If there is a major investigation of a whole party, what do we expect the representatives of parties B, C and D to do? The representative of party A may well say, &#147;I am going to set this out because my party is in the dock and is being accused of a major dereliction of duty, an offence under electoral law&#148;, but what about the other three parties? The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has raised an important issue about the commission not being like other organisations in which there are party representatives.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000096"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09043028000463"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> My noble friend used the key word &#147;approval&#148;. It may well be that a recommendation comes through, and it is that process of approval about which I am concerned.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000097"></a>On the question of withdrawal, in the expenses discussion that will now take place in the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the political representatives are withdrawing from those proceedings. That might be an indication of the way we should proceed in this case as well.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000098"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09043028000464"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord. We do not have that guidance from the Minister. He may feel that it is necessary to give it guidance between now and Report on whether the model is that all four have to withdraw in such circumstances, or the circumstances in which some other arrangement can be made. I share the anxiety of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000099"></a>The Minister&#146;s response was very helpful and I am grateful. He rightly emphasised, and perhaps I should have done so earlier, the role of the Speaker&#146;s Committee. I hope this debate will inform and assist that committee in considering these issues in future. However, there is room for greater clarity between now and Report. The terms of office issue, which falls under Schedule 1 to the PPERA, need to be looked at again. For example, if an incoming party leader decides that his or her representative inherited from a previous leader is going to be an extremely awkward customer, who has gone native in the Electoral Commission and is now taking a totally dispassionate, non-partisan view when the reverse is what the party leader requires, the easiest way to deal with that is to say to Joe Bloggs or Joan Bloggs, &#147;Look, I have got a good idea. Why don&#146;t you go into the House of Lords?&#148;. That would remove him or her immediately from the commission and then the party leader can put in the favoured trustee to behave

There is an issue here and we should think about it quite clearly. If the electoral commission is going to operate on exactly the same basis as other commissions, it could be a potential minefield and we need to address the issue.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000100"></a>I do not wish to detain the Grand Committee longer. Important points have been made throughout our debates today which have fully justified our anxiety to take a good look at this issue. It is an important change in both practice and perception for the commission and I hope that Ministers will at least give further thought to the best way to handle it before Report. We, too, will do that&#151;we will look very carefully at what has been said on all sides of the Committee&#151;but, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000104"></a>The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 imposes a 10-year restriction on previous political activity for all Electoral Commission staff. Clause 7 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seeks to reduce the restriction period from 10 years to five years for the commission's chief executive, and to one year for all other staff.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000105"></a>These government amendments are intended to address the concerns raised by the commission and my noble friend Lady Gould that the five-year restriction should be capable of being extended to other senior posts in the commission, or those dealing with politically sensitive responsibilities.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000106"></a>Having heard representations on the subject, we fully acknowledge that there may be a small number of posts in the commission, other than the chief executive, which merit a requirement for a longer restriction on recent political activity than one year. It is right that we strike an appropriate balance between ensuring that the commission is able to employ those who have the necessary skills to enable it to be more effective, without creating any perception of politicising the commission.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000107"></a>The amendment provides flexibility so that the chief executive of the commission can determine the appropriate restricted period for its staff. Some senior posts may merit a longer restriction period, while others will not. Likewise, certain posts, which may not necessarily be classed as senior posts, may indeed involve politically sensitive responsibilities. The chief executive of the commission will be best placed to decide which posts merit a longer restricted period, and what that period should be. That said, we are keen to ensure that the power provided for here does not provide the chief executive with unfettered discretion when it comes to choosing what post should be designated or how long a restriction for a particular post should be.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000108"></a>In light of this, government Amendments 75 and 77 provide the commission's chief executive with the power to designate certain other commission posts as being subject to a restriction period of up to five years. The chief executive may designate a post if he reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so in order to maintain public confidence in the effectiveness of the commission in carrying out its functions. In deciding the length of the restriction period, the chief executive will be required to take into account the level of seniority of the post, and how likely it is that any holder of the post will be required by the post to deal with politically sensitive matters.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000109"></a>These criteria show that we are mindful that the chief executive should use this power responsibly. To that end, we propose a further check on the discretion provided for here, so this amendment also requires the chief executive to consult the Speaker's Committee on the posts that he intends to designate. A duty to consult will mean that any view put forward by the committee in relation to a proposed designation will have to be taken into account, and taken seriously, by the chief executive. We believe that the Speaker&#146;s Committee is an appropriate body to give an independent and objective view on proposed designations, in line with the oversight rule relating to the commission. We considered whether it was appropriate to give the Speaker&#146;s Committee the right of veto over a particular designation. Ultimately, we took the view that the  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chief executive is best placed to come to a final decision on what is best for the successful internal working of the commission.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000110"></a>The chief executive will be required to give notice to the Speaker's Committee of his intention to designate a particular post, and the relevant period of restriction for that post. The notice has effect from the day it is received by the Speaker's Committee and expires after three years, unless the chief executive issues a cancellation notice or a notice that alters the details contained in the original in the interim. Any notice of cancellation or alteration along these lines is also subject to the duty to consult the Speaker&#146;s Committee before the chief executive can issue the notice in question.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000111"></a>This mechanism strikes a sensible and proportionate balance; empowering the chief executive, as the individual responsible for staffing decisions, to make decisions, while allowing him to take account of the views of the Speaker&#146;s Committee as he sees fit. Amendment 75 states that, in cases where the chief executive has designated a post as subject to a longer restriction period, this will supersede the one-year restriction.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000112"></a>I turn to Amendment 78. Noble Lords will be aware that the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 imposes a 10-year restriction on previous political activity for all Electoral Commission staff. Clause 7 reduces the restriction period from 10 years to five for the chief executive, and to one year for all other staff&#151;I hope as amended by my previous amendment.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000113"></a>The Boundary Committee for England is part of the Electoral Commission. However, the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill provides for a separate and independent boundary committee in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The Bill retains a 10-year restriction from previous political activity for boundary committee members and staff once the independent body is set up. This mirrors the existing 10-year restriction for all commission staff.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000114"></a>Government Amendment 78 seeks to exclude all Electoral Commission staff dealing with electoral boundary work from the reduced restrictions in Clause 7, because it is envisaged that most members of staff will transfer to the independent boundary committee, which we expect will be set up in April 2010. The commission estimates that 20 members of staff will transfer to the independent boundary committee. Commission staff perform certain functions relating to boundary work that have been transferred by secondary legislation from the Local Government Commission for England. These functions include the implementation of recommendations for a change in the law made by the boundary committee.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000115"></a>Finally, a small number of staff who currently assist with this work, albeit not on a full-time basis, will not transfer over as part of this process. The changes made by this amendment relate also to these categories of commission staff during the intervening period before the boundary committee is set up.</p>

I begin by apologising to the Committee for not having been here for the beginning of today&#146;s proceedings. I am therefore patricianly conscious that I should not try to plough a furrow that has already been ploughed in previous amendments and particularly under Amendment 74 from the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. Some of my foxes have been shot by the Minister in his opening remarks, but I have one or two small foxes still running across the fields, which I should like to pursue if I may.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000118"></a>My amendment is a probing amendment designed to raise the minimum period from one to three years in which staff of the commission may have been involved previously in political activity. The point was made by the Government and by many noble Lords from all sides of the House yesterday and today about the necessity of maintaining public confidence in the performance of the commission. It will be doubly damaging if, at a time of public cynicism, we set out to reform and improve the working of the commission and for reasons unforeseen at this stage fail to do so because it will be a quantitative uplift in public cynicism as a result. We discussed under an earlier amendment the mixture of politicians and people who are politically active as commissioners in an administrative body, and I raised concerns about that during my debate at Second Reading. Obviously, we have seen calls for restraint and a non-partisan view of those who are so selected from political parties.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000119"></a>I want to check one thing in relation to the Government&#146;s Amendment 77&#151;and I think I heard the Minister clearly&#151;in subsection (8) of the new section on the requirement to consult. The Minister seemed to make it clear in his remarks that the ultimate power in this lies with the chairman of the commission, who can discuss the matter with the Speaker&#146;s Committee but in the end, if he decides that the post is politically sensitive, it is his call and there is no gainsaying it.</p>

My issue relates to subsection (3) of the new section. It is not about seniority of posts but the political sensitivity of posts. A great range of posts within the commission will be politically sensitive at one point or another and it is

I am thinking not of senior but of younger people, who can be rash&#151;shall we say, rash or precipitate in their judgment of how they might take advantage of the information that they gain in performance of their duties within the commission? It might be someone who foolishly believed that he or she could advance his or her political career by gathering information of one sort or another. It may not even be a political career that he or she wants to advance; it might be a career in the media, for which the information would be very helpful indeed. Is there not some value in having a slightly longer minimum period of quarantine? I know not whether three years&#151;36 months&#151;is the right period, but a 12-month quarantine period is quite short. I have no wish to inhibit people developing their careers, within and without the commission, but there is an argument for having a slightly longer period of quarantine for people who want to work in the commission and at the same time have political affiliations.</p>

It is absolutely right that that should happen; I also think that it is right that they have to have that consultation with the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which, at the end of the day, will no doubt be the body that takes the decision. I have no doubt that the chief executive will listen with care to whatever the Speaker&#146;s Committee says. I wanted to make that point.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000125"></a>Having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, I want to make another point.

Junior members of staff will have a variety of tasks, perhaps. What I am concerned about is that if someone obtains access to information on a serendipitous basis, that person would not be the subject of the quarantine order, because the chief executive would see it in that way.

I go back to the point that I do not think there is an absolute relevance in that and hope that the chief executive would have the discretion and sense to ensure that anyone who has to deal with political issues has the experience to carry out that role.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000128"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09043028000477"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbots.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000129"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09043028000478"></a>Lord Henley:</b> Perhaps I may make one or two brief comments. We are sympathetic to these government amendments, but I ask the Minister to deal with one or two points. First, can he repeat what seems obvious to me: that this affects only the staff of the commission and in no way could these amendments at some future stage be used to affect the commissioners in relation to new subsection (3)? It would obviously be ridiculous if they began to be appointed by their party leaders. They could not be treated as if they were staff and found themselves excluded because of their political backgrounds. The noble Lord will obviously have no problem in repeating that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000130"></a>Secondly, I agree that it is useful that the chief executive has the power to vary the period as he wishes and that he should consult the Speaker&#146;s Committee. In the end, the final decision will be that of the chief executive. I should be grateful if the noble Lord repeated that. I take it, from my reading of the Bill, that the Speaker&#146;s Committee has no veto on the chief executive. No doubt, he or she would take appropriate advice if the Speaker&#146;s Committee had very strong views about what he was proposing.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000131"></a>Thirdly, it would be quite useful if the Minister gave some example of the times when he thought that the chief executive might wish to make use of this power to vary the period. I have some idea of my own, but I should be grateful if the Government gave their views as to when they thought it likely that the chief executive might exercise these powers.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000132"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09043028000479"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I wish to make a brief contribution. We, too, see the logic of clarifying these issues and we very much endorse what the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, said about the role of the chief executive. It is now easier to follow and clear. It is also important that the chief executive knows what the role is and to whom he or she is accountable on this issue. There was quite a lot of discussion about this at an earlier stage, and I think that this is now probably a sensible consensus and compromise.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000133"></a>However, it is important that those responsible in the commission for any form of enforcement are seen as a particular category. It may be that a longer period will be necessary for them, not just from a practical point of view but, as we have said in debate on other amendments today, from a perception point of view as well.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000134"></a>I listened very carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts. I understand his point about quarantine but I fear that, as the noble Baroness said, the length of time is less important than the mindset. You could stipulate that people should not have been involved in active politics for 15 years but the important point is their mindset when they come

Similarly, I am sad to say that if a young person has ambitions to become an investigative journalist, it will not matter how many years of restriction are imposed because that may not have any bearing. That person may not have had any political experience but may be extremely ambitious to join the team of the <I>Sunday Times</I>, to quote just one example. Whatever the case, I do not think that we should be deluded into thinking that time is the critical point. However, the noble Lord made a very important point about loyalty and commitment in the commission. If we do nothing else in this Committee and at later stages, we have to reinforce that point, if only because, with the appointment of the nominated party commissioners, we may look as though we are diluting the issue.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000135"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09043028000480"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I keep thinking of the Damian Green affair, where a civil servant had come straight from a political party, gone into a department and then acted improperly. I worry that the restriction period is too short and I think that the Government should consider an additional period in relation to employees.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000136"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09043028000481"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> Again, I understand the noble Lord&#146;s point, but whether that individual had been immune from direct party-political influence and activity for one year, three years or 10 years is immaterial. I shall try not to make any generalised comments but it would seem that anyone who takes on a responsible position within any administration, as in that case, or in an important regulatory body such as this and who goes in with a partisan view or with partisan ambitions&#151;a point made very well by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson&#151;is inappropriate for the task. It is a considerably difficult question, and it concerns recruitment and training as well as a check on previous experience. I give way.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000137"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09043028000482"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I am extremely grateful. The noble Lord raised the question of enforcement. I understand the point about senior enforcement officers but the enforcement case will be heard at quite a junior level. The information and documents will be put together and the case will be assembled not at a senior level but by a series of junior members of the commission. As I understand the drift of what the Minister is saying, some senior people will be picked out and will probably be given a longer quarantine period. I may be wrong but I do not read in the Minister&#146;s comments or body language that we are talking about adding to the quarantine period for those who deal with highly sensitive matters at quite a junior level.</p>

The commission has many other responsibilities but, when it comes to the specific task of enforcement, I think that the chief executive will be well advised to think very carefully about the so-called period of quarantine. However, the marker that I wanted to put down is that we need to be quite sure that we give guidance to those who set out the criteria. I think that we will all have to give that matter more thought before Report, and I hope that the Minister will do so too. However, whether the guidance should be in the form of the time limitations

The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, made the valid point that we do not want to see at any level of the commission people given important responsibilities that will have a direct relationship on how a party, or an individual within a party, is or is not the subject of any enforcement. It is an extremely important point that we should all think about between now and Report. It may be that Ministers will find a way of approaching this issue other than through the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000139"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09043028000484"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> I have little to add to what I have said but it is important to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, once again, for her input. She answered the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, very well and has completely stolen what I was going to say. But I shall say it again anyway. The issue of political sensitivity is covered by the proposed new sub-paragraph (3)(b) in Amendment 77. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that the issue is about the kind of people who will be recruited. When someone who has been politically active becomes a public servant, that individual has to have a change of mind because he is now a public servant. The restrictions, the varying times and so on are meant to help in that, but it is also about the way people think.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000140"></a>As to the direct route request, yes this applies only to the staff of the commission; yes it is correct that the final decision will be made by the chief executive; and no, I am afraid I do not have any examples at hand. The enforcement point is interesting and we will certainly think on it as a result of today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000141"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09043028000485"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Perhaps I may put a scenario to my noble friend. This is a real world question. Imagine a young socialist in a political party who does his 12 months and then joins the Electoral Commission. He is then involved in an inquiry into malpractice in another political party&#151;maybe the Liberal Democrats or the Conservative Party&#151;and has to make a recommendation about penalties or is involved in the making of that recommendation. Surely that is utterly wrong and must be avoided at all costs. So we either have to extend the limits, as proposed in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, or we have to introduce other criteria on the way in which the commission deals with these matters internally. We have to do that in the Bill, otherwise we will have problems in future.</p>

The power in this clause is to give the chief executive a reasonable and proportionate way of ensuring the impartiality that we all seek. The chief executive in his consultations will sensitively pick the appropriate post and create a structure that will provide public confidence. Over and above that, the essence on which our public life depends is that public officials act impartially in their role of working to their job descriptions and to the standards expected of them.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="09043028000367"></a>(1) Where the Electoral Commission makes a report to the Secretary of State under the provisions of section 6 of the 2000 Act, the Secretary of State shall respond in writing within a period of six months from the day of the publication of the report.</p>

I mention in passing, following yesterday&#146;s debate, that the commission is not required to report on institutions of government or institutions of the European Union. The commission may also be  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>required by the Secretary of State, under subsection (2), to review and submit reports on matters specified by the Secretary of State. The reports produced under the terms of this section are published in such a manner as the commission determines.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000147"></a>The areas covered are clearly important and relate to the commission&#146;s areas of expertise. However, Section 6 is silent about what happens to the reports once they have been published. There is no requirement for the Secretary of State to have regard to them, or even to respond to them. My amendment would ensure that, when the commission makes a report to the Secretary of State under the provisions of Section 6, the Secretary of State responds in writing within six months of the day of publication of the report.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000148"></a>The requirement to reply within six months is not onerous. Ministers seek to reply to Select Committee reports within two months of publication. In this House it used to be six months for committees other than the European Union Committee; but the Government recently agreed that it should be two months for all committee reports. The Government seek to respond to Law Commission reports within six months. I have opted for the more generous six-month period. If it is to be a statutory provision, that seems appropriate.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000149"></a>The second part of the amendment seeks to address the obvious objection to imposing a statutory time limit, namely that it may not always be possible to provide a substantive response in six months if the report is highly technical. My proposed new subsection (2) provides that if the Secretary of State is unable to respond within six months, he shall inform the Electoral Commission of that fact, and the reasons for it, not later than the day on which the response is due.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000150"></a>The provisions of the clause are not unduly onerous; indeed, they are open to the objection that they are not tight enough. However, they have the merit of imposing on the Secretary of State a duty to respond to reports from the Electoral Commission. Such a requirement is eminently sensible. It would bring Electoral Commission reports into line with Law Commission reports, and ensure not only that they are taken seriously by the Secretary of State, but are seen to be taken seriously&#151;an important element of transparency. If the commission believes that a matter is of such weight as to justify a report to the Secretary of State, or if the Secretary of State believes that a matter is of sufficient importance to require a report from the commission, there should be a requirement on the Secretary of State to provide a written response. The new clause imposes no requirement in terms of content; that must be a matter for the Minister, as is the case with responses to Select Committee and Law Commission reports. All that is required under this clause is that the Secretary of State must reply in writing; I believe that it imposes a useful&#151;indeed, a necessary&#151;discipline. I beg to move.</p>

It is absolutely right that if, in fact, the Electoral Commission has been asked to do a piece of work, that response must come. I am not sure whether six months is not a bit too long, but I shall go with the amendment. It is important that responses are received

If you leave it a year, you could have completely forgotten what the issue is about. To lay this down means that there has to be a response. The commission says that usually it does get responses, but there have been occasions when it has not. That is unacceptable. It is unfortunate, perhaps, if something needs to go into the Bill to say that that has to happen, but if that is necessary then so be it. The commission also makes the point that reports should be published under Sections 5 and 6 of PPERA. We should ensure that it covers all those points.</p>

I am not sure whether it is not that the present reporting regime has been inadequate as regards what the commission has or has not been doing, or whether it is the response that the Secretary of State has or has not made in a timely fashion that is at the centre or core of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. Either way, this is obviously an extremely helpful self-discipline, which otherwise is not really dealt with under Section 6 of the 2000 Act. The reviews set out under that section are very important; these are not trivial issues and, as the noble Baroness has said, leaving them too long unreported or unresponded to by the responsible Secretary of State would seem to leave a nagging doubt on whether action is being taken on important issues.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000153"></a>We warmly support the amendments and hope that the Minister will be prepared to take them on board either now or at Report in some other format, if that becomes essential. Either way, a bit of tightening up and tidying up is very timely.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000154"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043028000495"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I shall be brief but perhaps marginally more controversial. I completely support the amendment, although perhaps not for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, might appreciate. Sometimes the commission produces reports that are politically very inconvenient; they just do not suit the debate of the times. One particular report that I recall is the one it produced on individual registration, to which I am utterly hostile. It might in a few years&#146; time produce a report on electoral registration that shows that government policy is not being realised, which might suit the Government of that time, who might wish simply to ignore it and not respond positively to any recommendations that it might make that would lead to an increase in electoral registration. In wanting to avoid the potential political inconvenience, I strongly support the amendment.</p>

If the Secretary of State is unable to respond within that time frame, the amendment requires the Secretary of State to provide the commission with reasons no later than the six-month deadline.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000156"></a>The noble Lord was good enough to remind us what Section 6 said. It enables the Electoral Commission to submit reports to the Secretary of State on various matters, including elections, referendums, the redistribution  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of seats at parliamentary elections, the registration of political parties and the regulation of their income and expenditure; and the law relating to these matters. As he also told the Committee, the Electoral Commission publishes a significant number of reports. Some reports make recommendations to government, while some make recommendations for others, such as electoral administrators. A proportion of these reports does not make any recommendations at all, so it may not be necessary for government to respond to them.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000157"></a>We note that the Electoral Commission supports this amendment. I have been quick enough to say when it does not support an amendment, so it is only fair to say when it does&#151;although I am hardly surprised and understand absolutely its reasons for doing so, given where it sits. However, I hope that noble Lords will take the point that pressures on government time are significant and it is important that issues are prioritised. It could create a real burden on government resources if we were compelled to respond to all reports within six months of their issue, irrespective of their subject matter. Moreover, depending on the nature of the issues covered by a particular report, requiring a response in every case within six months could prejudice government&#146;s ability to consider the issues fully or engage with other stakeholders. I am sure that we can all agree that a fully considered response to a report that requires a response will be of more benefit than a response that is prompt but is less detailed in its analysis.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000158"></a>However, I am obliged to oppose the amendment on a more basic and fundamental ground&#151;</p>

That is a response which would fall neatly within the terms of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. If that is adding to bureaucracy, I pity the Minister and his department.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000166"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09043028000504"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Perhaps I could go on to what I considered my strongest point, which is that such a shift risks seriously moving the initiative in setting policy away from government and towards an independent regulator. That would be damaging to both government and to the commission. I shall rely on what the Committee on Standards in Public Life said in its 2007 report, which we talked about yesterday. It said that the Government should lead the development of policy on electoral matters. The committee recommended that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000369"></a>&#147;The Electoral Commission should no longer have a role in undertaking policy development in relation to electoral legislation. This function should be the responsibility of the appropriate Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09043028000325"></a>as it then was. The commission is a source of expertise and it is right that it shares it and offers its view to government. But to allow the publication of commission reports to dictate the focus of government policy making by requiring a policy decision to be taken one way or another in response to their recommendations is handing the initiative to the commission in a way that is wrong under our system, in which the elected Government of the day, whoever that might be, set the agenda.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000167"></a>I argue that the Government should be allowed the flexibility to respond to commission reports as they see fit within what they consider to be an appropriate timescale, taking account of the subject of the report and other priorities. There may be circumstances when the Government feel able, and consider it appropriate, to respond relatively quickly. In other cases, they may require a longer period to consider the recommendations of the report fully before making any decisions, either because of the nature of the report or due to other political issues. Therefore, we believe that a time limit of six months is inflexible.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000168"></a>Perhaps I may use one example to make my case. The commission&#146;s September 2008 report on electoral administration structures is a useful case study. It called, among other things, for the establishment of regional electoral management boards chaired by prominent local administrators and backed by statutory powers of direction. The commission&#146;s proposal has had a mixed response and, given that similar powers of direction already exist for the 12 regional returning officers for this June&#146;s European elections, the Government have decided to wait to see how effective the power of direction proves to be in that context so that we can take account of that important evidence. Therefore, it is difficult to see what purpose would have been served by requiring a government response in March 2009 when that data would not have been available.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000169"></a>In case there is any misunderstanding, we entirely support the view that considering commission reports fully is important. Often, a formal response will be required within an appropriate timescale, but the timescale will vary according to the nature of the report.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000170"></a>I remind the Committee that the department and the Government have a good relationship with the commission. Officials and Ministers regularly engage with it on issues of mutual concern and interest. Indeed, I met the commission&#146;s chairman and some of its senior officials yesterday morning. We take the commission&#146;s views and recommendations very seriously, but we do not believe that an amendment along these lines is necessary&#151;we think that the system works pretty well at present.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000171"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09043028000505"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I am tempted to ask the Minister whether he recognises that he is speaking out loud. I am very grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken in support of the amendment. The Minister will have noticed that he is somewhat isolated on the issue&#151;he is in a minority of two, with support from his fellow Minister&#151;and that, so far as I can determine, his arguments did not seem to persuade the rest of the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000172"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09043028000506"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I cannot help but have heard the strong arguments around the Committee on this issue. Although I have argued a case which I consider has some merit, I think that in these circumstances it is incumbent on the Government to think again about the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. I give no promise or guarantee at all that we will come back to the noble Lord with a positive answer but I tell him and the Committee that we will think again about this issue.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000173"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09043028000507"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. He has listened to the Committee. I think it is worth reiterating the point that I made, which has been supported elsewhere. The requirement to respond has no bearing on the content of the Minister&#146;s response. It is up to the Minister to determine how to respond, and therefore he is not being required to give a substantive response on policy. The six-month requirement is covered by the second part of the proposed new clause, which allows the Minister to say, &#147;I require more time&#148;, if that is necessary, but at least then the commission will be clear on that. Therefore, there is flexibility on the part of the Minister; the amendment merely requires his response.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000174"></a>The other point to stress is transparency. To some extent, the Minister spoke as though the commission reports were not published, but they are. It is for the Minister to respond but what that response is is entirely at the Minister&#146;s discretion. The amendment does not tie the Minister&#146;s hands except in ensuring that there is a response, which from the commission&#146;s point of view, given the seriousness of the issues with which it deals and the amount of work that it does, is important. On some issues, the department can say, &#147;This is not a matter for us&#148;, but I think that it is an important discipline and therefore I am very grateful for what the Minister has just said. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Currently, a declaration would be required for all donations above the reporting thresholds&#151;&#163;1,500 and &#163;7,500 depending on the recipient.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000178"></a>We support this proposal as a means to reduce the burden of compliance with the 2000 Act. This is effectively an alternative to the Opposition&#146;s proposal to increase the local reporting threshold, which is currently set at &#163;1,500 in the Bill. While that would undoubtedly reduce the burden of compliance, it would have an impact on transparency and, as such, we have decided that an increase in the threshold in Clause 8 is preferable. If it were ever moved, we would be bound to resist opposition Amendment 111. I note that the Electoral Commission opposes that amendment for similar reasons.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000179"></a>Balancing the importance of transparency and encouraging compliance with the reporting requirements of the 2000 Act with the twin, and also important, objective of minimising the regulatory burden of compliance is a delicate act. First and foremost, it is the Government&#146;s belief that transparency and effective regulation are vital to public confidence in the probity of our democratic and electoral systems: an objective to which all in this Committee would subscribe. But that is not to say that we are not sympathetic to the concerns expressed here and in another place about the challenge of compliance with the reporting requirements set out in the 2000 Act. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State said that compliance is key to supporting the effectiveness of, and public confidence in, the regime: it is not intended as a challenge in its own right.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000180"></a>We therefore agreed that, to balance the additional requirements in the Bill which are intended to increase the transparency and regulation of political party finance, we would in parallel support a measure to reduce the burden of compliance. Doing so by further increasing the thresholds for reporting donations was one option we considered, but concerns have been expressed that that would reduce the public transparency of political funding, and such a step might be detrimental to public confidence. That is why we have instead supported this proposal, which increases the level above which a declaration is required, stating whether or not a donation is the donor&#146;s own. Instead of the

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000181"></a>It should not be inferred from this change that the declaration is not of value, nor that the smaller donations need not comply with the same rigorous transparency requirements. The declaration requirement will help to shine a light on the true source of the most significant political donations by focusing the minds of those claiming to make the donation and those who are in receipt. Importantly, this will ensure that donors understand the legal requirements relating to permissible donors. Additionally, it will reduce the scope for donors to claim ignorance of the law, put in place by the 2000 Act, which seeks to ensure disclosure of the identity of the individual or body that is regarded by the Act as being the &#147;true&#148; donor.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000182"></a>Rather, the amendment before us today recognises the concern that the burden of reporting can be high, and seeks to address this concern in a way that is least damaging to transparency and thus to public confidence. I hope that this approach will gain the support of the Committee. I beg to move Amendment 80.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000183"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0005.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09043028000512"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for speaking to the government amendments and for touching on our Amendment 85, which the Government have also supported. Having heard his explanation, we accept the government amendments, which shows the value of seeking consensus and cross-party support for the various parts of the Bill. Having said that we accept the government amendments, I make it clear that I will not move my Amendments 81, 86, 92, 94, 96 and 111. However, I will take the opportunity to move Amendment 85, in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Bates, because I am buoyed up by the presence of the Minister&#146;s name on the amendment. I shall therefore move that amendment and trust that I will have the Government&#146;s support.</p>

However, I am quite happy with Amendment 85.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000185"></a>The government amendments are helpful and will result in a relaxation of the process, not in the sense of making life easy but by avoiding unnecessary burden. That should be an important subtext of all our purposes in considering the Bill in Committee. I am delighted to hear that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has decided not to move the amendments to which he referred because it would have been an unfortunate step to take. There was quite a lot of discussion at an earlier stage about the thresholds for this purpose. I think we have got it about right. Clearly it will have to be reviewed over the years because life moves on. Even now, when we have nil inflation, we assume that it will eventually return. As we understand it, the mechanism is there for that. If it is not, it can be dealt with by secondary legislation. In the mean time, we welcome the amendments and hope that we will make some progress together, as a Committee, in this direction.</p>

I have tried to be brief on other matters to which I have referred in Committee, but this is a very controversial area and the debate we are now having will be followed closely in the House of Commons, whence these amendments originally came.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000188"></a>This is an extremely important amendment which seeks to deal, in part, with a Linton loophole&#151;that is, a loophole that has been identified by Martin Linton during his considerable work on these matters over the past 20 years. These two amendments were originally tabled in the House of Commons and were supported by 216 Members. They were probably among the highest signature-endorsed amendments ever produced in the Commons. Yet, for all sorts of reasons that I hesitate to go into in detail during proceedings in this Committee, the matter was not debated in the Commons. Amendments 84 and 85, to which there were 216 signatories, were tabled by Mr Prentice and constituted the fourth group of amendments scheduled for debate out of a total of six on day two of proceedings on the Bill. The House had from 3.40 pm to deal with all six groups, and had to complete its consideration by 7 pm. That left three hours and 20 minutes to deal with these highly controversial areas of the Bill. The first three areas included limits on donations, caps on donations and unincorporated associations. Consideration of this group began at 5.20 pm and was interrupted at 7 pm under the programme Motion governing Report stage&#151;that was the amendment before this amendment could be called, with the result was that there was no debate in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000189"></a>Mr Prentice asked me whether I would move the amendments in this House, and I agreed. His argument is simple. He says: &#147;We in the Commons were denied the opportunity to discuss these matters, and we now rely on you in the House of Lords to give us in the Commons the opportunity to deal with these matters&#148;. He goes on to say that if the pay-roll vote had been free to add their signatures to this amendment, a  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>majority of the Commons would have supported the amendment. He is convinced that in a Division in the Commons, these amendments will go through. I bring these amendments to your Lordships&#146; House because the Commons was, under the programme procedure, denied the opportunity to debate and vote on these matters, and we should give them that opportunity; and because of the merits of the amendments.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000190"></a>The question is simple. Why should a person who does not pay tax in the United Kingdom, or is not liable to tax on their earnings in the United Kingdom, be denied the right to influence the election of the Government by making a substantial political donation? The answer is because, as individual citizens, we collectively pay our taxes in the belief that, having paid them, we have the right to influence how they are used. The payment of, and liability for, tax gives us and not others the right to decide. It is our money, not theirs. It is for us to decide which Government should be in place to spend the money raised from us as citizens through taxation. Those who are not liable to taxation are not entitled, through the use of their money, to influence the Government that is in place to decide how our taxes are spent. Why should a person who is not liable for tax in the United Kingdom influence the use of taxpayers&#146; money paid by those who are liable for tax?</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000191"></a>I will exaggerate to make my point. If a Hungarian billionaire philanthropist, entrepreneur, oligarch, public benefactor&#151;whatever you want to call him or her&#151;acquires British residency, buys a home in London, spends most of his or her time abroad, refuses to make himself or herself liable for tax in the United Kingdom and then offers a political party a &#163;10 million donation, should a UK political party be permitted to accept it? The public would be appalled, the political party would be discredited and Parliament&#146;s credibility would be further undermined.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000192"></a>As I understand it, that can happen under the law as it stands. The argument therefore turns on where we draw the line. What does the Prentice amendment do? It would make it unlawful for any person who is not a UK resident for tax purposes and is not a non-domicile UK resident to make a substantial donation to a political party. The higher limit of donations would be defined in law.</p>
<h5><a name="09043028000425"></a>2.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90430-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000193"></a>The amendment is based on a simple principle: if you want to donate, you have to be liable to tax. Of course, there are limitations on that. If a person is not ordinarily resident, they are liable for tax only on income which arises in the United Kingdom and only a person who can spend 183 or more days in the UK is a UK resident under the six-month rule. Also, someone will be regarded as a resident if they come to the United Kingdom regularly and after four tax years they visit during those years on an average of 91 days or more a year. I am sure that if I am wrong legally on these matters, I will be corrected, but I have tried to source that material as accurately as I can. If I need to be corrected on the detail, then others should do so.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90430-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000194"></a>We do know that these non-UK taxpayers can have a huge impact on the outcome of general elections. As the Rowntree report published last year, <I>Purity </I><I>of Elections in the United Kingdom C</I><I>ause</I><I>s:</I><I> for </I><I>C</I><I>oncern</I>, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000373"></a>&#147;There is substantial evidence to suggest that money could have a powerful impact on the outcome of general elections, particularly where targeted at marginal constituencies over sustained periods of time&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000326"></a>I will not get into the names of people or even the parties involved because that is irrelevant to this debate, but one noble Lord who lives offshore refuses to make himself liable to tax in the United Kingdom. He converted a &#163;3 million loan into a gift to a political party and then went on to donate a further &#163;100,000 to that party and an additional &#163;30,000 to a mayoral election campaign. Do we really believe that that is acceptable? As the Electoral Commission, which has got it right for once said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000374"></a>&#147;The permissibility requirements in the 2000 Act are intended to ensure that only people and organisations with a close relationship to the UK can donate to political parties. It is for Parliament to decide if this is appropriate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000327"></a>That is precisely what we are doing with this amendment.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000195"></a>In a spirit of frankness, I should say that the Electoral Commission has allegedly expressed some reservations over the workability and proportionality of the Prentice amendment. But the enlightened Mr Prentice has considered its reservations and come up with a solution to the problems. He suggests that a donor simply ticks a box on his or her tax return and then the Electoral Commission needs only to certify with the Inland Revenue that that is the case&#151;that a ticked tax return has been received. I cannot see how such a simple solution can be described as disproportional, particularly when such a donation could influence the result of a general election. Some people believe that such donations have influenced the results of general elections. Of course, it would apply only when donations exceeded a threshold laid down in regulation.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000196"></a>I now draw the attention of the Committee to a letter from the House of Lords Appointments Commission to Mr Tony Wright, chairman of the Public Administration Committee, announcing changes to the selection criteria for Peers of the realm. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000375"></a>&#147;I am writing to notify you of a slight strengthening of the selection criteria which the Appointments Commission will in future use when assessing nominees for non-party-political peerages. The Commission has agreed these changes as part of its review of policies and procedures and in the light of experience&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000328"></a>A copy of the press notice is then attached which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000376"></a>&#147;The Commission also wants to strengthen the existing requirement that a nominee should be resident in the UK for tax purposes, and be willing to confirm his or her acceptance of the requirement to remain so. This strengthening will also be reflected in our vetting criteria for future party-political and other nominations for peerages&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000329"></a>Surely, if the appointment to the Lords requires UK residency for tax purposes and a liability to tax within the United Kingdom, it must follow that donations of millions of pounds to political parties, which could influence whole general elections&#151;elections to the elected House, the House of Commons&#151;must at the least have the same tax liability requirements.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000197"></a>Finally, I turn to the response of the Government on these matters. They have circulated a document. I do not know how widely it was circulated, but it was sent to Members of Parliament in the House of Commons, certainly to Labour MPs, and perhaps even wider. However, I shall place it on the record because it is it is in the public interest. It is headed:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000377"></a>&#147;Tax status and donations: Gordon Prentice amendments. Two amendments have been tabled by Gordon Prentice MP to make political donations from individuals who do not pay full UK tax illegal ... there are a number of practical problems&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000330"></a>Paragraph 1 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000378"></a>&#147;The amendments would not prevent non-UK taxpayer donations. The amendments as tabled would not in practice prevent political donations from non-UK taxpayers, as they could use other routes&#151;such as companies or unincorporated associations&#151;to pass on funds ... These amendments would not affect company donations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000331"></a>My response to that is very simple. Why do the Government&#151;presumably the Government were behind the document that I am now reading&#151;table amendments to deal with the deficiencies in that area of these amendments? I invite my noble friend to consider with his officials and other Ministers in the department whether it would be possible to table amendments on Report to deal with the deficiencies identified.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000198"></a>I had a conversation with the Justice Secretary Mr Jack Straw about the matters raised in the next paragraph and he raised exactly these issues with me. Paragraph 2 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000379"></a>&#147;The amendments would create an anomaly in rules regarding democratic participation. The amendments would allow a non-UK taxpayer to stand for election, collect and receive political donations, vote in elections and potentially sit in a democratically elected body. But the same individual would be barred from donating money&#151;even to their own campaign. There is no coherent reason for this discrepancy,&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09043028000332"></a>say the Labour Government&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000409"></a>&#147;and indeed such a move would be open to legal challenge on the grounds of unjustifiable difference of treatment. If there is a desire to tackle the residence and tax status of donors, it is preferable to do so in a broader context&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000333"></a>That is an interesting phrase. The document continues:</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000410"></a>&#147;Tackling the issue in a broader way means that any risk of legal challenge would be minimised&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000334"></a>So why do we not do that? Why do we not table an amendment on Report that tackles the matter in a broader way to deal with the concerns expressed in paragraph 2 of this document which has been circulated on behalf of the Labour Government&#151;my party in Government?</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000199"></a>Paragraph 3 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000380"></a>&#147;The amendments would be impractical and burdensome. An additional reason for opposing the amendment is that, as things currently stand, it would be very difficult to deliver in practice. This is particularly the case given the concerns surrounding confidentiality of tax data and the fact that such data are not readily verifiable (ascertaining whether a person is resident in the UK for tax purposes would in most cases require a specific investigation). Whereas at present political parties can fulfil their compliance duty to check that an individual is on the electoral roll, or a company is registered at Companies House, by consulting public records&#151;obliging parties to check the tax/residence status of donors would be an impossible task. Tax records are not public documents and in any event there is no single record of individuals&#146; tax status&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09043028000335"></a>We are not asking the public to have access; we are asking the Electoral Commission to go to the Revenue to check whether it would be compliant with the law in the event that it were to be incorporated in the law in the way that I suggest in the amendments.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000200"></a>This opens up the further question of what would happen if a party was shown to have accepted an impermissible donation some time after the event. It would presumably be required to pay the money back, despite never having been able to verify whether the donation was permissible in the first place. Such a scenario would undermine the confidence of political parties, as well as the public, in the regulatory system. I would have thought that it would concentrate the minds of parties, that they would want to be sure that it was a permissible donor donating the money, and that it was within the law. It would probably make the parties extra diligent. I know that the Liberal Party, for a period, had some difficulties in this area and, on reflection, I am sure that it regretted what happened. But the point is that it must have concentrated its mind so that in the future it would not find itself in that difficulty again, as indeed is the case. We have all learnt from what happened over the Liberal experience. Let us tighten up the law in the way I am suggesting because we can make it work.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000201"></a>I say to my noble friends, I do not know where this document came from, but it must have something to do with the Government. It is a criticism of the amendment and it certainly did not come from the Conservative Party. On the basis of the document here and the reservations expressed, why do we not table amendments on Report that deal with all these matters and then deal with the concerns expressed by 216 Members of Parliament of all political persuasions, not including the payroll vote? If this House carries the amendment when finally we divide on it&#151;as we will do on the Floor of the House&#151;the House of Commons will have the opportunity of deciding on something that it wants to decide on. I believe that it is the function of the House of Lords to give it every opportunity to do so. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000202"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043028000517"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I and my noble friend Lord Rennard have added our names to Amendments 82 and 84 for a number of reasons. I shall, as briefly as possible, add to what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has already said and try to emphasise one or two additional points.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000203"></a>First, I entirely endorse what he says about the extent of support within the House of Commons and the totally inadequate lack of attention to this issue because of the way in which the legislation was so-called &#147;programmed&#148;. Old-fashioned politicians like me used to think of it as guillotining. The only point on which I differ from the noble Lord is that I think it was 218 members who signed the amendment; a very substantial number.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000204"></a>To pick up on one extremely important point that the noble Lord made towards the end of his speech, all parties would benefit from this situation being sorted out. What happened in the past has gone; we have all had unfortunate experiences in this field; the sooner this issue is cleaned up and it becomes absolutely apparent to the public that it has been  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC146"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>addressed, the better. It is not going to be retrospective, but the lessons of the past should be informing us for the future.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000205"></a>We, too, believe that it is a matter of principle that those whose commitment to the United Kingdom stops short of making a substantial contribution to its economy through their tax should not be put in a privileged position. It is surely the greatest irony that you can save a bit of money by being a tax exile, and then you can use it to invest in the United Kingdom political parties to try to reduce the tax burden, perhaps, on non-doms. It is extremely important that we find ways to deal with this issue. To me, tax is the rent we pay to live in a civilised society. It is part of being a citizen of the United Kingdom or any other democracy.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000206"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, referred to the Rowntree report. I do not intend to follow him in detail, but I drew that report to the attention of the House in a Question some months ago. We are still awaiting a considered response from the Government to that extremely important report, which raised very substantial issues about the way in which the political system is seen and the extent to which individuals in our society feel disenchanted and disengaged from the political system, because of the power of money&#151;not least in terms of the power of foreign money.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000207"></a>The noble Lord referred to the views of the Electoral Commission and I take seriously the fact that it recognises the purpose of what we are seeking to achieve, but has some concerns about its application. It is clearly a problem that it is impossible for any regulatory body to take a retrospective view of. Were they a tax exile last year or are they a tax exile this year? However, ways can be found around that. If there is a practical way, as the noble Lord said, for the Appointments Commission to look at this issue in relation to nominations to this House, and if that is seen to be a perfectly legal, unchallengeable way to assess the tax status of an individual, why, for goodness&#146; sake can that not be used in the same way?</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000208"></a>There are two subsidiary issues to which the noble Lord has not referred. As he pointed out, small donations might well fall outside this particular restriction, for reasons that we all understand. However, as I understand it from the briefing that was repeated to me from the Electoral Commission, which I received before Second Reading, if each individual donation is &#163;1 less than the threshold, and the donation is made at that level every week of the year and goes, in aggregate, way over the top of the threshold, it would not be caught in terms of reporting and checking the origin of those donations. That cannot be right. I had hoped that having raised this at Second Reading the Minister and his team would have found a way of closing what is, at least apparently, a loophole. If it is an apparent loophole for the Electoral Commission, it must surely be one that we should take very seriously, because it would be crazy if the aggregate donation over the full 365 days of the year turned out to be dramatically more than Parliament and government intend in terms of the threshold. I hope that the noble Lord can respond to that in particular. As I have said, I raised that at Second Reading; I did not receive an answer then and I was hopeful that we would have received a substantial amendment to deal with it now.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000209"></a>On the other question to which I should like to draw attention, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, mentioned the question of companies that might be in the control of an otherwise impermissible donor. The answer to that is of course in Amendment 89, to which he may care to add his name, in the name of my noble friend Lord Rennard and myself, and in Amendment 90. Both amendments deal with this issue. We will come to them in due course, but it is not impossible to deal with that perfectly justified point. We do not want a way whereby particular donors are excluded as individuals, but they find a route round that simply by having a company which enables them to make donations in a way that would be illegitimate in terms of the amendment and, I hope, the eventual legislation that we pass.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000210"></a>We have a great deal of sympathy with the points that have been raised, not just by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, but by a huge number of others outwith politics. These are not just political animals saying that this system is being cheated, it is of a real concern to the interested public, and that was very apparent from the Rowntree report. We hope that the Minister, even if he cannot do so today, will recognise the strength of feeling among Members of both Houses&#151;and rightly so, because the present situation is not sustainable, and the public knows it is not sustainable. The public believes that it is yet one more reason why we have what is now being referred to as a reputational crisis in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000211"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09043028000518"></a>Lord Henley:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, will not be surprised to learn that he does not have my support on his amendments. I shall be relatively brief in dealing with the arguments that he put at considerable length, but there are three important points to make.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000212"></a>First, and I think that the Minister would agree with me, these are matters where we should proceed by consensus. The parts of this Bill that are working best are those where consensus has come into it, as the Minister acknowledged earlier. Secondly, we already have strict rules which deal with controlling who can and cannot donate to political parties. If there is a concern about large donors having a disproportionate influence on the political process, which is in effect what the noble Lord is worried about, that is a matter that in my party&#146;s belief should be addressed by a comprehensive cap on donations. That, as the noble Lord is well aware, would have to affect not only firms and individuals but also the trade unions. If the noble Lord was prepared to go down that route, he might find that some consensus was possible, but I suspect that he and the Government would not like to see their political masters, the trade unions, denied making the contribution that they wish to make to their party.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000213"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09043028000519"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> How would we manage to regulate a multiplicity of &#163;50,000 donations coming in from some obscure part of the world?</p>

<p><a name="09043028000214"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09043028000520"></a>Lord Henley:</b> That is not a matter for me to address at this stage. I noted what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said about a whole series of individual donations coming in in different weeks. If we could reach an agreement on a comprehensive cap, I have no doubt  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that some such means could be found to do it. If the noble Lord wishes to have a comprehensive cap, it must be not just on individuals but on individuals, firms and trade unions&#151;the noble Lord has to accept that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000215"></a>Thirdly, I go back to the point on which he quoted the Justice Secretary. Confidentiality is very important in relation to individuals&#146; relations with Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs. I understand that HM Revenue &amp; Customs currently has no power to release data of this kind to other bodies, because of confidentiality.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000216"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09043028000521"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I am listening with great interest to the noble Lord, but does he accept that that principle has been blown to smithereens by the Appointments Commission for this House, which is presumably given access to that precise information?</p>

<p><a name="09043028000217"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09043028000522"></a>Lord Henley:</b> It might have been blown to smithereens on that one point but it still exists here. It is a valid point that has to be borne in mind.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000218"></a>I go back to my first and second points, which are the more important. We need a consensus and, if the noble Lord&#146;s real concern is the disproportionate influence coming from individual donors, the route that he should look at is a cap on donations, which must affect all bodies and not just individuals.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000219"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09043028000523"></a>Lord Pearson of Rannoch:</b> As a fundraiser for the UK Independence Party, I find these amendments inconvenient. However, I also find them largely persuasive. At Second Reading, I asked the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about the possibility of a large number of cumulative donations of &#163;7,499 coming in by standing order. That is not a problem that the Committee has resolved, and it is clearly unacceptable.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000220"></a>Perhaps I may ask the noble Lords, Lord Campbell-Savours and Lord Tyler, one or two questions. Under these amendments, what would be the position of a UK-resident taxpayer donating through an unincorporated UK association? Have they thought of that? I refer to a genuine UK-resident taxpayer, from whom a donation is currently permissible. Under the amendment, would that situation continue to apply?</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000221"></a>Secondly, I did not want to come here as the usual Euro-bore that I am in your Lordships&#146; House, but I ask the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, whether he has thought about European law with regard to the amendment. I may be wrong but, as I understand it, under European law, European Union companies and individuals are able to donate in this country in a way that companies and individuals from outside the European Union are not. I apologise if I am setting off a false hare but it is an area that the noble Lord should think about, especially as we go forward. I do not mind betting that if it is not law at the moment, it will be fairly soon. Those are my two questions.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000222"></a>On the subject of trade unions, which I do not suppose will be popular with&#151;</p>

The question of unincorporated organisations is dealt with in the Bill. I understand that they are subject to new restrictions.</p>

I hope not to irritate my erstwhile Conservative friends too much, but a trade union is a collective of British resident taxpayers and therefore I cannot see why it would not fall within the ambit of the amendment. Nevertheless, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the Front Benches generally can reach agreement on this matter. I look forward to the answer on my European point and support these amendments in general.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000225"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09043028000526"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I recognise the powerful, if emotional, appeal made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. Some aspects of what he is thinking about are more complicated than they first appear. I am not sure that membership of your Lordships&#146; House is a good comparator with the ability to vote. He prayed in aid the new Appointments Commission procedures. It seems to me that, when appointing one of 750 members of a legislature, you will have a higher, or different, standard than for someone who will be one of 50 million voters, because the influence is much greater.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000226"></a>There are two practical points for the noble Lord to bear in mind. The first is that we recognise that a large proportion of our population&#151;often the most talented part&#151;may serve overseas for a period of time. I lived in the United States for five years, and so do many other people. In your period of overseas service, you may cease to be resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom. Those people who intend to return to the United Kingdom should not in those circumstances be precluded from participating in our elections. That is recognised by the fact that you can continue to vote if you live overseas for 15 years&#151;it used to be 20 years&#151;by remaining on the register here. The noble Lord should address that issue.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000227"></a>The second point is the question of residency and domicile for tax purposes. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, and I were in this Room on Tuesday afternoon discussing perpetuities and accumulations. Residence and domicile for tax purposes is almost as complicated as perpetuities and accumulations. The simple issue of being resident for tax purposes is not a permanent state; you may drop in and out of being resident for tax purposes along the way. Therefore, I am not sure that his case will work in a practical way.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000228"></a>I do not wish to sound as though I am trying to deride every proposal. I hope that when we get to Amendment 108, which talks about a cap on donations and provides a blanket answer to the particular problem that he proposes, the noble Lord will be prepared to speak in favour of it as being at least a halfway house to what he is seeking to achieve here.</p>

I complimented him on the fact that he was participating in this Committee and was here the whole time, and I thought that the Committee gained enormously from his doing so. He reminded me that he periodically moved amendments which, to borrow the language of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, I might find inconvenient. I said it was perfectly true that I had had quite a lot of those, not only in business such as this but also in business relating to the City of Westminster.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000232"></a>I want to make two generic points about the opening speech of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. The first, I remark in passing, relates to parliamentary procedure. I totally understand the unhappiness about the inability of the Commons to debate and vote on the issue that we are discussing now. However, when I was a Whip in the Government between 1979 and 1983, on no less than three occasions we sat for between 100 and 135 hours and did not guillotine the Bill; in other words, we did what the House of Lords does&#151;we looked at absolutely the whole Bill. I recognise that in the ensuing 20 years Governments have found that pattern of behaviour inconvenient, and of course the right to guillotine was always available to us, had we chosen to use it. However, it is slightly disingenuous of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, to complain about the outcome in the House of Commons when it is the Government that he supported in the House of Commons who introduced programming that I personally consider to be a flagrant interference with the right of the elected House. I think that the noble Lord wants to interrupt me.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000233"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09043028000530"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> If I had still been in the elected House, I would have voted against it and spoken against it with passion.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000234"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09043028000531"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I have no difficulty at all in recognising that fact. It is obviously worth referring to in the context of how this amendment has arrived here but I do not think that it can be blamed on the Official Opposition. Fortunately, scrutiny in the House of Lords is automatically available. It is one of the glories of the House of Lords that that is so. I do not in the least begrudge the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, bringing forward this amendment, and I think it is a very good thing on behalf of the nation that we should have the opportunity to scrutinise it.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000235"></a>The second thing of a generic nature to which I wanted to allude was his observation about the advice that had, I gather, been offered to Labour MPs, although I know not whencesoever it came and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, was not able to tell us. The commission briefing on the subject, while pointing out some of the difficulties, makes it quite clear that the issue that we are debating is a matter for Parliament and not for itself. The commission states that it is not for it to make a judgment on the issue.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000236"></a>In the context of the advice, I shall briefly recount a conversation that I once had with a Permanent Secretary of a department in which I was serving as a Minister. We had been contemporary undergraduates, so we knew each other very well in a private capacity. He said that politicians of both parties&#151;I think the Labour Party is a little more prone to this than the Conservative Party, but there is no question that my party is prone to it as well&#151;are extremely resistant to what they regard as negative advice given to them when they come into office, when civil servants tell them why what they want to do is impracticable. He said that they are making a mistake because members of the Civil Service are themselves part of the Government, and they take pride in the manner in which business is conducted because they are paid from the public purse.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000237"></a>The civil servants have two preoccupations. First, if a Minister does not listen to all the arguments against what he is proposing to do, there can be a moment when he is caught out at the Dispatch Box. That could happen even at the Second Reading of a Bill on which the Minister has intervened on dozens of occasions. He has to look at difficulties contained in the Bill which he has never considered before because he has brushed aside the advice that he has received. That is embarrassing for the civil servants sitting in the Box, who have no way of advising him.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000238"></a>Secondly, it is worse when a Government do not take advice in the early stages and then find themselves having to retreat in midstream from the legislation on which they have embarked and start again. It is infinitely easier to prepare legislation over six to nine months than to suddenly have to produce it in a month, to which there has previously been some allusion even in this Committee.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000239"></a>I do not think that the Government are wrong to point out the difficulties of doing certain things. It is the right thing to do so that everyone taking part in the debate on the legislation knows what the real practical difficulties are. I say that on behalf of people who have been in government in both major parties.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000240"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09043028000532"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The intention behind Amendments 82 and 84 is to seek to tie the ability of an individual to make a political donation to his or her taxation status. In order to be considered a permissible donor, the 2000 Act requires that an individual must be registered in an electoral register. Amendment 82 would introduce two further conditions or requirements. First, the individual would have to be resident in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007; and, secondly, that individual would have to not be a non-domiciled United Kingdom resident. Amendment 84,  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC152"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in turn, would require a donor to affirm that these two additional conditions are met under any statement made as to the source of a donation, as will be required under the provisions of Clause 8.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000241"></a>As the Committee has heard, identical amendments were tabled in the other place but were not reached. It goes without saying that the Government recognise the force of support that these amendments enjoy in another place. I can confirm, and do so, that we understand the argument that the ability of an individual to participate in the democratic processes of this country should be linked to their taxation status in a broad sense. But if these amendments were passed, that would not introduce any further controls on donations from other permissible donors&#151;for example, from companies, and I shall come back to companies in a moment, and non-incorporated bodies. It could therefore have the effect of diverting these donations through other, less transparent routes.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000242"></a>The amendments that we are to deal with later in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, Amendments 89, 90 and 142, seek, as I understand it, to prevent people who are not allowed to vote in local, parliamentary and European elections, and companies controlled by those people and other impermissible donors, from giving political donations. The qualification is not linked to the tax status of individuals or companies; it is the right to vote that the amendments will deal with, rather than the tax that they pay.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000243"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, asked about companies donating under European law. To donate, a company must be incorporated in the UK or in an EU member state, but must still carry on business in the United Kingdom. That is at Section 54(2)(b) of PPERA. Effectively, the amendment, even if carried, would not achieve the clear objective that it appears intended to achieve.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000244"></a>My noble friend asked the perfectly proper question of why the Government do not add an amendment to that effect. In order to donate to UK political parties, companies have to be registered and carry on business in the UK. The Government acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed about the scope for evasion of the ban on foreign donations contained in these provisions. As we have indicated throughout&#151;and I shall say a little more about this later&#151;the Government are of course willing to discuss how these provisions might be improved and are willing to hear representations on the best way forward. However, we believe that we should move forward on any proposals for better regulation in this area, if we can, on the basis of consensus. We think that in the long term that is much the best solution.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000245"></a>There are wider issues to consider than those that the amendments would address. We are concerned&#151;and it is a fair concern&#151;that if these wider issues are not looked at, we risk creating a constitutional anomaly. The amendments tabled by my noble friend seek to prevent those who do not pay certain types of tax in this country from donating in their individual capacity to a political party or other regulated recipient. However, they do not attempt to prevent those same people from participating in a very active way in our democracy in a number of significant ways, including by voting,  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sitting in our legislature and standing as a candidate to sit in our legislature. That would be a significant anomaly for which there would be, on the face of it, no obvious explanation. Because of the concern about the potential for creating constitutional anomalies, which we should try not to create if we can help it, we believe that broader consideration is needed of the relationship between, on the one hand, an individual&#146;s right to civic and democratic participation and, on the other hand, their responsibilities and, in particular, their taxation status.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000246"></a>Noble Lords may be aware&#151;and let me tell them if they are not&#151;that we approached the Committee on Standards in Public Life to suggest that it might want to consider the issue. However, we were advised that the work programme of the committee does not allow it to pursue the matter at present. We are continuing to reflect on how best to take forward this very important matter.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000247"></a>We are, however, clear that it would be wrong to tie democratic rights in one area to taxation status, as the amendments propose, while leaving other democratic rights unfettered. Let me deal with some of the significant practical and legal difficulties which mean that the amendments proposed might not work in their current form. I shall mention briefly a few of these.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000248"></a>First, the amendments raise real practical difficulties, which cannot be wished away, about how a recipient party or the Electoral Commission would be able to verify whether or not what a donor told them about their taxation status was accurate. Coming to a sustainable view about whether or not someone is resident or domiciled in the UK for tax purposes raises complex issues that it may be difficult for either a party or the commission&#151;both may be involved&#151;to resolve on their own without expending considerable time and, potentially, money. An individual&#146;s taxation status is essentially retrospective&#151;a tax return is normally submitted at the end of a financial year&#151;and it might, therefore, be difficult at a point of time in the middle of a year to determine what an individual&#146;s tax status is.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000249"></a>One way to deal with this might be to enable information about taxation status to be shared among key stakeholders in the process. Information on whether an individual is resident and/or domiciled in this country for taxation purposes is currently held only by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in certain circumstances. HMRC does not collect data on residence and domicile status unless it is relevant to an individual&#146;s tax calculation, and it does not hold a list of individuals who are non-resident or non-domiciled. It may be that for the proposal to be fully effective, HMRC would need to collect additional information specifically for this purpose in addition to any information it currently holds. The Electoral Commission or others would want to be able to access this information, whether it be routinely or on a more limited basis.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000250"></a>I hardly need to tell the Committee that the confidentiality and data-sharing implications of any proposal to tie residency to donation permissibility would at the very least have to be carefully considered given Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#146; statutory duty to preserve taxpayer confidentiality. I note that the Electoral Commission has expressed concerns about  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the workability of the proposal in its briefing note on the Bill ahead of the debate. It is worth quoting what it says about this aspect. The commission states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000381"></a>&#147;In order to assess whether any donation from an individual is permissible, the recipient would need access to authoritative information about that individual&#146;s tax status. The Commission would also need access to that information to confirm compliance. We think it highly unlikely that this will be achievable in practice or (if so) that the resulting burden on regulated entities and on HM Revenue and Customs would be proportionate&#148;.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000251"></a>I should also note that at present many people are potentially unaware of the concept of domicile or their domicile status because it is not relevant to their tax affairs. For example, domicile is irrelevant if you have no overseas income. Under this amendment people unaware of their domicile status could unwittingly commit an offence by giving to a political party.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000252"></a>My second practical point, if that is the right expression, is that following the changes made in the 2008 Budget, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a commitment that there would be no further substantial changes to the taxation regime for resident non-domiciles in the rest of this Parliament or the next. Any change to the rules on permissibility of donations should be mindful of this commitment.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000253"></a>Finally, we must also consider any legal implications arising from a proposal further to limit the ability to participate in our electoral system, whether through a narrow limitation on the ability to make donations or something wider on participation more generally.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000254"></a>It is possible&#151;I do not say that it is inevitable, but it is possible&#151;that the proposals in this area would touch on some key principles. For example, any limitation on participation may well raise issues relating to Article 10 of the ECHR, the right to freedom of expression, and Article 11, the right to freedom of association. We must bear in mind that this amendment proposes a restriction that would apply to UK citizens who happen not to be resident in the UK for various tax purposes. Any proposal that seeks to limit the right to democratic participation of a UK citizen, whether it is in this field of donation or any other, will require particularly careful scrutiny and may raise legal issues for which there may be little established precedent. So I hope that the Government can be forgiven for acting here with some caution.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000255"></a>Any potential legal issue will almost certainly be complicated by focusing only on donations, rather than by taking a more consistent approach across the board towards the issue of tax status and participation in politics more generally. These matters may be complex and it is clearly sensible to take the proper amount of time to examine them with the care that they deserve. I do not consider that a task of that detail and potential complexity can safely be completed during the timetable allowed for by this Bill.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000256"></a>There are many other points to bear in mind, some of which have been raised during this debate and which the Government will reflect on in taking forward work on this complex issue. I thank my noble friend for raising this issue in the way that he has and for giving us the opportunity to have this debate, which, I suspect, we may in some way or another come back to at a later stage of the Bill.</p>

That is relevant not only to this discussion but also to the wider one in which we are engaged.</p>

We could lower the threshold, but if we were to do so it would be a disproportionate administrative burden. The noble Lord, as I look at him from quite a long way off, does not seem entirely satisfied by what I have said and so I offer to write to him with an answer before the next stage of these proceedings.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000259"></a>I had almost finished what I was going to say. It is for the aforementioned reasons that the Government cannot support the amendments. I hope that my noble friend at least realises that we consider this to be a very important matter, to which I know we will return at a later stage.</p>

I do not want to be rude to noble Lords, but I shall be quite brief in dealing with them. What my noble friend has said will now be pored over in the House of Commons. His contribution to the debate today will be that which Members of Parliament at the other end will want to read in some detail; indeed, it will be widely circulated.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000261"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09043028000536"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I suspect that Members of Parliament may also want to read what the noble Lord said.</p>

It is clear that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, understands the politics of this at the other end; he has obviously been well briefed by his colleagues. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, used the &#163;50,000 argument without explaining how it is possible to police foreign donations if they are capped at &#163;50,000. It is utterly impossible, unless you have policemen all over the world checking up on inter-company and inter-family relationships.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000263"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, presses me on Europe. I have to tell him that my interest in Europe is not as detailed as his, as we know from his weekly interventions at Question Time. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, raised an important issue: the whole question of how we legislate. He may be interested to know that this recommendation came from a report, sponsored by the IPPR, written some 16 years ago entitled <I>Money and Votes</I>. Among its recommendations is that donations from overseas sources should be banned with three exceptions: registered overseas votes; allocations from parliamentary groups and the European Parliament; and donations below &#163;1,000. Therefore, there has been a longstanding argument over many years on the need for reform in this area.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000264"></a>I turn to the comments of my noble friend Lord Bach. I noted that his brief closely followed mine&#151;that is, the one that I received from my colleagues, which was circulated in the House of Commons. Clearly, it must have come from the Government, because even the order in which the points were raised was very similar to the order of the points in the document that I read to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000265"></a>On my noble friend&#146;s point about the release of information from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue &amp; Customs, is he aware of the NTC project? It is referred to in the document that he was not too happy with, produced by Rowntree. He may remember the debate about two weeks ago on the Floor of the House in which he commented on his reservations about the Rowntree report. I cannot remember the name of the report but it referred to NTC projects which provide HMRC tax-credit data to local authority housing departments. Therefore, there is obviously a process whereby HMRC is able, certainly in the case of housing benefit, to provide information to departments outside HMRC.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000266"></a>My noble friend said that the Government are continuing to reflect on these matters. In the event that this amendment were agreed in the House of Lords, they would have to reflect very fast. I understand that, if it goes back to the other House, Members will want to vote on it unless the Government come up with some alternatives, so they might want to get a move on and sort out an alternative approach, rather than put the Commons in a position where they might have to vote on the amendments that I have tabled here today.</p>

I am afraid that a few words of criticism did cross my lips on that report.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000268"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09043028000539"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> The reference to the interflow of data between various organisations within government appears in the section dealing with data-matching. Of course, the Government&#146;s case is that through data-matching they will be able to make the system of individual registration more effective. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We now move on to what will be new Section 54A, which is inserted via Clause 8 and relates to declarations as to source of donation. Our amendments are designed merely to provide some sort of protection for those who have a duty to make such a declaration. The first one changes the words from,</p>

The second amendment leaves out in line 41 &#147;or recklessly&#148;, so it has to be quite clear that a person knowingly makes a false direction and there is no question of recklessly. To underline that particular point, after that we insert a new subsection to make it clear that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000383"></a>&#147;A person does not commit an offence if it can be reasonably proven that the person had no intention of making, or by innocent mistake made, a false declaration under this section&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000337"></a>When a new criminal offence is being created, as it is here, it is right that if the individual does not have the mens rea and has not properly thought that he was committing a crime, it would be unwise to deem that he or she has done so in that event. I hope that the Minister will accept that it is particularly the last amendment that is the most important, in that it makes it quite clear that from Amendments 87 and 88 a person must know that they are committing an offence before they commit it, rather than being able to be found guilty having made a reasonable mistake. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment 83 would cause confusion when what is needed is clarity on this situation. You should really know whether it is your own money that you might be giving to a political party; the test should be a matter of fact rather than a supposedly reasonable belief that you think that it is your own money. We had sufficient controversy with Mr Abrahams&#146;s donations in the north-east a few years ago. The Bill is tightening up on those problems, and introducing Amendment 83 would not help.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000271"></a>Amendment 87 would weaken the Bill significantly by leaving out &#147;or recklessly&#148;. We need to punish recklessness, not just dishonesty. There has to be a reasonable expectation that you will endeavour to comply and that, if you are reckless in not actually complying, you should be open to punishment for it. On Amendment 88, it may be that there is a slightly better form of words to be found; perhaps &#147;proven beyond reasonable doubt&#148; would be better. But to make a donation and not know that it is your own money seems rather absurd. If you are in any doubt that it is your own money that you are giving to a party, you should really not be giving it away.</p>

Government amendments alter the level above which such a declaration is required so that it is necessary to provide a declaration for donations above &#163;7,500 only. The intention of these amendments appears to be to ensure that so-called &#147;innocent&#148; mistakes&#151;essentially, the inadvertent submission of a false declaration under the requirement in Clause 8&#151;are not needlessly punished. That is an intention with which I have some sympathy, but I am afraid that the effect of these amendments in this specific context is not something I can support.</p>

The Electoral Commission has reassured us that it intends to take a risk-based approach to the use of their investigatory powers and civil sanctions. This implies a proportionate approach where attention is focused on the most egregious breaches of the Act.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000274"></a>The amendments before us would negate the requirement for a declaration under Clause 8. They would mean that a person could only give a false declaration if they did so knowingly; that the test for making a declaration would no longer require an individual to be satisfied &#147;to the best of their knowledge or belief&#148;; and, most significantly, that any honest mistake would not be punishable.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000275"></a>This is a powerful combination of amendments that would render the declaration requirement nugatory. It would be very hard for the commission or Crown Prosecution Service to be satisfied to the criminal standard of proof, as is required by the changes proposed in these amendments. That is contrary to our intention. The clause seeks to remind donors of the requirements applying to them&#151;requirements of which many donors could be ignorant.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000276"></a>Any individual signing a declaration must surely be required to be certain of the truthfulness of that declaration. That is a basic requirement in many spheres of law. Suggesting that it does not matter whether the statement is truthful, or that the individual has no responsibility for seeking to ascertain its truthfulness, detracts significantly from the value of the provision.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000277"></a>The provision is intended to buttress the existing regulatory regime for party finance, in particular by ensuring that donors of significant amounts&#151;now above &#163;7,500&#151;should not be ignorant of the law. Clause 8 does not make it harder to comply with the law, since it does not restrict the permissibility of donors. Rather it ensures that the existing law is complied with.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000278"></a>Accepting the amendments would weaken the declaration requirement for Clause 8 when compared with other declaration requirements in the 2000 Act; and a justification for this difference in treatment is not evident. Moreover, removing the reference to recklessness in this context might incentivise ignorance of the rules. I reject the suggestion that all innocent mistakes ought to be disregarded. If an individual signs a false declaration under this requirement and there is no clear evidence that they knew that the statement was false, there might be evidence to suggest that the statement was reckless. If this cavalier attitude to the statutory requirements is permitted, it will over time erode public confidence in the probity of our party and of the electoral finance regime. For these reasons, I reject the amendment and hope that the noble Lord will withdraw it.</p>

The third amendment is the most important. I always worry about the Government in their legislative capacity, particularly when I look at some of the motoring legislation in which they imply that careless driving is almost the same as reckless driving. One should be very wary about what they are up to when they use the word &#147;reckless&#148; here. That is why I will consider the amendments again, and there is a considerable likelihood that I will&#151;carelessly or recklessly&#151;bring them forward at Report.

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000283"></a>Secondly, Amendment 88, if carried, would certainly have avoided the problems to which I referred at Second Reading and in Committee yesterday of an innocent mistake ending up in court on appeal and even eventually going to the High Court at vast expense to the taxpayer and the recipient political party.

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000287"></a>We have been carefully advised that, contrary to what the Minister said a few moments ago, if we had already approved Amendments 82 and 84 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, an impermissible donor would include someone who had been made impermissible under those amendments. So when the Minister said a few moments ago that it entirely relied on those who were not qualified in terms of their electoral status, that is not our view. If they were not permissible donors under the amendments that we endorsed for tax reasons, they would fall within this definition as well.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000288"></a>Amendment 89 relates to those companies whose control is in the hands of an impermissible donor either for electoral reasons or for tax reasons. That meets the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. Were we to take the view that impermissible donors would include those whose tax status made it impossible, it is illogical if those people could get round that by using a company under Amendment 89. Therefore, the amendment would make it impossible for them to use that route.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000289"></a>Similarly, under Amendment 90, we were looking at the specific issue of those who are not qualified to vote under all three types of election. When this matter was discussed in the other place, there was some anxiety that those Members of your Lordships&#146; House who are disqualified from voting in parliamentary elections should not be permitted to make donations to political parties. That is not our view and we have

As noble Lords will recognise, we would not be preventing them from making a donation to a party under these provisions.</p>
<h5><a name="09043028000428"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000290"></a>I want to refer briefly to the debate in the other place at the 11th sitting of the Public Bill Committee on this Bill because there was a very interesting exchange between representatives of the three parties on the issue of consensus, about which we have heard again today. The Minister, Mr Wills, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000391"></a>&#147;I hope that one day we will see a consensus emerge on what we all agree are important issues&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09043028000338"></a>that is, the issues that we are now discussing and the wider issues that we discussed earlier today. My honourable friend Mr Howarth, our spokesman, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000392"></a>&#147;The Minister came back to the point about consensus, but he seems to have a highly restricted view of where we should be going and how. There are times when politicians have to go with the consensus of the public rather than the consensus of the parties&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000339"></a>Most interesting of all, Mr Andrew Tyrie, for whom I have the widest respect&#151;I have worked very closely with him and he has given more attention to this issue on behalf of the Conservative Party than anyone else; indeed, some would say more than anyone else in the House of Commons&#151;said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09043028000393"></a>&#147;I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that we cannot arrive at the point at which one party can have a veto over change if it were clearly what the overwhelming majority of voters concluded would enable greater public trust to be restored in such matters&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Political Parties and Elections Bill Committee, 20/11/08; col. 414.]</p>

<p><a name="09043028000340"></a>Mr Howarth said that he agreed with that.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000291"></a>I quoted Mr Andrew Tyrie in particular because he sums up precisely where the public are on this issue. Any representative of a political party who thinks that we can just coast along and wait for some entirely impossible situation to arise where the minority of politicians are able to veto the view of the public, and probably the majority of politicians generally, must realise that that is no longer a sustainable position. The public have a perception of Parliament and politics which is not doing us any good at the moment.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000292"></a>This was reflected at Second Reading from all sides of the House. We may have to find a compromise. It may well be that all of us will have to give a little and be prepared to listen to others. If we simply go on, as Ministers tend to do, saying that until we have agreement between the parties on the lowest common denominator we will do nothing, not only your Lordships&#146; House and the other place but the whole of Parliament and the whole of our political life will continue to suffer an increasing degree of disengagement and disillusionment with our political systems.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000293"></a>These amendments are similar to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, which we supported, and are an attempt to address a real public concern about the way in which money is being employed to try to influence our political system. Unless we face up to that, and unless Ministers are prepared to give leadership on these issues instead of always waiting for the lowest common denominator of consensus, then we will have a major problem.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000294"></a>At this stage of the day, I think that is enough. I beg to move.</p>

I did not table an amendment to this effect, but does the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, agree that, on the principle of the difference between &#147;and&#148; and &#147;or&#148;, the meaning of subsection (1) would be clearer if it said,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000412"></a>&#147;parliamentary elections and local elections and European elections&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000341"></a>The omission of the &#147;and&#148; introduces a slight element of ambiguity and requires the reader to read it at least three times before he knows what the noble Lord is trying to say.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000296"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09043028000554"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> Perhaps I may briefly respond. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, has a great deal more experience than I have, but we were advised that this is the normal way to identify these options. I may be wrong; if so, we can correct this between now and Report.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000297"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09043028000555"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> I must say that officials and ourselves had also read the amendment as implying that it would apply to Members of your Lordships&#146; House, but shall adjust my notes for brevity and we will look at the words even more carefully if this amendment comes forward on Report.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000298"></a>This group of amendments seeks to effect a significant change in the regulation of donations to political parties. Amendment 89 adds to the permissibility requirements for political donations from companies and would prevent companies which are controlled by impermissible donors from donating to UK political parties. Under the proposed new clause, a company would be deemed as being controlled by an impermissible donor in a range of specified circumstances. For example, it would be deemed as being controlled by impermissible donors where 75 per cent of the voting shares are held by an impermissible donor or a combination of impermissible donors. It would also be deemed as being controlled by impermissible donors where a person who would be an impermissible donor under the 2000 Act acts as a shadow director of the company, or where the majority of the board of directors of the company would be impermissible donors if they were donating in their capacity as individuals.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000299"></a>Amendment 90 defines an impermissible donor as one who is not registered to vote in the UK, either in parliamentary, local or European elections. Amendment 90 extends this proposed exclusion whereby a company controlled by an impermissible donor by virtue of this proposed provision should also be deemed to be an impermissible donor. Amendment 142 would mean that the provisions in the proposed new clauses would come into effect on Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000300"></a>I begin by saying that I am sympathetic to the intention behind these amendments which seem primarily intended to prevent foreign donations from being channelled through companies operating in the UK. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Neill, under whose stewardship the Committee on Standards in Public Life provided the blueprint for the Political Parties and Referendums Act, which was  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a major reform in the area of party funding. It is therefore right that we take a step back and look at what the noble Lord said when considering these amendments. His report stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="09043028000413"></a>&#147;political parties should in principle be banned from receiving foreign donations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09043028000301"></a>The Government welcomed this recommendation and sought to implement it in the Bill which became the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000302"></a>I assure noble Lords that we remain committed to the important principle that political parties should not receive foreign donations; and some of the provisions in the Bill would provide a disincentive for foreign donors channelling donations through legitimate structures to circumvent the rules on transparency&#151;for example, the proposals in Clause 8 which seek to ensure that provisions regarding donations on behalf of others are understood and complied with, and those in Clause 12 which seek to bring more transparency to donations from unincorporated associations.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000303"></a>The provisions preventing foreign companies from donating to UK political parties have existed since 2000 and are a vital component of the regulatory regime. Section 54 of the 2000 Act requires a company to be registered in the UK or in a member state, and carrying on business in the UK. I understand that there are some concerns about whether those provisions go far enough and I do not want to dismiss those concerns out of hand. However, I do not believe that the amendments proposed here are effective.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000304"></a>The scheme envisaged by these amendments would almost certainly require a party or other donee to verify the permissibility status of those who own voting shares, of shadow directors and of board members. For example, although &#147;shadow director&#148; is defined in legislation, it would require considerable expertise in the law relating to companies to be able to say for certain whether someone was or was not such a director. Therefore, it seems clear that verifying these new permissibility requirements would be, at the very least, a difficult and onerous task. It could greatly increase the possibility of parties and others inadvertently accepting donations that they had concluded were valid. I cannot see that the resulting damage to trust in politics which might follow, even in cases where there is no blame to speak of, would be at all desirable.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000305"></a>Ultimately, these amendments may well have the effect of substantially reducing the number of companies from which donations can be accepted if those matters cannot positively be verified, including companies about which there is no real concern but in relation to which the relevant details are simply unavailable. Consequently, the potential effects of the amendments could be far-reaching and disproportionate.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000306"></a>Amendment 90, which prevents those ineligible to vote in UK elections donating to UK political parties, is also something that I have to oppose. The existing provisions in the 2000 Act require individuals donating to a regulated recipient to be on an electoral register. Extending this provision so that it excludes those who are not &#147;qualified to vote&#148; would seem to have no positive effect.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000307"></a>Finally, as noble Lords will know by now, consensus is a watch-word of the Bill. A significant step such as that proposed by the amendments would need to command broad cross-party consensus, and I am not convinced that such a climate exists at present. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000308"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0008.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09043028000556"></a>Lord Marland:</b> I apologise for arriving late at the Committee. I also apologise for taking noble Lords beyond four o&#146;clock when they all have things to do. I want to say a few things from a practical point of view. I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about getting public perception right, and I obviously endorse many of the things that Andrew Tyrie said in the other place.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000309"></a>The purpose of the Bill is partly to make party funding easier and more transparent. However, I am afraid that I do not believe that the amendment, as presented, makes it more transparent; it makes it more difficult for the parties to practically operate and police the giving of donations. How is there a means of finding out the dynamic of a shareholder register during the period of a gift? How can you police each individual shareholder of a party as a party treasurer or compliance officer? Who can determine their status? It should not be incumbent on the political party to act as policeman for companies&#146; shareholder registers.</p>

<a name="90430-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09043028000310"></a>The two criteria by which we have to transact, as does the noble Lord as party treasurer, are as follows. First, is the company UK-registered? That strikes me as being fair enough. Secondly, is it a company that trades? Once those two criteria have been met, it becomes almost impossible to police the shareholder register. Whereas I am extremely sympathetic, as I am sure are all of us in this Room, with the wish to clear up public perception and find a method whereby we can control these issues, I do not believe, with due deference to the noble Lord, that this works on a practical level.</p>

<p><a name="09043028000311"></a><b><a name="90430-gc0008.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09043028000557"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Marland, in particular, because I know that we share a great deal of concern about the reputation of our political system and we are seeking practical ways in which to go forward. At this stage, I can say only that we will look at the matter very carefully. I am very grateful to the Minister because he recognised that there is a genuine anxiety here that we all share. However, finding the right practical solution is more elusive. We will look carefully at what the Minister said and at what the noble Lord, Lord Marland, said, because he speaks with great practical experience in this field as a former national treasurer of the Conservative Party. If we can find a way in which this can be addressed more effectively between now and Report, we will bring it back. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09043026000013"></a>The successful bidders are:</p>
Bow Bidco Wylfa Ltd (A consortium consisting of EON UK plc and RWE Npower plc) for the 178 hectares (438 acres) of land at Wylfa;Bow Bidco Oldbury Ltd (A consortium consisting of EON UK plc and RWE Npower plc) for the 48 hectares (119 acres) of land at Oldbury;EDF Development Company Ltd for the 200 hectares (493 acres) of land at Bradwell
<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09043026000014"></a>The sale of these three sites is worth up to &#163;387 million which the NDA will use to offset the cost of decommissioning and to further its core mission. The successful outcome of the auction demonstrates that major energy companies are gearing up for significant investment in low carbon energy in the UK.</p>

The changes will take effect from 27 April 2009 for applications and awards made within the south-west region and from 8 June 2009 for the East Midlands region. This is because of the introduction of a requirement for third and subsequent living expense crisis loan applications to be usually completed at a face-to-face interview at a Jobcentre Plus local office. In addition, a customer will usually be limited to three non-aligned living expenses crisis loans within a 12-month rolling period. This will be where the first and subsequent awards are made within the south-west region on or after 27 April 2009 (8 June 2009 for the East Midlands region). Customers in these regions will be advised of the three non-aligned loan limit before taking out their first and second loans. Subsequent loans will still be available for customers who require assistance to meet living expenses:</p>
A: as a consequence of a disasterB: in an emergency which &#151; 1: is not a consequence of an act or omission for which the applicant or his partner is responsible, 2: the applicant or his partner could not have taken reasonable steps to avoid (as in guidance), regardless of the number of loans already taken out in a given year.

<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09043026000031"></a>On 17 March 2009 the Healthcare Commission, the independent health regulator, published its comprehensive report into the severe failings in emergency care provided by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and mid 2008. It was a catalogue of appalling management and failures at every level for which I apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS in my Oral Statement to the House the next day.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09043026000032"></a>I announced at the same time a range of measures, including two swift reviews into the circumstances at Mid Staffordshire to be led by Professor Sir George Alberti, National Clinical Director for Emergency Care, and Dr David Colin-Thom&#233;, National Clinical Director for Primary Care.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09043026000033"></a>Professor Alberti has looked at the hospital&#146;s procedures for emergency admissions and treatment and its progress against the recommendations in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report. In addition, he looked at other related areas of work, including the quality of care issues highlighted in the report in relation to the medical admission wards 10, 11 and 12.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09043026000034"></a>Dr Colin-Thom&#233; looked into the circumstances surrounding the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust prior to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation to learn lessons about how the primary care trust and strategic health authority, within the commissioning and performance management systems that they operate, failed to expose what was happening in this hospital.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09043026000035"></a>Those two reports were submitted me on 29 April and we are today placing copies in the Library together with the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09043026000037"></a>The new health and social care regulator, the Care Quality Commission, will, together with Monitor and the PCT, take stock with the trust after three months. The CQC will do a follow-up review in six months. Monitor, the independent regulator for FTs, will hold monthly meetings with the trust to ensure it implements all of the recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09043026000039"></a>The Healthcare Commission report identified severe failings at Stafford Hospital. While much has been done to rectify these, the two reports indicate that work still needs to be done to ensure quality of care at the hospital reaches the highest standard. Swift and decisive action is being taken to ensure that is the case. Stafford Hospital was exceptional, not typical, but all those working in the NHS can learn from this experience so that such events do not occur again elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09043026000041"></a>I am today placing in the Library of the House and on the MoD website a copy of two reports, <I>The Puma Force</I><I>&#151;</I><I>A Review of Contemporary Operating Issues</I>, and the earlier report, <I>A Strategic Review of the Puma Helicopter Force</I>.  These reports were undertaken by the Ministry of Defence as a prudent step following a number of Puma helicopter incidents in 2007.  The reports are a comprehensive and honest examination of a wide range of issues, including Puma Force culture, training, flying and operational requirements, structure, leadership and management.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09043026000042"></a><I>A Strategic Review of the Puma Helicopter Force</I> was written for internal consumption and consequently contains sensitive information that we have needed to redact. I realise that this can make the document difficult to read and that is why <I>The Puma Force</I><I>&#151;</I><I>A Review of Contemporary Operating Issues</I> was written and is also being published. This is an unclassified report, specifically designed to provide a clear narrative and allow the reader better to understand the context in which a series of incidents occurred and the actions taken and planned as a result. As a consequence of the latter, the Puma Force&#146;s capability has been enhanced and the management of safety improved to minimise the risk of further accidents. Clearly, operational flying can never be risk free. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09043026000043"></a>I would stress that there is no suggestion in the documents that the Puma is in any way unsafe to fly.</p>

<a name="09043026000092"></a><b><a name="90430-wms0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09043026000180"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS34"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column WS34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="09043026000093"></a>As part of the Children&#146;s Plan, we committed to a fundamental review of the primary curriculum, and I was delighted that Sir Jim Rose accepted my invitation to carry out this important work. The remit for the review was to consider how to:</p>
Ensure that the primary curriculum builds on prior learning in the early years foundation stage (EYFS) and supports transition to and children&#146;s readiness for secondary school. Increase flexibility and reduce prescription where possible to allow teachers more freedom to tailor the curriculum to their pupils&#146; interests, different and developing abilities and local circumstances to ensure that no child is left behind and to narrow achievement gaps. Continue the focus on the crucial skills of literacy and numeracy, while recognising the increasing learning opportunities opened up by advances in technology in the past decade and children&#146;s increasing ICT capabilitiesGive a greater emphasis to children&#146;s personal development and well-being. Balance these priorities with children&#146;s entitlement to a broad and balanced primary curriculum which introduces them to the arts, sciences, humanities, physical education and sport and foreign languages as they progress through primary education.
<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="09043026000094"></a>In addition, I asked Sir Jim to consider how to improve outcomes for summer-born children, including considering when they should start school. During the review I asked Sir Jim to consider two of the EYFS early learning goals for writing as part of his wider review of improving transition from EYFS into primary key stage 1.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="09043026000095"></a>Sir Jim&#146;s interim report was published on 8 December and has been subject to widespread consultation with teachers, parents, learned societies, subject experts and other professionals. He has now completed his final report, which I am publishing today along with proposals for a revised primary national curriculum. Hard copies are being placed in both Houses. I am accepting all of his recommendations subject to public consultation.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="09043026000096"></a>Sir Jim has made a number of recommendations directly related to the design and content of the primary curriculum which will require legislation, which I have accepted subject to public consultation which I have asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to carry out from today. It will also consult on the proposals to make personal, social, health and economic education statutory that I announced on Monday 27 April.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="09043026000097"></a>Sir Jim proposes a new core of essential skills for learning and life focused on literacy, numeracy, ICT and personal development and learning which is embedded across the whole curriculum. This will help to ensure that all children leave school secure in the basics. Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations also include restructuring the primary curriculum into six broad areas of learning, within which essential subject content will be organised and become more distinct as children progress from key stage 1 to key stage 2.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS35"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column WS35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="09043026000098"></a>The areas of learning are:</p>
 understanding English, communication and languages; mathematical understanding;understanding the arts; historical, geographical and social understanding; understanding physical development, health and wellbeing; scientific and technological understanding. 
<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="09043026000099"></a>The draft programmes of learning for these areas set out the knowledge, skills and understanding which children should learn linked to the overall aims of helping children become successful learners, confident individuals and responsible citizens. The curriculum content is set out in three clear phases to help teachers plan for progression. Sir Jim also recommends that a foreign language should become compulsory for the first time from age seven, building on the recommendation of the languages review carried out by the late Lord Dearing.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="09043026000100"></a>A number of other significant recommendations do not require legislation and I plan to take them forward subject to the forthcoming consultation. These will support and promote the successful implementation of the new curriculum from September 2011. These include promoting what Sir Jim has already seen as excellent practice in some of our best primary schools relating to teaching reading and encouraging children&#146;s spoken communication skills. He has also concluded that we should retain the two writing early learning goals as aspirational targets and that the Government should make available guidance and support to smooth children&#146;s transition from the EYFS to primary school, including supporting those children still working towards these goals.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="09043026000101"></a>Other recommendations relate to helping schools plan for implementing the new curriculum, such as the Government supporting teachers&#146; professional development needs to deliver our increased expectations around ICT. Given the fundamental nature of the changes and the important contribution that I expect the new curriculum to make to children&#146;s attainment and well-being, I have agreed that primary schools should be permitted an additional training day in 2010 to give every school the time and opportunity to plan  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS36"></a><b>30 Apr 2009 : Column WS36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the new curriculum from September 2011. A full set of Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations and my response is set out in the annex to this Statement.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="09043026000102"></a>On the question of when summer-born children should start school, I have accepted Sir Jim&#146;s recommendation that children should ideally start school in the September immediately following their fourth birthday, possibly on a part-time basis for some children, but with parents having freedom to choose. He has taken account of the compelling evidence on the benefits to summer-born children from starting school at the same time as their peers and that the majority of local authority areas already operate a single point of primary school entry in September. Young disabled children and children with SEN in particular will benefit from starting school as soon as possible so that the right interventions are put in place to ensure that these children also make progress alongside their fellow pupils. I am mindful, however, that compulsory school age does not start until the term after a child turns five and that some parents have a strong preference for their child&#146;s early years experience to take place outside a school setting. I therefore intend to make funding available across the maintained, private and voluntary sectors to enable all children to receive full-time provision in education and childcare from the September after their fourth birthday. Alongside making that provision available, we will ensure that parents have clear information about the benefits of beginning reception in September and we will work to help schools and early years settings to smooth the transition for any children who move into reception after September.</p>

<a name="90430-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="09043026000103"></a>I am enormously grateful to Sir Jim for the rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based way in which he has undertaken this major review. He has consulted widely with subject experts, learned societies, teachers and other professionals, and his review is informed by excellent practice in our best schools and internationally. Throughout the review he has kept in the forefront of his thinking the interests of children and their parents. I am confident that his work will make a huge difference to millions of young people, helping to ensure that their primary years equip them with the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to thrive in their future education and later lives.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="09043035000017"></a>Following a tendering process in August 2008, the contract to pilot the draft framework of standards and recruitment process for institutions engaging Muslim chaplains in public service has been awarded to Faith Matters. Faith Matters will carry out a number of pilots in different institutions across the country over the coming months. The evaluation of the pilots will incorporate the views of relevant officers within participating institutions, as well as wider stakeholder consultation with imams, other faith leaders, chaplains, and officials from other government departments and relevant associated agencies. We expect the pilots to be completed by autumn 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="09043035000018"></a>Using key findings from evaluation of the pilots and stakeholder consultation, Faith Matters will produce updated versions of the voluntary standards framework and recruitment process, with accompanying notes and a report listing key actions that need to be taken when implementing the documents.</p>

At that meeting on 10 November 2008 the issue of embedding arts and health into department's policy was discussed. While the department supports several arts-related programmes, the group recognised that further work needs to be done to establish arts and health firmly within departmental policy. There has been difficulty in identifying a single clinical lead to add legitimacy to the work and there have been no dedicated resources available. Since the November meeting, funding has been secured for 2009-2010 to provide expert advice to support the development of the department's internal structure in relation to arts and health.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_381"></a><a name="09043035000405"></a>Although no formal assessment has been made as to the direct effect of local authority house building on homelessness, all local authorities have a homelessness strategy in place to tackle and prevent homelessness. The latest set of homelessness statistics (October - December 2008) show that homelessness acceptances are down by 21 against the same quarter in 2007 and those being placed in temporary accommodation had also reduced by 15 per cent over the same period. The Government have provided over &#163;150 million of homelessness grant from 2008-2011 to local authorities to tackle and prevent homelessness effectively, the biggest ever cash injection provided for homelessness services.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_382"></a><a name="09043035000406"></a>Although RSLs are private sector bodies, many receive grant through the Homes and Communities Agency to provide affordable homes for either social rented or low-cost home ownership. Since the early 1990s RSLs have been the major providers of low-cost, sub-market, rented housing and the main developers of new social housing for people on low incomes and in housing need.</p>

Where relevant to the asylum claim, the applicant's ethnic origin will be further investigated at an in-depth asylum interview to discuss the reasons for seeking asylum. An assessment of the available evidence will then be made in the light of the country of origin information and any expert evidence submitted by the applicant.</p>

Neither do we accept that it is unsafe to return all Darfuris to Khartoum. Protection needs vary between individuals, which is why each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits.</p>
