In his supplementary he referred to the consultations presently taking place on possible future changes to those operations. The Chancellor indicated that such changes would be the subject of widespread consultation, which is presently taking place, and that they would in due course require legislation. So we have a long way to go before these issues become effective. My noble friend will also recognise that this issue revolves around other aspects of the tripartite arrangement and not only those to which he referred.</p>

They have tended to lecture me on what we should have done, so there is some improvement there. It is clear, as has been expressed many times both here and in the other place, that we have lessons to learn from the development of the crisis last summer in relation to each aspect of the tripartite structure. We believe that that structure has stood the test of time and that it will continue to enjoy the confidence of the banking community and the wider public.

There was very considerable investment in the Northern Rock bank, a private institution which ran into severe difficulties that had the potential to produce the most deleterious consequences for the wider financial community and with a cost to the whole nation. The Government and the tripartite structure responded positively and intelligently. As there was such pressure at the time, we can learn lessons from how all three partners acted. However, as the noble Baroness will recognise, the chief executive officer of the British Bankers&#146; Association is broadly in favour of sustaining the tripartite system, reflecting the fact that although improvements can be made to its operation, those structures should be in place.

Is that position not intolerable because of the difference in burdens of proof? At a time when there seem to be signs of a considerable mood change towards a greater emphasis on fairness and justice in international relations in the United States, is this not rather a good time to reopen the issue?</p>

The requirements are as broadly comparable as it is possible to achieve between two different jurisdictions. It is worth setting this in context by giving some figures. Since 1 January 2004, when the prima facie evidential requirement was removed from the United States, 37 people have been extradited from this country to the United States. Of those, 11 were to face allegations of so-called white-collar crimes such as mail fraud and satellite signal fraud. However, 26 of them&#151;or 70 per cent&#151;involved serious offences such as murder, rape, indecent assault, drugs and child pornography. Thirteen people have travelled from the United States to the United Kingdom, of whom four were for white-collar crimes&#151;so it is roughly 30 per cent in each case. It is also interesting that in each case 54 per cent of the requests applied for have been granted.</p>

There are full and proper safeguards in the 2003 Act.</p>

Do the people of this county have to await a more liberal Administration in the United States and this country to achieve full reciprocity?</p>

<a name="80108-0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="08010865000032">The Minister says that there is substantial equality but, with respect, that is not correct. The sixth amendment to the American constitution requires a greater standard of fairness than this extradition treaty&#151;the Ashcroft-Blunkett treaty.

This is not only the case with the United States; the requirement not to provide prima facie evidence is not unusual&#151;it applies also to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and to all the EU countries that are signed up to the ECE. That has been the case since 1991. So this is not at all unusual and is, I think, perfectly fair.</p>

These are being addressed through retention incentives, through increased recruiting and by rebalancing the Army under future structures. At the same time, we are reducing some operational commitments in the Balkans, in Northern Ireland and now in Iraq. This helps to decrease the frequency of operational tours, both for units and for individuals.</p>

I do not know whether he read it over the Christmas holiday, but it is quite a frightening read. It concludes that suicide by Dr Kelly would be extremely unlikely and is certainly not proven beyond reasonable doubt. As my noble friend will know, the Hutton inquiry was not statutory, and no evidence was taken under oath, so is it not now necessary for the Government to set up a proper statutory inquiry to investigate fully the circumstances of the death of this senior government employee?</p>

The inquiry of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, is the only time this provision has been used in a non-statutory inquiry. Surely the new evidence that has come to light since the Hutton inquiry and to which Mr Norman Baker refers in his book is an exceptional reason, which requires the events to be fully investigated, witnesses to be called and cross-examined and a verdict to be reached beyond reasonable doubt, just as in the current lengthy inquest relating to the Princess of Wales.</p>

I have nothing further to add. The Government believe that the inquiry by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, in this matter was conclusive. The noble and learned Lord set out the reasons for his conclusion. I say again that, if any person has evidence, they can take it to the authorities&#151;to the police&#151;and there is a procedure for a further inquest to be held.

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="08010865000076">The noble Lord said: After what has been a rather eventful Christmas break&#151;and I hope the Minister is recovering from his inadvertent break during our recess&#151;we return to consider this important Bill. The fact that these three weeks have gone by in a flash rather suggests that 2050 may not be as far off as we imagine. I am moving Amendment No.39 but I will be speaking to all other amendments in this group. It is appropriate that we return to talk on this subject because it is one that we have raised in previous debates. I remember clarifying our view that the Bill needed beefing up and that the best way of doing this was by strengthening the role of the Committee on Climate Change in its triangular relationship with the Government through the Secretary of State and Parliament. These amendments put the Committee on Climate Change centre stage in determining the effectiveness of the Bill in achieving its objectives. It makes it difficult for the Secretary of State to counter the decisions of the Committee and to override it in setting targets and budgets.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="08010865000077">How in practice do these amendments operate? They limit the order-making powers of the Secretary of State when amending target percentages as well as carbon budgets by transferring the power to the Committee on Climate Change, subject to parliamentary approval. Let me explain how this would work. Essentially no targets could be amended without the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change and the approval of both Houses in Parliament and an order must be made if those conditions are met. The Committee on Climate Change is subject to the same limitation in the exercise of power as the Secretary of State is under the Bill. The triangular balance is maintained&#151;committee, Government and Parliament. The detailed form of the order would of course be left to the Secretary of State. Perhaps I can elaborate on this scene. As on the last day of debate on this Bill, we on these Benches will today be repeating the broad themes that form the substance of our approach. These amendments entrench those themes. We have mentioned that it is of the utmost importance that science and not politics leads the strategy against climate change and we have repeated that there is a need to strengthen the committee&#146;s powers and to limit those of the Secretary of State. I have already rehearsed our motivation for doing this. There is an important point about balance of power that should not be overlooked. Our amendments are designed to shift that balance&#151;I make no secret of that fact&#151;but not to completely reverse it. We recognise that tackling climate change will require the co-ordination of Parliament, the Committee and the Government. It is the Secretary of State who will implement the policies and I do not want to suggest for a moment cutting the Government out of the equation. After all, they are the agency through whom all will be delivered.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="08010865000078">However, we on these Benches feel that it is simply not acceptable for the Secretary of State to be the one to set the targets. If the scientific realities are to be addressed, we must follow scientific recommendations. The only reason the Secretary of State would have for straying from the committee&#146;s recommendations would be political, which cannot be allowed to happen in this framework and in the way in which the Bill is constructed. How we implement the suggested strategies might well  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_743"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column 743</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be a political issue and consequently left to politicians. However, the targets are in a sense an absolute issue.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="08010865000079">As the Bill stands there is not enough check on the power of the Secretary of State on matters of science. Our amendments would shift the balance back to where it belongs, such that no Minister could change a target by order if he feared he might not achieve it. When considering the magnitude of the issue and the consequential significance of changing the targets, we on these Benches feel that it should be subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament. If there is a circumstance that would make the Minister stray from the recommendation, he would have an opportunity to make his case publicly. That mechanism would allow for the scrutiny that a change of this magnitude requires.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="08010865000080">I suspect that the Minister thinks that we on these Benches perhaps go too far in our emphasis on the driving role of science in these matters. Even if he will not go as far as we would like, does he at least agree that there is a fundamental problem with leaving so much power in the hands of the Secretary of State when setting targets and budgets? Does he not think that there needs to be some shift or ground given beyond just merely taking advice that could make the Bill more effective and increase the public&#146;s confidence in the ambitious goals that we are setting for ourselves?</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="08010865000081">I expect that noble Lords will have much to say on this subject, and I will listen to the Minister&#146;s response with interest. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="08010865000083">Before the Minister responds I have one or two observations to make about the amendment. My noble friend has performed a valuable task in raising an important issue, but I hope that he will forgive me if I say that I am not absolutely certain that the balance in the proposed scheme is completely right. We need to give a good deal of thought to this critical issue before we go further in Committee. Interestingly enough, it was not a matter that we really dealt with in the Joint Committee on the draft Bill.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="08010865000084">My tentative reaction was prompted by the brief that I received from Friends of the Earth, which, like my noble friend, wants to strengthen the Bill to make it more effective, but which also has doubts about the solution that he has suggested. That organisation points out that these are not just scientific questions; it describes them as moral and ethical, involving judgments about what we and the rest of the world should be doing. In that sense they are political issues as well. There is a case for saying that such crucial issues should not entirely depend on the advice of a committee, however well qualified or well respected it may be. These are crucial decisions that will affect all our people and generations to come.</p>

My noble friend said that he wanted to strengthen the powers of the Committee on Climate Change, as do I. He said that he wanted to limit the powers of the Secretary of State; this is where I begin to ask my question. Of course the Secretary of State should have to seek the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. A whole series of amendments elsewhere should ensure not only that that should happen but that the advice should be published, and reasons should be given by the Secretary of State if he does not follow the advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="08010865000086">My noble friend talked about some shift in the balance between the two. It is the extent of that shift that concerns me. If my thoughts were triggered by the paper that I received from Friends of the Earth, perhaps they were triggered still more by the remarkable book that I read during the parliamentary recess by my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford and Carole Nakhle entitled <I>Out of the Energy Labyrinth. </I>It should be compulsory reading for almost everyone who takes part in these debates and considers these issues.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="08010865000087">When we come to a later group of amendments, I shall make the primary points that arise from my noble friend&#146;s recommendations. The point that he makes is essentially that you cannot separate the kind of things that we are trying to do in the Bill from the whole issue of energy supply and the immediate and growing risks to energy. He argues that energy policy and the policies dealt with in this Climate Change Bill are interlinked and cannot be separated. Indeed, he goes further. He argues&#151;I shall come back to this during debate on a later group of amendments&#151;that it is all very well setting all these great targets in the Bill. We hope that we have them right and that they can be achieved but, if they are achieved, that will be done a very long time in the future. In the mean time, we have to deal with the consequences of our present carbon levels and the effects they are having, and that leads us to the whole question of adaptation, which we will come to again later in our debates on the Bill. </p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="08010865000088">My noble friend argues that, if you are to carry world opinion or our European partners down this road, it is all very well saying that we are going to set a lot of long-term targets which may cause great difficulties and the people will not see the results until many years later; however, they will be acutely concerned&#151;possibly quite soon&#151;with an energy crisis which may have political causes: further warfare and turmoil in the Middle East, Russian policy or whatever. He believes that by bringing the two things together you can persuade people to act and to act decisively. If you link energy policy with climate change policy, you are more likely to achieve the result than if you treat them separately. Some of us have criticised the Government because we feel that their energy White Paper does not go far enough and that perhaps their energy policy is not linked closely enough to the objectives in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80108-0002.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="08010865000089">That brings me back to my noble friend&#146;s amendment. It seems that if you to link the two things effectively, the Secretary of State must have a role. The Committee on Climate Change can consider the energy equation; in a later group of amendments,

However, ultimately only the Secretary of State and the Government can effectively bring together the action that is needed on energy security and climate change. Therefore, I do not want to weaken the power of the Secretary of State to act if it is only he who can act. Of course I want him to have the advice of a very strong Committee on Climate Change. I am all for strengthening that role and for ensuring that the advice is published and that the Secretary of State sets out any reasons for disagreeing with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="08010865000090">What worries me slightly about my noble friend&#146;s amendment is that it seems almost to eliminate the ability of the Secretary of State&#151;by the Secretary of State, I mean the Government as a whole&#151;to take action if it is necessary to do so, particularly in the energy field. Therefore, I go with my noble friend quite a long way down the road that he is asking me to follow, but before we reach Report I hope that he and the rest of the Committee will consider very carefully how to get the balance absolutely right so that we have a strong and effective Committee on Climate Change but do not neuter the role of the Secretary of State to such an extent that we cannot bring together these two vital and absolutely interlinked objectives of achieving energy security and our aims regarding climate change.</p>

It is an argument which goes right to the core of this Bill and the way in which this subject is being dealt with. As my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said, it raises the issue of government structure and the way in which the Government do their business. Clearly, as I have said before, one department is dealing with energy policy and another is dealing with the consequences of that policy.

Ultimately, as I hope the Minister will acknowledge, the Secretary of State has no power except for that derived through Parliament and, in this case, through this Bill. It seems to me that that is the sovereignty that we have to preserve. I accept that essentially the executive authority of the Government comes from the Crown and, in that sense, Parliament has the right of oversight and of regulation. However, when it comes to new legislation, there is no question at all in my mind that the view of Parliament has to be paramount.</p>

That in itself might lead us into difficulties in this House where, as a matter of custom and tradition, in the past we have not voted against orders even when we felt that we should or only on the rarest of occasions. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="08010865000094">We need to recognise the territory that we are getting into in this Bill. It goes way beyond the Bill itself, which is essentially procedural and sets out a parliamentary mechanism. It does not deal with the detail of the energy policies that will be required. In a month or two, a planning Bill will come to us from the other place and it will have to deal with aspects of the implementation of things that may make this policy and energy policy work. The whole complex has to come together and fit but I think that on balance, because my noble friend has preserved the oversight of Parliament, his amendments deserve the most serious consideration.</p>

We should remember that this Bill looks to 2050. Even within that timescale, this House might be reformed&#151;at least slightly&#151;so that it feels that it has the ability and integrity to reject orders more regularly than it has done in the past.</p>

Indeed, if this amendment went through, it could lead to extreme pressure on the independence of the committee when there was a diversity of views. That argument may not be completely de rigueur, but it is practical&#151;that these different bodies and people have different roles. Therefore it is essential that the climate change committee has to be consulted, heard and considered on any target changes. However, at the end of the day, the Secretary of State has to retain a sensible degree of executive power in this area.</p>

The danger of a committee that does not feel that it has power is that it will act irresponsibly. It may well come up with conclusions that are simply impractical. I disagree profoundly with the position taken by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. If I might say, there is an element of inconsistency in his case, when I compare it  with his earlier contributions during the passage of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="08010865000099">At this party, I see three people or organisations taking decisions&#151;the committee, Parliament and the Government. There are going to be conflicts between those three. The problem is that when Governments take decisions, they are subject to all the pressures that they could be subject to. Members of this House, many of whom have been Ministers, know exactly the pressures to which I am referring&#151;such as lobbyists and outside organisations&#151;all of whom are exerting pressure and often producing decisions and making recommendations to Parliament that Members of Parliament, in their wildest understanding and dreams, cannot even begin to understand.</p>

<a name="80108-0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="08010865000100">You often look at legislation and think, &#147;Where on earth did they get this idea from?&#148;. For example, the Gambling Bill went through and many Members of the other place could not understand who had asked for it. In all the years that I was a Member of Parliament in the other House, I never had one letter asking for gambling legislation to be introduced and yet, somehow, it appeared out of the woodwork. It arose as a result of pressure being exerted by lobbyists. It is those pressures that worry me. As they exert their way through the system&#151;and they will be exerted on the Government when they are faced with crisis decisions in this very area where important decisions are going to be taken on policy&#151;the Whips drive them through, very often in opposition to the views of Members of Parliament. That does not happen uniquely on the Labour Benches; it happens on all sides of the House. We all know that Members of Parliament often find themselves voting in Lobbies voting in a way that they do not altogether agree with, but in this area the danger is that decisions will make their way through the system. They will find their way into Parliament and will have been promoted by Government. They will be opposed in the Committee on Climate Change because they are not its recommendations, and they will simply be driven through the House of Commons. I am very worried about that.</p>

Most of the decisions you are having to make can only be successful if people themselves are part of the process. If you take climate change, you cannot solve the problem of climate change without the personal and social responsibility of individuals, so you cannot have a sort of top-down government dictating climate change targets without at the same time having a debate about the personal and social responsibility of people and people have, therefore, got to be involved in that debate&#148;.</p>

In briefly elaborating that, I crave the Committee&#146;s indulgence and apologise for being out of the country for the first two Committee sittings. I have read the reports with considerable interest. I was not surprised but very favourably impressed by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who frequently said that while he did not necessarily agree, he could see the point and would go back to the department. I am equally clear that I am surrounded in this Committee by people who understand far better than I how to construct the verbiage of these arcana, which will put in place properly what we all wish&#151;an appropriate balance between Government, Parliament and a climate change committee.</p>

A fascinating paper is about to appear in one of the world&#146;s premier journals. It is one among many such papers as people concentrate more on the social science of how to resolve what is variously called the free-rider problem, the prisoner&#146;s dilemma or the tragedy of the commons. It is a fascinating and depressing experiment done by a group of people in Europe, but headed in Switzerland. Students were put together in groups and each group member given a chunk of money. They went through 10 rounds of five-year quotas, as it were. They played 10 rounds in which each student had to put in a certain fraction of the money that they owed with the idea that, at the end of the exercise, if they had reached a certain target sum of money, they would all get to keep the money they had not put in. If they failed, however, they lost all their money. It is a crude and flawed metaphor for asking people to make decisions today that will lead to later and later decisions contingent on what other people decide about whether we will achieve the goals that we are trying to set ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="08010865000107">Depressingly, the outcome of those experiments was that at the beginning most people tried to cheat and hoped that others would help. Then they realised that they were all going to lose and tried to catch up. There was a curious pattern of not enough action at first and then trying to catch up at the end. More often than not everybody lost and they all went away with nothing. That is why I am concerned about the inevitable political tensions to take it easy now&#151;not to do the uncomfortable thing, not to bite the bullet on nuclear power, not to put in tough building restrictions. You can name your own favourite thing that we need to do. This is why I would have preferred annual and not five-year targets, so that they were not sowing seeds for a future Government to reap. That is why I would have preferred the Secretary of State to outline in general and not binding terms broadly how he saw the annual target being met. I recognise some of the impracticalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="08010865000108">The real need is to recognise the essentially different interests of individual Governments and even individual Parliaments. The supervening realities against these unresolved paradoxes of co-operation lead me to believe that we have to be really careful about putting this legislation in place in a way that is even-handed in ensuring the strength of the appropriately constituted climate change committee, the Government&#151;made appropriately immanent in the Secretary of State&#151;and both Houses of Parliament. Much as I listened to the criticisms of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, I am in favour of the broad spirit of the amendment. I think that the Committee probably is also, if it is appropriately done.</p>

They will have a great deal to say on this. Mr Salmond, the First Minister, is already saying that in no way will there be nuclear power plants in Scotland. I think he is saying that for political reasons; he cannot be saying it on scientific or cost grounds. But he is saying it and he is going to go on doing so. The Government know that and no doubt will allow for it when they bring forward their proposals. The political situation will be quite complex. It will not be just the Westminster Parliament and the Government having to deal with these matters with the committee, it will be the devolved bodies as well.

I want to add one argument to those of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, who I agree with entirely. Let us remember that the people principally affected by this Bill are the young. They are going to demand a different kind of politics, and I think that what this amendment attempts to do, not unsuccessfully, is to strike the type of balance that the young will be seeking. We will be asking for behavioural change from them in the form of changes in attitude towards the environment and changes in thinking about their futures. I do not believe that all that can be achieved through a determinist position by any Government, and I identify completely with the quotation used by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. I hope that the Prime Minister meant what he said to the Liaison Committee because he is spot-on: politics will not continue to be done as it has been in the past, and this Bill is a litmus test of how far the Government are prepared to advance in changing the very nature of politics.</p>

I do not want to be accused of not listening because I agree with many of the points that have been made. Also, although there has not been a lot of support for the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, he made a central point that seems to be lost sometimes; that is, that &#147;the Secretary of State&#148; means the Government. As an ex-Secretary of State, the noble Lord probably realises that. Decisions are not made by an individual in a ministry; it is not like that. It is not possible&#151;although it would be convenient, of course&#151;to have all our energy provisions wrapped up in one Bill with one ministry in charge. All that is for the Government.

Members of the Committee found it incredibly helpful to have that amendment before them that day because it provided us with a possible lifeboat while we looked for a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="08010865000115">As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said when he kicked off, this group of amendments raises the question of the relationship between the Government, the Committee on Climate Change and Parliament, which we discussed before Christmas and no doubt will discuss again. My answer today is the same: so far as issues of transparency are concerned, we undertake to take this group of amendments, as with others before it, away for consideration. That is genuinely meant and is not a one-off response to a particular debate. There is a theme running through the amendments concerning the Committee on Climate Change and its relationship with Parliament and the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="08010865000116">In the end the country will still want to know who is in charge, and thus be able to hold them accountable. The country cannot demand that the Committee on Climate Change be accountable to &#147;the people&#148;; people will demand that from their elected representatives whether they be at Westminster or in the devolved Administrations. We have to find a satisfactory way round that. But as I say, consideration has already commenced regarding the transparency of the decision-making process and the relationships between the three bodies and it is hoped that we will be able to come forward with something on that at Report. It is not my job to push the Bill along; it is the will of the Committee. I only have the same message to give in this area of debate: we will very seriously consider looking at the transparency arrangements.</p>

They must be made by a body accountable to Parliament, with proper scrutiny, which is another area that we have committed to consider again. Obviously we want advice from the independent committee, and we want far more robust scrutiny than Parliament or its mechanisms have at the moment. We will take away and consider aspects of that part of the process; it is important. We will do this where there are similar thrusts behind different groups of amendments, which are clearly there on  the Marshalled List. Looking ahead, there are amendments to Clauses 19 and 20 that cover the same issue. I shall make exactly the same commitment on behalf of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08010865000118">Amendment No. 97 specifically relates to the alteration of the length of budget periods under Clause 18. The Committee on Climate Change does not currently have a role. This is because the only circumstances in which the powers in Clause 18 may be exercised are if a change to budgetary periods is needed to keep them in line with similar periods under European or international agreements to which the United Kingdom is a party. As we have discussed, the key reason for choosing the five-year period proposed in the Bill is to ensure that the UK framework mirrors international timescales. There is no need for the committee to have a role in decisions about the length of budget periods, as any decision to move away from a five-year period may only be based on changes in the international situation. Any use of that power would simply realign the United Kingdom with those international frameworks. I make that point in relation to Amendment No. 97 because I do not want to be too dismissive. There is a practical reason why the committee will not have a role in changing the budget periods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="08010865000119">The general thrust of this group of amendments concerns the relationship between the three bodies, certainly as far as Parliament, individual Members in both Houses and people outside are concerned.

As I said, we will come forward after discussion with proposals to make sure that this issue is far more transparent than it is in the Bill at present.</p>

I am raising these points now, before my noble friend replies to the Minister&#146;s response, in order to try to help the Committee. In the previous two sittings the Minister has been very honest in responding and has taken our points on board, saying that he will come back with ideas on Report. I have a feeling that we are covering the same ground again and again in many of these amendments. Is there any chance that we might have a more general feeling for how the Government might meet us halfway on some of the proposals that we debated in the previous two sittings and are debating again today? Otherwise we are clearly going to keep going over the same ground, raising the same issues with the Minister, and we will get no further until Report. That does not mean that I think that it is a waste of time. But perhaps we are not progressing on this Bill as we have on previous Bills when the Government came back between sittings and gave us a slightly fuller response on how they saw matters progressing.</p>

No doubt these kinds of issues weighed heavily then. I do not think there is any body of opinion in either House of Parliament which would argue against that decision today. It bears out entirely the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that if you want a body&#146;s recommendations to be treated with the gravity you require, you have to give it authority.

As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, suggested, the difficulty with the amendment is that it would require every budget to meet the targets in the Bill. I agree that that would not be possible. The level of the 2038 to 2042 budget, for example, cannot be set at such a level that it meets the 2050 target, as the target does not fall within the budget period. If the noble Lord accepts that as an example of a budget being unable to meet a specific target, he will accept that the amendment is unnecessary, although I fully appreciate that the sentiment behind it is to drive the policy objective of the Bill forward.

It seems incredible that such a situation could arise, but let us suppose that we actually start to make technological change at a rate that permits meeting the 2050 target by 2040 or 2044. What is the problem, if that is the case? It still meets the 2050 target. We could probably go on from there and get even further. So I do not know why the Minister felt compelled to say that the 2044 budget, or whatever, could not actually meet the 2050 target, because patently, if it were technically possible to do so, it should be allowed to do so.

That is, we do not want to compromise on the overarching decisions of what needs to be done. Thus, when setting carbon budgets, it is essential that scientific knowledge about climate change, relevant technology, the economic impact of proposals, fiscal policy and some of the other issues emphasised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury earlier in Committee come to bear on decision-making.</p>

<a name="80108-0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="08010865000155">However, the list of factors to be considered as it stands in the Bill is not exhaustive and ignores to some degree the very thing that we are trying to protect&#151;the environment. When setting the budgets, proposals must be considered in terms of their broader environmental impact as well as the impact on the population that inhabits it. In our efforts to stop global warming we must avoid spoiling the very thing that we are trying to protect. We need to be sure that we do not get into a situation whereby, in our debate about policy, we are prevented from seeing the forest for the trees. The proposals for reducing carbon emissions must, therefore, be considered in light of potential impacts on the environment. I put it strongly to the Committee that carbon budgets should take into account the broader issues of sustainability and adaptation, and I hope to find support on this subject. Essentially, the impact on the environment and people should not be ignored when budgets are set. If a carbon budget were set that would mean sustaining damage to the environment in reaching it, we would be faced with a policy oxymoron and have to seek out alternatives.</p>

The important point about budget-setting should be not how the Secretary of State&#146;s decision will affect such factors, but how climate change will affect them. This is in line with our belief that the changing climate should be the primary factor in our decision-making. Obviously, all manner of environmental and economic considerations go into the production of a carbon budget. However, these amendments seek to ensure that climate change drives budget-setting.</p>

<a name="80108-0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="08010865000157">I would be the first to admit that this approach once again raises the question of what climate change is. In many ways that highlights what appears to be a great gap in the Bill. There is no definition. The purpose clauses that we discussed in the first day of Committee hinted at the issue, but only as far as temperature is concerned. &#147;Climate change&#148; is a nice cosy little title, but what we have is almost entirely a carbon emissions reduction Bill. Clause 10(2)(a) is more or less tacked on and thus conveys the ability to consider developing scientific knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="08010865000158">Only one of the clause headings in the Bill proposes a report on climate change, but only by Welsh Ministers to the Welsh Assembly. If that really is what is meant, it seems a rather solitary burden for Welsh Ministers, given that we are putting in place this high-powered, technical committee. This leads me to think that it might be appropriate at a later stage to introduce amendments to make one of the first responsibilities of the committee to produce a report on the criteria against which it thinks climate change should be judged, and on how the present climate measures up to them. It could then be asked to say, along with its periodic report on carbon emissions, how the climate is progressing and what changes, if any, have taken place. This would have the advantage of letting the rest of us see on what issues the Secretary of State would exercise his extensive Henry VIII powers. I beg to move.</p>

The press notice went on to say that it would more likely be 20 per cent of GDP each year. Unless the climate change committee has that focus in front of it, and has taken the economic and consequential factors into account, it will not be able to set a practical target for the reduction of carbon emissions.

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="08010865000161">Targets for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are strongly related to another environmental point, the question of air quality. In urban areas, that is a serious matter. Perhaps 20,000 to 30,000 people per year in the UK die prematurely as a result of poor air quality&#151;a higher figure than anything we are likely to see in the next 20 or 30 years for those dying prematurely from the effects of extreme heatwaves or other climatic events. The Environment Agency, which is concerned with air pollution, will also be the agency concerned with monitoring the emissions that go into the calculations of climate change controls and regulations. I am sure that the department, the Environment Agency and the climate change committee will bear these points in mind. It would be extremely complex to try to put all that into the Bill. I hope the Minister, in responding to the amendment, will explain how the Government are trying to take&#151;in the words they now use, of which I approve&#151;a holistic approach, considering all the different factors.</p>

But again, adaptation is not going to be part of the responsibility of the climate change committee, for reasons that will be explained more fully when that comes to be debated. Some of the best policies will need to consider mitigation and adaptation together. But in order to restrict its role, the climate change committee will focus on the emission aspects of the problem, and the Secretary of State&#146;s job is to make sure that all these different and complex issues come together. The question is whether the Bill as framed meets these points, and perhaps the Minister will be able to explain that.</p>

Presumably the reason for specifying certain matters in subsection (2) is to ensure that those are taken into account while leaving open the possibility of others being taken into account if the committee judges them at the time to be important. It seems to me entirely right and proper that we should specify now those things that we consider, at least as of now, to be the key factors in reaching decisions on the carbon budgets. Like the noble Lord, Lord May, I support the underlying intention of Amendment  No. 48 and would like something that reflects that intention to be incorporated into the clause.

I should like to make a couple of points because I think we are talking at cross purposes. The reason for the confusion is that there is no fiscal delivery mechanism in the Bill, which I shall discuss in an amendment that we will consider at a later date. To get to 20 per cent, 40 per cent, 60 per cent, or whatever, there will have to be a painful fiscal tax&#151;or whatever we call it&#151;delivery mechanism. We have to find, at some stage, a way of getting a price tag into the Bill and some broad-brush ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="08010865000182">There is no point in having so-called dramatic carbon budgets for the year two thousand and something or other if we have no idea about the fiscal side of the equation. If people say that we cannot be very precise about that, we are being jolly precise about the other side of the balance sheet. This must involve either tax increases&#151;balanced with some other reductions, but with a net increase of tax in this field and maybe with some degree of hypothecation&#151;or the allocation or purchase of tradable permits or subsidies of one sort or another. That is how the whole thing will work. These are at the heart of the action that will be very painful for many people.</p>

That will be reflected in the world price of carbon, whether there is a European carbon tax, what happens to European emissions trading, and all of the rest of it. That cannot be the job of the Committee on Climate Change either; we have got to leave it for now. It is a Treasury matter and the central fiscal responsibility will be for the finance Minister at the Treasury.

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="08010865000184">I will explain to why I am not proposing an amendment here. The central fiscal problem will arise from the fact we have a double bind with carbon. Increasingly, we have reports about shortage of reserves and exploration problems. That drives up prices on the normal supply-and-demand basis and there is very low elasticity of demand for carbon; hence home heating. You cannot suddenly turn it off without freezing to death and you cannot suddenly and easily halve overnight your car journeys.</p>

Clause 27 will require the committee to provide the reasons for its advice on carbon budgets. It will set out how it has arrived at its conclusions and how it has weighed up the costs and benefits and the risks associated with different abatement pathways so that we in Parliament, other stakeholders and the Government can understand why that carbon budget has been recommended.

That is why we believe it is essential that environmental circumstances, biodiversity, ecosystems and ecology generally should be included in the list of matters set out in the clause.

<ul><a name="08010865000282">&#147;what is crystal clear is that, starting from here and now, long-run targets for checking further carbon growth, however &#145;demanding&#146;, or backed by stern-sounding laws, stand not the slimmest hope of being achieved unless they are seen as necessary to protect people and industry against violent price movements, against power cuts and supply disruption, or against more oil shocks, as the Middle East and the Islamic world continue to boil. Nor will they do much to prepare the world for, or help it adjust to, the big climate changes which are already in the pipeline, <I>and which no amount of carbon curbing will now avert.</I> That will require expensive adaptation on a major scale&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="08010865000203">I produce those quotes because I want to emphasise that it seems to me that far from being negative, some of the matters that have to be taken into account are entirely and completely positive. I hope that the Climate Change Committee and the Secretary of State will not only think of scientific knowledge about climate change and the economic and social issues which have been referred to but will pay a great deal of attention to Clause 10(2)(f), which relates to energy policy. I hope that by combining a realistic energy policy with the climate change policy they will seek to get something that is not only effective, but is also saleable to a doubtful and dubious world. In their book, my noble friend and his co-author set out a series of proposals for achieving greater energy efficiency and for saving the vast amounts waste that now occur in our oil, gas and energy supplies. They are all relevant to what we are debating in the Bill, but they are all equally relevant to dealing with the energy crisis that my noble friend fears may get much worse in the short term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="08010865000204">As we go through the Bill, with all the importance that is being attached to the scientific input, I hope that those who have to implement these policies will pay as much attention to the energy issues and to the way in which, by combining those two things, we can achieve the results we all want.</p>

My noble friend intervened to draw the noble Lord&#146;s attention to the existence of legislation on these matters, but what I want to emphasise about this amendment is that if noble Lords were looking at the Bill as a member of the public might look at it and were seeking to establish what matters must be taken into account, it is important that they are defined. The responsibility that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is referring to is defined in this section. In many ways, this is presentational. The argument was not so much about an absence of these responsibilities, but about their definition being clearly identifiable in this part of the Bill. I hope that despite my noble friend&#146;s response to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, he will take that matter into account before Report.</p>

Somebody reading the Bill from outside would not necessarily think that they needed to go back and look at &#147;X&#148;. This is an extremely important Bill.

This is particularly the case with this Bill, which is so important and will, I suggest, be of interest to a wider audience than some other Bills that we have taken through the House.</p>

I can understand why the Minister would make the intervention that he did because he comes from Defra, where I am sure biodiversity is always at the front of his mind. But at other departments, such as the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department for Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government, bio-diversity is not always at the front of people&#146;s minds. Although they have a duty to regard it, it is very low down the list of priorities. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that this is presentational. It is important for that reason.</p>

The Severn barrage particularly highlights the fact that, while it can produce 5 per cent of energy from a renewable source, there will probably be an enormous habitat loss. That will be a balance that the Secretary of State will have to weigh up, and that the committee will have to consider. If the value of biodiversity is not made explicit in the Bill, it may be easier for the Secretary of State to make a decision that might be popular with people because it will impinge less on their lifestyle than others, but will impinge much more on habitat. We must give habitat and biodiversity a fighting chance by putting them in the Bill.</p>

Because he laboured the point, I thought I would say for the information of the Committee that it is covered. I make no bones about the fact that I am sympathetic to having this in the Bill, and we will have a look at it. But&#151;I have to say &#147;but&#148;&#151;one of the golden rules that is drummed into us&#151;into ex Ministers as well&#151;is the strong advice of parliamentary counsel never to legislate for the same thing twice. Only legislate for an issue in one place and do not even repeat it in another piece of legislation. The fact is that once the lawyers get to work, interpretation will suffer. It is dangerous to legislate for the same thing twice. Notwithstanding that, I am more than happy to see if we can achieve greater clarity.</p>

However, I am more than happy to have a look at it. I also understand the point about presentation, which is no bad thing because this has to be sold to the public. We are looking for a change of culture and changes in behaviour, so I understand the point. But I must give a warning that the advice may be not to legislate for the same thing in two places.</p>

I have not sought to imply that they cannot consider anything else they may choose. That is the point: this is not prescriptive. They can look at any other issue, but in guiding their initial decisions, Parliament will certainly look at those they must take into account and how they have done that. When we come to Clause 27, which I highlighted earlier, covering functions and how this is to work, we can look at the matter in more detail because the question is highly valid.</p>

We are very reluctant to add to the list because most of the issues raised are covered within the Bill. Indeed, I have not heard of one that is not, and have had no advice to the contrary. Biodiversity is covered in legislation elsewhere, as a statutory duty on the Committee on Climate Change. This is something they must do. It is the way it comes out and the way it is explained. I make the point because it says &#147;must take into account&#148;. It also says that they can take anything else they want into account. That would not have the same force, because you could not have a checklist. They would choose to do that.</p>

I hope I made that clear when I was forecasting what we might debate on Clause 27, in terms of the costs, benefits and drawbacks of different suggestions and advice the committee may give. We would see the negatives as well.</p>

With regard to Amendment No. 55, the reference to European and international circumstances in Clause 10(2)(h) already implicitly includes the international dimension of the other factors on the list. One factor on the list impacts on others, so Amendment No. 55 is unnecessary. I have already indicated the breadth of issues that can be added, but they would not fall under the &#147;must&#148; category. The noble Lord specifically mentioned Amendment No. 50A, which looks at the benefits of reduced energy use. This will be considered in the context of overall economic circumstances. The committee would have to look across the economy as a whole, at the different impacts, positive and negative, of different reduction pathways.

Of course, we are leaving the implementation of the policies in the hands of the Minister, as that is the only way in which the climate change committee can effect change. However, we feel that it is important that the strategy that he or she implements comes from the experts and that the committee be encouraged to produce a detailed plan on the ways in which carbon emissions can be reduced and climate change stemmed. This will make it easier for the committee and others to come to an independent view on whether the policies are sufficient to meet future budgets and to help monitor progress towards the budget as time passes.

If the mechanisms in the House of Commons are correctly constructed, you can get a forum for accountability that does not meet like a Select Committee&#151;weekly, two-weekly or whatever&#151;but at the right time to take evidence on issues when something has happened and where the view of Parliament should at least be in the mind of Ministers and others when decisions are taken.</p>

It seems extremely important to spell out a strategy on how these matters are to be dealt with. I am pretty confident that the Minister, in response to the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, will say, &#147;That is absolutely nothing to do with us in this House or with the Government; it is a matter that will be decided by the other place&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="08010879000018">As for whether there will be a separate committee, I would have thought, given my experience of working, for example, on the European Union Committee&#146;s sub-committee on foreign affairs and defence, that if a strategy paper were to be presented to Parliament, it would not be lost as a single item to be dealt with in a great batch. An appropriate House of Lords committee would almost certainly decide that it was exactly the kind of topic on which it should devote a day to cross-examining witnesses. Without going down the road of inventing parliamentary procedure, a matter which is not for us, my noble friend&#146;s amendment would by its very nature produce exactly the kind of examination that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, wants.</p>

I am therefore not entirely happy with the proposal that these budgets should be detailed. I suggest that when this clause comes back it should recognise the difference in detail that can be offered for different stages. This goes back to the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, withdrew. I think that he was trying to provide for a relatively quick response for the immediate future, for the first five years. What will happen in 10 or 15 years can be a matter for much more deliberation. I hope that it will be possible to incorporate some of these ideas in a revised clause.</p>

It seems to me that, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said a few minutes ago, this is a fundamental part of the Bill. Unless there are proper policies and a proper strategy to meet the budget, it will not amount to very much. It is hugely important to get the timing right. I rather like the six-month proposal for the first part of the period but think that it would be entirely unreasonable to expect reports for future periods to be produced in six months. A certain unbundling of the clause may be needed to reflect these different time horizons.</p>

My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours has flown one of the more obvious kites and I will neither cut it down nor respond to it except to say, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said, that the safest position to adopt is to point out that this is nothing to do with the Government or with this place but is for the other place. My noble friend is always ingenious. He has tagged his proposal on to this amendment and he deserves a response.</p>

We all recognise that Parliament has a very important role to play in this and it would be helpful if considerable thought was paid to the mechanisms by which that is done.

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="08010879000025">There is also the obvious problem that calling it a &#147;climate change strategy&#148; could be somewhat misleading. After all, this report will be concerned only with mitigation&#151;measures to reduce emissions. It will not cover the crucial issue of adaptation to climate change. That is the subject of Clause 49 which appears later in the Bill. Although the Government are not oblivious to the important points which the noble Lord makes about the necessity for strategy, this is not the appropriate clause for it because this report is more narrowly defined to deal with the more narrowly defined issues.</p>

On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The whole thrust of this Bill is about the need to look forward to see what we do next. We need to report and to know where we are, but we also need&#151;and this is the point of these amendments&#151;to place centre stage the notion that we require methods for addressing the issues and a course of action that is clearly stated by the climate change committee and available to the Government. As I said, we need more than just suggestions and I hope that that will run through all the Government&#146;s thinking on this. The Committee on Climate Change is not just a suggestion box. It exists to provide the thrust of the argument that the Government will then use to implement policy.</p>

I would like, as I am sure we all would, Parliament to play an active role in following this Bill through to the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s activities and the Government&#146;s responses. I am sure that Parliament will find vehicles for doing that, not just in another place but here, too. Indeed, the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill has been one of its strengths. If these debates have resonance, it is because there is a cadre of Members speaking in Committee who have great experience of the Bill through the time that they spent on the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam; they have brought that knowledge to our debates, which has been very useful. I would like to think that post-legislative scrutiny will be equally important to the parliamentary process. I keep on about these three things: Parliament, the Government and the Committee on Climate Change. This Bill can be effective only if all three feel that they have bought into the process.

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="08010879000045">In my short note in response to the amendment, I have an absolute gem of a sentence, which I am determined to put on the record, but first I have one point to make to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. The Clause 11 report is drafted by the Government, not the committee. There should be no misunderstanding about that. The legal duty to meet each budget, which we discussed at an earlier sitting, provides a strong motivation to deliver the proposals and policies. I think that that was one of our very first debates, on line 1 or 2 of Clause 1 of the Bill. In addition, there will be regular progress reports by the Committee on Climate Change to Parliament under Clause 28. I am sorry to refer to these later clauses, but they set out in some detail the operation of the Committee on Climate Change.</p>

<a name="80108-0007.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="08010879000046">Here is the gem. A legal duty to implement the proposals and policies would be highly unusual in legal terms. Ministers can say all they like about implementation, but a legal duty&#151;this is what my note says&#151;would be highly unusual in legal terms. On another point, the amendment would be very restrictive. If the Government were unable to implement one element of the plan&#151;through, say, unforeseen events&#151;they would be in breach of the law. The same problem would apply if evidence came forward supporting a change in policy approach. It is not intended&#151;this is not to demean the Bill at all&#151;that the programme should be drafted as a legal document. It is therefore likely that any duty to implement would raise questions about precisely what the duty is and what needs to be done in order to fulfil it, and it would be very difficult to determine whether the duty had actually been fulfilled. Legal duties need to be set out in a way that shows precision and inflexibility. We do not want the proposals and policies to be drafted in this way. We want them to be understood and informative to the public. This goes back to the point my noble friend made about presentation.</p>

That line was drafted so as to send a signal to the Civil Service; the noble Lord knows how the culture of Whitehall works. That is what Clause 1, line 1 is intended to do but, with respect, this is a slightly different issue. The duty to implement would create a risk that a Government might choose to limit the policies included in the report in order to avoid a requirement to implement those policies. This could create a barrier to transparent and ambitious policy-making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="08010879000049">A further point, and one that I hope will appeal to your Lordships, is that a duty to implement a plan could be seen as a very broad enabling power for the Government to carry out any actions they proposed through the plan. I have no doubt the Delegated Powers Committee will have a look at that. I only say it &#147;could&#148; be seen to be a very broad enabling power. I do not think a power of that breadth would win the support of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="08010879000064">The proposals and policies may be intended to provide greater flexibility rather than a simple duty to implement but we think the Bill takes the right approach&#151;Ministers always say that&#151;in focusing the legal duty on the outcome. It is the outcome not the process that is important and that the Government need to be challenged by. Rather than arguing about the means of achieving the budget we need to know that the outcome has been achieved. This ensures that we can take a forward-looking approach to policy-making and avoid being restricted to policies originally set out in the Clause 11 report when a change in approach since that report might deliver more effective emission-saving. In other words, there has to be a degree of flexibility. If we set this out in a highly restrictive fashion, which is what the initial Amendment No. 60 would do, that would have the exact opposite effect to what your Lordships are seeking to achieve. I note the caveat that this goes back to Clause 1. At Report I am going to better delineate the arguments on Clause 1 and Clause 11.</p>

For example, biofuels are doubtless part of the solution to climate change because crops can absorb carbon from the atmosphere while growing and then be released into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned. This cycle might mean no net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="08010879000059">However, growing biofuel demand has led to widespread clearance of rainforest to plant fuel crops. The carbon released from the clearance of rainforests can be enormous. It is not much use if the UK claims to have cut millions of tonnes of carbon emissions by increased burning of biofuel if the country that has produced that fuel increased its carbon emissions by more than that. The sustainable development test would pick that up in a way in which the Bill&#146;s budgets currently may not, as well as identifying problems of biodiversity loss, displacement of communities, and so on, that are also associated with rainforest clearance.</p>

The proposals and policies produced by the Committee on Climate Change should have regard to the ways in which economic development can be made more sustainable, and also the ways in which sustainable development might affect the economy.

Climate change is an important and urgent issue, which will become even more important and urgent as it bites. The risk at the moment is that it can be seen as trumping all other considerations. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, referred to the debate on the Severn barrage. I hesitate to summarise what the Minister said on that day in a rather crass way. It was as if that amount of renewable energy justified any environmental damage by way of collateral damage, as it were. Though the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, said that no one in their right mind would propose a power station that damaged biodiversity, I hate to say that the Government are now spending tens of millions on feasibility studies on the Severn barrage to do just that. We have to get clarity on where the climate change effort needs to take place in that setting of sustainable development. This may not be the right amendment. It is open to being hijacked, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and others say. The solution to this is to insert a sustainable development requirement, as indeed we have done in many Bills for many functions and for many public bodies in the past, but never for the Government as a whole as this Bill would require.</p>

Simply to say that the reporting required by the Government in this clause should be required to take account of sustainable development&#151;the broad wording in many Bills&#151;would help to make sure of it, and provide a gentle prompt to government over many years about the fact that, no matter how pressing climate change becomes, if we solve it by creating other environmental, social or economic problems, we simply will not hit the mark.</p>

This seems to be a reasonable conclusion for the debate we have had. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, rightly of course, raised the impossibility of getting through to a solution in 2050 without somebody, somewhere, being damaged. The essence of the action required over the coming 40 years if we are to meet the 2050 target means an immense number of changes in society&#151;in the economy, in our structure, in the way we source our energy, and so on. That depth of change is not going to occur without some people somewhere losing money. At the same time it is equally certain that the change will introduce huge opportunities for gain. We live in this market economy and, whatever we do, we are not going to escape from that. That means things going up and things going down. We all have to accept that.</p>

The new cross-government public service agreements aim to ensure that all relevant departments have clear roles and responsibilities with respect to the important policy areas, so they are given full consideration in the policy-making process. The public service agreements are in place for climate change and the natural environment. We also of course ask the Sustainable Development Commission to act as an adviser, advocate and watchdog and to report publicly on the Government&#146;s performance on sustainable development, and to help build capacity to deal with sustainable development issues. So we do not think in the round that it is necessary to place an additional sustainable development requirement on the policies and proposals report. That is not to say it can be ignored.

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="08010893000028">The noble Duke said: Amendment No. 63 concerns a matter that was raised with me by the Scottish Law Society. I return to the question raised earlier this afternoon by my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour regarding the problems that arise when power over the environment issue is, to a considerable extent, devolved to various national authorities and in various ways. I accept that Clause 67(2) contains a general power which says that functions are to be exercised by all the authorities jointly. However, part of the question behind the amendment is whether that clause contains sufficient powers to draw all the contributing elements together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="08010893000029">We also return to the time that it will take for the Secretary of State to produce this report on policies and proposals. Obviously the Secretary of State and the Committee on Climate Change will have talked to the devolved Administrations in setting the carbon budgets, but it may still be possible for a devolved Administration to drag its heels as all approach the final hurdle of agreeing the division of the proposals. One can almost see an element of horse-trading coming up here.</p>

<a name="80108-0008.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="08010893000030">It will be very important for the Bill to make everyone accept their responsibilities. The problems are many. Even if there can be agreement from all national authorities on the framework of the Bill, the carbon budgets set in Westminster will have effects on the local operations of Governments across the union. Let us consider the emissions produced by cars. Cutting automobile carbon emissions involves local changes in traffic patterns, road pricing or improving public transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="08010893000031">I should also like to ask the Minister for clarification on how precisely he sees the national authorities working with the Secretary of State. Although Scotland has decided to have its own climate change Bill and there is much support for attempts to stop global warming, it appears that a duty is not necessarily placed on the devolved Administrations to implement the policies or strategies of the Committee on Climate Change or those of the Secretary of State.

I was not in favour of it and I still do not think that it is a great idea, and I think that the harvest from it is yet to be reaped in full. However, having got devolution, one must accept that countries such as Scotland can do their own thing. My noble friend and I are very fortunate that the home information pack is voluntary in Scotland, whereas it is compulsory in England. It is of great benefit to us in Scotland to have different law. Scotland will bring in its own climate change Bill and it may do things slightly differently from the way they are done in England. However, having got devolution, I think that the devolved Administrations should be given the flexibility to act. Certain things might be done better in Scotland than in England and certain things might be done worse, but that is a problem with devolution. Therefore, asking for a duty to be placed

We have devolved Administrations and they must exercise their responsibilities, but of course we are assured that each devolved Administration in the UK is committed to tackling climate change. The Secretary of State is responsible for meeting the targets and budgets in the Bill, but the report on policies and proposals must be developed in consultation with the devolved Administrations, as is their right, bearing in mind that this is a UK Bill. It is essential that it is a UK Bill because the UK has to operate in the international arena as an entity. However, some areas of climate change policy are devolved, and we respect that, as the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, properly pointed out that we should.</p>

<a name="80108-0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="08010893000034">The proposals and policies required under this clause will clearly set out what measures each devolved Administration intends to take to reduce emissions in areas of its responsibility. We have agreed this approach with the devolved Administrations and believe that it represents a fair way forward. We are also developing a more detailed concordat with the devolved Administrations, which will set out how we work together with them to meet the Bill&#146;s requirements. We believe that that is the best way to ensure that our efforts are properly co-ordinated, as opposed to seeking to impose on them a statutory duty to co-operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="08010893000035">I reiterate that all the devolved Administrations are fully committed to this process. We have enjoyed very constructive discussions with them and are grateful to them for their co-operation so far. I am pleased to be able to inform the Committee that the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament have both recently approved legislative consent Motions to this Bill, and we expect to build on this constructive process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="08010893000036">It is right that the Bill is focused on the UK level, given the highly integrated nature of the UK economy and our energy system.

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="08010893000037">I hope that the noble Duke will feel reassured by the Government&#146;s response and suitably chastened by his Back-Bench contribution to the extent that he will recognise the proper role of the devolved Administrations in this matter. At the same time, I hope that he will appreciate that this is a UK Bill with UK targets to be hit and that we will achieve that through the transparent process of consultation with the devolved Administrations, as we are obliged to do. I hope that the noble Duke is reassured and that on that basis he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Here, I am drawing to the Committee&#146;s attention the anomalies that we face in the Bill. We have given devolution to various national or sub-national authorities&#151;however one wishes to put it&#151;but, at the same time, this is currently a UK Bill. There is a possible way for the Government to get around that. If they can agree the policies and proposals at the same time as setting the budgets, then, when they come forward with the carbon budgets, the policies and proposals will be agreed ahead of time and all horse-trading will already have been done. The only other way to get round the problem is to turn this into an England and Wales Bill or an England, Wales and Northern Ireland Bill and leave Scotland out of it altogether. The objective that we are striving towards is that there should be a UK policy on climate change and that everyone will fit into it. We are not saying that they should do exactly what Westminster says; we are simply saying that there should be a requirement on the national authorities to co-operate.

We are supportive of this group of amendments&#151;although expect that votes might go the wrong way, recalling the reminder to us all from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, about the strength of government Whips and Parliament&#146;s procedures to make sure that the Government get their way.

I support the amendments moved by my noble friends for the very reasons that they gave, but will give an additional reason. I can well recall when we were taking the lottery Bill through that we made it clear to the House that we would make available a day&#146;s debate every year, to see if the House wished to vary the amount of money going to the particular lottery interests and distributors, according to the change in the circumstances of cultural life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="08010893000052">That there was going to be such an opportunity was a powerful reason the figures that we put into the Bill originally were not amended. We did not, as I recall, in any way stipulate this as being a formal part of the lottery process. It is no surprise that an incoming Administration chose to handle the lottery in a quite different way, perhaps because that restraint was not available. Had we had the opportunity to debate the purposes of the Lottery more frequently, the lottery might be in a happier position today. For that reason&#151;the same as given by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson&#151;it is highly desirable that the opportunity for debate, as this 43 years unfolds, is all to the good.</p>

I shall not list them, as I have not checked recently which they are and I could be a bit out of date, having left the other place. However, certain items and aspects of legislation are required to have an annual debate. That is not necessarily the same as approval. The question is what the noble Lord wants. If it is approval, I can assure the Committee that that would probably be done without debate, which does not add value to what is already happening. The accuracy and reliability of the information is almost outside the Government because we are subject to international rules, and we do not want to change that. If it is intended to have a look at this, the objective has to be to add value to what is already going to happen, given the requirement in the Bill to lay the reports before Parliament.

It is the Executive seeking to maintain discretion on these matters and not truly seeing the enormous importance of engaging public interest, through Parliament, in what the Government are seeking to do. A Government who cannot and do not wish to engage Parliament as an ally in this pursuit will fail. The Minister may suggest that no Government will seek to fail to engage Parliament in this great adventure.

We have said all along that we feel that we must leave the science to the experts. Allowing the climate change committee to prepare the statement depoliticises the process and fosters the credibility of the reporting mechanism.

It takes us back to the earlier debate on the powers of the climate change committee&#151;what I call the party and what the noble Lord referred to as the triangular relationship. If the committee has this kind of responsibility, it will focus the minds of the membership on the need to take realistic and real decisions for which they are accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="08010893000073">I have another reason as well. Ministers in all Governments are very often fearful of taking very difficult decisions. It is just the way we are. Sometimes Members of Parliament&#151;particularly in the other place&#151;grumble in the Tea Room about a decision that has been taken by the Government. Sometimes they know the reason behind it. Sometimes&#151;and I am talking across parties&#151;they talk about the inadequacy of Ministers because they fear to take those great decisions. My noble friend Lord Rooker was very firm in the decisions that he took during the period when I was in the House of Commons on the Back Benches and he was a Minister. I hope I do not embarrass my noble friend when I say that he was quite exceptional in being very deliberate in the decisions that he took. I am fearful that Ministers might duck decisions.</p>

And therefore Ministers&#151;whatever they make as a recommendation&#151; will have to have in mind what the views of the climate change committee are. If that is what is takes to give Ministers the bottle to make the big decisions then so be it and let the committee have this very important role.</p>

Many times in these debates we talk as if this is simply something that this country is doing and nothing else to do with the rest of the world at all. We lose sight of this&#151;we will come to this when we discuss aviation&#151;as if this was not taking place in any context at all. There are so many other places where the thrust of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is appropriate that it would be a pity to push for this area which does not add anything at all.

The issue with this drafting is that Clause 12(2) does not state who actually produces the figures. It may be that with redrafting this subsection could state that the Committee on Climate Change should be responsible for emissions figures which will be quite complex and open to question. For example, UK removals is a very difficult calculation to make, depending on forestry, emissions from waste areas and so on. I imagine that the Government will take data from the Committee on Climate Change and perhaps other organisations and then make their statement. As for the notion that the Met Office provides what the Government say about the weather, that is not something that we normally do.</p>

The UK&#146;s national emissions inventory publication is produced each year by independent consultants on the Government&#146;s behalf. That is what happens now and what will continue to happen. The publication is respected, subject to peer review and supplied according to international guidelines. It is not something knocked up by Defra, far from it. Rigorous measures are in place to ensure the quality of the information, which is set out in line with the requirements of the Office for National Statistics, and is subject to further independent scrutiny under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore we do not agree that the Committee on Climate Change should be required to lay before Parliament an annual statement of UK emissions. Not only would this be costly, it would definitely be potentially confusing if it duplicated the work of the official emissions inventory that the Government are already required to produce under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>

<p><a name="08010893000126">There are already in place well-established mechanisms which allow other non-departmental public bodies to contribute to issues of this kind.

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="08010893000098">I shall give an example.

It is peer reviewed to international standards and scrutinised by the UN framework and is in conformity with the Office for National Statistics. If anyone wants to come back on Report to say that it is not working and that claims have been made and so on, then that is fine. But no one has said that today. It is as though people are saying that the infrastructure for producing the emissions inventory does not exist, but it does exist. It is important that the Committee on Climate Change is locked into it, but not in a way that would duplicate the work and thus lead to confusion. We will certainly look further at how the network of the various bodies can be linked up properly. Obviously the Committee on Climate Change does not exist yet. It is the new kid on the block, as it were, and it is very important that its pronouncements and advice are based on the best available information.

So I was surprised by the Minister&#146;s suggestion that the secretariat will be allowed to come along to meetings of the other body&#151;I have forgotten the name he mentioned&#151;that is currently producing these figures.

In many cases, we have been reluctant to talk about &#147;advice&#148; or &#147;recommending&#148;&#151;we have been firmer than that&#151;but in this area the word used is &#147;recommendations&#148; because those people who are aware of an energy imbalance may well be capable of pointing out that it could be addressed by a particular course of energy policy.</p>

In one of the sections there is a call for an annual report.

It should have that important role but it should not be allowed to go as far as to then say, &#147;But, Secretary of State, you should be doing this&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="08010897000014">However, the amendment would not help the process of annual accountability, because the statement under Clause 12 is meant simply to provide factual information on net UK emissions and carbon units.

The Government would then have to respond under Clause 29 by&#151;I think&#151;October.

From a psychological, management and every other perspective, for it to be issued in the March of the second year following that to which it relates is too late.

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="08010897000037">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest. I have used hearing aids of one kind or another for almost half a century. More recently, I have had the considerable benefit of the new digital aids, in both ears. Put bluntly, because I have been able to afford the independent sector&#146;s excellent audiology services, I am able to remain a fully included Member of your Lordships&#146; House and the wider community.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="08010897000038">My concern is that everyone with hearing needs should receive the same timely service from the NHS. Sadly, that is not the case at present, as capacity in the NHS is not keeping pace with demand. As your Lordships will recall, on 1 March last year, in order to address this problem the Government published their long  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_807"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column 807</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>awaited national audiology action plan. Your Lordships will note that this document was published on the same day that the Minister was due to appear before the House of Commons Health Select Committee, in order to respond to its concerns over audiology services in England. The very fact that that committee launched this inquiry underlines the seriousness of the situation. Yet neither the committee&#146;s report nor the Government&#146;s response, published, respectively, in May and July last year, has yet been debated in either House. Furthermore, most of the representative bodies at the inquiry have expressed their views on that response, and they are all very critical, so today&#146;s debate is both necessary and timely.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="08010897000039">There can be no doubt about the scale of the problem which, with our ageing population, is bound to become more pressing. The RNID estimates that 55 per cent of people over 60 are deaf or hard of hearing. In total, over 4 million people in the UK have a hearing difficulty that would be assisted through the use of properly prescribed hearing aids, and it is common ground, which I hope the Minister will confirm, that about 2 million people in need are not yet provided with a hearing aid or aids. So there is clearly a huge task still to be tackled.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="08010897000040">Your Lordships will recall how often, in other debates, we all, but especially the Government, have emphasised the need for inclusive social policies. One witness quoted by the RNID, Janine Roebuck, an opera singer, makes very clear just how important that concept is in this context. She says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"><a name="08010897000060">&#147;My hearing aids are my lifeline. Long hearing aid waiting times means spending years struggling to hear and battling isolation and depression&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08010897000056">That is the background to have in mind, as we react to the fact, whatever the long-term need, that as stated by the RNID no less than 250,000 people are currently waiting for a digital hearing aid.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="08010897000041">How have the Government reacted? In May 2006, they set a target that by March 2007 no one should have to wait longer than 13 weeks for an audiology assessment&#151;note those words carefully&#151;and that by March of this year no one should be waiting longer than six weeks. However, the most recent figures, for October, show that almost 48,000 people were still waiting more than six weeks for an assessment, and more than 34,000 over 13 weeks. Furthermore, more than 13,000 patients have been waiting longer than a year for an assessment. I stress that these government targets and figures are for waiting times for an assessment only, and certainly not for actually being fitted with a hearing aid. Remarkably, the Government do not publish waiting-time data for what is called &#147;the full patient journey&#148;.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="08010897000042">What then is the picture if one takes in that second period between assessment and supply&#151;as clearly one must? Indeed, the Select Committee specifically recommended that. For the past four years the British Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists&#151;BSHAA&#151;has carried out an annual survey of waiting times for precisely that full patient journey from referral to supply. Its results are, therefore, much more meaningful than the Government&#146;s official figures and the findings  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_808"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column 808</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are even more disturbing. The latest BSHAA survey published last September indicated that while there has been some fall in waiting times in the past year, patients are still having to wait an average of 36 to 38 weeks between referral and the actual fitting, at last, of a digital hearing aid. Moreover&#151;and astonishingly for someone wanting only to upgrade from an analogue to a digital hearing aid&#151;the average waiting time is even longer: between 44 and 47 weeks.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="08010897000043">These BSHAA surveys have also highlighted serious regional discrepancies in waiting times. This has recently been underlined by a report from the RNID based upon freedom of information requests, delivered to every PCT, only two months ago. Out of the 100 trusts that have responded, no less than 11 have average waiting times of more than a year from GP referral to fitting of hearing aids. Some have waiting times of more than 18 months. In Kingston-upon-Thames, new adult patients wait an average of two-and-a-half years. Who knows how much worse the figures might be for the 50 or so trusts that have failed to reply to the RNID? What are the Government doing to address this? At one time we thought we knew. In July 2006, the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, announced that 1.5 million patient pathways were to be procured from the independent sector at a rate of 300,000 per annum for five years. We have now passed that date and, alas, have seen no evidence of this happening. Instead, strategic health authorities locally have been tasked with filling their capacity gaps with,</p>
<ul><a name="08010897000065">&#147;a combination of greater efficiency in existing services where possible, and, where that is insufficient, new capacity&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80108-0011.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="08010897000044">So what has happened to the national audiology action plan and why do we have no clear or continuous plan for effective engagement of the independent sector? The modernisation of hearing services&#151;MHAS&#151;project to equip the NHS with facilities to offer digital hearing aids began in 2003. It included a limited independent sector involvement through a PPP. Although only two independent sector companies were involved, no less than 68,600 patients were fitted with a hearing aid through that PPP until it ended last April. More significantly, it was accepted that the companies&#146; standards in providing fitting and follow-up service matched those of the NHS.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="08010897000045">Despite all the current barriers to its involvement, the independent sector is, of its own volition, making a contribution towards alleviating pressures on waiting lists&#151;for example, by helping to test patients&#146; hearing at their local GP surgery, thus speeding up the initial assessment and referral process. Some PCTs have also involved independent-sector providers in assisting with part of the full patient journey&#151;for example the fitting of an aid and follow-up. But these are piecemeal approaches, wholly dependent on local initiatives and not part of any coherent policy by national government. The independent sector continues to invest in training of hearing aid dispensers who are fully qualified to carry out hearing assessments and fit hearing aids. Yet this significant capacity, a workforce of some 1,400, is virtually ignored in the Government&#146;s calculations. Is it not high time to consider a more direct&#151;indeed, a more actively participant&#151;role for the independent sector?</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_809"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column 809</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="08010897000046">I invite the Minister and, indeed, the rest of your Lordships to study the evidence given to the Health Select Committee by Specsavers. From that, it is clear that developing a market for directly supplying audiology services financed by the NHS along the lines of the successful optical prescription model would offer the public greatly improved access, choice and quality.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="08010897000047">In summary, the Government&#146;s actions do not measure up to the scale of the problem. The Department of Health seems unable to ensure that the NHS works in partnership with the independent sector to develop a sustainable national audiology service. Consequently demand cannot be met and patients continue to suffer. I end by quoting the closing paragraph of the BSHAA report, <I>Suffering in Silence</I><I>2007</I><I>,</I> which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"><a name="08010897000061">&#147;BSHAA has for some time said it is puzzled why the Government does not recognise that the independent hearing care sector on the high street has the skill and expertise necessary to help solve the waiting list problem&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08010897000057">and,</p>
<ul><a name="08010897000066">&#147;offer patients real choice; choice of location, choice of time, choice of instrument, choice of dispenser and even choice of how many and which hearing aid they have fitted&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80108-0011.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="08010897000048">I am much looking forward to this debate and, in particular, to hearing from the Minister when and how the Government will open the door that will enable us to start proceeding down the road that I have described.</p>

It would be hard to dispute that audiology is one of the Cinderella areas of the NHS. This in some part reflects widespread cultural attitudes towards hearing loss in our society. If someone goes blind, it is universally regarded as a tragedy, but even people whose problems are of being very hard of hearing can be regarded with scorn, mirth and derision which is surely inapplicable, given the scale of the issues that we face in this area.</p>

<a name="80108-0011.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="08010897000050">A recent study of the baby boomers generation in the US concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"><a name="08010897000062">&#147;The reality is that hearing loss has a long way to go before it is considered a legitimate public health issue&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08010897000058">I would suggest that the same applies in this country, too. That is pretty amazing when one considers the facts. According to the same study, 25 per cent of the baby-boom generation&#151;people between 50 and 60 years old&#151;suffer from serious noise-induced hearing loss, in addition to hearing loss brought about by ageing processes. Some observers in America have spoken of a hearing health epidemic and I do not think that that is an overstatement.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="08010897000052">The other side of this issue is a tremendous and continuing wave of innovation in hearing-aid technology and, more generally, in technologies linked to those who are either deaf or seriously hearing impaired. At the cutting edge of this technology is nanotechnology; on the commercial market there is already a hearing device available which can be implanted, is invisible to the external observer and has a battery life of some five years. Tremendous technological revolutions are going on.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="08010897000053">When I read the Government&#146;s document, <I>Improving Access to Audiology Services in England</I>, and their response to the House of Commons Select Committee report, I felt that I was living in 1948 rather than 2008. I give three reasons for this: one is that digital aids were not introduced into the NHS until 2001, in spite of the fact that they existed for many years previously, although, of course, they were improving radically. That raises the issue of whether what is going on in the intersection between the NHS and the private sector is really at the leading edge of technological developments. Secondly, as the noble Baroness said, no reliable data are collected, or has been collected to date, on the wait between GP referral and treatment. As I understand it, the Government have now committed themselves to collecting that data. That is clearly a serious lapse. Thirdly, as the noble Baroness also said, the survey by the RNID found that many trusts had very long waiting times. This was based on a sample, rather than a universal survey, so to some extent it was guesswork. Like her, I picked up the case of Kingston, where there is a wait of 2.5 years, which translates into 125 weeks.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="08010897000054">I have four questions for the Minister, which she might answer directly or subsequently. First, is this figure of 2.5 years for Kingston health trust valid? Is it really true? It seems quite incredible. Secondly, the person choosing open-ear technology today, and who goes privately, can get tested and fitted not only in one day, but within one hour of going to the practitioner. Yet the Government document says proudly that the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust, using open-fit technology, has seen treatment waiting times drop from 28 weeks to 21 weeks. Could the Minister explain this yawning discrepancy? Thirdly, as the noble Baroness has said, surely there must be must more effective ways of integrating the public and private sectors. She mentioned the case of opticians, where there is indeed very little waiting&#151;where, because of technological innovation, you can get a pair of glasses within an hour. Here again the Government seem to have made only modest progress, especially in relation to the target that was also mentioned. According to the calculations I saw, only 116,000 people have been treated under a PPP arrangement. Fourthly, in his speech the other day, the Prime Minister rightly put an emphasis on prevention, rather than simply treatment. What are the Government doing in the area of prevention? It is not just the baby-boom generation who went to rock concerts; it is also the under-25 generation using iPods. A recent French study calculated that one in 10 of such users will have hearing deficiencies within two years, because they use these devices almost every day, and they play them at much too high volumes. Surely, prevention should be moved massively up the Government&#146;s agenda.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="080108103000002">Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disability worldwide. Although deafness and loss of hearing are more common in the elderly population, many children and young people are also affected, with potentially devastating results on the development of language, communication and learning. There are estimates that in the UK, one in 1,000 children is deaf at the age of three. Currently, a staggering 17 per cent of the population have some deafness. As the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, in the younger age group that is likely to rise almost exponentially because of the sound technology they use on a daily basis. There are 20,000 children aged 15 and under who suffer from a degree of deafness, and 12,000 of them were born deaf.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="080108103000003">Sufferers of deafness often experience isolation and depression. When deafness is of sudden onset, it is particularly devastating. The person with sudden onset deafness suddenly loses all orientation. Crossing the road or even pursuing activities in the home becomes incredibly hazardous. Even those with progressive deafness may find that they cannot pursue their previous employment, or find that employment opportunities wither, as their lives rapidly become narrower and more cut off. They are often acutely aware that their potential contribution to society is being wasted and that they cannot enjoy the same quality of life as they did when they had hearing or as those with good hearing can.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="080108103000004">Two million people in the UK currently use a hearing aid, but it is estimated that a further 4 million might benefit from one. The Government are to be commended on their commitment to reducing waiting times for digital hearing aids. They certainly have recognised the failure of many PCTs to give audiology services the priority they deserve. To address this, the Audiology Advisory Board, chaired most capably by Professor Sue Hill, has produced the National Audiology Action Plan. But I would ask the Minister whether the current referral-to-treatment waiting time for a hearing aid has improved at all. Is the target of providing a diagnostic test for audiology within six weeks likely to be reached by its target date of March this year, since last year&#146;s 13-week target was not met on time?</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="080108103000005">Hearing loss does not occur in isolation. The associated vestibular disorders cause dizziness, vertigo, nausea, fatigue and sometimes tinnitus and, sadly, they are commonly misunderstood both by the public and by healthcare professionals. These symptoms represent the most common reason for GP visits by patients over 65, and indeed 40 per cent of the UK population aged over 40 have experienced symptoms of dizziness and/or imbalance.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="080108103000006">Let us make no mistake: the aftercare of those receiving an NHS hearing aid is inferior. After receiving an NHS aid, a patient will receive one phone call to assess whether problems are being experienced with the aid. If a hearing aid is purchased privately, the patient is able to arrange a personal consultation

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="080108103000007">However, I hope that no one will be fooled into thinking that providing a hearing aid is the answer to issues around deafness. There is a real and urgent need for an increase in training numbers in audiological medicine if we are to cope cost-effectively with the increasing numbers of people with audio-vestibular disorders who will otherwise continue to be referred to the wrong NHS resources where their problem becomes compounded by inappropriate investigations and wrong treatments. Currently, services are variously provided by ENT surgeons, audio-vestibular physicians, audiologists, neurologists, geriatricians, paediatricians, physiotherapists and so on, depending on the complaint and the availability of professionals in that area, frequently determined by staffing levels and the equipment infrastructure. The majority of patients are referred to ENT and to neurology, even though only 5 per cent of hearing and balance disorders require surgical intervention or result from central nervous system pathology.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="080108103000008">I know that the &#147;good practice&#148; documents produced following on from the framework are supported by the commissioning of 18-week patient care pathways, and there are other audiology transformation projects on education and training of the workforce and on the development of a workforce tool and a quality assessment tool. But all those require the availability of expertise to underpin them. Nationally, however, only a handful of services are able to provide state of the art, sophisticated auditory and vestibular investigations that patients need for accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause of their deafness and other problems. Unfortunately, much time and effort is therefore wasted on inappropriate or unnecessary and expensive investigations and referrals. With an ageing population, these problems are going to get greater. Provision of a hearing aid is only part of the management.</p>

<a name="80108-0012.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="080108103000009">We need an increase in specialist medical audiology without which we risk more money being spent inappropriately. Hand in hand with that goes a requirement for more national specialist facilities too. The need for a rapid expansion in such services of expertise also puts an onus on the profession itself. Currently the training in audiological medicine is far too long. I ask the Minister what discussions have been had with the royal colleges to streamline and bring down the time spent training.</p>

There is little that you can do when you are so breathless, so enjoyment with other people becomes all the more important. However, the one chance that his wife had to relax with him, watching television in the evening, was made excruciating by his increasing deafness. He needed the volume at such a level that it caused her acute pain, so they ended up spending the evening in separate rooms.

The outstanding campaign by the RNID resulted in the unique partnership between government, the voluntary and independent sectors, and the modernising hearing aid services programme produced, in the RNID&#146;s own words, the complete transformation of the service in less than five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="080108103000014">More recently, the RNID has highlighted the unacceptably long waiting lists that still exist. Its latest figures revealed a shocking situation in some parts of the country, the worst, as we have heard, being in Kingston. But what is in danger of being overlooked is the fact that we are talking about pockets of poor provision. It is not the national picture. In fact, nationally there has been an enormous improvement and, while the unacceptably long waiting lists should and must be eliminated, the successes should be recognised and praised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="080108103000015">My local audiology department at Charing Cross Hospital is held up as an example for others to follow. That department&#146;s reaction to the publicity given to the RNID&#146;s figures was that it was grossly unfair. In its opinion, the figures do not reflect the overall reduction in waiting times, which have reduced radically. According to the Department of Health&#146;s figures, last October roughly 80,000 people were waiting for an audiology diagnostic assessment; a year earlier, in November 2006, the figure was double that, at more than 166,000. Of these, roughly 47,000 had been waiting for more than a year, whereas last October this figure had been reduced to 13,000. Yes, that is still far too many, but the picture is not a uniform one. The staff at Charing Cross felt kicked in the teeth for all the hard work that their profession had undertaken over the past few years. They deny the description of Charing Cross as an &#147;elite service&#148;; in their judgment, theirs is a normal service, just hard working.</p>

Its main concerns are that the tariff is too low to cover the actual costs, that it does not reflect regional variations in the cost of provision and that it does not provide for the ongoing maintenance of hearing aids or for post-fitting adult rehabilitation. Nor is there provision for people who need bilateral aids&#151;aids for both ears. Charing Cross fears that, at the current rate, the tariff will lead to increased contracting of independent sector provision at an inferior level of service. The head of department said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"><a name="080108103000058">&#147;If an independent sector company can provide a patient journey for the current tariff rate I would have serious concerns about the quality of that service; there will certainly be no money left for the shareholders if the job is done by a fully qualified audiologist&#148;.</p>

I do not have time to go into these in detail, but I ask the Minister to assure the House that the Select Committee&#146;s concerns will be acted on. Will she also assure me that the Department of Health will take on board the serious concerns that have been expressed about the level of the draft tariff? In reality, the audiology service is very cheap for the life-changing results that it achieves. Will she do all that she can to ensure that the Government build on its successes and not allow the service to deteriorate?</p>

I was encouraged by a friend to go to a private clinic, where I had a test that was much more carefully done. I discovered that the kind of disability that I have relates to the middle range of sound, which means that I find it difficult to distinguish consonants in speech.

Also on the telephone, when I have to get through to some officialdom and find that I am in a call centre, it is almost impossible to find communication between us and if I say to them, &#147;I am deaf, will you speak slowly?&#148;, they cannot resist the temptation to shout at me, which does not help at all. I find it difficult and almost impossible to eat with your Lordships at the long table in the dining room. I find it difficult to have a conversation with someone who is sitting alongside me. I need to see you in order to hear you. People leave voicemail messages and they think they have communicated with me but they have not done it clearly enough for me to be able even to hear who it is who has left the message, which causes quite a lot of embarrassment. I attend receptions and I do an awful lot of nodding and smiling and find that sometimes I have agreed to opinions I do not hold or even volunteered to do something I did not intend to do because I have not actually heard what was being said.</p>

I have heard on more occasions than I can think of about people who say when they sit at the back of the church that the problem is that preachers are not trained to project their voices properly and refuse to admit that the problem might be within them. There is growing acceptance that help is available, and greater acceptance about the sophistication of the instruments which can help, but the capacity for dealing with the problem has not kept up with the expressed need. Only a year or two ago my nearest hospital was reporting that there were 22,000 people on its waiting list, and as has been said, there have been reports of waiting times of between 84 and 92 weeks in parts of the south-east.

I do so for a particular reason. For over 60 years my mother has been profoundly deaf and she has been wholly dependent on the NHS for her lifeline&#151;her hearing aids. That experience of growing up as the hearing child of a deaf person who lives in a hearing world with the TV turned up too loud and all that kind of stuff has had a profound effect on me. I shall give one example: most people my age can tell you all about &#147;Doctor Who&#148;&#151;who played the Doctor, his assistants, and all that. In my house, &#147;Doctor Who&#148; consisted of the first three bars of that rasping, tinny music and an adult shouting, &#147;Turn that noise off now&#148;, as it cut through my mum&#146;s ears.

It was the same thing when we moved to Lancashire; she used to go to social services. She managed to get along with a pretty inferior system. During that time a friend died and in an act of generosity his family gave my mum his very expensive, private, behind-the-ear hearing aid, but it did not work. It was not until we moved to another place that, when she came under the audiology department of a district general hospital, on her first appointment somebody said, &#147;We need to do a complete audiogram&#148;. Because technology had changed and much more powerful behind-the-ear hearing aids were available, she finally got one.

That was profoundly depressing for her and for all of us. Then there was a change, and last year she finally got a digital hearing aid. I asked her last week what it was like and she said that, apart from the relief of not having an inevitable descent into further deafness, she can hear things that she has never heard before. It may not be the biggest thing in the world, but to be able to differentiate noises is huge. In her words, it makes being in company altogether easier.</p>

While that may be fine for somebody who has a slight hearing loss, who is young or familiar with technology and who can go to a private service, there will be those who are older and who have multiple conditions. They may be arthritic and cannot see very well and they are presented with a minute piece of machinery. They then panic because they do not know how to use it. It is important to note the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that maintenance and aftercare are an enormous part of a proper audiology service. The concentration on recording data, not just at the point of assessment but right through to fitting and beyond, to see how the person is living with a newly acquired deaf condition, is important.</p>

There needs to be coherence. Ophthalmology and optical services have changed by their reliance on there being a very good system of referral between the different parts&#151;the voluntary sector, societies for the blind, the private sector and the NHS. That has enabled routine maintenance of people&#146;s conditions to be contracted out to technicians, which has left precious specialist resources in ophthalmology&#151;the same could be said for audiology&#151;to be focused on those who really need them. I worry that, with the new system of commissioning from PCTs, we might be in danger of going back 40 years to when there was no coherence in provision, and deaf people will suffer as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="080108103000033">The story of NHS audiology over the last eight years is an interesting one. In my view the Government are entitled to claim considerable credit for the decision they took in 2003 to roll out NHS provision of digital hearing aids across the whole country. That really did represent a quantum leap forward for many tens of thousands of people in terms of their quality of life. Unfortunately, as has been said, the very success of the MHAS programme sowed the seeds of the difficulties we are now experiencing. The benefits of digital hearing aids suddenly became more widely appreciated, demand for them shot up, and the NHS found itself without the capacity to cope. Indeed, audiology contains a paradigm of what has happened to the NHS as a whole since 1948. It is a classic instance of where an ageing population, improved technology and rising consumer expectations have combined to drive up demand for healthcare. If one were being critical of the Government, one could say that someone ought to have predicted this. As it is, there is not much indication that in 2003 anyone actually sat down to assess what capacity the NHS needed to meet future demand for audiology services in the short or medium term.</p>

<a name="80108-0013.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="080108103000034">The result is what we see today: long average waiting times, as cited by the noble Baroness, to have a digital hearing aid fitted and of course, as we have heard, the average numbers conceal a huge variation between best and worst in different areas of the country. The target of a 13-week maximum wait between referral and assessment was meant to have been achieved last March but was missed by a wide margin. The six-week target, which is supposed to be met by March 2008, seems unattainable within that timeframe.</p>

<a name="80108-0013.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="080108103000035">I say &#147;unattainable&#148; not simply in the light of the published figures but because of the numbers of people waiting whom the figures do not include. Those people waiting for a reassessment to see whether they need a digital hearing aid are only included in the official waiting list once a review has taken place to establish whether they might benefit from being reassessed. How many people are currently waiting to be reviewed in this way, and does the Minister not think that that hidden element of the waiting list makes the six-week target rather misleading?</p>

<a name="80108-0013.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="080108103000036">The obvious way forward is for the NHS to draw upon the spare capacity that exists within the private sector. The problem here is that if you use the private sector there has to be demonstrable value for money, and how can you verify value for money unless you have a national tariff? A tariff is the only way there is to assess price comparability between different suppliers, yet there are very mixed messages emanating from Ministers about whether they see this as something that should be developed. The strategy document of last March simply said that the department would consider the introduction of a tariff as soon as practicable.

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="080108103000037">Could I also ask the Minister about priority treatment for war pensioners? As from 1 January, all war veterans became entitled to priority access to NHS secondary care for any conditions which are likely to be related to their service, subject to the clinical needs of all patients. This could present a difficulty in relation to hearing loss. In the context of applying for a war pension, veterans have had to meet quite a high threshold of hearing loss&#151;50 decibels in both ears&#151;to be deemed eligible. For priority treatment on the NHS, on the other hand, the threshold is bound to be a lot lower, and we could well see a backlog of cases&#151;perhaps as many as 100,000 according to the RNID&#151;coming forward for priority treatment for deafness caused by service. What impact is that likely to have on waiting lists and what specific measures have been taken to ensure that the NHS can meet the potential increase in demand from those patients?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="080108103000038">We are back to the capacity question. Like the noble Baroness, I wonder what happened to the commitment given by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, in July 2006 to source an additional 300,000 patient journeys per annum from the private sector for five years. Is that happening? In their answers to the recommendations of the House of Commons Health Select Committee, the Government admit that they are only now examining in any depth the medium and long-term demand for digital hearing aids and are only now developing a toolkit for workforce planning. Again, only very recently have the Government accepted that official data on referral to treatment times should be collected in relation to hearing aids. Better late than never, but one wonders how any policy decisions have been reached either in Whitehall or in PCTs in the absence of such fundamental information. What is not measured cannot be managed. I hope that the Minister will tell us that better and more detailed information will be the starting point for better and more joined-up policy in this vital area.</p>

Those with more profound hearing loss, including children, are obtaining access to new implantable devices, such as bone-anchored hearing aids and cochlear implants. As people get older, they are more likely to develop a degree of hearing impairment, and with more people living longer, the demand on audiology services will continue to increase. The demand for audiology services has also increased because many people who currently use an analogue hearing aid naturally and rightly wish to switch to the improved performance provided by digital hearing aids.</p>

From the outset, the department engaged with many key stakeholders to ensure that the process of developing the framework was inclusive. The national audiology framework, <I>Improving Access to Audiology Services in England</I>, was published in March 2007. It set out a programme of work aimed at helping local health systems to transform the experience of the audiology service for all their patients with a vision of delivering high-quality, efficient services closer to patients&#146; homes and responsive to the needs of local communities.</p>

The number of people having to wait for an audiology assessment has fallen dramatically. A year ago, more than 114,000 patients waited longer than 13 weeks for their assessment. Now this figure has fallen to 34,000 and is still falling. By March 2008, no patient should have to wait longer than six weeks for their assessment.</p>

I assure noble Lords that we have effective engagement with the independent sector, but at local rather than national level because we believe that PCTs are best able to identify local needs and capacity.

In doing so, the Government and the UK open themselves to criticism of fixing figures&#151;what is exactly what they would be doing. These mechanisms would be used only if borrowing targets were not met. Why bother to do this with a figure of 1 per cent? Clauses elsewhere in the Bill allow emissions trading and credits, so if there is a problem in this area the Government can buy international credits. We believe these should be restricted, but not excluded. Why then bother to go into this complication of borrowing and banking to fix the figures in retrospect? This area of the Bill can be criticised both within the UK and internationally. It will lead to all sorts of accusations if it is ever used. It is not particularly practical. If the target is missed by 1.1 per cent it cannot be used. Why 1 per cent and not 2 per cent? Why even 0.5 per cent? And if 0.5 per cent, why bother with this mechanism at all?

I genuinely feel that the Government are creating a rod for their own back with Clause 13 and that it would be better purely to use international credits if they wish to do so.

There is a real risk that if Governments are allowed to borrow from another year, the temptation will be to do just that; it will be irresistible.

On the point about international credibility, if the Government can act only after having consulted, and therefore effectively on the advice of the Committee on Climate Change&#151;one can assume that they would not act against the advice of the committee&#151;that particular problem is rather less acute than has been suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. I agree with him that half a per cent seems rather small, and I would be inclined to leave it as it is at 1 per cent in order to give the Government the flexibility to respond to unexpected developments such as, for example, those related to the weather.</p>

I am not intervening on the subject of the difference between half a per cent and 1 per cent, but I recall that when I was the budget Minister in the European Union, we reached a situation where the Parliament would vote the money that was available to be distributed in a particular year absolutely up to the last euro. As a consequence, there was no way we could adjust because it had done deals on every single piece of expenditure. We the British invented the negative reserve, under which we knew perfectly well that not all the money would be spent. We therefore created a negative reserve that gave us enough leeway to be able to negotiate at the closing stage. Money in other parts of the budget would not be spent and it was simply put back into the negative reserve to fill it up so that it would come out flat at the end of the year. So I am all in favour of having an instrument of a modest kind at the margin in order to make such an adjustment&#151;because of the way in which the world works.</p>

I am dealing with Amendments Nos. 77 and 78, and thus effectively with Clause 13, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, remarked, so I shall be slightly longer than I was on previous debates.</p>

<a name="80108-0014.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="080108104000015">The clause ensures that there are strong incentives to over-achieve against budgets and to reduce emissions by more than is necessary. Where this is the case, the surplus emissions may be, but do not have to be, banked for use in the next budget period. The benefits of banking to provide incentives for early action and over-achievement are recognised under the Kyoto Protocol, which also allows for unused emissions rights to be carried forward for future use. We think that this will encourage deeper emissions cuts to be made earlier, which would not be the case if we could not carry forward the savings made by early action. Banking is therefore a good thing in environmental terms because it rewards good behaviour, whether by government, business or other organisations.</p>

<a name="80108-0014.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="080108104000016">Banking can also help to reduce the costs of mitigation, especially where abatement becomes more expensive over time, while still ensuring that emissions, over the period as a whole, are limited. In the context of the policies designed to establish a carbon price, banking reduces the risk of price spikes or crashes at the end of the budget period. There is some evidence, cited in the Stern review, that allowing banking between phases of the United States Acid Rain Program, for example, helped to deliver early reductions and improved participants&#146; efficiency. This evidence suggested that because of the ability to bank from the first phase into the second, the emissions reduced in phase 1 were twice that required to meet the cap.</p>

Without banking, the risk is that effort will be focused on trying to meet budgets exactly, rather than reducing emissions by more and going beyond the budget. Given the problems of the natural variability of emissions, and the uncertainties over what level of carbon savings will be achieved by many policies, removing banking will also increase the risk of not meeting the targets at all.</p>

<a name="80108-0014.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="080108104000018">Clause 13 allows borrowing of emissions from the next budget, but only in strictly limited circumstances. This is to help deal with unexpected natural events, such as a particularly cold winter at the end of a budget period, that could otherwise mean a budget or target is missed. Amendment No. 77 would halve the limit on borrowing to 0.5 per cent of the following budget. As I said, the current limit of 1 per cent in the Bill is not a number plucked from thin air. It reflects the likely situation when an unexpected shock towards the end of a budget period would otherwise lead to a risk of missing the budget.</p>

<a name="80108-0014.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="080108104000019">Analysis suggests that allowing up to 1 per cent of a future budget to be borrowed would be consistent with the rise in emissions that may result during an unexpectedly cold winter, or with the uncertainty around emissions data. There have been three large emission rises due to unexpectedly cold winters since 1990, the coldest of which led emissions in these years to be between 3 and 4 per cent higher than the year before. This effectively means that if 0.8 per cent&#151;that is to say, 4 per cent divided by the five years of the budget period&#151;of the subsequent budget were borrowed, the shock could be absorbed with a 1 per cent limit on borrowing, and the budget would still be met. This would not be the case with a limit set at 0.5 per cent, as Amendment No. 77 proposes.</p>

<a name="80108-0014.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="080108104000020">Another important source of uncertainty is the time it takes to make sure that the UK emissions figures are completely accurate. Provisional figures for emissions in the final year of the budget period will be available shortly after the period ends. These figures are generally accurate to within a few percentage points, but the final confirmed emissions figures are not available until later. Again, if the emissions figures for the last year of the budget period were to be revised upwards by this amount, as the period had already ended, the Government&#146;s options would be incredibly limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="080108104000021">One option available to the Government following the end of a budget period is to buy international credits from the carbon market. As we discussed earlier, there are concerns within the House about this. The 1 per cent limit is therefore considered the most appropriate approach in providing a small degree of flexibility to smooth emissions across budget periods but, crucially, without undermining the clarity and certainty that the budget system as a whole provides. I have given an example of realistic figures from cold winters since 1990. We have an example where we can deploy the figures.</p>

That is why I made the point that if the emissions in the last year of a budget period&#151;that is, a five-year period&#151;were revised upwards by an amount because of an exceptionally cold winter, if the period had already ended the options would be incredibly limited for the Government because we would be in the next budget period. As I understand it, the implication is that we would not go over from one budget to another. Effectively, what you have got has to be contained within the budget period, which is exactly what the noble Lord is saying in regard to the trading system.</p>

Clause 14 clearly separates out information on activity within the UK and activity overseas. Clause 14(2) requires the Secretary of State to report on UK emissions, UK removals, and net UK emissions for each greenhouse gas included within the budget. The terms used in Clause 14 are all defined in Clause 24, which makes it clear that they are referring only to activities which take place within the UK&#146;s borders. The proposal to add &#147;domestic&#148; to Clause 14 would not add anything to these existing provisions, and is therefore redundant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="080108108000017">The Bill also allows the Government to count activity overseas to reduce emissions or enhance removals towards the UK&#146;s budgets. However, this is the case only if these activities are backed up by carbon units. The country which financed the activities is not relevant; it is where the carbon units end up which matters. Clause 14(3) already requires the Secretary of State to report on the use of carbon units during the budget period and to describe the number and types used. There is therefore already a clear separation in Clause 14 between domestic activity and overseas activity, which is the nub of the argument. We fully accept that&#151;there is no distinction between us on this matter. However, the amendments do not add to this clear separation and, in fact, their effect is to confuse the defined terms and concepts used in the Bill. If one rewrites the clause with the amendments as they would change it, it becomes incredibly confusing and tortuous. The amendments are simply not required. There is a clear separation between the activities in he UK and overseas, and the definitions to cover ourselves are in Clause 24.</p>

I fully accept that the wording that my amendment produces might be confusing, but we have a job to do to make absolutely clear what is what. The other confusion that arises when you start to look at Clause 24 is between carbon reductions and other greenhouse gas reductions. I am sure that when we get to that clause the Minister will explain that more fully, but I am very concerned that the public should be able clearly to see that distinction.

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="080108108000051">I turn first to Amendment No. 95. The reasons for altering carbon budgets will vary from the blindingly obvious to the more abstruse. The advice will appear at any time of the year and could reach national authorities at the start of a holiday period, such as Christmas or during the summer. Moreover, any changes need not be based equally in each part of the United Kingdom. Some national authorities may have greater difficulty in assessing their validity and local effects. The climate change committee will contain experts carefully chosen to represent the various branches of relevant knowledge, experience and expertise. The national authorities will be entitled and may feel obliged to consult similar specialists outside the committee. In such circumstances, there may be occasions when a one-month response time limit is unreasonable.</p>

The title and the wording of the clause suggest that the Secretary of State will know some considerable time in advance that a change is likely and presumably the reasons why. It seems probable that he and his staff will also know the scope of any advice before it is published to the other national authorities. In other words, he and his staff will have rather more time than those others to adjust, to plan and to revise arrangements for measuring, monitoring and reporting. The existence of a three-month statutory deadline does not mean that national authorities must take three months. They may never need to; there may be no occasion on which such a response is required. The purpose of the amendment is to build in an allowance for a situation whereby, through either complexity or timing, one month is inadequate.</p>

<a name="80108-0015.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="0801091000002">Clause 17 requires the Secretary of State to obtain the views of the Committee on Climate Change and to consider the views of the devolved Administrations before amending the budget. It sets out a slightly different approach to how the views of the devolved Administrations should be taken into account, depending on whether the budgetary period has already begun. I should have thought that it was eminently reasonable to be able to give a more extended time before the budgetary period is under way. We must remember that the consultations will have taken place before the budgetary period has begun. In setting up the budgetary period, the Secretary of State has to involve the devolved Administrations in consultation. However, once the period is under way, amendments will by definition need to be effected more quickly, because they will relate to a more limited timeframe.</p>

<a name="80108-0015.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="0801091000003">That is all that Clause 17 does. It provides for a reasonable period for the more considered opinion, which is the basis on which the Secretary of State goes forward.

As my noble friend said, we have carried out very extensive consultations with the devolved Administrations, and Northern Ireland and Scotland have already passed motions of assent to the proposals before us. The noble Lord is as ever extremely well motivated with regard to his amendment, but the devolved Administrations do not think it necessary. If we look at the logic of the way in which the consultation process is to be undertaken, there is not a great deal to object to there. The amendment would greatly limit the flexibility provided in the Bill in Clause 17 and we obviously want to sustain that flexibility.</p>

In legal terms, &#147;whether&#148; means &#147;whether or not&#148; and &#147;how&#148; means &#147;how or how not&#148;. In other words, the Secretary of State under the phraseology in Clause 17 is obliged to give a very full account in his statement on whether and how the amendment of the budget takes into account the representations of the devolved Administration. It is not a limited or cursory approach but a fully comprehensive analysis of the representations that have been made and the Secretary of State&#146;s responses to it. I recognise that as a probing amendment this is a very well motivated amendment and a very accurate one. At first sight of the clause it may look as if the Secretary of State is potentially involved in a rather superficial response in his statements&#151;not so. In order to be watertight in legal terms, that statement has to take in the full range of representation and to argue the case for and against such representation. It is a very comprehensive document and I hope the noble Lord feels assured on that point.</p>

If for any reason one of the devolved Administrations gets into difficulty one year with being able to reduce its carbon, for example, or work within its limitations, is something built into the Bill that I have missed which makes allowances for that? Scotland could have an emergency for one year and not then be able to fulfil its obligation to the original agreement. Clearly this does not allow for that. It may be that elsewhere in the Bill exceptions have been made for that. I would be grateful for a bit of clarification.</p>

In order for the United Kingdom to be able to meet its targets, it would have to take account of any such potential dereliction on the part of a devolved Administration and it would be beholden upon the Government to make other arrangements to cover for the weaknesses which might obtain in one area. That is a straightforward reflection of the fact that this is a United Kingdom Bill and the Secretary of State is responsible. That is why he has the powers that he has, which we sought to defend when they have been under challenge at times in the Bill. The responsibility rests with him but, by the same token, in the case of failures within the framework of the United Kingdom in any one area he or she must take account and make arrangements accordingly. It is the responsibility of the Secretary of State.</p>

For example, if Scotland&#151;this is a bad example as I am sure that Scotland would not be at fault&#151;were unable to meet those targets, is the Minister saying that the rest of the Administrations within the UK would have to take up the slack?

I am not an expert in local government but in a sense her parallel is exact. In certain areas the devolved Administrations will have their responsibilities and strategies on how to hit certain targets, and they will have reached the decision on their contribution with the Secretary of State. If there were a deficiency, the United Kingdom would be responsible for it.</p>

I accept that if one of the devolved authorities fails for a particular reason to meet its target it is a United Kingdom responsibility to meet the overall target if at all possible. That does not alter the fact that there is then a devolved authority that, for want of a better word, is in dereliction at that time. The question is whether the devolved authority has to catch up on its target or does the United Kingdom&#151;the other two devolved authorities plus England&#151;continue carrying that authority and its deficit ad infinitum? Is there an arrangement by which the devolved authorities have overall responsibility within their targets to catch up their deficits if they find themselves in the unfortunate position of having such a thing?</p>

The judgment might well be entirely right, fair and proper and the devolved Administration who had missed the targets might well be expected to make the reparation next time. On the other hand, it might be judged that no one could have foreseen the circumstances where the failure occurred. Within that framework, the Secretary of State might judge that with its rather greater resources it should be borne by the United Kingdom, which at the end of the day is responsible to the international judgment on these matters. I make the obvious point to the noble Lord, and indeed to the noble Baroness, that we are dealing with a process of consultation and an adjustment of understanding what is sought and should be achieved. There will be toing and froing within that framework

It shows the potential for tensions that might exist between the United Kingdom Government and the devolved national authorities. We live in a democracy where the governance of one part of the United Kingdom is not forced to be the same or to have the same political beliefs as those of another, and tensions can be built into such a system.</p>

I am very reassured by his comments on Amendment No. 96, which made it clear that the Secretary of State has to do, in effect, what our amendments sought to achieve. I am interested in the response we have had to this very useful debate about the relationship of the Bill, the authorities, the discussions that have currently taken place and the commitments that have been made up to date&#151;knowing full well of course that no parliament can bind its successor and that the agreements that have been made with a devolved authority currently within the United Kingdom may not be persistent.

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="0801093000006">That is absolutely right. The Kyoto targets relate to greenhouse gases and not just to carbon dioxide, and the EU targets for 2020 and beyond concern greenhouse gases. The UK Government were part of setting that at last year&#146;s spring European Council. Looking at the European ETS, we think of it as a carbon trading system, but in fact Annexe II lists the gases included under the directive that set up the trading scheme and&#151;guess what&#151;listed there are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. I have never yet met a sulphur hexafluoride, but the point is that all these gases are extremely important in terms of emissions and they are the accepted basket of gases for measuring the effectiveness of the fight against climate change. However, in the Bill we restrict that. We do not do so for ever&#151;there are clauses to amend the list in future&#151;but at present and for the likely future we say that the provision relates just to carbon dioxide.

However, I believe that those gases should be included. It is equally as important to reduce them according to their weight and use as it is to reduce carbon dioxide. I suggest to the Government that we bring the Bill in line with international and European practice, both of which we have been a part of, and that we include all greenhouse gases so that we can truly call this a Climate Change Bill.

It went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="0801093000041">&#147;this in no way relieves the Government of its responsibility to continue to reduce other greenhouse gases, (both by reasons of domestic necessity and our international obligations). Accordingly, it is essential to monitor all greenhouse gas emissions, in part so as to provide greater transparency when comparing UK performance against EU and Kyoto targets. We recommend that the Bill should be amended to require both the Government and the Committee on Climate Change to include within their monitoring and reporting a clear analysis of all emissions which contribute to global warming, including non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. We further recommend that this be done with the explicit intention of providing a stepping stone to a more comprehensive approach to setting targets across the whole range of greenhouse gases, were that approach to emerge as a result of future international negotiations&#148;.</ul>

The two amendments are in Clause 19, and there is another group consisting of Amendments Nos. 101, 102 and 106, which affect Clauses 19 and 20, as do Amendments Nos. 103 and 105. I cannot for the life of me see why I am required to speak to Clause 20 stand part when I am only dealing with Amendments Nos. 99 and 100 in Clause 19 and I still have other amendments to deal with. The whole point of a clause-stand-part debate is that it takes place at the end of the debates on the amendments when the Committee has discussed the Bill to see whether all the points have been answered. However, I have got a speaking note and at this time of night I am going to stick to it because it is the last time I am coming to this Box tonight.

However, the vast majority&#151;some 85 per cent&#151;of the UK&#146;s contribution to climate change is from carbon dioxide emissions. We have a good understanding of the costs and benefits of reducing CO2 emissions, whereas there is much less understanding about the cost-effective potential of reducing other greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the long-term. That is not to say that we are doing nothing about it because we are taking measures in terms of local authority waste to reduce methane emissions from landfill, which account for 3 per cent. In pushing the uptake of anaerobic digestion for manure slurry and other organic waste and attempting to reduce other greenhouse gases, detailed work is going on in the department. However, 85 per cent of our contribution is to carbon dioxide emissions and we know more about how to deal with them.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="0801093000038">It therefore recommended that there should be annual reporting on all greenhouse gas emissions, and we have accepted that recommendation. The Joint Committee also recommended that this should be a stepping stone, as the noble Lord said, towards an approach which addresses all greenhouse gases. That is provided through Clause 19 and will form part of the review of the 2050 target by the Committee on Climate Change. We have asked the Committee on Climate Change to look at this issue as part of its review of the 2050 target, so that we can take an informed decision on the level of the target and on whether to include other greenhouse gases now. I am here as the Defra Minister, it is true, but it is not my day job, and I regret that I do not know whether we have publicly said that we have asked the Climate Change Committee&#151;which we have not set up, but the secretariat is there in shadow form&#151;to do that so the work is under way.</p>

Clause 19(2) would prevent other greenhouse gases from being included in a budget period which had already started&#151;the intention behind this provision was to provide greater certainty to the relevant sectors of the economy. However, now that the committee will review the 2050 target alongside its advice on the first three carbon budgets, we are reassessing the effect of Clause 19(2) and may&#151;I suspect that means &#147;will&#148;&#151;bring forward a Government amendment on this point in due course.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000010">The noble Baroness said: I begin by wishing everybody a very happy new year. In speaking to Amendments Nos. 1 and 18, I repeat the overwhelming sentiment of Second Reading that we broadly welcome this very important Bill. I look forward to debating the amendments, many of which can only make it  better.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08010887000011">The purpose of the Bill is to improve the provision of care for children and young persons and to ensure that children in care have the same opportunity as all other children and young people. It is important, however, not to lose sight of the fact that providing the support that the Bill seeks to offer can happen in many cases without a child ever having to go into care. While the aim to improve care services is certainly laudable and necessary, we must remember that when it is in the best interests of the child, every effort should be made to keep families together and prevent children going into care in the first place. Of course this is, sadly, not always possible. However, the amendments place a duty on the local authority to make sufficient provision to intervene before the rest of the Bill&#146;s provisions kick in. Having this duty is important for a number of reasons: success in early intervention provides relief for the care system, saving money and allowing the limited resources to be used more effectively. Sometimes problems that could have been resolved by counselling or family group conferences result in a vulnerable child being taken from their home and spending their entire youth in care. We have always welcomed any serious attempt by local authorities to intervene early enough to prevent children being taken into care, and I have often cited the example of Kent County Council, where early intervention and family group counselling have created a virtuous circle.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08010887000012">Everyone we interviewed for our social workers commission said that they would like to see more emphasis placed on proactive work. When the Government issued their Green Paper, <I>Care Matters,</I> we held a number of hearings from those involved in the care sector. A common theme was that the current threshold for intervention into the lives of families on the edge of care is too high. That leads to a very costly process&#151;costly to the lives of those children and costly to the state. Research from the NCH Sheffield Hallam report indicated that early intervention could save &#163;250,000 within one family.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08010887000013">The other amendments in the group outline the specific manner in which we see early intervention being addressed, namely with family group conferences. Such conferences and our specific amendments are supported by a number of children and family lobby groups, including the Family Rights Group and Every Disabled Child Matters. Family group conferences offer a way in which children and their families have the opportunity to have a professionally mediated way of addressing problems and coming up with a plan of resolving them in a manner appropriate to the specific family&#146;s needs. Does the Minister agree that it is vital to take the steps necessary to see that families are not broken up in the first place, and that if problems can be fixed early, they should be?</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08010887000014">I understand that a weakness in my amendment could be the term &#147;as appropriate&#148;, and this could be an excuse not to refer in authorities where they are not confident of the model. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that the amendments are a genuine attempt to put some anchor points into a Bill that will require a great deal of best practice and good will. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000015"><b><a name="80108-gc0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="08010887000078">Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I will speak to Amendment No. 26 in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and also to Amendment No. 27, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08010887000016">Amendment No. 26 is very similar to Amendment No. 18, which has already been spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. It differs slightly in that it seeks to promote a family group conference before a child is committed into care and puts a duty on the local authority to undertake a family group conference when there is a strong likelihood of the child being committed into care and to offer the opportunity of a family conference to develop the care plan for the child. It is important to emphasise that point, because even when a child is taken into care, a family group conference is useful so that the family can understand what the plan for the child is, participate, be involved and to some extent have ownership of that plan. I emphasise the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that such early intervention and thinking forward is a very important part of the process.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08010887000017">Family group conferences are a proven mechanism to enable partnership between the state and families at all key decision-making points for the child, including as a means of engaging the family to identify and support care arrangements for vulnerable children and their parents and as a way of identifying  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC263"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>alternative care arrangements within the family when the parent cannot continue to look after the child, including identifying necessary support packages to avoid the child being received into care prior to legal action being undertaken, other than in emergencies.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08010887000018">Recent research has found that family and friends placements were initiated by social workers in only 4 per cent of cases, with the vast majority of placements initiated by relatives and friends. There is therefore clear scope to improve practice and to increase the number of family and friend placements. Family group conferences are a very effective way of engaging family members to come forward to care for a child if a child cannot live at home. The number of family group conferences taking place in England and Wales is increasing, and we welcome the commitment in the White Paper <I>Care Matters: Time for Change</I> to developing the capacity to deliver family group conferences. Nevertheless, whether a family is offered a family group conference is currently dependent on where they live and whether the social worker is inclined to support it. In other words, it is something of a postcode lottery. We believe that it should be the right of every child to know that it has not been removed from his or her family without the state fully exploring all the options for the child to remain within the wider family network. It is worth noting that it is a legal requirement in New Zealand that there should be a family group conference before a child is taken into care.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08010887000019">We have also added our names to Amendment No. 27, the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. It deals with the provision of mental health and other services that might support the child and his family, which we discussed extensively at Second Reading. I am very grateful to the Minister for the letter that he sent after that debate, which spoke, among other things, of the statutory guidance that will be issued in the coming year on promoting health for looked-after children and which will make it clear that child and adolescent mental health services should be providing targeted and dedicated provision that prioritises children in care. That is certainly not the case at the moment. We should be delighted to see that guidance made explicit to PCTs and to child and adolescent mental health services.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08010887000020">The Minister also talked about two projects where pilots are being run aimed at providing additional support for vulnerable children and their families; the multi-systemic therapy intervention, which gives the child cognitive behavioural therapy strategies with a range of family support services, and the family drug and alcohol court developments, which are being piloted and developed. Both of those are very promising developments. We are delighted to see that they are taking place but other forms of therapy might be piloted and I hope that the Minister will say a little more about that.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000021"><b><a name="80108-gc0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08010887000079">Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> I support Amendment No. 18, to which I have added my name. I also support much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has just said. I start with an unscripted bit about how very challenging and encouraging it is  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC264"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be in a room where so many people are focused in a non-party political way on the welfare of children. Many noble Lords present are members of the all-party parliamentary group which I chair. This strong grouping, including the observers, clearly indicates that if we support people who care for children, we support children themselves. That is the focus of our deliberations. The welfare of the child, as always, should remain paramount.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08010887000022">I want to say two things. First, the amendment supports the notion of consulting with children, which is evident in much recent government policy. Secondly, it also ties in with some of my later amendments on kinship care. Family group conferences genuinely seek to engage the family in identifying support care arrangements for vulnerable children, alternative care and support packages. They also provide pathways to planning and a means for the child to see members of their family and return home to the family from state care whenever possible. I support the amendment which has already been spoken to.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000023"><b><a name="80108-gc0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="08010887000080">Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> I, too, support the amendments and even more so in the light of the comments of the noble Baronesses, Lady Morris, Lady Sharp and Lady Massey, with which I strongly agree. My interventions will be wholly benevolent because I believe that this Bill is needed and I support it very much. I would like potential changes to follow the spirit in which the Government have presented the Bill to make a Bill which gives the best hope for improving the conditions of looked-after children and young persons.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08010887000024">I support both the key elements in this group of amendments. The first is early intervention, raised in Amendments Nos. 1 and 18, which is an underlying point of real importance. I shall not argue at great length that it must be built into the Bill but it is extremely important and if we can get it in the Bill, all the better. Early intervention is really important as regards all these issues.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08010887000025">The second element is family conferences and family therapy, which are not quite the same thing. Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 do not cover exactly the same ground but they are close to it. Both those elements are very helpful and, as some noble Lords said, we all know that there is strong pressure towards using more family therapy where there is a mental health problem. I have seen it in action and I very much support it. I support all four amendments in the group.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000026"><b><a name="80108-gc0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="08010887000081">The Earl of Listowel:</b> I support Amendment No. 26, to which my name is attached, and the general principle behind these amendments. It reminds me of the joint chief inspector&#146;s report on safeguarding children published two years ago now. One of its most troubling and important findings was that the thresholds for interventions with families were too often too low to ensure that children were protected from harm and were also often too low when a child was being abused to enable social services to intervene to get them out of that situation. That is very important and the resources, particularly social workers, must be available to deliver

Perhaps the Minister can confirm that when a child is fostered by his or her extended family in such circumstances, the outcome is likely to be better, which is a very good reason to support them.

<p><a name="08010887000027">Last year, I attended a seminar sponsored by Family Law UK, with representation from the Family Rights Group, which looked at family group conferencing, in particular. Evidence strongly points to the success of this approach, but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, said, there seems to be some reluctance by local authorities to implement it. The noble Baroness said that this approach is used in only 4 per cent of circumstances. Can the Minister confirm whether there is such apparent reluctance on the part of local authorities? Perhaps he would write to me. What might be the reason? Perhaps it is the cost of setting up a meeting in the first instance. What does the Minister consider to be the problem? I welcome the measures to prioritise placement with a family. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

Let me add to what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said. For those of us who have sat through previous children&#146;s legislation, where two or three people met and hoped that someone almighty was with us, it is wonderful to see so many people taking an interest.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08010887000029">No one who has been involved with social work for as long as I have can disagree with the tenor of any of these amendments. Clearly, the content is crucial. However, I question whether they need to be in legislation. On how the amendments would be incorporated, it would be interesting to hear whether the guidance and workforce planning going on answers some of the issues. We should remember that Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 already places a duty on local authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Within that duty, they are able to provide most things described in the amendments. The problem with Section 17 is the phrase, &#147;who are in need&#148; and the way in which local authorities have closely and tightly defined children in need to the exclusion of vast rafts of children who have needs that are not being met. Therefore, unless we get that clear, none of these amendments will improve the lot of children. We simply will be repeating previous legislation and not taking it forward.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08010887000030">As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, good prevention is good practice. We have heard the Government saying that about health services recently. We hope that they will pay the same attention to children as they have paid to adults in preventive health services. But all that depends on resources, skills and training, rather than legislation.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08010887000031">Family group conferencing is a very good preventive measure, but we must be extremely careful if we include it in legislation. It is equally important

<p><a name="08010887000034">I go back to family group conferencing. The issue that I have with including it in legislation is that, having been involved with family groups and knowing the dynamics of families at times of trauma and difficulty, I know that that can be just the time not to bring some families together but to do good individual work until families can come together. In my work in CAFCASS, it is noticeable that the families who come before the court are increasingly more complex, with deeper and deeper difficulties, which may be why fewer children are being placed in extended families&#151;as Members of the Committee will know, I am a keen exponent of placing with families, and especially of encouraging grandparents.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08010887000035">We have to be careful and remember that these are not your next-door-neighbour families, on the whole; these are families with extreme difficulties. Family group conferencing has been shown by research to be extremely positive when it works, but needs to be carried out with skill.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08010887000036">The Committee will know that I am a family case worker and therapist by background and my other anxiety is the level of skill that is available. I know that work is under way on workforce development. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister about that in terms of skills development, so that we know that the services that could and should be provided will be provided in future. I repeat, Section 1 of the 1963 Act&#151;it goes back that far&#151;now incorporated in Section 17 of the Children Act, while not referring directly to family group conferencing, gives the capacity to provide all those services. Section 17(10) includes support for the child's family.</p>

I very much support the concept of the Bill. In principle, I support the amendments. We need to have a specific requirement, where appropriate, for family conferencing or family intervention. One can always deal with it by saying, &#147;where appropriate&#148;, to cover the situation that my noble friend Lady Howarth, has rightly raised. Of course, to bring some families into the same room is a recipe for the police.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000039">My experience as a family judge trying care cases&#151;I am certain that my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan will have had exactly the same experience&#151;is that halfway through the case, you find  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC267"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the parents say that they were never given the chance to take part. In some cases, that was true; in others it was not. Perhaps more importantly, that required the judge to ask social services whether they had looked at the wider family. I have to tell the Committee that, during I cannot remember how many years as a family judge, there were numerous examples where social services had gone rushing ahead and had never looked for the aunt, the cousin or the grandparent who was the obvious person to have the child.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08010887000040">My feeling is that if we do not have a specific requirement, whether in primary legislation, in a statutory instrument or in guidance backed by a requirement, unless the local authority is told that it must consider a family conferencing early intervention, that is a recipe, I am sorry to say, for a large number of local authorities not to do it. Somewhere, either in legislation or in guidance, there must be that requirement. It is very important that that is part of the Bill, in whichever form is thought appropriate. It is very important that parents are not given the opportunity to tell the judge or the magistrates that they were not consulted and that the wider family is considered with a great deal of care before we put the child into a wholly new family.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08010887000041">Over the years that I have been doing these cases there have been many where there would have been a cost implication of enormous value to a local authority, and therefore to the state, in getting hold of a family member early so that there are not the long, drawn-out and extremely expensive care proceedings, bitterly fought to the end, in which the child is in limbo for 12 to 18 months&#151;and probably moved four or five times or more under short-term arrangements. The family really must be looked at.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08010887000042">I am interested in Clause 27 on the need for intensive family therapy. The Cassel Hospital is west London is a unique family therapy unit. It is not only unique, it is outstanding&#151;and it is expensive. It is in grave danger of having to close. Since a decision of the House of Lords Judicial Committee, it has basically been unnecessary for a local authority to send a child there for assessment if the assessment includes therapy. If we recognised that intensive family therapy at a very early stage would probably send a child back to the family in a certain percentage of cases, we would save the cost of the foster parent for the next 10 or 12 years. This splendid Bill has behind it intentions such as local authorities continuing to pay for these families through university education, so we are talking far beyond 10 or 12 years.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08010887000043">I strongly support intensive family therapy. Tied to that, please do not let the Cassel fail and shut down. If we do, the best place in the country will be gone and there will be nowhere else quite as good.</p>

Unfortunately we do not currently really know what type or proportion of families can benefit.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0001.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08010887000045">I add a note in support of the comments of my noble friend Lady Howarth that we must indicate to local authorities that they should explore what facilities might be appropriate for individuals. I do not know how this is best done, but I know that it is too early in our understanding and knowledge of how these things can work to put it in statute sensibly. We must do a lot more practical research on what works before we can say that. Of course, family conferencing is important and should be encouraged, but family therapy in particular probably only works when the whole family is ready for it. It can be quite destructive at times.</p>

<p><a name="08010887000048">The Bill in its entirety is an accomplishment for those who have thought deeply and considered the needs of the community in this regard. It can be improved in many radical ways. It may well be argued that this is perhaps not the vehicle for all those possible improvements&#151;that vehicular defence is always raised in respect of any radical legislation&#151;but we should remember that we may not go along this way again for quite some time. It is unlikely that we will see another children&#146;s Bill for many years.

<p><a name="08010887000049">I wholeheartedly agree with the proposition that even contemplating the application for a care order on the part of a local authority should be regarded as a policy of last resort. When you consider all the sanctions that the courts have with regard to the criminal law, still one of the most impactive and significant orders dealing with human liberty that a court can ever contemplate making is a care order. I am sure that every court that has ever been seized of that jurisdiction is aware of that responsibility. That means that a local authority should consider applying for a care order only when it is convinced that it has exhausted all the other practical possibilities, as so  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>many Members of the Committee have already mentioned. Even then, of course, it has to consider under Section 31 of the Act whether the basic criteria have been satisfied, and even then, in the light of those tests having been successfully passed, whether it is appropriate, in relation to the needs of that particular child, to make a care order. A judge has to be satisfied not only that those tests have been successfully proven but that the care plan has been imaginatively and thoroughly put together.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08010887000050">A great deal depends on each circumstance, but I am afraid a great deal also depends upon the financial and human resources of a local authority. I speak with regard to certain local authorities in Wales. The latest local government reorganisation in Wales allowed Wales to go back to a scheme of 22 counties. Many revelled in that; I was glad to see my ancient county of Cardigan reinstated in its full local government sovereignty. The reorganisation means, however, that many of those counties are extremely weak in financial terms. I have often thought that it might have been better, in relation to certain matters, for there to be an amalgamation of services, and children&#146;s services might have been at the front of the queue for consideration. The poverty of many of those local authorities makes it difficult for them to commit all the resources, human and financial, that they would wish to commit to children in many circumstances, with the result that care plans are put forward, with the best will in the world, with inadequate examination and incomplete consideration. That means that often a care order will have been made in circumstances where it is not absolutely necessary&#151;where there has been no detailed examination, as my noble and learned friend has said, with regard to all the family members who might be adequate to assist in the matter. I am not sure how one goes about that.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08010887000051">I salute Amendment No. 1 for everything that it represents, although it would probably never achieve its aims because it deals with children who are the subject of Clause 1 and Clause 1 deals with children who are already looked after. Most of those looked-after children will be the subject of a care order already and one has to intervene at a much earlier point. Other children who are not the subject of a care order will be looked after under the other provisions of the Children Act 1989.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08010887000052">Clearly, it has to be inculcated in the minds of all concerned with the care of children that one should resort to this scheme&#151;a care order&#151;only when all other possibilities have been exhausted. To my mind, that can never be over-endorsed or over-supported in financial and human terms. If these amendments do no more than concentrate the mind on such matters, they will have succeeded. However, I may be wrong and it may be possible for there to be a specific piece of statutory precept included which will operate at an appropriate time for the childcare case and for children who do not actually go into care.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08010887000054">This is a probing amendment and I hope that it will begin a debate about the <I>Care Matters</I> recommendation that we should concentrate our efforts on avoiding the need for care&#151;early intervention&#151;rather than waiting years to pick up the pieces when children or young people arrive in prison. Having trained and worked with a number of therapy modalities many years ago, I am aware of the incredible power of family therapy, almost over and above the other therapies with which I have worked. I refer to an example from 30 years ago which sticks in my mind. Two children in a family were repeatedly admitted to hospital with acute asthma&#151;they were blue and at death's door. This had gone on for a number of years and a highly skilled family therapist in the hospital where I worked at the time decided to take on this family. They were given only six sessions of family therapy, and the children never returned. I was told that their asthma disappeared. For me that was extraordinary. I was relatively young and fairly green and it was very striking. Those children had a particular sematic response to the very profound problems within the family. As we know, the great majority of children illustrate the problems of their parents through emotional, behavioural and mental health problems.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08010887000055">My noble friend Lady Murphy said that we do not yet know who can be helped by family therapy. The NICE guidelines are quite good on family therapy. They recommend it alongside CBT as one of the most effective interventions with specific problems, including problems such as depression and anxiety. Many parents and families have those kinds of problems and there is evidence to support the fact that family therapy works. I very rarely disagree with my noble friend Lady Murphy but on this occasion I feel that I am on reasonably firm ground. It is certainly no surprise to me that the NCH claims that, on average, in four out of five referrals to their intensive family therapy services the children do not end up in care, although that appears to be a dramatic statement.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08010887000056">I am sure that the intensive family work done by the NCH will be peculiarly helpful for those severely disturbed families. The sort of work that I was doing was much less intensive. Obviously, the Government will be concerned about the cost, but the NCH evidence on cost is just a no-brainer: the tiny cost of &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000 for family therapy spread over those children whom it benefits as well as those whom it does not. Every child who goes into care costs &#163;36,000 a year, or something of that kind, quite apart from all the long-term costs of youth justice courts, prisons&#151;you name it.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08010887000057">Bearing in mind the Government&#146;s commitment in their document to that sort of approach, I hope that the Minister will take the amendment very seriously and take it on board as his own.</p>

I say at the outset, because it is early in our proceedings, that, having been a profound sceptic about the whole process of a Committee stage in the Moses Room, I have been converted. As a hard-nosed politician, as I like to think of myself professionally, I used to feel that the trouble with the Moses Room procedure was that it was nothing: you had a lot of talk but you did not take things to a vote; what did that really add to the whole legislative cause? I have now come to see that it has a very great potential value as a kind of pre-legislative consultation. It gives my noble friends who are Ministers the opportunity to take very seriously the arguments put forward, which have been brought forward with great experience and effectiveness this afternoon, take them away and think: if there is a valid point, how can it can best be met? That is a very sane approach to legislation and I hope that we will make full use of it. We know what sort of people my noble friends are, so I am sure that they will respond in that spirit.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08010887000059">The second thing that I want to say about our work in general, which starts with the amendments, is that, as has already been said, there are considerable resource implications to an awful lot of what we are talking about: human resource and cost resource implications. We all know that local authorities are under incredible pressure on expenditure. That is a real challenge that we see repeatedly in social policy: because of our failure to give priority and finance to the strategic things that need to be done, we are using vast amounts of public expenditure to deal tactically with the consequences of that failure. In the long term, it is therefore a totally illusory saving. It is counterproductive; it actually increases the cost.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08010887000060">However, although those financial implications are very important for us all and need to be thought about, we in this Committee are all primarily concerned with the children. Here, I want to make just two points in support, however inadequate, of what the noble Baroness said. The first thing that troubles me about so much of our social work, in whatever dimension it is taking place, is that so often we are dealing with the symptom of the real social issue. I hope that the great champions of children will not mind my saying that sometimes we have not only to see children as children&#151;which is crucial&#151;but to see the predicament in which they find themselves as a symptom of something more profound. In that sense, the great strength of the approach in this amendment, and others, is that it allows us to look at how to address a total situation and deal with the root causes rather than simply the symptoms.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08010887000061">Finally, some very telling points have been made. For a child with an already disturbed life, it is right that we should avoid a feeling, a sense, by the child, however inarticulately expressed, that he or she is somehow being systematised and being handed over to a system&#151;however enlightened and committed, and no one doubts the enlightenment, dedication and commitment&#151;for dealing with such children; as distinct from, in the best sense, a more spontaneous, emotional situation in which he or she still can feel that they belong and are a part of the situation.

For different reasons, I am very much in favour of all these amendments, particularly early intervention because of the social and financial costs. I agree entirely with the need to deal with that. I was at a meeting with my noble friend Lord Listowel where the point was made that you have to look at prevention because of the social and financial costs. But, at the same time, because you have failed&#151;and we have failed&#151;you also have to take action and do your best for those who have been failed.</p>

It is really dangerous to shut some of these facilities. These children fall between health, social services, education and mental health. I served for many years at a young offenders&#146; institution, and saw thousands of young people with problems. We should take seriously the prevention of these people becoming criminals and going to prison. It is a dangerous situation and they need all the support they can get, as do their parents. I would be grateful if my noble and learned friend would tell us more about that hospital. Something should be done to stop these facilities from closing.</p>

I had an agonised letter from it just before Christmas, which I passed on to my noble friend Lord Listowel, and I believe he has been in touch with one of the Ministers about it. It is difficult to know how to help the organisation. It needs support from individuals and organisations, but it needs government funding as well.

It is therefore all the more important that the proper support services are in place to ensure that this step does not need to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000004">Helping children to stay with their families is an important part of the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper referred to by many noble Lords. Most of chapter 2 sets out how we intend to promote the capacity for families to sustain relationships with children through times of turbulence and stress, through the increased provision of support for the most vulnerable children on the edge of care. I particularly draw attention to the plans set out in chapter 2 for multi-systemic therapy on page 37, and the new family drug and alcohol court described on page 36&#151;which the noble Baroness Lady Sharp, mentioned, and which has just been launched as part of Wells Street magistrates&#146; court in central London&#151;and an expansion of family group conferencing to make it more widely available.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000005">In October 2006, we published guidance to local authorities which emphasises the importance of support being available to families at the earliest point at which it is needed. As part of this, we encouraged them to develop better support services for families. Specific new services include family intervention projects to reduce anti-social behaviour, and pilots of nurse-family partnerships aimed at vulnerable new mothers.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000006">On the statutory framework, Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 already contains a wide duty on local authorities to provide a range of services to promote and safeguard the welfare of children in need, and a duty under Section 17(1)(b) of that Act to promote the upbringing of such children by their families, defined as:</p>
<ul><a name="08010894000037">&#147;any person who has parental responsibility for the child and any other person with whom he has been living&#148;.</ul>

Rather, we are addressing the actual services which local authorities provide, which in part&#151;as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said&#151;support the work of the courts to ensure that children do not need to be taken into care, in pursuit of the duties that local authorities already have under the Children Act.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000008">Amendment No. 1 of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, relates specifically to the duties of local authorities over children placed within social work practices. This relates to the following debate, but I stress that, under the social work practice model, local authorities will retain the responsibility for providing services to children in need who live at home with their parents under Section 17 of the Children Act. Social work practices will have no role in relation to such children who have never had any contact with the care system. They can be involved only after the local authority has decided to apply to the court for an interim care order and the court has granted that order and where the child has become a looked-after child on a voluntary basis.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0002.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08010894000009">Those powers and duties apply equally to looked-after children to whom, in addition, the local authority owes an express duty to make arrangements to enable the child to live with his parents.

Many local authorities work with voluntary and other organisations in dealing with children who are not in care but who are in danger of being placed in care. I am thinking of the Family Welfare Association, which is now joined with other organisations and with NSPCC projects. I assume that what the Minister is saying will not prevent that work continuing. The implication was that all the work&#151;this is only to do with private practices&#151;that is carried out by the voluntary sector at the moment would not happen.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000014">Page 33 of the White Paper <I>Care Matters</I> showcases a very good example of how a family group conference has been used to generate a preventative package to enable a very vulnerable young girl to stay at home. Noble Lords who have experience in this area will be able to supplement that. A family group conference is a complex service to provide and it requires high levels of skill and competence. For that reason, we announced in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper that we would fund a programme of regional training events to equip managers and practitioners with the necessary skills

In November 2006, a toolkit funded by my department was published, aimed both at supporting existing family group conference projects to sustain the projects and to assist new agencies to set up a service where none currently exists. In December 2006, we also funded the publication of a family group conferencing reader, containing a wide range of essays on research, policy and practice perspectives. That is available to practitioners in the field.</p>

The guidance states at paragraph 10.2:</p>

Furthermore, it is not clear whether it is envisaged under the amendment that those services should be provided to children who are looked after to enable a speedy return home, or to children on the edge of care to avoid looked-after status, or both.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000018">However, the Government entirely share the concern expressed by Members of the Committee regarding the provision of services that are culturally sensitive. As part of our implementation of the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, we will be encouraging local authorities to analyse and manage their care populations more proactively, which will include an understanding of the racial and cultural profile of children in need in their area, as well as the differing needs of long and short stayers in the care system. That should enable local authorities to take a more sophisticated approach to commissioning services, ensuring a better match between the range of services offered and the cultural profile of the local population.</p>

I am told that the evidence shows that disruption rates are broadly similar between family and friends foster placements and those foster placements made with strangers. Family and friends carers receive considerably less support, and children tend to speak positively about being with the wider family, so that context has to be taken into account when taking decisions. We recognise that in respect of arrangements instigated by local authorities with family and friends the practice varies and, in response to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and the noble Earl, it probably varies too much. <I>Care Matters</I> sets out our commitment to establish a more consistent approach to considering extended family and friends carers at every stage.</p>

I will reflect on her points, but we believe that it is adequate. It provides a definition of children in need that makes it clear that local authorities should intervene where necessary if a child is unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health and development, or where the child is at risk of suffering a significant impairment without the provision of services.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08010894000021">The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, referred to funding. I have responsibility only for the situation in England, so I have immediately to hand only the statistics for England. Spending on children&#146;s social care in England has increased from &#163;2.1 billion in 1996 to &#163;5 billion in 2007, which is a real terms increase of 88 per cent in 10 years. There has been a substantial increase in resources available to local authorities. There is always the issue of trade-offs that local authorities must consider, but they are doing so in the context of a significantly enhanced resource. The White Paper <I>Care Matters</I> is being funded in England to the tune of &#163;300 million over a four-year period. I cannot speak for the position either generally in Wales or specifically for Cardiganshire, but the grants made available to Wales as a whole will have increased in line with those for England.</p>

<p><a name="08010894000022">In respect of the Cassel hospital at Ham in Surrey, to which the noble and learned Baroness referred, I am informed that it has seen a significant reduction in referrals to its family unit following the case of RG, which the noble and learned Baroness could probably tell us more about than I can. The funding issues are a matter for the Department of Health, but I will write to Members of the Committee to set out the department&#146;s view.

Will the Minister consider the proposition in the amendment&#151;not necessarily the exact words&#151;that there should be more definition and clarity about the duties of the authorities to provide early intervention family work to try to avoid children going into care? It seems to me that there is great potential here if one can get the wording right.</p>

<ul>

(b) his health or development is likely to be significantly impaired, or further impaired, without the provision for him of such services; or (c) he is disabled&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08010894000033">Those are strong duties on local authorities and we would need to be persuaded that the insertion of new duties over and above that was a wise proceeding before we took any step in that direction.</p>

Very often the difficulties arise because social services departments have to work as if they were totally in isolation as compared with other limbs of local government. In other words, had there been a measure of co-operation and understanding between social services, the education authorities, the health authorities and the housing authorities, then, indeed, in many cases the family would not have split up. It is a matter of total simplicity and of total significance. Of course, there will be situations where legislation is necessary but this has nothing to do with legislation at all; it has a lot to do with knocking people&#146;s heads together.

My noble friend Lady Masham of Ilton made the point that too many of these children are ending up in custody not just through their own actions, but often because we have failed them. Fairly recently, Members of your Lordships&#146; House heard of a 23 year-old who spoke of how she began her prison career at the age of 13. She had been in a good children's home placement for 12 months and one day, out of the blue, she was taken out of that placement. She and the staff were not alerted beforehand and she says that her criminal career began at that point because of her resentment. She could have been settled in that comfortable placement with people whom she knew but she was just ripped out of it at the last moment.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08010899000008">Such things continue to happen although the situation has improved somewhat. We urgently need to do much more to improve the lives of such children. We have higher levels of custody for children in this country than our neighbours, and those high levels lead to a high turnover of children&#151;a high level of churn&#151; which leads to poor relationships between prison officers and young people in custody, which leads to excessive use of physical restraint. There is now a call from the Prison Officers&#146; Association for batons in children&#146;s and young people's settings. We must address these matters with the utmost urgency. I commend the Government for bringing forward this important piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08010899000009">On social work practices, I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues for creating a multidisciplinary team of such eminence to consider how the notion of independent social work practices might be taken forward so that children in care should receive greater continuity of care. Paul Fallon, director of Barnet social services, who is very well respected, was a member of that team and the academic on the team was from the London School of Economics, a world-renowned institution. The report produced by the committee recognised the strong differences of opinions of its members and provided a helpful rationale for the proposed independent practices.</p>

<p><a name="08010899000010">The Bill proposes pilots. Can these limited pilots, perhaps only two years in length, really provide us with the information we need to understand the impact such practices will have on social services? I think not, and many others share my doubts. On the other hand, the Prime Minister was recently speaking with enthusiasm about extending the market in social care. The political priority being given to this innovation is implied by its taking pride of place in this Bill. Once this juggernaut gets going it may be hard to see how it can be stopped. The production of a shiny new initiative, a fix for social work, is likely to be overwhelmingly seductive to any Administration that holds office when the pilots terminate. The question of whether social work is ripe for such change is likely to take second place to the need for something to be seen to be done. This has been the experience at local authority level for decades as each new broom has introduced its new structures and social workers have torn their hair out seeking to adjust.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08010899000011">I share the view expressed at Second Reading by my noble friend Lady Howarth of Breckland, a former director of social services. We need to focus on what is most important. The problem, of raising the status of social work, of improving the retention of social workers, and of ensuring the professional and continuous care of our children is complex. Its solution hinges on providing the right professional framework for social workers. The Government's White Paper <I>Options for Excellence</I> laid out what that framework should be. While there has been some progress in the 14 months since that White Paper hit our desks, it has been slow. I would appreciate the Minister laying out what steps have been taken in response to that White Paper since it was put forward. I know there were welcome steps: for example, the need for qualified social work practitioners.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08010899000012">There are many obstacles. Children's services have been separated from adult services, splitting responsibility for social workers between two different departments. The fusion of health and social care risks diluting the voice of social work further. There are several regional skills councils&#151;the Children's Workforce Development Council and the Children's Workforce Network&#151;with input into the evolution of social work. Social work falls between more and more stools. The Children's Workforce Development Council is very well respected but has a huge work programme. The new children&#146;s services are led predominantly by educationalists and there is the concern that this new leadership may not have the experience to know what social workers on the front line and children in care or in need may require.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08010899000013">Is it really advisable to introduce another level of complexity with these practices? Can the Minister say what the response of the British Association of Social Workers has been to the proposed practices? Is the Association of Directors of Social Services enthusiastic in its support? How far is the workforce on side? All-important will be the establishment of good contracts between the new providers and local authorities. However, in the past such commissioning has historically been poor. It may lead to a significant increase in the cost of the provision made by the new

The practices may cherry pick their clients leaving a Cinderella service outside the practices to deal with those they exclude. I fear we risk creating a fragmented service which will benefit some children at the cost of others. There is a danger that social service departments may become even more incoherent then they often already are.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08010899000014">Some local authorities are already making significant improvements in the continuity of care for their children. Barnet has created smaller social work teams and has motivated experienced practitioners to stay at the front line supporting their less experienced colleagues by creative new social work roles, such as senior practitioners. Hackney is developing smaller teams with intense integral therapeutic support. Each team has half-time support from a mental health professional. This is beginning to show fruits in terms of retention.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08010899000015">I continually hear that social work needs to benefit from the same efforts that the noble Lord and his colleagues have put into reforming education. I know that what is proposed is done with the best of intentions and seems likely to benefit the children in the proposed practices. However, I am concerned that this may be at the cost of wider consistent implementation of reforms which will make social work the respected, professional institution that our children&#146;s needs dictate that it must become. I seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance on this matter.</p>

I enthusiastically welcome this Bill and wish this very large Committee a happy new year. Members of the Committee will have noticed that we on these Benches have tabled quite a large number of amendments, which fall into two groups. Some are probing and others are what I like to think of as Oliver Twist amendments; in other words, &#147;Thank you very much. That&#146;s very nice, but can we please have some more?&#148;.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08010899000017">These are probing amendments to Clause 1 stand part and all the clauses in Part 1. Obviously, without Clause 1 none of the others is any use. We have tabled these amendments, not because we have any problem in principle with this idea, but because we do not believe that the proposed arrangements will necessarily provide a solution to the problems identified with the current arrangements for caring for looked-after children. Neither do we believe that the proposals or the arrangements for the pilots have been thoroughly thought through by the Government. Finally, we have great concerns about the knock-on effects of these proposed arrangements on the existing local authority provision and the workforce. Of course, underpinning all our concerns is our worry about the outcomes and welfare of children in care. That is what matters most. It is really immaterial how their care is provided as long as it is of high quality and gives them the best possible second chance in life&#151;their first chance having gone horribly wrong or they would not be in care in the first place.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08010899000018">It seems to me that the proposals in Part 1 are made in response to three problems: first, the lack of stability and quality of relationships between the

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08010899000019">We now have to ask whether the proposals for private social work practices will solve these problems or whether paying more attention to the existing structures would do it better. To give him his due, Professor Le Grand does not claim that social work practices are the answer to everything. However, his paper and his recommendations raise a number of serious issues.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08010899000020">First, there is a fundamental problem with his comparison of social work practices with GP practices. Primary health care, like education, is the universal service. GP practices serve the whole community with non-acute services, while acute cases are referred to specialists and hospitals. The 60,000 children in care represent 0.001 per cent of the population and are the most needy, most acute cases. Given that GP practices have great difficulty in providing 24/7 cover to their patients, my first question for the Minister is how does he think that groups of six to 10 people, not all of whom will be registered social workers, will be able to provide 24/7 care to their child clients? Our worry is that, given this difficulty, those practices will only contract for the easier end of the spectrum and will leave the most difficult cases to the local authority social services departments. If that were to happen, it would be easy to see how, eventually, the social work practices would be able to cream off the best social workers locally.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08010899000021">Clause 2(5) says that the local authority must secure that the functions are carried out by, or supervised by, a GSCC-registered social worker. Can the Minister confirm that only registered social workers in the social work practices will carry out those functions which would be carried out only by registered social workers in the local authority?</p>
<h5><a name="08010899000043">5 pm</h5>

<a name="80108-gc0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08010899000022">On resources, given recommendation 11 in Professor Le Grand&#146;s paper that these groups are given pump-priming funding, it is clear that they will not be working on a level playing field with the local authority department. Would the Minister consider that a fairer way of making a real comparison between a new social work practice and a local authority department would be to give the local authority department the same sort of pump-priming funding to enable it to address some of the problems that I outlined earlier? Will this difference in funding be taken into account in the evaluation of the pilots?</p>

<p><a name="08010899000023">One of the problems that I mentioned earlier is the stability of staffing and the continuity of the relationship between the social worker and the child.  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC284"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Could the Minister explain how that matter is likely to be improved by contracting out services? Surely the monitoring and contractual arrangements between the authority and the social work practice will hive off funding from the coalface that could have been spent on ensuring greater continuity? It is also difficult to see how these new arrangements are going to &#147;reduce bureaucracy&#148;, as has been claimed. Indeed, it looks to me as if it will be increased.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08010899000024">Moving on to other issues relating to the pilots, I am concerned about the supervision of the social work practices during the pilot period. According to Clause 6(1)(b)(i), Ofsted&#146;s supervision of providers of social work does not kick in until after the end of the pilot period. Who will be registering and inspecting these bodies during the pilot period? How will the Government receive independent advice about whether the pilots are working well and whether the evaluation before any rollout is considered will be independent?</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08010899000025">Professor Le Grand&#146;s working party recommended that the contract between the local authority and the social work practice should be outcome-based. Presumably the assessment of the success or otherwise of the arrangements will also be based on outcomes. In that case, it is essential that we compare apples with apples and not apples with pears. In other words, how will the Government ensure that comparisons are really being made between two organisations with exactly comparable client caseloads and resources? It is interesting that recommendation 3 of the working party was that information should be gathered about the real full costs of providing local authority children&#146;s services to help inform the setting of the budgets for the new social work practices. It is surprising to me that the real costs of such services are not already known to the Government. Many local authorities that are determined to provide a good, high-quality service have to top up what they receive from the Government from their own resources to do so.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08010899000026">The working group recommends that there should be an evaluation strategy for assessing the impact of social work practice pilots. It stated that this should include comparisons with control groups of the average and the best authorities. If the Government accept that recommendation, will the Minister undertake to make use of the information so gathered about the characteristics of the best local authorities and put the same effort into disseminating best practice among those public authorities as they are now proposing to put into the new contracting-out arrangements?</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08010899000027">In this regard, I made particular note of recommendation 2 of the working group report, which calls for greater attention in the social work training curriculum to the importance of stability and continuity in services for children and their implication for social workers&#146; professional development. Will the Government pick up this recommendation in relation to all social workers, wherever they are employed?</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08010899000028">The overarching concern is that the proposals fit in with the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda and the delivery of integrated services. There seems to me to be a disconnect between the Government&#146;s recent activities

The establishment of the children&#146;s services authority and the appointment of a director of children's services and a lead member on the councils was a direct and appropriate response to the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming. Indeed, within the past six months we have had the setting up of the Department for Children, Schools and Families in order further to integrate all matters relating to children. Against these developments, which we on this side of the Committee support, the contracting out of social work practice appears to be going into reverse. I hope that the Minister can allay some of our concerns in his reply and convince us that the power to set up these pilots will indeed advance the cause of better care for our most vulnerable children.</p>

If this new model of social work practices can go some way to providing that, we welcome it, although we think that the pilot should run for a sufficient length of time and in a diverse range of local authorities.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08010899000030">Like many Members of the Committee, I received a pamphlet from Chris Waterman, director of the Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies, entitled &#147;Motivation in agency and social work practices: Of halos and horns, paupers and princes&#148;<I>.</I> It was a labour of love, as it was, I understand, written over the Christmas holidays. Like the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, it raises genuine concerns. For those of us who would like to see these social work practices work, it is important that the Government address those concerns.</p>

Social work has been bedevilled by change for change&#146;s sake. Every time one child has died, there has been a review and the suggestion of legislation. If this had happened so often in the health service, it would be even more topsy-turvy than it feels it is at present. But it has happened in social work.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08010899000032">I ask the Minister what the real rationale is for these changes. I can see no reason why the present structure, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has so clearly outlined, cannot be reduced in bureaucracy&#151;in fact, that was in the Climbi&#233; report&#151;why the kinds of structures required to give social workers the support they need cannot be improved and why some of the services cannot be developed with other groupings, as already happens. That was the point of my intervention: some local authorities already use voluntary organisations to work with some families and children in care on a deferred basis. Why can these not be developed properly to get some stability? Not only children in care need stability, but the workers need some in their work.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08010899000033">That could be said to be resisting change for its own sake. I am certainly not resistant to change. If convinced by the Minister that this would really be in the interests of children in care, I will give it all my

My great anxiety, as clearly outlined by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, is that it would be yet one more diversion and hitch, which will mean that good professional development will not happen. Good professional development ends up as good social work services for children.</p>

I very much support the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I am very worried about these pilots, which seem to be set up to succeed in a sense, even though they may not be the right way forward. I would question very seriously whether they are the right way forward. On reading the report by Professor Le Grand and other things, it seems that there are four issues that these social work practices might presume to resolve. The first issue is staff turnover and the second is the rather strange division of responsibilities within social services departments so that children have to move through at least four teams&#151;therefore, four different social workers&#151;even before you start worrying about changes of social workers. The system creates four social workers, then there are the changes on top of that. The third issue is the excessive caseloads, form filling, bureaucracy and all that. The fourth issue is, partly because of that, that managerial decision making has taken over completely from professional decision making.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08010899000035">Will social work practices resolve these four problems? The first two do not need this new, separate stand-alone unit of social workers. Certainly, as regards staff turnover, good social work managements already have massively improved staff recruitment and retention. It can be done: we just need good regulatory authorities to make sure that it is done. We do not need social work practices for that. On the divisions of responsibilities, again, good regulatory authorities should come in and say, &#147;Come on, you have to organise yourselves so that children have continuity&#148;. All the evidence tells us that children need continuity. It is so obvious and does not need social work practices.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08010899000036">Julian Le Grand points to the elimination of a third set of problems as the big plus for these social work practices. He argues that the big advantage of these practices would be the absence of the need to report continuously to a managerial hierarchy and the other bureaucratic demands of a large organisation. But on page 24, Le Grand recognises that social work practices would not escape the bureaucratic demands of the system. How then can he claim that social work practices will have little or no hierarchy and that decisions would remain firmly at the social worker level? This is the essence of the loss of rationale for these pilots. It is set out that these pilots will get rid of this bureaucracy, but they will not. Even Julian Le Grand, who I know well as a good friend and who is a very able man, admits that it cannot do that and that it will not do that. Of course, these pilots cannot do that because of the Government regulations and guidance that we are all so familiar with, which have arisen understandably as a result of Victoria Climbi&#233; and earlier tragedies.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08010899000037">The reality is that whether the bureaucracy shifts into the social work practices or remains in the local authorities, it will be there. The difficulty for the

We will take away a lot of this bureaucracy, a lot of these forms and lot of this stuff. We will take away managerial decision making and return the decision making to social workers, so that they can feel professional again, can have job satisfaction again and will really be able to deal with the interests and needs of the child again&#148;, which they used to do rather more effectively. Of course, there may then be something like a 2 per cent greater risk of another tragedy. There will always be a risk, but dare you risk increasing that risk by, say, 2 per cent? That is a very difficult issue for the Government. But, rather than addressing the real issue of whether the balance is right, the Government are throwing, or perhaps grasping, these social work practice pilots as something that will look as though they may resolve the problem. I honestly think that all of us in this room know that it does not feel very likely that they will.</p>

<p><a name="08010899000038">So this is where we are. Dare a Government bite this bullet or is it really just all too difficult? A London borough recently contracted out its elder services. Shortly after that an elderly person was mistreated by a carer in a stand-alone unit. It was very embarrassing and there was a big to-do in the local press. But if a social worker in a social work practice mistreated a child, it would be in all the national press, and yet the local authority may have difficulty dealing with that contracted-out service. However, if we hold on to all the bureaucracy that we have now, it would be able to deal with it. That is the dilemma with which we are stuck.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08010899000039">One of Laming&#146;s main findings was that one of the most significant causes of breakdown and tragedy was the difficulty of communicating across different organisations involved with a child. That was one of his main findings. Is it a good idea to create more separate organisations and therefore increase the likelihood of communication problems, which Laming says is the one big thing we have to avoid? Will the Minister consider commissioning a piece of work to examine the impact on the services and the costs of government regulations and guidance affecting social work with looked-after children? Would he be willing to commission a piece of work to look at what we are doing with all this bureaucracy, regulations and guidance? What is it doing to the services on the ground? If we really understood that, it would be very helpful. I put that to the Minister.</p>

I therefore invite the Minister to reflect on issues such as the following. First, to what extent is the turnover of social workers responsible for at least some of the breakdowns in foster placements, especially in London and other high-cost areas? When I talk about high-cost areas, I particularly mean areas which have high housing costs. Secondly, will the current turnover of social workers be improved by contracting out? Is there any evidence to show that it really will be? Thirdly, to what extent will the proposed pilots be representative of conditions across the whole of the country and, indeed, across Wales, so that sound conclusions are capable of being drawn from the experience of the pilots? Then, thinking about things from the point of view of voluntary organisations providing children&#146;s services, will the proposed contracts be sufficiently long term so that voluntary organisations can plan their personnel, resources and finances?

I will quote one example to illustrate my concern about the involvement of the privatisation of some of this work. Noble Lords may have heard of a local authority secure home called Orchard Lodge, which is near Crystal Palace, and which focused on the problems of young people with serious mental health disturbances. It was run exceptionally well for many years by Southwark Council. One of the things about it was the fact that the staff had an average length of stay of 11 years, and it told in the fact that not only were the children able to establish long-term relationships with people, but over time the staff developed a confidence in the use of techniques which meant that they did not have to resort to some of the restraint and seclusion that has been the subject of other debates in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080108100000006">Sadly, the Orchard Lodge contract was let to privatisation, and the immediate result was the exodus of good staff and the reduction of people who were prepared to stay for a time. The terrible thing that one finds most in private sector prisons and young offender establishments is staff turnover. They just do not stay. Therefore, I echo the point, when we are considering what is done, that the relationship that is established between staff and children is so crucial to any development that we should not do anything to undermine that.</p>

To my mind, trying to understand the history of social work and the history of social care, one asks why all these reams of bureaucracy have

One might say that it is because there have been tragedies to do with children, but why have there been such tragedies? Partly, it is because of the way in which the media responds, but it is also because of the gradual de-professionalisation of social workers. Who would want to be a social worker today? More people are wishing to be social workers because of some of the steps that the Government are taking, but it really has become an unattractive job. I welcome the fact that pay has been increased in recent years by the Government, but historically the pay that has been given to this job, where individuals are responsible for vulnerable and difficult families, has not reflected in any way the degree of responsibility that is entailed.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080108100000008">I put it to my noble friend that this bureaucracy has arisen in part because of failures, which have been in turn the result of the failure to support and give a proper professional framework to social workers. It has happened in education that the more we develop that framework, the better our schools have become, the less we have needed to inspect them and the more we have moved toward them assessing their own performance. There is a way forward, and it fits with what my noble friend Lady Howarth said. If we concentrate on the professional expertise of front-line social workers, that will do so much to improve the circumstances that we are currently in and the outcome for children.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080108100000009">That point is very much reflected in residential care in children&#146;s homes. There, we have had terrible disasters with children, which have made the profession very unattractive. On the continent, in Denmark and Germany, 50 per cent of looked-after children are in residential care. In Denmark, 90 per cent of the staff in children&#146;s homes have a degree-level qualification. Comparative research highlights the fact that staff there are so much freer to interact with the children. They can hug, they can kiss, they can go into the child&#146;s bedroom at night; whereas we are bound by regulation after regulation because we put people with those children who were never equipped to work with those vulnerable children. Disasters have happened, and we have put down layers of administrative red tape. I hope that is a helpful observation.</p>

That has never been adequately recognised over the years; the noble Earl has already addressed the pay issue. One could turn it around the other way, however, and say that social workers in general have done a rather good job if there is one tragedy with social workers involved every three or four years and one relates that to the numbers of children with whom social workers are involved year by year. These families are chaotic, if I may put it that way. They are difficult. They do not answer the door and so on; it is sometimes difficult to make contact. These are not easy situations to work with, but we live in a blame culture. </p>

You would never dream that from the press. I am sorry to raise something outside the debate, but it is related because the blame culture of the tabloid press is the problem. I am afraid that we are all affected by it. I feel for any Government dealing with legislation in the difficult areas of social services and mental health. One tragedy: headlines, pressure, reports, bureaucracy; that is what happens and what has happened in this field. All I am asking is whether we, as a legislature, can perhaps encourage our Government to sit back and say, &#147;Let&#146;s ensure that we are getting the balance right&#148;.

I hope that I am able to provide the reassurance that the noble Earl seeks. I do so in no small part by addressing the crux of the debate: when the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to the proposal for social work practices. I stress that there is no government proposal for social work practices: there are proposals for pilots of social work practices. To get this debate in perspective, I stress that we are talking about six to nine pilots&#151;a small number&#151;within a large social work profession and local authority system. The issue to be addressed by the Committee, to which the Government have applied their mind, is whether, given the scale of the challenges we face in social work&#151;so well set out by the noble Earl and other Members of the Committee&#151;it is sensible for a Government who are seriously undertaking their responsibilities to see that we provide the best possible standards of care, to pilot&#151;and I stress pilot&#151;one possible approach which, alongside others, may have a beneficial role to play as part of the wider system.</p>

Then, of course, it would be for local authorities to decide whether, on the basis of that evaluation and advice which the Government may give at that stage, it would be sensible to take the idea further. If it were to be taken further, local authorities would commission and pay for social work practices&#151;not us. Local authorities would proceed after the pilot only if they were persuaded that it was an advantageous course to follow to provide for some part of their social work obligations. I stress all of that because, on that basis, the onus is

To take legislative powers to pilot anything is of course a big step for a Government to take. Why have we taken that step? Precisely because of the definition of the problem set out on page 5 of the report of the group chaired by Professor Le Grand, which sets out in stark terms the nature of the challenge that we face&#151;I know that this has been strongly supported by Members of the Committee. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080108100000074">&#147;A key problem for looked after children is the lack of continuity in their relationship with the local authority social worker. Whilst some children have a strong relationship the majority have little or none. They have had too many social workers and have seen too little of those they have had&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080108100000071">That is within the existing local authority system, a system that is funded by the Government to the tune of &#163;5 billion a year, so the resources are there for local authorities that want to pilot new arrangements. There is very little that the Government are doing to stop local authorities taking forward innovative approaches if they want to do so. The question on social work practices is whether we give them powers to take still more innovative pilots forward.</p>

<p><a name="080108100000019">I think that Members of the Committee accept the definition of the challenge facing us. I accept in turn that the overwhelmingly important response that we should make is within the existing local authority system, because we are talking about 69 pilots. That will be a very small part of overall provision. That is the whole emphasis of the <I>Care Matters</I> paper, in which we set out our priorities for the social care workforce, addressing many of the concerns that the noble Earl raised in his remarks on Second Reading. In the Children's Plan, we set out specific proposals for piloting a newly qualified social work status, developing a professional framework for social workers, including a much stronger professional development provision, a wider ranging recruitment campaign and a fast-track programme to attract mature graduates into social work.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="080108100000020">I will certainly seriously consider the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, in respect of the bureaucratic burdens on local authorities. I will study her remarks carefully to see whether we should make some response to the concerns that she raised. Shortly in the New Year, we will be publishing our workforce action plan, which will say more about our proposals for improving training and accelerating the pace of remodelling. So we will have a great deal more to say and are taking forward reforms that meet the issues at large. I direct the Committee to the question of whether, on the basis of the work that has been done by Professor Le Grand and his group, it is a sensible course to pilot social work practices. Our judgment is that it is, for the reasons set out.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080108100000021">I should stress that Professor Le Grand&#146;s group includes many eminent leaders within the social work profession. It included Lynne Berry, the former chief executive of the General Social Care Council, Paul Fallon, the former head of children's services and the director of social services in Barnet, Moira Gibb, the chief executive of Camden Council, and Alistair Pettigrew, the director of children&#146;s services in Lewisham. Alistair Pettigrew is also part of the Social Work Practices Expert Group, which is taking forward the work on the design of the pilots, which also includes Jane Haywood of the Local Government Association and Alan Wood, the director of children's services in the London Borough of Hackney, who is on the group as a representative of the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080108100000022">So these are not ideas that are being foisted from outside on the profession and on local government, they are being developed in very close collaboration with the leaders of local authorities and the directors of children&#146;s services and rely on advice given by eminent figures in both the local authority and the social work world.</p>

Clause 4 ends the piloting period and therefore makes the social work practices introduced by Clause 1 permanent. In fact, it pre-empts the outcome of the pilots by providing for powers to institute regulation and registration of providers. It would ensure that, if the pilots were rolled out across the country, regulations would be in place for them. In a way, Clause 4

<p><a name="080108100000027">The potential gains from social work practices&#151;I stress potential gains, because the whole purpose of piloting is to see whether those gains can be realised&#151;are set out at length in Chapter 5 of <I>Consistent Care Matters</I>. They are gains which, if they could be secured, would be valuable in the support offered to looked-after children. The potential gains relate to enhancement of continuity, of professionalisation and of relationships between children. They have been recognised by a number of experts as gains which, if they could indeed be secured by social work practices, would be valuable, which is why the Children&#146;s Commissioner, Professor Al Ainsley Green, has said that he supports careful piloting and evaluation of a social care practice model, and why other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also welcomed our approach to piloting of social work practices.</p>

I thought that Members of the Committee might find it useful to read the whole report for themselves and, on the basis of what is said in the report, to consider carefully the arguments made. As I said, the argument is made for potential gains addressing a real and fundamental problem that we face in providing properly for children in care. The question that we then face is: on the basis of that report on those potential gains, which are suggested by an eminent group including directors of social services and other experts, is it sensible for Parliament to enable the policy to be piloted? On the basis of the report, we believe that it is.</p>

<p><a name="080108100000030">Many of the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, are addressed in that report, but I shall deal with one or two of the specific points that were raised. As regards how an inspection would be

<a name="80108-gc0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080108100000031">I did not fully follow the noble Baroness&#146;s remarks about pump-primed funding and whether this would create a playing field that was not level. That point was raised also by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. The reason I do not follow it is that the scale of the support provided in terms of activities is so vastly different in the two cases. We are talking about funding for social work pilots over the spending review period 2008-11 at an average of &#163;2 million per annum, some of which will be used to enable local authorities themselves to meet the costs of commissioning and managing contracts. So we are talking about very small levels of central support which are being provided to enable these pilots to happen. As I say, this stands against the &#163;5 billion provided to local authorities in respect of children&#146;s social care, so we do not believe that there is an issue of a playing field that is not level. A local authority that wished to use its resources to provide similar support to that provided in social work practices for its own social workers in the way that it recruits them, manages or trains them, would be entirely at liberty to do so. Local authorities have very large budgets with which to do that.</p>

The issue is whether it is sensible for us to provide this very small sum, in comparative terms, to enable these pilots to take place. I contrast the minnow of social work practices with the whale of the social work supported by local authorities and suggest that there is no unlevel playing field in respect of social work practices.</p>

The Minister gave the relevant figure. As a former director of social services, I know that local authorities get their allocation but the money is not necessarily spent on the service that central government wish because the latter is not in favour of ring fencing but of local authorities establishing their own definitions.

That is what gives rise to much of the concern. Although we hear what the Minister says and have huge trust in him, and value the reassurance that he has given, he may not be in office tomorrow, and in three years&#146; time there may be a different view unless some of these things are clarified in discussion and later in guidance.

That is the nature of local democracy. These decisions should be taken at local level. I meet this debate all the time in schools. If part of the justification for having local authorities is to enhance local decision-making and the capacity of localities to do things differently if they wish, it is very difficult for a Minister to say that we think that there is only one way to do things and to seek to determine precisely how much money should be spent on it. There are two sides to this. I accept that local authorities are free to spend some of these resources in different ways, but that is in the nature of local democracy, which we hope will have other beneficial effects, including a greater emphasis than we would otherwise have on local experimentation and innovation to address the sort of issues that the Committee is grappling with this afternoon.</p>

The Minister said that the money is a very small amount in relation to total budgets for children. Is he talking about &#163;2 million for each social work practice pilot of six to 10 social workers? If so, that is quite a lot of money. My trust has had pilots on something else and we had &#163;1.5 million from the Government. That was big money in terms of what we were trying to do, but rather similar. It is important to understand what this &#163;2 million is. Secondly, if &#163;2 million for a social work practice is the idea, will the local authority have the freedom to devote that money to another kind of pilot within their own area to develop administrative changes as I was suggesting earlier?</p>

<p><a name="080108100000040">If a local authority wishes to pilot other approaches, within the law, to developing social work and recruiting social workers, it is entirely at liberty to do so. Nothing that my department or the Government are doing, within the law, will prevent it being able to do so. It is entirely at the discretion of the local authority whether it chooses to engage in such pilots. It is therefore reasonable that the funding specifically intended for social work pilots should be spent on social work pilots.</p>

The concept of pilots is mentioned only once in the White Paper&#151;a minor reference in chapter 7 proposing that perhaps there might be legislation to establish a variety of two-year pilots. It is slightly surprising that these pilots come up in Clauses 1 to 6 and are given Part 1 of the Bill. The most important part of a Bill is usually bang at the front. If the money involved is only &#163;6 million, as the Minister rightly says, of the &#163;300 million that is being spent, one wonders why it is given such prominence in the Bill.</p>

Perhaps I should apologise to the Committee for the fact that we did not put it at the back. If we had put it in the last six clauses rather than the first six, perhaps it would attract the level of attention that it deserves. This is important, because Parliament is giving new powers in respect of social work practices, but I stress again, coming back to the point made by the noble Earl, that in respect of the vast majority of children in care and those approaching the care system, it is the work of local authorities apart from the pilots that is going to matter. It will be the enhanced status of the social work profession that will matter. All those other measures set out in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper will apply.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080108100000043">However, the Committee needs to be reassured that we are not asking Parliament to take powers in respect even of pilots where we do not believe that there is a proper case for piloting. As I have said, the 75-page report by the committee chaired by Professor Le Grand, which includes eminent leaders of local authorities and of the social work profession, more than meets the threshold to persuade us that this is a correct course to undertake on piloting.</p>

First, she asked whether functions currently carried out by social workers in local authorities would still be carried out by social workers in social work practices. That would be the case. We intend the situation to be broadly comparable. Local authorities&#146; social work functions can be carried out at the moment by or under the supervision of registered social workers. The same regime will apply in respect of social work practices.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080108100000046">The noble Baroness also asked a specific question about social work practices providing an out-of-hours service for children in care. There is no question of children supported by social work practices not having access to out-of-hours support, whether from the social work practice or from the local authority. However, we see no reason why social work practices would not devise creative ways of providing out-of hours services to the children they support in a way that delivers consistency and stability. For example, social work practices could arrange for their social workers to take turns to be on call or pay their staff a premium for working out of hours.</p>

<p><a name="080108100000047">On that basis I hope that the Committee will think it sensible to allow the pilots to proceed.

From 1997 they were determined to improve the lives of these children. They recognise that they have been poorly treated by society, but the inputs that they have made have not given the outputs that they wanted. The previous Prime Minister recognised that we have not done enough for these children. We as a society have underestimated the job that social workers have taken on. We have underestimated the demands of doing this job. I remember what Paul Fallon, a member of the eminent group that Professor Le Grand pulled together, said about his success in reducing the vacancy rate for social workers in Barnet from 30 per cent to 3 per cent in three years. Every day,

What am I doing today to make the lives of my social workers better?&#148; I spoke to the publisher of <I>Compass</I> magazine, a recruitment magazine for social workers. He commented on Paul Fallon&#146;s approach to recruiting new social workers. He said, &#147;This man is quite amazing. He will find new recruits and say, &#145;Come around, let me give you dinner and I&#146;ll talk to you about social work&#146;&#148;.

This project of extending the diverse market to all areas of public services has been very much at the heart of the Labour Government over the past 10 years. My concern is that this minnow will turn into a very large fish, and it will be difficult to stop that motion forward because of the political investment in it and because it fits so well with the Government&#146;s philosophy.</p>

The question behind the amendment is essentially probing. Have the Government considered these issues and the implications that they may have on the costs involved, even in relation to the pilot exercises, let alone in the long run, should the pilots suggest that the model be extended?

In addition, when we are drawing up statutory guidance for local authorities about making arrangements for social work practices, we will include guidance about staff transfers and about compliance with TUPE to ensure minimal disruption for staff, as well as children and families.

<p><a name="080108100000066">As the Committee will know, direct enforcement of rights contained in the Human Rights Act can be achieved in the UK courts only against a public authority. Section 6(3)(b) provides that a private body may be a public authority for this purpose where it is carrying out a function of a public nature, but not where it is carrying out a function of a private nature. Those are known as functional public authorities. A series of court judgments have given a narrow interpretation of,</p>
<ul><a name="080108100000081">&#147;functions of a public nature&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080108100000073">with the result that individuals receiving services from private and voluntary sector providers under arrangements with local authorities have, on occasion, been unable to rely on their convention rights.</p>

<p><a name="080108100000067">The Government recognise that that has led to individuals receiving contracted-out services being unable to rely on their convention rights and have expressed their commitment to seeking clarification of the meaning of &#147;public authority&#148;. Rather than seeking to address that discrepancy through an amendment to the Human Rights Act&#151;there are legitimate concerns about taking such a course&#151;or ad hoc legislative provision for individual areas of service provision, the Government have, up to this point, relied on interventions in court proceedings, seeking to persuade the courts to adopt a broader interpretation of &#147;public function&#148; in line with the original intention behind the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080108100000068">Unfortunately, those efforts have so far been unsuccessful. The House of Lords, concluded in the recent case of YL v Birmingham City Council that the provision of care and accommodation by a privately run care home to an elderly woman, although arranged and paid for by Birmingham City Council under its statutory powers and duties under Sections 21 and 26 of the National Assistance Act 1948, did not constitute a function of a public nature. The Lords commented that if the Government thought it desirable that residents in privately owned care homes should be given convention rights against proprietors, they should amend legislation to make that clear. That is why, by laying this amendment, we seek to amend legislation in this case. If the Government's policy intention is that children receiving services under arrangements under Clause 1 should be able to enforce their convention rights against both the relevant local authority and the social work service provider, I hope that the Minister will accept our amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080108100000069">We understand that, through Clause 3(1), the Government seek to provide that the relevant local authority will be liable for acts of omission by providers of social work services exercising functions under Clause 1. In Clause 3(2)(b), the Government seek to exclude liability for local authorities where providers of social work services are exercising functions of a private nature. This apparently is intended to ensure that the local authority will not be liable for incidental matters, such as treatment of employees by providers of social services. But the Government&#146;s policy intention will be achieved only if their view that a provider of social work services, in discharging the functions of the local authority, will be exercising functions of a pubic nature and can be relied on with certainty on the basis that social work service provision for children, under Clause 1, is distinguishable from the position of the YL v Birmingham City Council case, to which I referred earlier. I believe that this is an area of legal uncertainty. This amendment would achieve significantly better certainty and better protection of children&#146;s convention rights where social work services are contracted out by local authorities.</p>

The view of the Government is clear. Social work practices will be functional public authorities for the purposes of Section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, concern about the status of social work practices under the Human Rights Act arises from the litigation in the case of YL v Birmingham City Council concerning a private care home and the recent judgment of your Lordships&#146; House on the question of whether such an organisation is a public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act. However, the Government consider that arrangements with social work practices are fundamentally different from the arrangements in question in the YL case. In the YL case<I>, </I>it was concluded that a private care home was not exercising functions of a public nature. But in reaching that conclusion, their Lordships laid great emphasis on the fact that the private care home was not exercising any delegated statutory functions. The authority&#146;s statutory duty was to make arrangements for the provision of care and accommodation and that duty had not been contracted-out or delegated to the care home.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080108109000003">By contrast, the functions that will be the subject of arrangements under Clause 1 will be functions of the local authority itself.

For these reasons, the Government are clear that social work practices will discharge

We all have to take seriously the difference underlined in that analysis from the YL case. But there is a lot of uncertainty and where human rights are concerned there should not be uncertainty. It should not be necessary for people to have to resort to all sorts of special initiatives to find out exactly what their rights are, how they apply and why the Government&#146;s interpretation prevails. I hope that my noble friend will therefore understand that among the agencies working in the front line with children there is a strong desire to seize this opportunity to make the situation more explicitly clear in law. I hope that my noble friend will consider doing this.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000005">I should perhaps say to the Committee that when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights it was extremely exercised by that situation. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that it goes to great lengths not to find itself in contention with the Law Lords but it was deeply disappointed by their decision on this issue because it did not find it helpful in fulfilling the spirit of the Human Rights Act. Be that as it may, we have a situation here which needs to be clarified. One of the points that I would have made on this in our internal discussions in the Joint Committee is that surely there should at least be some provision in the Bill that makes it clear beyond doubt that when a local authority is making a contract with an organisation to provide services it should be stated firmly and beyond question that part of that contract concerns the fulfilment of obligations under the Human Rights Act. As I understand it, I do not believe that is universally applicable and I think that it should be made applicable. Can my noble friend reassure us on that point?</p>

So perhaps it could be made absolutely clear that either the social services department remains the public body or the provider becomes the public body. It does not matter which so long as it is clear that the child is protected in the event of a human rights failure. Otherwise, you risk the provisions of the Children and Young Persons Bill not being compatible with the convention rights.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000013">On Amendment No. 4, providers of social work services will exercise functions of a public nature and will therefore be functional public authorities, as I have just set out, under Section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act. Section 6(5) of that Act provides that, in relation to a particular act, a person is not a public authority by virtue of Section 6(3)(b) if the nature of the act is private. We have realised that the words &#147;of a private nature&#148; in Clause 3(2)(b) might be taken as referring to the provider of social work services rather than to the act in question.

<p><a name="080108109000014">On Amendment No. 8, in Clause 5 we intend the power of a local authority to enter into arrangements with a provider of social work services to be a social services function for the purposes of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. This means that the Secretary of State would be able to issue guidance and direction to local authorities under that Act about the exercise of that power. Clause 5 covers making arrangements for the discharge of social services functions in relation to certain children and young people, whereas Clause 1 permits arrangements to be made only in relation to &#147;relevant care functions&#148;, which means those relating to looked-after children and care leavers. It is more appropriate for Clause 5 to reflect the definition in Clause 1.</p>

All these sections are set out in Clause 11 and relate to independent reviewing officers. New Sections 25A and 25B deal with matters that are entirely devolved and will be commenced by Welsh Ministers without reference to Westminster, in line with the devolution settlement. This amendment combined with Amendment No. 104 will provide for different commencement arrangements for the provisions in Section 25C, since the power to extend functions regarding the officers of CAFCASS in relation to Wales is not devolved and is exercisable only by the Lord Chancellor.</p>

The establishment of the children&#146;s services authority and the appointment in every local authority of a lead member and a director of children&#146;s services was the Government&#146;s direct response to the failures of co-ordination highlighted in the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, following the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080108109000022">The whole structure of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda, which underpins not only the Children Act 2004, but much of the education legislation that we have subsequently considered in this House, is predicated on co-operation between the different arms of government, and above all local government, dealing with children. It underlies the logic of the present Prime Minister&#146;s decision to create a Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080108109000023">It therefore seems slightly odd for the Government to be coming forward at this juncture with these proposals for social work practices. It is almost as if they have switched into reverse gear by mistake. We are worried by the fact that the new providers of social work proposed by the Bill would fragment social service provision and run counter to the drive for multi-disciplinary teams from health, social services and other agencies to work flexibly across organisational and professional boundaries.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="080108109000024">In addition, the proposal fragments the child&#146;s journey through the care system and works against continuity, meaning in effect that a local authority social worker would hand over a child to new staff within a private practice at the conclusion of care proceedings.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080108109000025">The amendment is intended to ensure that the new providers abide by the provisions under Section 10 of the Children Act 2004, which sets out the statutory framework for local co-operation between local authorities, key partner agencies and other relevant bodies, including the voluntary and community sector, to improve the well-being of children in the area. We see this as an essential element of any future structures that incorporate social work practices. They will have to conform to the partnership model that is all too slowly beginning to develop on children&#146;s services.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para28">
<p><a name="080108109000029">This is an ideal opportunity to give substance to the spirit of the recently published national Children&#146;s Plan. I do not want to carp about whether we should be going through with the Bill. The amendment is important not simply for the work and the people covered by this Bill. It also brings home that others have responsibility for children. Success in all that we are seeking to do for children cannot be achieved simply by social workers. They can be effective only if other people recognise that co-operation is a two-way business. Therefore, if we have this provision in the Bill, even in the crude conversations that sometimes take place in the course of front-line work, it is possible for social workers to say, &#147;Look, we are expected to co-operate with you, now you must co-operate with us&#148;. That would be a very important weapon to have to hand. I hope that my noble friend will be willing to consider the spirit of what is being said.</p>

I am one of the people who were unable to attend Second Reading, and I was enormously grateful to the Minister for his letter of 3 December, which he copied to me, in which he commented on various things that were said. However, I was interested to note, on reading the Second Reading debate&#151;he will not be surprised that I am interested in the children who end up in custody&#151;that 10 of the 16 speakers mentioned the problem of children in custody, but, unfortunately, the Minister did not. It was not mentioned in the opening or the winding-up speech.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para29">
<p><a name="080108109000031">I was therefore, frankly, disturbed by the second paragraph of his letter of 3 December, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080108109000158">&#147;However, we believe that children should only be brought into care where it is necessary to protect them from harm. It is important to ensure that young people in custody are safeguarded and protected from harm, but we do not accept that this requires them to be looked after and the state to assume a formal parenting role for them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080108109000151">I wonder whether, on reflection, the Minister believes that that is actually the Government&#146;s position. I hope that it is not, because if ever there was a group of people who need to be looked after and to have formal parenting roles assumed for them by the state, it is those in care who go into custody who, without that provision, will have none of it. I was therefore extremely concerned.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0006.htm_para30">
<p><a name="080108109000032">This debate is not the time or place to cover the issues of custody, which we will come to in later amendments that I have tabled, but I cannot help being concerned that here, at an early stage, we are talking about co-operation and insisting that it must be there, because only if there is that co-operation will those wretched people in custody receive the care that the state must give them.</p>

I simply wanted to point out that if we include the amendment, we should have a whole list of other people in the Bill with whom there should be co-operation. I do not think that we should single out one group. However, they need to be included in the <I>Working Together</I> document and arrangements, with which I am not absolutely up to-date these days, but which I believe talk about working together with the voluntary and private sectors. No doubt private practices could be properly included. I think that it has enshrined all of those groups since 2006 and before and, I hope, will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000034">I should like to ask the Minister a question that arose about TUPE, although I did not think that I was going to speak about it because I did not think that I had anything to say. The Minister&#146;s answer caused me some concern, which relates to <I>Working Together</I>. In his reply, he mentioned that groups of social workers might well be transferred to private practices, or the new pilots. I had never conceptualised it like that; perhaps I need to read the document again. I had assumed that private or voluntary organisations would set up those practices and that people would apply for posts in them, so that their conditions of service would be set by whichever organisation. TUPE would not necessarily occur unless they were seconded from the local authority, which is not beyond the bounds of innovation and has happened in other voluntary and private organisations. I am sorry to go back to that, but it caused me some concern, because it has implications for how the whole programme works.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 places the duty on agencies to make arrangements merely to promote co-operation between them. If this amendment is in keeping with the idea that co-operation between agencies and bodies involved in the promotion of child welfare can produce better results, we would certainly support the amendment. However, the wording seems too prescriptive and to go beyond the idea of making arrangements to promote co-operation and enshrine in law an obligation, although I may just be misinterpreting it. I wonder whether the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, could clarify that.</p>

On the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, of course, not just one agency is involved in Section 10, as she knows perfectly well. A whole group is involved, so it is not a case of just picking out co-operation with one particular group. As the noble Baroness knows, it has been a long process of trying to mould co-operation and gain co-operation from all these agencies. It would be very sad to see this thrown away.</p>

I shall deal with those issues fully at the appropriate stage in Committee. In respect of the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, on TUPE, whether or not social workers with existing contracts transfer will depend entirely on decisions by the local authority. They may transfer if that is a decision that a local authority takes, but a local authority could wish to see a social work practice be developed without staff transferring.

We agreed that providers of social work services will need to be part of a multi-agency framework, but we do not believe that it is appropriate to elevate the provider to the status of a relevant partner for the purposes of Section10 of the Children Act 2004.

Working closely with other agencies is not the only way that social work practices can ensure that the whole range of children&#146;s needs are being met.

<p><a name="080108109000052">The Government&#146;s social care White Paper, <I>Options for Excellence</I>, and the Scottish Executive&#146;s 21st century review of social work highlighted the need for social workers to work through the relationships they build with their clients if they are to be the key to successful social work. Fundamental to making and keeping those relationships with such troubled and troubling clients is a capacity on the social worker&#146;s part for reflection. There is nothing more important to good quality social work than the good supervision that ensures social workers keep to task and have space to reflect on what they are doing. Nothing is more important, perhaps, except having the manageable caseloads that permit time for reflection.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080108109000053">I refer to discussion groups in my amendment. The habit of reflection has seeped from much social supervision over the years, and social work has declined to some extent. Self-work discussion groups are sometimes used in children&#146;s homes, schools and nurseries. A staff member presents a particular client, and his peers and the supervisor can help him reflect on his practice. Perhaps a nursery might have one evening a month with a two-hour late stay, and the key worker of a particular child can say, &#147;Bob has had certain difficulties recently, this is what I have been trying to improve the matter&#148;. Then he can have the input from his peers and they can say, &#147;Well this seems like a good idea&#148;. If one is doing the right thing, one often needs to be told that to do it with confidence. That is an example.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000054">I recently spoke to a legal professional, both of whose parents are social workers; her mother worked in child protection. I asked her if she had ever considered being a social worker. She replied that she had never dreamed of it; she was too mindful of the immense stress her mother was exposed to. If the Minister wishes to continue to encourage more applicants of the highest calibre into social work, and for them to stay there, then I hope that he will give a sympathetic response to the amendment. After all, this would simply be a duty on local authorities to be as transparent as possible to prospective social workers about how much support they will receive.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000055">Briefly, on the newly qualified social workers, the Government are already successfully recruiting more new social workers and we must ensure that their practice is safe. The Government have increased the standard qualification for social work from a two-year diploma to a three-year degree. They have registered social work, thus raising its status as a profession. As I say, numbers are rising. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister what the latest figures for applicant numbers are; perhaps he could write to me on that.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000056"><I>Options for Excellence</I> recommended the creation of a newly qualified social work status, and we have already heard from the Minister that the White Paper <I>Care Matters: Time for Change </I>made application of that to child and family social workers. That entails reduced caseloads and increased supervision in the first year of practice. Money has been announced for this in the Comprehensive Spending Review; that is welcome news.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000057">Can the Minister remind me of the timing of the implementation of these pilots? How soon can we realistically expect this to be applied, first, to child and family social workers across the board, and then to all social workers? It is important that this support for newly qualified social workers is put in place.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080108109000058">The amendment is simply intended to encourage local authorities to bring forward such protections for newly qualified social workers, as some already do, as soon as possible. Not so long ago, I heard an 18 year-old care leaver speak. Many young people from care want to go into either social work or youth work. I think they probably want to improve the lives of others because of their own experiences; of course, this is a field that they know from personal experience. We must ensure that all local authorities give such new social workers appropriate support as a matter of urgency. This is necessary if we are to retain them and their practice is to be safe for children.</p>

As so often happens in Committee, we must consider whether this should be built into the Bill or encouraged in other ways. I emphasise that we are dealing with a serious point. The extent to which we can achieve what is set out in the amendment, by this means or others, is important to the effective operation of the system we are trying to encourage in the Bill. I support the amendment. I do not necessarily ask that it go into the Bill, but I would like to have the sort of assurances which the noble Earl has asked for in introducing it.</p>

As a social worker, I could not have done it better myself. We owe him a great deal. I would be the first to acknowledge the important intent behind the amendment. Again, however, as I said at Second Reading, good practice does not depend on legislation but on implementation. Indeed, to put this into legislation or contracts would be detrimental to change and the ability to move forward. I say this from my recent experience in trying to unpick similar contractual arrangements in another organisation. It is obviously the job of unions to ensure that contractual arrangements are adhered to, which can lead to inflexibility and lack of change&#151;real difficulties can ensue.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para21">
<p><a name="080108109000062">That does not mean that there cannot be other ways to drive this forward. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said earlier, my great wish is to find drivers to ensure that these things happen. Legislation would not make this happen, but would make it more difficult. I hope that the Minister will give us some idea of how the workforce planning and some of the guidance might help local authorities to move some of these issues forward.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080108109000063">While I am speaking I make one other point, about bureaucracy, which has been raised on a number of occasions. The Climbi&#233; inquiry made it clear, because it made an analysis of some of the bureaucracy, that it can be cut significantly. However, there is a difference between bureaucracy and good management, and we should be careful not to confuse the two. Young social workers on the job need help, management and supervision. That is what the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, points out in the amendment. We must not say that they need that and then say that it is bureaucracy. We must be clear about what we are moving forward on.</p>

However, I agree with previous speakers that it may not be appropriate to put it in legislation. It may perhaps be more appropriate in guidance, but I do not agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that it would be inappropriate to put it in a contract. I say that because I draw a parallel between the newly qualified

I recall, when I was a newly qualified teacher, feeling rather like a learner driver, not having quite enough hands and feet to control the car and being extremely grateful that I had only a half timetable. The reduced workload and increased supervision given to me as a newly qualified teacher is also appropriate for newly qualified social workers, particularly in the light of cases like that of Victoria Climbi&#233;. So it must be laid down somewhere, but I agree that the Bill is perhaps not the appropriate place. However, I absolutely agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble Earl.</p>

It underlines some of the previously outlined problems of just how overvalued, overused and unsupported social workers feel. Although I would agree with those who have expressed the view that the Bill is not necessarily the right place for this, it would be good to have some real assurance from the Minister that this will be done and taken into account with regard to the workload. Good management should certainly be rewarded in itself, but it should not be reflected in bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000066"><b><a name="80108-gc0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="080108109000198">Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, knows that this is a matter close to our heart and one that we gave great thought to in our commission on social workers. I have one copy of the report; I do not have a box of them, but I could arrange to get one for our next day in Committee. I am sure that you would all find it fascinating and excellent reading.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080108109000067">I pay tribute to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who is a tremendous spokesman for social workers. I applaud the intention behind the amendment, but I fear that it is unnecessarily prescriptive and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, has said, it could be detrimental. I understand how important it is to have provisions and protections in the employment contracts of social workers. It is a difficult job and is often a labour of love. It still requires a lot of labour, often with a small financial reward. To maintain a strong and well trained social work force, attention must be paid to their conditions of employment, but we have some concerns about this amendment, which seems to place a greater requirement for specifications in a contract for social work services than those that exist in local authorities. Social work services must be allowed at least equal flexibility in employment to local authority social workers and must be able to offer a diversity of care arrangements.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para24">
<p><a name="080108109000068">Secondly, there is a specific problem with having a contractual cap on a social worker&#146;s caseload. If one social worker becomes ill, a colleague might know about the unique situation of a particular child and be able to provide temporary care helpfully and efficiently. If there was a contractual caseload cap, would the care provider be forced to find someone else, perhaps less knowledgeable about the situation, to fill in? Surely mechanisms need to be in place to allow for the flexibility necessary to deal with problems arising. Even if the scenario that I have just sketched is not exhaustively persuasive, central

I cannot answer all his points&#151;those that I cannot answer I shall deal with in correspondence&#151;but I can answer quite a number of them. He asked about the number applying to go into the profession. The latest numbers that we have are for 2005-06, when 5,553 students in England registered with the GSCC for pre and post-qualifying training. That was a welcome 16 per cent rise on the 4,770 in 2004-05. I am seeking to ascertain whether we have the figures for 2006-07 and I shall let him know whether we do.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080108109000070">Those figures reinforce another similarly welcome upward trend. In 2006 there were 20,200 social workers in children&#146;s services, which was a 21 per cent increase in the number of whole-time equivalent social workers since 1995 and an increase of 3 per cent since 2004. So although it is true that vacancy rates are very high&#151;the noble Earl mentioned this big ongoing issue earlier&#151;that needs to be set against the fact that numbers are rising significantly in the profession. The problem is that the workload is increasing and therefore the requirement for social workers has been increasing.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0007.htm_para26">
<p><a name="080108109000071">Part of the success we have had in attracting social workers&#151;again this relates to the point about investment raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and others&#151;is on the back of significant increases in pay for social workers. Average pay for newly qualified social workers in children&#146;s social care increased from &#163;24,565 in 2001 to &#163;29,892 in 2005&#151;a 21.7 per cent increase. The significant resources that I referred to earlier have gone very substantially into recruiting more social workers and paying them better, which I think is what the Committee would wish. The issues that we have in terms of the recruitment challenge need to be set in that context.</p>

While I fully accept that we have a great deal more to do if we are to get the social work profession we need for the future, the trends are largely encouraging.

The point was raised with me by a psychiatrist who has worked for many years with social workers. Part of her concern was that the job description provided to social workers did not include a description of how many hours of supervision they would receive and details of such support. I wonder whether that might be looked at as well. I am sure that in the Minister&#146;s discussion with his officials it will come out how far that might be improved.

The huge support that universities can give to the whole approach to social work and in terms of all sorts of degree qualifications or part qualifications can be considerable. The funding issue is crucial, and I very much agree with the point about the part-time courses, because we all know that the Open University, Birkbeck and others are under a severe disadvantage, and we need to look at this very carefully. We shall need to think of different forms of funding.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000091">I declare an interest, because I have an American granddaughter-in-law who came over here and is a scientist by training but has no right, of course, to practise. She is married to my grandson and she is acting as an administrator in a school for a year while she gets her teaching qualification approved. It will not cost her anything, as no doubt the school is paying for it. From that moment onwards it will be accepted that she will be able to teach science. We should be grateful for that, given how short we are of science teachers. That is just one example of where the local university could do an extremely important job in regard to people who might wish to change careers and come into social work. We are going to need all these forms of encouragement and the raising of standards and status that we have heard are so necessary, so I hope that consideration will be given to this, although it may be being done already.</p>

Perhaps I may cite two things. There are parallels in this with the Probation Service and how much probation has benefited from the contact that it has had with the university courses run for probation officers, which could be developed. I declare an interest as having an honorary doctorate from the Portland Clinic. Over the years, the Portland Clinic has run events for youth offender teams. There is no doubt that the youth offender teams and managers who come together under the leadership of the Portland Clinic have benefited hugely from the experience. That is another aspect which could be explored in development rather than necessarily put in the Bill.</p>

It seems to me that this is another form of vocational training. We are perhaps not looking at apprenticeships at a lower level, but at a higher level. There used to be a &#147;sandwich degree&#148; when people spent a year out in industry or, often, in public services, which have sadly disappeared. Nevertheless, the co-operation required here means that universities need to think again. I suspect that the Minister will say, &#147;Yes, it is not right that this should be in the Bill, but there is nothing stopping local authorities and universities from getting together and co-operating&#148;.</p>

It is rather straightforward to make arguments for this amendment. If we are to have a first-rate social workforce, it is undoubtedly a good thing to provide continued training and support to social workers. Still further, continued training works to increase the profile of social workers and creates demand for better and better qualified care providers. Thus, I have great sympathy with this idea.</p>

They were sent off as trainees to the universities with which we had strong relationships. In exchange, the universities provided extra courses for our social workers and we provided placements for social workers on courses. Some of those relationships continue today, so we should not forget that social work has a strong reputation in working jointly with universities, and long may that continue.</p>

They work on three main areas: building and supporting sustainable partnerships between universities and employers; increasing the supply and quality of practice placements; and on the collation of data on practice placements. The scope of the work that these networks do is currently under review. The CWDC and Skills for Care are preparing for both departments to review this work. However, the core of the work, to support practice placements and relationships between universities and local authorities, will continue to be central to the work.

It does not offer the opportunity for any other models for new arrangements of social workers to receive similar legislative backing. As has already been indicated on these Benches, we have some scepticism as to whether the establishment of private social work practices will address the issues that the Government are concerned about, such as the need to free up social workers from bureaucracy to focus on direct work with children. Instead, we are concerned that they might have a negative impact on partnership working and on the journey of the child through the care system, while at the same time failing to improve the recruitment and retention of social workers.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0008.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080108109000110">Importantly, the option of social work practices is not the only way to ensure that the Government&#146;s aims are met. Other pilots to address some of those aims are underway. For example, the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council is currently seeking bids to trial new arrangements for social workers in 18 local authorities. The new trials are intended to remodel social work teams to improve the recruitment and retention of social workers and other social care staff, to involve more early intervention work and to tackle bureaucracy. It is also worth bearing in mind that the trials are going on alongside other developments in the education and care sectors that are seeking, through counsellors and mentors, to provide children with longer-term, stable support and help from adults outside the home. It may be that these experiments also prove to be an alternative to the social work practice model. The amendments proposed for this part of the Bill aim to ensure that the move from piloting to social work practices and making the model permanent is not seen as the necessary outcome.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0008.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080108109000111">We propose two mechanisms through this group of amendments. First, Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 would shorten the length of time in which local authorities are given the opportunity to pilot the social work practices. This is aimed at ensuring that it is not seen as the only model of delivery for the provision of care for looked-after children and that other potential models are also given adequate opportunity to be trialled by local authorities. It is intended as a probing amendment to gain further understanding of the extent to which the Government are committed to the pilots and whether they are genuine pilots or whether the Government are open to running other schemes simultaneously.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0008.htm_para24">
<p><a name="080108109000112">Amendment No. 12 is more substantive. The aim is to ensure that a rigorous evaluation of the pilots of social work practices takes place before the model becomes permanent. The assurance given on Second Reading, that the results of the pilots would be published and that by implication they would be given no further rollout until after publication and consideration of the results, is reassuring. The Minister a short while back again reassured us that the pilots would not be rolled out until the evaluation was complete.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0008.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080108109000113">That does not detract from the fact that the criteria for judging the success or otherwise of the pilots must be rigorous. They will need to be judged in terms of the required improvements in services offered to children in care, their broader impact on the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of children&#146;s social services and the general delivery of personal social services. That is why in proposed new subsection (8) we are asking that they be judged against the delivery of the <I>Every Child Matters </I>agenda, the local authority&#146;s responsibilities as a corporate parent, the impact on local authority resources and the general stability of the care system, as well as the specific impacts on the children in care services and the recruitment and retention of social workers.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0009.htm_para0">
<p><a name="080108109000114">Finally, proposed new subsection (7) puts in the Bill the Minister&#146;s pledge that the social work practice pilots would not be rolled out more generally until the evaluations have been completed and considered by Parliament. I find myself really rather unclear on what triggers Clause 4. As we discussed earlier, Clause 4 effectively ends the period of piloting and introduces social work practices, as suggested in Clause 1(1). Looking at Clause 6, the piloting period begins on the date when Clause 1(1) comes into force and ends on the earlier of the two: the date when Clause 4 comes into force or the end of the period of five years, beginning with the date on which the Act is passed. I read that to say that, unless Clause 4 is brought into force, there is a five-year pilot and after five years the whole thing falls.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0009.htm_para1">
<p><a name="080108109000115">I am not clear on Clause 6(2):</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080108109000170">&#147;An order bringing section 1 into force may do so by reference to particular local authorities or local authorities of a particular description&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080108109000153">I take it that that means you could roll out the pilots more generally in either a particular local authority or a group of local authorities. Someone has to declare the day on which Clause 4 comes into force. I am not clear from the Bill what triggers that. Can the Minister clarify that? The aim of Amendment No. 7 would be that an order from the Secretary of State bringing Clause 4 into force would not be made until an evaluation of the pilots had been completed. We are clear in our minds that this is what we would like, but I am not clear what would trigger Clause 4. I beg to move.</p>

My problem was that I could not understand whether this was to do with the technical start and end of the process or the length of time for which this might happen; the five years.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0009.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080108109000117">If that is so in operational terms, the anxiety that I have at that point is that a contract&#151;I disagree with the noble Baroness on this&#151;of less than five years to set up these practices would cause considerable difficulties. Anyone who sets up operational services on the ground knows that it is six months from the start date of the contract before you are really going, it is a year before you can begin to really assess how you are doing, and  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC323"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>if the limit is three years you are winding down half-way through before any hope of a service. If you are going to have the practices, you will need them for five years, and hopefully the local authorities will set their contracts for that good time, because as noble Lords know there has been a great deal of criticism of short-termism in local authority contracts. I may be under a complete misunderstanding as to what this section means and whether it is more technical.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000118"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="080108109000217">Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> It may not be necessary for me to intervene here but it seems to me that there is a simple answer to the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Clause 39(1) relates to Wales, and subsection (2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080108109000171">&#147;Otherwise the provisions of Parts 1 to 4, section 37 and the Schedule come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint&#148;.</p>

Clause 6(2) allows for Clause 1 to be brought into force by reference to a particular local authority or local authorities. This will enable the selection of local authorities to pilot the social work practice model. However, unless Clause 4 is brought into force within five years of Royal Assent&#151;the five years begin with Royal Assent&#151;Clauses 1 to 5 will cease to have effect. That means that we must establish the pilots, allow them to run and evaluate them in time to decide before the end of that five-year period whether to roll out the power to make arrangements under Clause 1 more widely. I hope that clarifies the position about the five years.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000121">Why have we gone for five years? For exactly the reason that the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, set out. We believe that it is an appropriate period when you take into account all the preparatory and evaluation stages that will need to be gone through. It may help the Committee if I set out the rough timetable for activity that we foresee. Subject to the successful passage of the Bill, we will run a competition for local authorities to take part in the pilots, with a view to identifying three to six successful candidates in autumn this year. At the same time, we will also be putting the finishing touches to the model contract and funding systems to support effective operation of the pilots.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0009.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080108109000122">Pilot local authorities would then begin commissioning social work practices in autumn this year. Leaving time for a full and proper commissioning process, we anticipate that the successful social work practices should have been chosen by early 2009. In the first quarter of 2009, detailed contract negotiations will need to take place, social work practices will need to get themselves set up in offices, and practical arrangements for transferring cases will need to be put in place.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000123">The aim is to have social work practices up and running, with full caseloads, at Easter 2009, roughly a year after Royal Assent. The intention is that they should then run until Easter 2011. During that two-year period, evaluation evidence will be gathered. In the fourth year, from Easter 2011 to Easter 2012, the evaluation of the pilots will take place. The evaluation will be independent, and we will ensure that the evaluation report is made public and that there is full and proper consultation before the model is made available to all local authorities, if this is indeed a desired option.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000124">Year 5 would then be a period of transition. If a decision is taken to make the social work practice model available more widely, we will need to take time to get the regulation regime right. We will want to design and consult on national minimum standards for social work practices and give the chief inspector time to prepare inspection arrangements. Those local authorities who had operated the pilots would also need to commission social work practices for the post-pilot period, and they will need time to do that.</p>

We tabled the amendments, which came from UNISON, because we generally agreed with them but, on thinking about it, I know all too well how long it takes to set up a proper pilot, so I agree that the five-year period is required if we are going to include the evaluation in it.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0009.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080108109000133">What the Minister did not answer but has now begun to is the point that I made about the need to have control experiments&#151;that there are other ways to do these things. The difficulty faced by local authorities is that it takes time to set up a trial or a pilot. That is recognised, because the Government are putting aside &#163;6 million&#151;a very small sum, but nevertheless enough to help the pilots forward. The point that the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, was making is that if there are to be other pilots, there needs to be a little bit of money in the system to help them forward. It might be appropriate that other experiments should be carried forward to see what might be best practice.</p>

<a name="80108-gc0009.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080108109000134">My second point was on the whole process of the evaluation. Amendment No. 12 was the substantive amendment, rather than Amendments Nos. 9, 10 or 11, and it concerns two matters. First, the evaluation should be reported back before an order is made by the Secretary of State putting Clause 4 into effect. The evaluation should be considered by Parliament rather than just as an order. Secondly, the evaluation should look at a number of specific issues. The Minister did not reply to that point.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000135"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew10"><a name="080108109000227">Lord Adonis:</b> Perhaps I should say a little more about evaluation and controls. On pages 48 and 49 of <I>Consistent Care Matters</I>, the report by the group chaired by Professor Le Grand, evaluation is addressed, as is the control group against which the  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC326"><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column GC326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pilots will be compared. The report says that the group considers that a thorough and robust evaluation of the pilots is essential and that this should involve a comparison of the pilots&#146; performance with those of selected local authorities acting as controls. That is not the Government funding them to be controls, but simply looking at their performance. The report&#146;s recommendation is that the performance of social work practices should be compared against the performance of three controls: first, the pilot authority; secondly, the performance of a best practice local authority; and, thirdly, the performance of an average local authority, to provide a fair assessment of its impact.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000136"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew11"><a name="080108109000228">Baroness Meacher:</b> That is precisely one of my concerns. The plan is to compare these pilots, with the injection of pump-priming funding, with other local authority practices where there is no such funding. That is exactly the point that we have raised.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000137"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew12"><a name="080108109000229">Lord Adonis:</b> I entirely disagree with that point. There is nothing to stop one of the more successful local authorities, or a local authority running a social work practice pilot, providing funding to ensure comparable levels of recruitment, incentive or whatever is the particular area of reform that it wishes to compare between traditional local authority managed services and the social work practice pilots. Pages 48 and 49 of the report set out the basis on which a comparison would be made. The Government believe that that is an entirely fair basis.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000138"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spmin1"><a name="080108109000230">The Earl of Listowel:</b> Perhaps I may press the Minister further. It is not the local authorities who seek to pilot this programme to examine the effectiveness of the new social work practices in improving continuity for children in care. It is the Government who are doing so. I cannot see why local authorities would wish to spend extra money just to prove whether the Government&#146;s initiative works or does not work. Surely the onus should be on the Government, if they want to be scrupulous in terms of testing this approach, to inject a similar amount of money into the control local authorities to test whether the approach is making as much difference as the Government hope&#151;and, indeed, we all hope.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000139"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew13"><a name="080108109000231">Lord Adonis:</b> With great respect to the noble Earl, we will be running a competition for engagement in the pilots, so we are dealing only with willing local authorities. This is not the Government piloting a course of action which local authorities do not want pursued. On the contrary, we will be dealing with local authorities that want to engage in the pilot because they believe that it could be a beneficial way to improve social work provision in their area. If they see social work pilots as one way to improve it, they may see other measures with which they wish to compare it as a good way of proceeding. The Government are not obliging local authorities to engage in the pilots. They will be willing partners who have chosen to engage. If they wish to engage in other

How are the Government going to ensure that the range of local authorities represented within the pilots covers all the bases&#151;all kinds, sizes and natures of local authorities? What if some kinds of local authorities do not apply? What will happen then?</p>

<p><a name="080108109000141"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew15"><a name="080108109000233">Lord Adonis:</b> I am afraid that we are dependent on those who apply. We are talking about a small number of pilots, so I certainly cannot say that they will be representative of the whole generality of local authorities in every respect. But the whole purpose of pilots is that you must make allowance for the conditions within which you are working, and your evaluation must take account of them.</p>

<p><a name="080108109000142"><b><a name="80108-gc0009.htm_spnew16"><a name="080108109000234">Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> In view of the time, we have probably been around this one for long enough. But, actually, the Minister is not quite right. If any local authority is open to set up a pilot in anything and does not need any extra funding for it, it does not need any funding to set up pilots in social work practices. If they want to have, or try out, social work practices, they could have a pilot. There is no need for extra money to encourage them to undertake one. There should be, as we were suggesting earlier, a level playing field on this issue.</p>

<a name="80108-wms0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"><a name="08010869000009">I am pleased to provide further details of events being organised by the Ministry of Defence later this year which will commemorate the contribution made by members of the Armed Forces in operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Northern Ireland over many years.</p>

<a name="80108-wms0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"><a name="08010869000010">On Thursday 22 May 2008 a commemorative service is to be held at the new Armed Forces Memorial located in the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. This service will honour the personnel who lost their lives or were injured and the many thousands who served throughout the 15-year deployment in Bosnia. It will also allow time for reflection on the United Kingdom's contribution to a more stable and secure environment within Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was made possible by the outstanding efforts and dedication of our Armed Forces.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"><a name="08010869000011">The second event that I would like to announce is a service to mark the end of Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. This event will take place on Wednesday 10 September 2008 at St Paul's Cathedral, London, and will honour those personnel who lost their lives or were injured in Northern Ireland and the over 300,000 personnel who served in the province since 1969. The resilience they displayed over such a long period of time under extremely difficult circumstances greatly contributed to the peace that now exists.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"><a name="08010869000016">The rules were also drafted to build on the Government&#146;s commitment, given in 2002, to combine both sets of rules and to reflect current practice as adopted in procedure rules prepared more recently for other types of inquiries, such as those for planning inquiries.</p>

<a name="80108-wms0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"><a name="08010869000019">This Statement is to inform the House of our intention to release the Princess Royal Barracks (PRB), Deepcut, for disposal as part of ongoing work to optimise the defence training estate.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"><a name="08010869000021">In October, Derek Twigg, Under-Secretary of State for Defence, updated the House on the way forward for the defence training review (DTR). The Statement announced that we were continuing to consider a range of options for package 2, which aims to provide training for logistics and personnel administration, police and guarding, security, languages, intelligence and photography. The conclusion of the part of that work related to the wider rationalisation of the estate, taking into account our focus on improving accommodation and training facilities, is that it would be in the best interests for defence to release the site for alternative civilian use and to reprovide the training facilities elsewhere. It has been judged that the site could be suitable for residential development and make a significant contribution to the Government's housing strategy. It is, therefore, our intention to submit the Deepcut site for inclusion in Surrey Heath Borough Council's core strategy.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"><a name="08010869000022">The closure of Deepcut in the future will not lessen our commitment to maintaining the improvements already achieved to improve the care and welfare of trainees, and to continue to address the areas where performance can be improved. We will not forget the four young soldiers&#151;Sean Benton, Cheryl James, Geoff Gray and James Collinson&#151;who died at Deepcut. In seeking to improve the environment in which our people are trained we are continuing to meet the recommendations made by those such as the Adult Learning Inspectorate and Nicholas Blake QC.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"><a name="08010869000034">My objectives for the programme remain to:</p>
enable improved business continuity by replacing ailing legacy case management  and offender assessment applications in public prisons and probation;enable more efficient and effective operational management of offenders; support offender management processes and thereby reduce reoffending and enhance public protection; provide supplier-neutral information to support commissioners; and provide improved management information to enable improved performance 
<p><a name="08010869000037">The recommendations of the review are that:</p>
HM Prison Service is to receive a version of C-NOMIS which will replace the existing case management system (LIDS). Three public sector prisons already use the live system. From recent analysis it is clear that the system will drive significant efficiencies when rolled out across the service; arrangements will be made to allow sharing of information between  prisons and probation areas through a new mechanism &#147;data share&#148; which will give read-only access to core case information to support offender management; improvements will be made to OASys and the system will be redeveloped as a single national system across probation and prisons;Delius, a case-management system already in use by some probation areas, is to be implemented where existing NPS case-management systems are in urgent need of replacement;  C-NOMIS will not therefore be deployed to the National Probation Service;we will consider options to address a range of issues associated with CRAMS (the case management system currently in use in most probation areas), including obsolete software and hardware and compliance with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act; and we will take account of the current strategic reviews of offender management and offender assessment. 
<a name="80108-wms0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"><a name="08010869000035">I have agreed these carefully costed measures on the recommendation of the governance boards of the National Offender Management Service and Ministry of Justice. We will continue to scrutinise the value for money provided by each business case as it develops.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"><a name="08010869000036">This has been a successful review, delivering a reformed programme which is now set to provide real operational improvements for practitioners in managing offenders alongside other reforms across the criminal justice system.</p>
