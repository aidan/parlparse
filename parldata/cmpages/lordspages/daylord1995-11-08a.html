<P>

<a name="51108-01_para5"></a>"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,
<P>

<a name="51108-01_para6"></a>"The Duke of Edinburgh and I were pleased to receive the state visits of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait in May and His Excellency the President of Finland in October. We also remember with great pleasure our state visit to South Africa in March. We are enjoying our visit to New Zealand, where we shall be present at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.

<P>

<a name="51108-01_para9"></a>"My Government continued to make provision for the defence of the United Kingdom and our allies and for the promotion of international peace and stability. They were among the leading participants in United Nations peace-keeping operations. They contributed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and to the development of effective and reliable European defence arrangements which complement those of NATO. They welcomed the success of the Partnership for Peace between the countries of NATO and other countries of Europe; the commitment by NATO and Russia to build a co-operative relationship; and the decision to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<P>

<a name="51108-01_para10"></a>"My Government continued to be at the forefront of attempts to find a lasting solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.

They worked to promote a closer relationship between the European Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, with a view to the enlargement of the Union. They continued to help the former communist states of Europe and Asia to establish democratic market economies: bilaterally, using the Know How Fund, and together with our European Union partners.

<P>

<P>

<a name="51108-01_para15"></a>"At the Summit of the seven leading industrialised nations in Halifax in June, my Government contributed to far-reaching proposals on the reform of the international financial institutions and the United Nations. They worked at home and with our European Union partners to implement the outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
<P>

<a name="51108-01_para16"></a>"In the interests of the people of Hong Kong, my Government worked to achieve a smooth transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997. My Government in Bermuda consulted the people of Bermuda about the future constitutional arrangements for the Territory and its relationship with the United Kingdom. My Government gave assistance to the Cayman Islands to alleviate the problems caused by the arrival of a large number of migrants from Cuba in 1994.

Legislation has been passed to enable certain prisoners to be released on licence at the half-way point of their sentence.

<P>
<A NAME="51108w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether valid evidence has been provided by Germany, whereby Mr. Kani Yilmaz might be extradited for trial; and whether they will request that he be granted bail, pending a decision on his case by the High Court, since he has been held under maximum security conditions for one year in HMP Belmarsh.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51108w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  The documents provided by the German Government in support of its extradition request for Kani Yilmaz, also known as Faisal Dunlayici, comply fully with the requirements laid down in the Extradition Act 1989 and the European Convention on Extradition. As I made clear in my Written Answer of 22 June
(col. WA28), there is no requirement for a prima facie case to be made out where the requesting state is a signatory to the convention. Decisions on bail are a matter for the courts and it would not be proper for the Government to make such an approach.

<P>

<a name="51108w01_para0"></a>As part of this contribution, we envisage a need to make use of a number of members of the Territorial Army and the Regular Army Reserve. On present estimates, the number would not exceed 350 personnel, who would, as far as possible, be sought on a voluntary basis. My department will shortly be setting in hand the necessary arrangements.

Recurrent funding, including that required for items such as those mentioned in the Question, will normally be specified in a pupil's statement of social educational needs.
