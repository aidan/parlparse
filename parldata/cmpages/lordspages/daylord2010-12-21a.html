This menu format takes account of seasonal variations and prisoner preference and is capable of meeting different dietary requirements, such as religious, cultural, medical and lifestyle needs.</p>

Each of the 85,000 people in our prisons cost £38,000 a year, with as many as seven out of 10 offenders who have been in prison ending up in prison once again. Short-term sentences often bring moderate offenders into long-term crimes. Those who start a probation rather than imprisonment limit the increasing rise in the prison population. Should not the Government support Ken Clarke MP in limiting the increasing rise in prison population?</p>

How can the Government justify supporting universities that show no regard for academic standards and offer science degrees in courses which teach that certain essential oils cure specific diseases, areas of the foot lead to pathways to certain inner organs, and health depends on the pattern of energy flows within the body? If the Government believe in evidence-based science, can they really remain indifferent to the fact that some of their funds are used to promote quackery and mumbo-jumbo and call it science?</p>

My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary agreed with other EU Foreign Ministers on 16 December that the EU would adopt restrictive measures against those obstructing the peace process, including Laurent Gbagbo.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="10122142000062"></a><b><a name="101221-0001.htm_spnew55"></a><a name="10122142000664"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, but I fear that the EU's limited sanctions and travel restrictions will not go quite far enough. Not only has Laurent Gbagbo stolen the election from Dr Ouattara, but he has mobilised paramilitary troops, and it has been discovered that nearly 1,000 people are missing. Does the noble Lord agree that the international community now faces a potential Srebrenica moment, whereby the UN may need to withdraw under fire and atrocities will be committed on a large scale? Will he suggest to his right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary that ECOWAS, and potentially UN peacekeeping troops from Liberia, need to be mobilised to intervene in a more substantive manner than mere sanctions?</p>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>

Indeed, the EU is now moving on from the proposed targeted travel ban, which includes Mr Gbagbo, his wives and others associated with him, and is considering much more targeted sanctions and freezing assets. On the EU side, more proposals are being put forward, with the active involvement of British officials and colleagues.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10122142000064"></a>At the UN level, the Security Council has expressed very deep concern. There are further problems about trying to get UN sanctions in place, not least because it is supposed that some countries, certainly among the permanent five members of the Security Council, would oppose them. However, the United Nations has rightly insisted, with our full support, that the UN operation in the Côte d'Ivoire-the so-called UNOCI-stays there, despite the fact that ex-President Gbagbo has insisted that it goes. UNOCI is embedded there; it intends to stay there and does not intend to leave. Further pressures will certainly be considered and may well be necessary.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10122142000065"></a>As for Liberia and Senegal becoming involved in other areas, there are difficulties and it is not quite clear what their remit would be. For the moment, the French troops are still there, although they have been told to leave, and the UN troops are there. That is the position at the moment.</p>

Does not the experience of Sierra Leone show that having an over-the-horizon capability, which can be provided only by countries with fairly sophisticated military forces, is often the best way of deterring the outbreak of fighting?</p>

Preventing the rising and particularly ugly conflict in this country from spreading to other areas and affecting everyone's interests may well need a larger military mobilisation. However, for the moment there is a precarious situation in which the UNOCI has insisted on staying there, the army appears to be under the control of ex-President Gbagbo-or President, as he would style himself-and there is a sharp stand-off between the two. That is the position at the moment and it is very hard to comment beyond that. Certainly, any remit for a larger military force would not be at all clear in the present complex situation.</p>

Does he also agree that if this is to be put right, it is absolutely essential that in the Government's approach to the reform of the UN they give priority to increasing the effectiveness of the military planning staff at the disposal of the Secretary-General?</p>

However, "putting right" is a big phrase in the present situation. The pressures from outside are bound to have some limitation on them, and within this hapless country there are hideous and dangerous rivalries that I am afraid have been there for many years and are nowhere near being resolved at the moment.</p>

They are not simple in this case, as we well know. Does the noble Lord agree that building up the African Union so that it has both presence and political authority is the only long-term solution to dealing with these kinds of unfortunate events in Africa, although they are becoming rarer? Could I also tempt him, in the spirit of Christmas and given that dictatorship is not limited to Africa, to comment on representations made on the arrest of candidates in the recent election in Belarus?</p>

As for this situation, it is complex and dangerous. We are working to reinforce the will of the African Union in general, and the economic organisation of west African states in particular, to take stronger views. ECOWAS has been quite forward and firm in what it said. It has behind it the driving forces of both Nigeria, which is a gigantic country, and Ghana, which is a successful smaller country. These are sources of authority, and pressure from them, encouraged by us, might make some progress and prevent further slaughter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10122142000077"></a>On 12 November, this House agreed by a substantial majority to an amendment to give compensation to ID cardholders whose cards are due to be cancelled. The Commons have now sent it back to us on the grounds of financial privilege. As it is a privilege reason, my understanding is that it would be contrary to convention to send back another amendment, which would clearly invite the same response. The debate this afternoon none the less affords an opportunity to the House to indicate to the Minister the strength of feeling on this matter and, even at this late stage, to ask the Government to reconsider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10122142000078"></a>The introduction of ID cards was subject to intense debate in your Lordships' House. We on this side saw the ID card scheme as a convenient and secure way of asserting one's identity in everyday life.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1000"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1000</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Party. That commitment formed part of the coalition agreement published on 12 May, and the Government introduced this Bill to Parliament on 26 May. We have acted swiftly in achieving our manifesto commitment and believe that the Bill's purpose, which is to remove the intrusive ID card scheme and the national identity register from the statute book, has widespread support in the country.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10122142000090"></a>Noble Lords are today focusing on the detail of the decommissioning process rather than on the significance of a Government destroying a national database. The Bill is a major step in removing the state from unnecessary and undesirable intrusion in the personal life of the individual. We should not forget the significance of the Bill, nor should we minimise the landmark action of a Government legislating to get rid of a national database. However, there are costs associated with dismantling the scheme. In incurring those costs, the public must be confident that taxpayers' money is being spent effectively and efficiently. The ID card scheme and associated work on biometrics and policy development has to date cost the taxpayer £292 million. Further costs of about £5 million will be incurred in dismantling the scheme.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10122142000091"></a>Further spending would be required if we were to provide refunds. I am aware of the strength of sentiment that has been expressed on this point, but this proposal would cost around £400,000. That may not seem much in the grand scheme of spending to date by the previous Administration on ID cards, and it may be that some Members of this House consider it an insignificant sum, but this is not how the coalition Government look at public finance. We are tackling the deficit which we inherited. We are doing that by ensuring that moneys are spent only where necessary and that such spending delivers more for less. Providing a refund on ID cards does not meet any of those criteria.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10122142000092"></a>I am not ignoring the fact that cardholders spent £30 each on a card for which there will be no further use on enactment of this Bill.</p>

We briefly debated that point when we considered the Bill. Does that mean that the person who now holds the card as their own property, as they are not being given any compensation for it, will be able to use it to prove their identity in certain circumstances, such as for young people in pubs, or whatever else it might be?</p>

The card does not have value or efficacy because it is no longer attached to a database which would enable it to be a valid document that could prove your identity. It is simply a piece of paper, because there is nothing behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10122142000096"></a>I am not ignoring the fact that the cardholder spent £30 on a card for which there is no further use. During debates here and in the other place opponents of the Bill indicated that the decision to refuse to issue refunds will affect the poorest or the less well off members of society. However, there is no socioeconomic breakdown of cardholders, so neither noble Lords opposite nor the Identity and Passport Service can indicate the economic status of cardholders. I cannot imagine the circumstances in which a person struggling to make ends meet would think that buying an ID card was a necessity. If the ID card scheme was intended to allow travel to Europe or to provide proof of identity to get into pubs and clubs, then, frankly, it is doubtful that we should consider this form of purchase to satisfy the criterion of core household spending.</p>

I hope that no Minister worthy of the name would need protection of that kind. I would be grateful if the Minister will just answer a simple question. Do the Government realise that there is a fundamental moral issue here? It is not a matter of complex socioeconomic categories-it is a very simple moral issue, is it not? Citizens have bought in good faith from the Government a good or a service and a new Government are now proposing not to deliver. Is that not the action of a dishonest trader?

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="10122142000280"></a>"A member of the House who is speaking may be interrupted with a brief question for clarification.

I have listened very carefully to the Minister but, although she says that she has listened, she appears surprisingly unsympathetic to the thousands of people affected.

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10122142000106"></a>On Report, the argument had advanced. The noble Baroness said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10122142000281"></a>"We do not believe that the statutory basis of the issue of ID cards creates a contract or anything akin to a contract in relations between the Secretary of State and the cardholder. Remedies that would be available in the courts if the contract were governed by the law of contract or consumer legislation ... is not available for identity cards".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/11/10; col. 792.]</p>

<p><a name="10122142000262"></a>Today, we hear this argument about the socioeconomic background of holders of the card. What on earth has that got to do with it? This is a matter of principle.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10122142000107"></a>Let us just think about the wider principle, not just in relation to ID cards and the sum of £30. For example, an incoming Government say that because they disagreed with the original policy of a previous Government, it is just tough luck on members of the public who decided to act on the provision that became available as a result of the actions of the previous Government. Does the Minister not see that, in refusing to refund the £30, she is developing a new principle that will essentially reduce trust in Governments generally?</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10122142000108"></a>What policies might this apply to in the future? If we were to accept the logic of the noble Baroness's argument, it would be open to an opposition party to say, "We don't agree to a policy being brought in by the current Government". If, subsequently, that opposition party came into Government, they could simply rescind the policy and refuse to pay any compensation if that policy had involved an outlay of money by members

That is simply not the right way to treat people in this country. For instance, that was not the way in which the previous Government dealt with the assisted places scheme. We abolished that scheme but we allowed children in receipt of an assisted place to complete the remainder of that phase of their education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10122142000109"></a>It is no wonder that on Report the noble Baroness's noble friend Lord Vinson described the Government's position as "morally indefensible". What is her response to my noble friend Lord Richard who pointed out that,</p>

<p><a name="10122142000263"></a>What does she say to the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, who thought that the Government were guilty of mis-selling? As he said,</p>

<p><a name="10122142000264"></a>Has she taken on board the comments made by her noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury? On Report, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10122142000283"></a>"Governments must set an example of the standards they expect of private industry. Had private industry engaged in a tactic of this sort, noble Lords on all the Benches would have been up in arms, and rightly so".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/11/10; col. 785.]</p>

<p><a name="10122142000265"></a>On Report, the noble Baroness said that she would look at the matter again. The defeat of the Government after her comments required no less. I would ask her what form her further consideration took. Will she say why the Government are not taking on board the views of this House? She cannot simply hide behind financial privilege.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10122142000110"></a>She also said on Report that she would seek advice on whether the Government risked legal challenge from the holders of ID cards since the Government are essentially confiscating cards without compensation. She was asked by the noble and learned Lord Morris of Aberavon to confirm that the advice she received came from the law officers. Will she inform the House whether the law officers gave such advice?</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10122142000111"></a>Finally, I appeal to the noble Baroness to consider the matter again. The Government are setting an extraordinary and dangerous precedent by not paying compensation. Such a precedent goes much wider than ID cards and would be very unfortunate as regards trust in government. She should think again.</p>

Historically, I believe, privilege has not been claimed in relation to matters of expenditure. I am very willing to be corrected by noble Lords who are former Speakers or Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons, but that is my belief. There is hardly a policy, a Bill or a statutory instrument introduced by Governments into Parliament that does not involve

If it ceases to be in order and permissible for this House seriously to consider the legislation and the policies brought in by the Government on the basis that financial privilege means that it is not appropriate for us to do so, we might as well pack up and go home. Such a situation would make an absolute mockery of our claim to be a revising Chamber or, indeed, a proper debating Chamber.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10122142000113"></a>On that point, I appreciate that the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, always seeks to act in the best interests of the House, as does the noble Lord, Lord McNally, but I would say to them that we are a debating Chamber. As my noble friend Lord Davies said, the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, is very well able to look after herself. The House respects her and I am sure that she is personally willing to enter into debate.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10122142000114"></a>On the constitutional point, I think that this really is of the greatest importance. It seems both cowardly on the part of the Government and contemptuous of this House that they seek to evade debate and, under a new and bogus claim of financial privilege, seek to prevent us from voting on issues on which we have traditionally been entitled to vote. This is a constitutional innovation of which your Lordships' House should be aware and upon which it should reflect very carefully indeed.</p>

They encouraged people to think that it would be a great thing to have an ID card. The fact that 30,000 people or thereabouts bought ID cards does not necessarily mean that those people thought about whether the cards were a good thing; they were encouraged to think so by the previous Government. Now we have the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, whom I have a lot of time for, saying that the Government will have to face up to the consequences of their policies in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10122142000121"></a>Behind the moral issue and the issue of principle, I think that there is a legal issue. The Minister will recall, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, that it was suggested to her on the previous occasion when we debated the matter that she might wish to take specific advice from the law officers as to whether the Government's approach is consistent with this country's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The concern, which is very simple indeed, is that the Bill removes a property right without any compensation, in breach of Article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR and, therefore, that the amendment that noble Lords approved was not only wise but necessary.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10122142000122"></a>When we last debated this matter, the Minister's answer was that the ID card remained the property of the Government and therefore there was no difficulty. With respect, however, that is no answer at all. It is very well established in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights-indeed, it is common sense-that, when the Government grant a licence or an authorisation to do something, that of itself establishes a property right. If that licence or that authorisation is then removed by the Government, contrary to the expectation that has been created, the Government have a duty, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, to pay compensation. That legal obligation is precisely consistent with the substance of our debate on the previous occasion and with the amendment that was approved by noble Lords.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10122142000123"></a>I therefore join the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, in asking the Minister to explain whether she has indeed taken specific advice from the law officers, to deal in more detail with the substance of this concern and to explain to noble Lords how it can be that what the Government intend to do is consistent with this country's international obligations.</p>

If we are concerned with a matter of principle-I understand what the noble Lord is saying-surely the policy of a previous Government cannot be constitutionally binding on the next Government. Whether it is unfortunate and whether there is criticism, the policy of this Government was in fact accepted by this House. If we have got it wrong and the noble Lord is right, that will not affect the validity of this piece of legislation in this country. However, if an application is later made to the Court of Human Rights, it may decide that the point of principle here is that this Government-I do not always agree with them or, indeed, with any Government-have the entitlement in constitutional principle to reject the advice of the previous Government.</p>

I have been waiting to hear some comment on the Commons reason for disagreeing with this House's amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, addressed the issue of financial privilege and suggested that we should not accept it. However-and this is an entirely personal view-I think that this may well be an issue that goes to heart of the relationship between the two Houses. I have grave doubts as to whether we should tackle that convention on the back of this Bill. This is an important, stand-alone issue, but it is not one that we should seek to overturn in this manner.</p>

I understood that we might be told before Third Reading that that advice had been sought. In the Bill there is a declaration that the legislation is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.

The noble Baroness will tell us very soon whether she has had clear advice from the law officers that it is compatible.

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10122142000133"></a>The second issue has also been well aired-my noble friend Lady Hamwee has just referred to it-namely, whether we can at this juncture pick a fight with the Commons on its reasons. I listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, said and I would be the first to leap on to the barricades if I felt that the privileges of this House were being undermined, but we need clear advice on that. Perhaps the learned Clerk may have something to say. I am very disappointed to see him shake his bewigged head. My own sense, for what it is worth, is that the Commons have a case. The amendment is a specifically money amendment; it specifically commits the Exchequer to compensation at the rate of £30 per ID card surrendered.</p>

I took that, obviously fallaciously, as indicating a potential open-mindedness on the part of the coalition Government, my Government, to think again on this issue were we in this House to pass the amendment that we did. That is my third point: regardless of whether the two legal issues here are stoppers, I would have hoped-even at this stage, given that views across this House have been expressed with not a single voice in favour of what the Commons are proposing to do vis-à-vis the amendment-that my noble friend would be able with my other friends in government to do the right thing. The right thing is abundantly clear. My noble friend talked of effectiveness and efficiency. It is not effectiveness or efficiency that we are talking about here; it is fairness, which is the single most important claim made by my Government. I want to see them walk the talk.</p>

I had not intended to intervene, so I shall brief, but I am increasingly concerned about the way in which the procedures both on issues of this nature and in the House more generally are being changed. As my noble friend pointed out, supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, there is a problem about us overturning what the Commons have done. I am not saying that we should do that now, but I am becoming less clear about financial provisions. Very few issues come back to this House that do not involve some expenditure. If the rule is to be no expenditure, there will be an awful lot of things that we will be unable to pursue. That will affect all sides of this House.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10122142000139"></a>I say again, as I have said on many other issues, that the Government are driving through and changing procedures, which is deeply unsatisfactory for this House. We saw it from the Front Bench today. I know that the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, is keen to help the House, but to have a Minister telling another Member of the House not to intervene when the other Minister has already accepted the intervention does not fit with the guidance that the House offers. I have my reservations about whether this really is a self-regulating House, but, if it is, one Minister should not intervene to tell a Back-Bencher to sit down and not intervene on a Minister who has already accepted the intervention. It must be wrong. For the noble Lord, Lord McNally, who is sadly not in his place, to follow that up in the way that he did was not helpful. The Government have to recognise that they are not in charge of Parliament. Parliament controls government; government should not control Parliament. We are seeing far too much of this. I support my noble friend Lord Howarth in his request to the Speakers of the two Houses to try to clarify this important issue of expenditure and finance-raising.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10122142000140"></a>On the issue itself, the noble Baroness has strayed into the area of the pros and cons of ID cards. I was always unsympathetic to the idea of ID cards, but the Minister has problems coming down the line. She might want to have a word with her colleague the Minister for Health in this House, who was very helpful to me. A couple of months ago, I raised with him the situation that is developing in the health service where GPs' surgeries are refusing to register patients unless they produce their passports as ID. They will not accept any other form of ID. By taking away the ID card, we are creating a situation where other things become an ID card. Please do not think that this issue is going away. It will be difficult.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10122142000141"></a>That is another part of the noble Baroness's problem. Frankly, what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said in his intervention is absolutely right. It is sheer common decency that when a Government take over and choose to reverse a policy taken by the previous Government, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, they must make sure that ordinary citizens do not lose out. That is what is wrong with this. I am afraid that it also fits in with the danger of the Government trying to run Parliament and not the other way round.</p>

On this issue, there are strong cases to be made on both sides and there are abstentions. The reason why the Government may have decided that the Bill is compatible with the Human Rights Act is simply that the Act is concerned with substantial matters; it is concerned with violation of rights of real value. Whatever one may say about the value of £30, I respectfully suggest to the House that that is not what the Human Rights Act is concerned with.

This is a sensitive issue and there are clear conventions that we should not in this House criticise the proceedings of another place-and I would not dream of doing so. However, I wonder whether I can take Members of this House back to another period of Conservative government. I recognise that a declining number of Members of this House were in here at the time of the last Conservative Government. Those of us who were used to delight in the tussles between my noble friend Lady Hollis and my friend but, alas, noble opponent at the time, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, on pensions legislation. Frequently, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish had to make concessions and was sometimes defeated. The effect of those concessions and defeats was that this House increased government expenditure. That Conservative Government never cried financial privilege.</p>

It is far from clear in the reasons that have been provided that it is the intention of the House of Commons to claim financial privilege. A single reason is given and that is that the amendment that we are considering, which was carried in this place, would impose a charge on the public revenue. In opening the debate, my noble friend explained that as the Government giving priority consideration to the taxpayer over those who have paid for their identity cards. That does not sound like the invocation of the right of the House of Commons in respect of financial privilege. Without some greater authority indicating that that was the Government's intention, there seems no bar to this House paying serious consideration to the law officers' views on the legality of what is proposed under the terms of the human rights convention. I hope that the House will not be forced to take a decision without those views being made abundantly clear and without absolute clarity about the intentions of the Commons in bringing forward this sole reason for their disagreement. To my mind it is far from clear. We will establish a bad precedent if we determine that claims can be made lightly, not by the Commons themselves, that their privilege in this respect has been breached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10122142000146"></a>On the relationship between ourselves and the House of Commons, the important question was asked why we were allowed to vote on the amendment in the first place if, in fact, it was not legally our right to do so. If we voted for it and it went back to the Commons, surely we should be allowed to look at it again and vote on it again if we so wish.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10122142000147"></a>I am one of very few people in the House who came out publicly in support of the ID card and opposed this piece of legislation. I think that we will come back to the issue. I listened to some of the debates last night on the register and the census and that sort of thing and I thought to myself that, if we all had ID cards, it would all be irrelevant and we would not need to go through that process. I am still not at all clear in my own mind as to what the standing is of the ID cards that have been issued. The Government are claiming that the cards are their property, so surely they should ensure that every one of them is returned to them. They should not be leaving that in the hands of private individuals; it is up to the Government to say that the cost of claiming back all the ID cards would be as much as paying compensation to those who have them.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10122142000148"></a>The other point is one that I have consistently raised. Can someone actually use the ID card-perhaps in an exchange between two people, such as a barman or pub owner and a young person? The youngster might say, "I've got an ID card", and show it to the barman, and the barman could say as a result, "That's fine, I accept you're over 18". Is it legal for that person to do that? If the card belongs to the Government, surely the person has no right to use it in that way. Can we get an answer to that question from the Minister? We seem to be in limbo on it. I do not quite know what the standing is of the ID cards held by individuals if they are not being compensated for them in any way whatever.</p>

Perhaps I can deal with some of the issues to which it has given rise. On compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Government would not put forward legislation that they did not believe to be compatible with the convention. We believe this Bill to be compatible with the convention. I hope that that is a clear statement. We believe it to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

That is why it was suggested to the Minister on the previous occasion that specific advice should be taken from the law officers on this precise point. I am sure that it would assist the House if the Minister were at least able to say whether she went back to the law officers in the light of the debate on the previous occasion, and in the light of the specific concern that was raised, in order to assure herself and noble Lords that that point had been considered and the Government were satisfied with regard to it.</p>

The answer to the question is a simple yes or no. If she gave that commitment and then did not deliver on it, she needs to say that. The House will not necessarily hang, draw and quarter on the issue, but we need to know the answer. If the Minister cannot answer that question, I am afraid that the Government have to answer the wider question of what they are doing in this regard, given that they are responsible for this department. If she cannot answer the question, the case for adjourning the House while she finds the answer, as the noble Lord has just suggested, or summoning the Leader of the House is very strong. We cannot have a situation whereby other Ministers keep jumping up to defend this Minister; that cannot be right. The Minister must be responsible for what she said at a previous stage and for what she is saying today. If she is not responsible for that, it is a serious matter.</p>

The Government are quite clear that they do not actually think that it is justified to refund this money. The Government's position is very clear on the substance. As regards the issue of financial privilege, the Commons cannot even make a determination without the House of Lords itself putting forward a proposition. One has to have the proposition from the Lords before the House of Commons can take a view on that. It is obviously then a matter for the Commons to determine.

That is utterly different from a payment of £30. We should keep a sense of proportion. We do not believe that the purchase of the card constitutes any kind of contract between the Government and the taxpayer. Therefore, we do not believe that there is an obligation on the Government to refund the money, so the Government do not intend to do so.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10122142000191"></a>The card will no longer have a database behind it to demonstrate its validity. Of course, it will not be an illegal act for someone to use it when they go to the pub. However, it has no legal validity, and one could perfectly well use a passport or driving licence for that purpose. For all these reasons, the Government do not believe that it is right-</p>

It is a lot cheaper to buy an ID card than a passport. She may say that £30 is nothing to people who go on holiday, but that is a slightly arrogant approach. She says that the card could be used in pubs that ask for ID, but that no one will be able to check it against a database. However, we all know, from going into and out of this country, that there are different ways of being checked by electronic means. Will these identity cards still work when one goes through immigration or will they be cancelled?</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10122142000193"></a>The Minister says that the database has been abolished. I doubt whether any database ever gets abolished, because MI5 or someone else will want to keep it. At what stage will the ID card not work when one goes through immigration, and what is the other solution? Not everyone has a driving licence-why should they? Will it be the case that one cannot go abroad unless one has a passport, so that going abroad will not be possible for people who cannot afford a passport? I would be glad if the Minister would respond to some of those questions.</p>

The previous Government decided that the database should be separate from the passport database. It is not possible to join up the two databases because they are not compatible; that is one of the problems. This database will not exist. Therefore, the ID card, although it might be regarded as a courtesy proof of age, for instance in a pub, will have no legal validity at the border. The receiving country might be willing to accept it, but I fear that the individual might not get back into this country because they would have to show a document that had a database behind it.</p>

Have the Government fulfilled their obligation not under the Human Rights Act, as we have been invited to do, but under the European convention, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, reminded us?

This is the right action to take, given our country's close economic, financial and political connections to Ireland. By passing this Bill today, the UK will be ready, come the new year, to meet its commitments to one of our closest international partners.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10122142000208"></a>The legislation before the House today is narrow in scope but it is still enabling legislation. It will sit alongside the actual loan agreement, which will set out the details of what we offer Ireland. I intend to address the substance of both the legislation and the loan agreement. Before that, however, I would like to remind the House of how Ireland ended up in its current predicament.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10122142000209"></a>Over this year, it became increasingly clear that the situation in the Irish economy was unsustainable. Irish banks had become almost wholly reliant on central bank funding to maintain their operations. At the same time, Ireland's market interest rates rose to record levels and its sovereign debt markets have now effectively closed, with little prospect of reopening.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10122142000210"></a>This situation cannot go on. So, on the weekend of 20 November, Ireland's Prime Minister, Brian Cowen, made a formal request for international financial assistance. The United Kingdom, alongside the IMF, the EU, the euro area and other member states, made  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1021"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1021</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an agreement in principle to take part in an assistance package to Ireland. At the end of November, Ireland agreed with the IMF and the EU a three-year financial assistance package worth €85 billion. The money will be used as follows: from that total, €35 billion will be used to support Ireland's banking sector, with €10 billion going towards immediate bank recapitalisation. The remaining €50 billion will be used for sovereign debt support.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10122142000211"></a>In terms of contributions to the cost of the package, Ireland itself will provide €17.5 billion towards the total. The remaining €67.5 billion will be split, with one-third coming from the IMF, one-third from the European financial stability mechanism and one-third from the euro area facility and bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10122142000212"></a>This is a significant package that will help Ireland deal with its problems and restore stability to its economy. It will help it recapitalise its banks and set up a contingency reserve for future problems. It will also help the Irish authorities cover the shortfall in their budget, which was presented to the Irish Parliament earlier this month.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10122142000213"></a>I understand that some noble Lords may have concerns about the size and the timing of the loan. Indeed, some may be asking why we are extending a loan to Ireland in the first instance. We are doing this because it is overwhelmingly in our national interest that we have a strong Irish economy and a stable banking system. This is not just about the Irish economy and Irish jobs; it is about the British economy and British jobs.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10122142000214"></a>A loan does not add to our deficit; any increase in borrowing is matched by the commitment of Ireland to repay it with interest. Ireland is the fifth largest market for British exporters, and accounts for 5 per cent of our total exports. Ireland is also the only country with which we share a land border, and in Northern Ireland our economies have particularly close ties.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10122142000215"></a>Just as our two economies are linked, our business and banking sectors are also interconnected. More Irish companies are listed in London than companies from any other foreign country. In Northern Ireland, two of the four largest high-street banks are Irish-owned, accounting for almost a quarter of personal accounts. Our own banking sector has a considerable exposure to Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10122142000216"></a>I should stress, however, that the UK's banks are sufficiently well capitalised to more than manage the impact from the situation in Ireland. But one thing is clear: it is undoubtedly in Britain's national interest that we have a growing Irish economy and a stable Irish banking system. That is the purpose of this Bill.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10122142000217"></a>The Bill has two substantive clauses. Clause 1 sets out the parameters under which the Treasury may make payments under UK loans to Ireland. The total international assistance package, including our contribution, is denominated in euros. However, our bilateral loan will be made in sterling. Subsection (3) includes a cap on the total size of our bilateral loan of £3.25 billion. This will be the total size of our bilateral loan to Ireland, and the period over which these loans may be paid out will end on 8 December 2015, five years after the Bill was first published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10122142000218"></a>I would like to make it clear that there is no expectation that we will have to make further loans to Ireland in the future. This is reflected in subsection (4), which is intended to prevent an increase in the size of the loan unless an order is made by statutory instrument. But because the loan is denominated in sterling, a mechanism is needed to accommodate potential changes in the exchange rate in the period between the publication of the Bill and the signing of the loan agreement. Therefore, the Bill allows the Treasury, under subsections (4) to (7), to make an order once the Bill is in force to increase the limit, as long as this is done solely to take account of exchange rate fluctuations between now and 30 days after Royal Assent without further parliamentary procedure. Let me be clear: any increase in any other circumstances or for any other reason would require approval in another place. This is something that I and my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer do not envisage happening. We also expect full repayment to be made over the term of the loan.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10122142000219"></a>We want the process to be as open and transparent as possible. Clause 2 therefore creates a requirement for the Treasury to prepare and lay before Parliament a report every six months on any payments made by the Treasury by way of a loan to Ireland, the original term of each loan, any sums received by the Treasury by way of interest or repayment of such loans, the amounts outstanding, and the remaining terms of any outstanding loans.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10122142000220"></a>I would like to update the House on the main terms of the bilateral loan, which we have agreed in principle with the Irish authorities and have made available in the Libraries of the House. The loan will be drawn in eight tranches, each with a seven-and-a-half-year term. This is in line with the terms for both the European and IMF loans. The first tranche of our loan will be available to be disbursed in September 2011 and the interest rate charged on each tranche of the loan will be fixed specifically for that tranche. This will be set by adding a fixed margin of 2.25 percentage points to the appropriate market-determined interest rate, the sterling seven-and-a-half-year swap rate, at the time of disbursement. For example, at present, the estimated interest rate on the first tranche of the UK loan would be the sterling seven-a-and-a-half-year swap rate in September 2011 plus 2.25 percentage points. That margin was set to give an estimated interest rate of 5.9 per cent for the first tranche of the loan.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10122142000221"></a>The rate on our bilateral loan is slightly higher than the estimated rate of 5.7 per cent for the first tranche of IMF and EFSM funds, but it is also slightly lower than the estimated 6.1 per cent rate the EFSF will charge on its first tranche of lending. This reflects the different costs of funding and is a measure of the international confidence in the UK's public finances. We will charge interest every six months and there will be a repayment of principal at the end of the seven-and-a-half-year term of each tranche. As with the IMF, there will also be a commitment fee for making this loan. We will charge half a percentage point on the total amounts that may be drawn down under the loan agreement for the forthcoming 12-month period. If the loan is drawn the fee will be waived, effectively replaced with the interest charged on the loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10122142000222"></a>There are two conditions on the loan set out in the terms, to which I would like to draw the attention of the House. The first condition is that the IMF as well as the EU must be satisfied that Ireland is complying with the agreed restructuring plan. This is a very important safeguard. The second crucial condition is that there are to be no amendments to the restructuring plan that could have a material adverse financial impact on the UK operations of Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. Given the scale of their operation in the UK, this is vital.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10122142000223"></a>The official advice from the Treasury is that this loan represents value for money for the British taxpayer while being in line with the terms offered by both the IMF and the euro area. A summary of the key terms of the agreement and a final written agreement will be forthcoming shortly.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10122142000224"></a>One thing is clear: Ireland is a friend, and a friend in need. Because of the steps we have taken, our economy is currently in a far stronger position than Ireland's; that is why we are able to offer such reasonable and sensible terms for our bilateral loan to Ireland.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10122142000225"></a>I should like to talk briefly about a related matter which I know is of interest to this House: the proposed permanent stability mechanism for euro area economies. Both my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have been very clear that when it comes to putting in place a permanent mechanism, the UK should not be part of it. The time has come for the euro area to put in place its own mechanism for dealing with the imbalances. It needs to be part of a comprehensive solution that sees countries addressing more decisively their own problems, including in their banking systems. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said yesterday, it is clear from the recent Council conclusions that the mechanism will be for,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10122142000290"></a>"Member states whose currency is in the euro".</p>

<p><a name="10122142000272"></a>Britain therefore will not be part of it.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10122142000226"></a>Since our coalition Government came into office, we have taken action to put our own house in order. We are now in a strong position that enables us to help Ireland, our closest neighbour, in its hour of need. As I have said, this is clearly in our national interest. A strong Ireland-indeed, a strong Europe-is vital to the success of the British economy. Today's Bill will help to ensure this. I beg to move.</p>

I was trying to catch what his ministerial colleague Mr Lidington was saying to us in evidence in the EU Committee about the permanent mechanism.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10122142000228"></a>I support very strongly the principle of helping Ireland in its hour of need. The case seems self-evident given the interconnectedness of our economies, with 5 per cent of our exports going to the Republic, and the consequences for us of a collapse of its economy, which would be serious, not least for British banks.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10122142000229"></a>No simple solution such as coming out of the euro is available for Ireland, as a lot of people who opposed the legislation seemed to think. It is worth bearing  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1024"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1024</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in mind that, were a member state to try to come out of the euro, there would be a very big devaluation. That would cause a collapse in living standards and purchasing power, which would have knock-on economic consequences particularly, in Ireland's case, for Britain. Moreover, its debt would continue to be denominated in euro. As the new currency had depreciated, there would almost certainly be a default that required a restructuring of that debt, again with very severe consequences for the British financial system.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10122142000230"></a>However, while I fully support the objectives of the Bill, I dislike it considerably. I dislike it because of its bilateral nature. The Government are profoundly wrong in the working assumptions that lie behind this bilateral Bill: that the euro problem is a problem for the eurozone, that it is for the eurozone to sort itself out, and that it is none of our business. That is profoundly misguided and not in the UK's national interest.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10122142000231"></a>It is wrong for three reasons. First, as we in Britain seek the necessary rebalancing of our economy towards exports and investment, it is absolutely clear that we are dependent on very strong growth in the euro area, which is our biggest market. I know that the rest of the world is growing much more strongly and Asia is growing very strongly indeed, but Germany, more than the United Kingdom and other members of the European Union, is getting the most benefit out of that global expansion. We will be the beneficiaries of that German growth in the eurozone. We live in Britain today in an economy that is deeply integrated into the rest of Europe. Our fortunes are dependent on the rest of Europe. It is completely misleading to talk about their problems over there and think that we can sort out our problems over here as though they are completely separate questions.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10122142000232"></a>Secondly, our banks are extremely interconnected. I was reading the Bank of England's report on financial stability, which was published last week. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10122142000291"></a>"UK banks' holdings of sovereign debt issued by countries under heightened strain are relatively small. But total claims on these economies, including lending to households and businesses, are larger ... Losses on such lending could increase were heightened sovereign concerns to be accompanied by weakening economic conditions. Credit risk could also be amplified by the interconnectedness of European banking systems. UK banks have claims of almost £300 billion on France and Germany, whose banking systems are more heavily exposed to the most affected economies".</p>

<p><a name="10122142000273"></a>The Bank of England argues that there is strong interconnectedness, and we must think in those terms, not that we are something separate and apart.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10122142000233"></a>Thirdly, when there is a crisis, we will end up paying for it just as if we were in the eurozone. I looked at the <I>Hansard</I> report of the debate in the other place on this subject and at what the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to say about it. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10122142000297"></a>"our contribution has been calculated on the basis of what we would have paid if we had been part of the facility".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/12/10; col. 946.]</ul>
<p><a name="10122142000274"></a>In other words, it is a bilateral contribution but it is based on a calculation of what we would have paid if we had joined. Mr George Osborne goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10122142000292"></a>"We are paying pretty much exactly what we would have paid if we had been a member of the euro".-[Official Report, Commons, 15/12/10; col. 948.]</p>

<p><a name="10122142000275"></a>We cannot avoid our obligations to the rest of the European Union by pretending that this is something apart from us.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10122142000234"></a>What is going on here is that UK politics is taking priority over the national interest. Clearly, we in Britain are in this up to our necks. Our banks are in it up to their necks and our prospects for growth are dependent on the euro area. Instead of the Prime Minister saying, "This is nothing to do with us", he should be doing today what Gordon Brown did in October 2008; he should go to the summit of the eurozone countries and say, "Here is the plan to rescue the banks in the area. Britain has a vital interest in being part of this". Instead, we get a washing of the hands of Britain's role. It is clear that this policy will not last. I looked at what various economic experts were saying about the likely pattern of what was likely to happen in the eurozone. It is difficult for the Government to comment on this because no Government can forecast that there will be defaults.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10122142000235"></a>I looked at an article by the one professor who forecast the crash of 2007 and 2008-Professor Roubini. In his view, what he describes as the current strategy of kicking the can down the road will soon reach its limits. He goes on to argue that,</p>
<ul><a name="10122142000298"></a>"Europe must ... implement early orderly restructurings of distressed sovereigns' public debt".</ul>
<p><a name="10122142000276"></a>The consequence of the orderly restructuring of distressed foreign debt would be the necessity also to carry out another restructuring of the European banking system, in which Britain's banks are intimately involved. Instead of doing these bilateral things, we should be putting ourselves at the heart of Europe and of the argument about what needs to be done in order to rescue the European economy. What we are seeing here is a policy for marginalising Britain that is profoundly against our national interests. We will pay a very high price for it in future, because when the new mechanism is set up the key economic decisions will be taken by the eurozone, which will go along to ECOFIN, and Britain will be forced to agree with what the eurozone has decided because decisions are taken by qualified majority voting.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10122142000236"></a>This principle of staying out and doing bilateral deals is a very bad policy for Britain. It is putting playing the politics of the <I>Daily Mail</I> and Rupert Murdoch before a real, patriotic sense of where our national interest lies.</p>

I was slightly concerned, however, that he did not refer the House with the degree of attention that it may deserve to paragraph 21 of the Explanatory Notes, which deals with the compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. I was tempted to ask him whether the law officers had been consulted before the Chancellor of the Exchequer made the statement that,</p>
<ul><a name="10122142000299"></a>"pursuant to section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 ... the Bill is compatible with the Convention rights".</ul>
<p><a name="10122142000277"></a>As this is the first time that we have debated the Bill, the Minister has not had the chance to give any undertaking to speak to the law officers, and it would be invidious to ask him to do so. However, one hopes that that will not be necessary.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10122142000240"></a>Was there any alternative to the loan and the Bill? As the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, has explained, there was not. If the EU had not intervened in the dramatic way in which it did, it is almost certain that Ireland would have had to default and leave the euro. That would have been bad not only for the eurozone but for the UK. It would have been bad for the UK for trade reasons-I shall come back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, a bit later in my speech-as we have a large volume of exports to Ireland. Indeed, 40 per cent of Northern Ireland's exports go to the Republic. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bew, will expand on that point.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10122142000241"></a>The prospect of Northern Ireland, as a depressed region of the United Kingdom, suffering significantly as the result of a major crisis in the Republic would have had not just a severe impact on Northern Ireland but, obviously, a severe knock-on effect here, including to the public finances. We would have had, in effect, to have filled in some of the hole that would have been knocked in the Northern Ireland economy. Such a crisis would also have been bad for the UK because of the exposure of UK banks. Again, as the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, pointed out, the Bank of England has set out starkly the scale of that issue. A default would have led to instability in sovereign debt markets more generally and could have increased the costs of UK government borrowing.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10122142000242"></a>That does not necessarily mean that we agree with absolutely everything that is being done to restructure the Irish banking system. The arguments for establishing the National Asset Management Agency can be made either way. Effectively nationalising all the risks taken by all the Irish banks raises moral-hazard issues, which we have sought to avoid to a considerable extent in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10122142000243"></a>Another issue is whether, even with all this activity, we will have been successful in stabilising the Irish economy. To pose the question that Martin Wolf posed in the <I>F</I><I>inancial </I><I>T</I><I>imes</I> recently, the question is not whether the Irish banking sector is too big to fail but whether it is too big to save. Hopefully, the answer is that the Irish banking sector can be saved as-heaven knows-it is not lacking resources. The amount that has gone in both from the Irish Government and, via them, from the EU is now considerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10122142000244"></a>It would have been irresponsible for the UK not to participate in the Irish bailout, but the Irish problem is not the only issue facing the eurozone. There are broader issues that relate to Greece, Portugal and now Spain and Italy. Given that we are outside the eurozone, it is a logical if inglorious position for us not to commit to taking part in any further bailouts of other member states.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10122142000245"></a>When contemplating this debate, I cast my mind back to the debates that we had a decade ago on whether Britain should join the euro subsequent to, as many noble Lords will remember, the famous five tests. I am pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord Morris, in his place. Uniquely in my hearing, he was able to make a joke-which at least I laughed at at the time-about whether we should join the euro. At a TUC summer reception, he said that, having been asked by the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, what he thought about the five tests, he had replied, "Well, we've won one, we've lost one, we've drawn one, but I think we might win the series in Sydney". A decade on, a lot has changed both in cricket and in our perceptions of the euro.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10122142000246"></a>At that time, many of us on these Benches supported Britain's attempts to join the euro. One of the joys of doing a considerable amount of work with Charles Kennedy, as I was doing then, was that we were summoned from time to time to see the Prime Minister for an uplifting talk on matters of common interest and concern, of which the euro was one. At that point, Charles Kennedy was keen to press the case for British membership of the euro on a Prime Minister who was keen but extremely nervous about that prospect. Indeed, he said at the time that he would like to join the euro but he thought that it was impossible to beat both public opinion and the popular press-he could beat one, he thought, but not both-so he did not attempt it. As a result, we are now in a situation in which nobody seriously thinks that we should join the euro in the foreseeable future. Although it is inconceivable-for the reasons given by Tony Blair among many other reasons-that we should join the euro at this point, some of us at least are not absolutely convinced that we took the right decision a decade ago.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10122142000247"></a>However, if I were to dilate on that argument and those tests, I would no doubt keep your Lordships here all evening. I know how much Members-particularly those opposite-hate overlong speeches. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is clearly already extremely impatient with me, and I can understand why that might be the case.</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10122142000248"></a>Even though we are agreed that we should not join the euro, two interlinked questions need to be considered-we cannot amend the Bill, and it would be foolish to attempt to do so-in this discussion on the Bill, which gives us an opportunity to range slightly wider. Realistically, what should our role be in terms of ensuring financial stability within Europe? And what should the eurozone do now? As I say, the two issues are inextricably linked, but the first principle should surely be to support eurozone members in doing whatever they agree is prudent to strengthen the working of the eurozone. For example, it would surely be perverse and ridiculous if the Government committed themselves to having a referendum on changes to the  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1028"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1028</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>EU treaties that eurozone members decided were necessary to allow eurozone members to support each other more effectively. Can the Minister assure us that, as a non-eurozone member, we will wave through any proposed changes to the EU treaties without requiring a referendum in the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="101221-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10122142000249"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, has pointed out, the Chancellor is more generally in an extremely odd position when considering the development of the eurozone. The eurozone's success or failure is obviously of crucial importance to the future of the British economy, as has been exemplified by the situation in Ireland. However, as the noble Lord pointed out, there are three reasons why the success or failure of the euro and the eurozone is important to us. The first of those reasons, to which he referred-and on which he was challenged by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch-relates to trade. It seems to me bizarre and sad that we export more to Ireland than to the BRICs combined. However, that may be a slightly misleading figure, as I suspect that the figure includes all the re-exports of goods that come from the rest of the world to Ireland via the UK. For example, I suspect that goods that are shipped from France to Ireland by road through the UK count as UK exports to Ireland. I may be wrong on that, but that may slightly inflate the figure.

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10122142000250"></a>However, if one wants suddenly to change gear completely and export significantly greater amounts to the BRICs, the problem is that, frankly, that is easier said than done. It is not easy for a small business suddenly to decide to sell its products in China or Brazil, given the problems of language and distance. Therefore, even with the best will in the world, it would take a while before we could re-orientate our trade significantly away from the eurozone, particularly given that our strength rests in exports of services, many of which are easier to export to the eurozone than to the BRICs. That is particularly the case in countries where there are institutional barriers to exports of services. It is not simply that a lawyer or accountant seeking to open an office in India has their work cut out for them but that they cannot do it. Therefore, it would be an extremely difficult challenge for the UK simply to do a handbrake turn and suddenly start newly exporting huge quantities of goods to the BRICs. Therefore, we need the eurozone to do well, because that is where many of our exporters already have links and where, as we grow, they could develop those links significantly more.</p>

First, it is increasing from a smaller base, so it is easier to achieve a higher percentage increase. Secondly, most of those economies are growing more quickly than the eurozone, so you are feeding into a

I completely accept that, but my point was slightly different. Incidentally, another problem about exporting to some of those other countries is that the newly passed Bribery Act is making many companies, not least small-to-medium-sized companies, very wary about their ability to export to China or India, for example, because they fear-sometimes rightly and sometimes, no doubt, incorrectly-that they may be faced with business practices there which they need to follow in order to gain access to a market but which they would not have to follow in the eurozone. In the medium term, I am extremely optimistic about the prospects for exports to the BRICs, but in the short term, given that we are starting from a relatively low base, it is a forlorn hope to think that the BRICs can solve our export problems.</p>

At the risk of repeating myself, let me say that the House will be aware that, by long-standing convention observed by successive Administrations and embodied in the <I>Ministerial Code</I>, the fact that law officers have or have not advised on a particular issue and the content of any advice are not disclosable outside the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10122146000002"></a>I have consulted <I>Hansard</I> and spoken to officials during the adjournment. I did say on Report that I would confirm the advice that we had received on legal aspects. I am able to confirm that I did just that, that the contents of the Bill are compatible with ECHR requirements and that I have given that commitment based on legal advice. I have taken appropriate legal advice at all stages of the Bill, including Report. I hope that noble Lords will appreciate that the convention of the House, which I have tried to follow, does not enable me to disclose the source of that advice, but I am satisfied that I have taken it.</p>

I will be very clear. The Minister has answered one specific point that was raised on Report. However, I remind her that she was asked whether advice was received from the law officers. The noble Baroness said, "I will confirm the advice that I have received". She has now answered that point. However, she was also asked by my noble and learned friend, Lord Morris of Aberavon, who is a former law officer, whether the advice was from the law officers. The noble Baroness said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="10122146000116"></a>"I am not sure that I can confirm that. I will seek to do so before Third Reading".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/11/10; col. 792.]</p>

<p><a name="10122146000110"></a>She has not answered that point, nor has she given an assurance to the House that, following Report, she did anything at all in relation to the commitments that she gave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10122146000007"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness says about the disclosure of the law officers' advice. That is a separate point to the one asked by my noble and learned friend, who asked whether advice had been sought from the law officers. That is a different issue. On the issue of the availability of advice from the law officers, would the noble Baroness be prepared to let me see that advice on Privy Council terms? The substantive issue  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1031"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1031</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that this raises is about Ministers making commitments to the House and then following them up. It is a matter that I will return to in the fullness of time.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10122146000008"></a>The further substantive issue is one of fairness. Thousands of people bought ID cards on the basis that they were for a 10-year period. The Government have decided to withdraw those cards and this Bill enables them to do so. That is parliamentary democracy. We did not oppose the Bill, because we recognised that commitments were made in the manifestos of both parties in the coalition Government. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, said, the issue is one of fairness. How can it possibly be fair, when a person has bought a card for 10 years, for it to be withdrawn after a matter of months and for no compensation to be given? It is an absolute disgrace.</p>

We certainly accept the convention that the noble Baroness is under no obligation to tell the House what the advice of the law officers was. However, I am surprised, not least in the light of the earlier observations by my noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon, to hear her assert that she is under no obligation to tell the House whether she received advice from the law officers. I wonder whether part of the reason for her difficulty earlier in the afternoon was that the advice of the law officers was not consistent. Perhaps they disagreed among themselves, which put her in an embarrassing and difficult position. Perhaps she would be willing to cast any light on that; if she would, I think that the House would be interested.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10122146000010"></a>The second issue is the one that I raised earlier. I am genuinely unclear, from what the Minister said this afternoon, whether the Government are asserting financial privilege and hiding behind a ruling of the Speaker and whether they are content that this extension of the doctrine of financial privilege to cover matters of expenditure as well as measures concerned with revenue raising is an appropriate new doctrine for them to espouse and to use for their political convenience. As I suggested earlier, if that is the case, there are large implications for this House, which we should ponder and take seriously. Will the Minister tell us in plain terms whether the Government consider that this is a matter of financial privilege and therefore outside the authority and competence of this House to vote on?</p>

Noble Lords will understand that of course we expect a noble Lord on the opposition Front Bench to be able to put the opposition view. Other noble Lords might wish to put very brief questions. We allowed a little latitude to the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. Perhaps we might now return to the normal convention of making brief interventions so that my noble friend can return to the assurance, which she has given very clearly to the House, that at all times she has taken the appropriate legal advice and, as she has tried to assure the House, that the Government have acted properly. Of course I understand that matters of parliamentary procedure

I also understand that these will be debated on another day. Our minds today are concentrated on one Bill and one or two Motions.</p>

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="10122146000013"></a><b><a name="101221-0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10122146000137"></a>Lord Pannick:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I shall confine myself to brief questions. First, the Minister indicated that legal advice had been taken. Will she accept that there is a difference, which concerns noble Lords, between taking legal advice on these matters and taking legal advice from the law officers?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10122146000014"></a>The second matter arises out of the noble Baroness's statement that it is a convention that Ministers do not confirm whether or not legal advice has been sought from the law officers. Does she accept that it is a different matter if she has given a specific assurance to the House that legal advice will be sought from the law officers and that it is entirely appropriate that she should confirm to the House whether her own assurance has been fulfilled?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10122146000015"></a>My third and final question is: will she also accept that it is not a universal rule that the Government do not tell the House whether legal advice has been sought from the law officers? There are many, many examples of the Government telling this House and the other place that legal advice has been sought from the law officers. Professor Edwards's book, <I>Law Officers of the Crown</I>, gives many examples, the most recent of which, of course, relates to the legality of the invasion of Iraq.</p>

I have tried very hard to be of help. Perhaps I can take up the points that have been made. I was asked in the House-I am looking at <I>Hansard</I>-whether the advice was from the law officers. I said that I was not sure but would seek to confirm it. That is indeed what I undertook to do. I am advised that I am not in a position to disclose either the fact of seeking that legal advice or its contents. That is why I am not able to take what I have said to the House this afternoon any further. The only way that I could do that would be-</p>

She says that she is not in a position to do so but, first, why did she not write to noble Lords following Report? Why does she treat this House with such disrespect? This is not the first time that she has not followed up debates by writing to noble Lords. Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, made clear, when she says that she is not in a position to disclose, I think that she is saying that, as a Minister, she is not prepared to do so, whereas in fact she could very easily do so.</p>

I approach this subject from a slightly different angle. Both in this House this afternoon and in the other place the main focus of the discussion on the Bill has been, for entirely excellent reasons, economic matters. A case has to be made for the British taxpayer supporting such a loan and it has been very well made in terms of the interdependence of the two economies, particularly the fragility of the Irish banking system and the possible negative knock-on effects within the United Kingdom. Indeed, if I may put it even more bluntly, so far as concerns Northern Ireland there is a great deal to be feared from an implosion of the Irish economy. Therefore, the steps that have been taken on Treasury advice with respect to the Bill seem entirely reasonable and entirely worthy of support.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10122146000020"></a>Although I accept the economic argument that was put so effectively today by the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, I suggest that we should look at the Bill in a wider and more historical context. The fact is that historically there has been a traditional Irish suspicion of Britain and its role, which has been reflected in Irish support for whoever the enemy of the United Kingdom has been at a given time, going back to Philip II of Spain and Napoleon of France. In 1916 at the time of the Easter Rising, the insurrectionists made an appeal to their gallant allies in Germany. Therefore, at different points in Irish history, there has been an explicable yearning for an alliance with major continental powers against Britain.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10122146000021"></a>In February 1920, Eamonn de Valera said that if Ireland became independent, it would become the closest possible ally of Britain,</p>
<ul><a name="10122146000120"></a>"in a moment of real national danger to either".</ul>
<p><a name="10122146000111"></a>The fact is that Ireland did become independent shortly thereafter but, for much of the time since then, that has not been true. It is hard to say that in the summer of 1940, for example, Ireland acted as the closest possible ally at a moment of real national danger, and there are many other such instances.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10122146000022"></a>However, in recent years there have been attempts to bring about better relations between the two countries. Following what, in the end, turned out to be a false start with the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 and the Good Friday agreement of 1998, we have moved to a new and better place. Not the least of the reasons why it is right for the British Government to take the step that they are now taking is that we are, when faced with dissident terrorism, now dependent to an unusual degree on the excellent security support that we receive from the Irish Government. That is one of many reasons why it is indeed in our national self-interest to behave in the way that the Government now propose.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10122146000023"></a>So we are now in a somewhat better place and we are in a moment when we can, on our side, try to fulfil de Valera's promise to be the closest possible ally in a moment of real national danger. To make it absolutely clear, this is a moment of real national danger for  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1034"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1034</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ireland and the Irish people. There are moments of great political and economic uncertainty ahead. It is also an interesting moment in that in Irish public debate over the past month there has been much criticism of things that have been said by the German Chancellor, the governor of the Portuguese bank and the governor of the Spanish central bank, but there has been no criticism of substance of anything said by senior politicians in London. In fact, there has been a recognition that the British Government have behaved well in this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, who will speak after me, is the co-chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and he will recall the warmth with which the Irish Members of Parliament responded to the initiative taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10122146000024"></a>Therefore, we are in a new moment-a potentially more benign moment-and I want to talk about politics and history, as well as economics, because I think that it is very important that we build on the politics of this moment, as well as fulfil the economic commitments into which we are about to enter. It is very important that we now try to achieve a new relationship between Britain and Ireland-often promised but often illusory following agreement after agreement. That relationship has not been delivered in the way that it was supposed to be. However, since 1998 we have been steadily getting to understand each other better and this is an important moment. At present, I offer my support for the Bill, but I ask the Government not simply to confine their actions here to the narrow economic sphere but to build on all the other political options that are open to them in order to strengthen the association with Dublin and to turn a new page in the history of the relationship between Ireland and Britain.</p>

I do not think that this is an interest in the strict sense that your Lordships' House understands, but for that matter, a lot of the interests that are declared in the course of your Lordships' debates are not, in the strict sense, interests either. The House is quite right to err on the side of disclosure in that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10122146000026"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Bew, has just indicated, as it happened, our last joint meeting as representatives of the legislatures of these islands occurred on 20 and 21 November, at exactly the time that the crisis which is the reason for the Bill was coming to a head. Our Irish colleagues were, indeed, somewhat distracted during our meetings over those days, as your Lordships will guess. It certainly gave us all a greater insight into the stresses that they were under and the political as well as the economic effects of the crisis. I can confirm, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, has just said, that a great deal of gratitude was expressed by our Irish colleagues for the attitude of UK Ministers and, in particular, for some of the Chancellor's remarks at that time. That has a political importance quite separate from the economic importance of the Bill and the loans it allows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10122146000027"></a>I strongly support the Bill. As my noble friend the Commercial Secretary has explained, the Bill and the loans it permits are part of the underpinning of the economy and banking system of the Irish Republic. It is important, as other noble Lords have said, for our economy and particularly for the economy of Northern Ireland. It is difficult to express that aspect of this too strongly.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10122146000028"></a>I go along with the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, to the extent that this is not, of course, the end of such matters. We must expect further strains within the eurozone and, clearly, EU Finance Ministers, including our own, are right to seek agreement on a debt restructuring mechanism, and so on. We in Britain are necessarily involved because our banks are involved, as has been said, but that does not make the Bill wrong. On the contrary, it is right and I support it.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10122146000029"></a>I also support the use of the fast-track procedure, which was devised, after all, by our Constitution Committee and which has proved its worth in this case, although it was questioned in debates in another place. Her Majesty's Government are to be congratulated on seeking specific legislative authority before signing up to the loans, rather than relying on so-called common-law powers and coming to Parliament afterwards for ratification, which is something that they could have done. The previous Government were accused of having breached the spirit and, arguably, the letter of the Public Accounts Committee Concordat of 1932 which governs these matters. This Government were right not to have risked such condemnation in this case. At the same time, if the Bill had followed normal timings through Parliament, it would have been delayed until well after the loan agreements were likely to be agreed. That is the first reason for the fast-tracking.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10122146000030"></a>The Government also say in the Explanatory Memorandum that fast-tracking is necessary to give confidence to our international partners. I understand that, but it is only part of the matter. The important fact which underlies all this is that markets these days move very swiftly and fast, firm decisions are required to deal with that. I was a Treasury Minister at the time we left the ERM-although I was not involved with that side of the department-so I need no convincing about the power of the markets and the speed with which they can influence events.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10122146000031"></a>Incidentally, there is a tendency to dismiss currency market operations as purely speculators speculating. Of course, there are some operators within those markets who are pure speculators, but the foundation of currency markets-the size of them reflects this-is legitimate traders trying to offset potential currency fluctuations. A board deciding to invest in a new major plant whose operations and building will extend over decades to come needs to insure itself as much as it can against possible currency fluctuations during the time taken to bring it to fruition. Similarly, someone buying or selling large items which take time to deliver can easily find that the profit or loss on the exchange rate can be greater than the profit on the goods themselves. They need to ensure that they are not penalised by currency fluctuations by buying or selling forward. Which of us planning a holiday overseas has

That is not speculation; it is prudent foresight.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10122146000032"></a>I make one further point before I sit down. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not quite accurate when, in debates in another place, he compared the affirmative procedure in Clause 1(4) for agreeing any increase of these loans to new primary legislation. He said that the effect is exactly the same, but it is not; certainly not in this House, which is not involved in the affirmative procedure in Clause 1(5)-quite rightly, given the nature of the Bill. The effect of affirmative orders and primary legislation is not the same, and certainly was not when I was a Member of another place a decade and a half ago. I realise that the timetabling of Bills in another place has made things rather different from when I was there. It means that there is less distinction between affirmative orders and Bills in another place, but what a commentary that is on the way in which primary legislation is now scrutinised there.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10122146000033"></a>However, that is by the way. I support the making of these loans to our friends and neighbours in the Republic and I support the mechanism by which it is being accomplished; namely, this fast-tracked Bill.</p>

I would have intervened on him earlier, but since I was hoping to speak in the debate I did not want to interrupt him unnecessarily. I think I heard him say that this potential transaction by which we lend three point something billion pounds to the state of Ireland will not increase our borrowing, because the Irish have an obligation to repay. I see the Minister shaking his head, so perhaps I misheard him. If I misheard him, I apologise. Clearly it may not increase net borrowing, because we have a corresponding asset-the Irish obligation to repay-but government borrowing figures are always stated on a gross basis, otherwise they would not be positive at all, because we always have substantial net assets. I thought that there was some confusion about that one phrase that the Minister used, but perhaps he will deal with that in his response. I am grateful to him.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10122146000035"></a>I am very much in favour of the Bill. It seems to me to be absolutely the right measure for two reasons. One reason, which the Government seem rather to dismiss, is that Ireland is a neighbour, a great friend for all the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Bew, set out, and a member of the European Union. I believe in the notion and the value of solidarity among nations, as in other branches of human affairs. I believe in soft power as well as hard power, in friendship and in good will. I believe in the value of these things, in the value of creating and maintaining them and that it is a mistake if you throw them away. That is an important consideration and I shall come, in a moment, to what I think of the Government's attitude on that subject.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10122146000036"></a>Secondly, I approve for the reasons that the Government appear to approve of it, which is that we have a very specific, practical and concrete interest in avoiding the kind of systemic crisis which could well be generated by a default by the Irish Government on  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1037"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1037</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its bond and other financial obligations, or, indeed, a default by the Irish banks, which are currently being guaranteed by the Irish Government. One default could well trigger another. Clearly, that would create a very difficult situation for us.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10122146000037"></a>My regret about the Bill, how it has been brought before the two Houses of Parliament and the way in which the whole issue has been conducted by the Government is that the Government have given away a lot of the good will that might have been achieved by this gesture by an extremely grudging approach to this transaction. As my noble friend Lord Liddle pointed out, we deliberately decided that we do not want to be part of a collective solution; we want to do these things individually and bilaterally. The Government's is a rather strange gesture to make, a rather strange signal to send. The Chancellor has been at pains to make clear that he was not responsible for Alistair Darling's agreement that we should join the stability mechanism back in May. Indeed, the Chancellor said in another place:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="10122146000117"></a>"I am doing everything I can to ensure that the UK is extricated from the commitment that was entered into, and we are making good progress".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/12/10; col. 944.]</p>

<p><a name="10122146000112"></a>He said elsewhere in that debate that we will certainly not be part of the permanent mechanism when that is established.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10122146000038"></a>I regret all those things for two reasons. The first is the practical and concrete reason of hard financial national interest; the other relates to my point about good will. In the first instance, there may well be other crises in future. It would be idiotic to exclude the possibility of our need to take part in such support operations in future to avoid some systemic crisis. It is always foolish in life to give up any flexibility. You want to maintain flexibility to respond in different ways. Excluding the idea of being part of a collective mechanism in the EU makes no sense. The other reason, as I said, is that it sends quite the wrong signal, and to my mind reduces the good will created by our decision to support Ireland in this way.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10122146000039"></a>All that reflects an uneasy compromise in the coalition Government. I suspect that the Lib Dems in the Government very much take the view that I take and would have been in favour of this whole operation instinctively on principle in the first place, would then have wanted to negotiate details with our EU partners jointly, and would have had no inhibitions about doing that because they are European partners or members of the eurozone.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10122146000040"></a>I suspect that the advice that the Government received from officials in the Foreign Office was that it would be disastrous, particularly after the centuries of Anglo-Irish history to which my colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Bew, referred-many incidents that are very much to the shame of this country. If we were the only major EU country that declined to take part in the support operation, it would have the most appalling effects on our relationship with Ireland. I imagine that the Foreign Office took that line-at the official level, at least. I imagine that the Treasury and the Bank of England were concerned with the potential systemic crisis and therefore urged the Government to take part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10122146000041"></a>I suspect that, against that, there were the Tories who, for Eurosceptic and chauvinistic ideological reasons, were reluctant to become party to this transaction and were certainly very keen to ensure that it had nothing to do with our European Union membership or the existence of the eurozone.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10122146000042"></a>That uneasy compromise is reflected in the very grudging way in which the money has been advanced and the very grudging statement that I have just cited from the Chancellor, which I very much regret. I am sorry that I cannot come up with entirely effusive, uncompromising congratulations for the Government on this move, but I am glad that they have taken the right decision, however grudgingly, and I shall be delighted to support them if there is a vote on the subject, which I doubt that there will be.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10122146000043"></a>I have a couple of remarks to make about the general context. So much complete nonsense, and dangerous nonsense, has been talked about the relationship between the euro, the banking crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that we have faced over the past year or two that I feel inspired to comment on it in this debate. It has been said openly and frequently in the Eurosceptic press in this country and by a number of Conservatives in the House of Commons that it shows the weakness of the euro system. It has also been suggested that the solution would be the break-up of the euro and that the countries with substantial debt should leave the eurozone. I regard both those comments as either completely incompetent, if people really do not understand what the logical consequences would be of the actions that they are urging, or frankly irresponsible and unpatriotic, because they do not take into account the interests of this country or are willing to sacrifice the interests of the people of this country for purely ideological, emotional or symbolic reasons.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10122146000044"></a>Of course, the euro had nothing whatever to do with the banking crisis or the sovereign debt crisis. In fact, the sovereign debt crisis would almost certainly have been worse if the euro had not existed. I should be the first to admit that the fiscal rules in the Maastricht treaty-the maximum 3 per cent fiscal deficit unless there was the consent of the Union, and so forth-have not been enforced sufficiently strictly. We all know that now, and we need a tougher and tighter regime with proper monitoring and sanctions in future. Nevertheless, if that regime had not existed at all, people would have had even greater deficits. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10122146000045"></a>There was possibly some accounting fraud in the case of Greece, but if there had been no rules, constraints or restrictions at all, the situation would have been a great deal worse. The euro, far from contributing to the crisis, might-albeit too modestly to have greatly affected the outcome-have had a benign influence. As for the idea that the solution lies in breaking up the euro, my noble friend Lord Liddle has already commented on that. I thoroughly agree with him that that would be an astonishingly self-destructive, and therefore I say advisedly irresponsible and unpatriotic, view.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10122146000046"></a>Undoubtedly, if the countries that are affected by the sovereign debt crisis-Spain, Ireland, Portugal or Greece- were to leave the euro, their currencies, whatever they might be, the successor drachma or punt No. 2, would  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1039"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1039</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suffer the most tremendous devaluation. As their liabilities are largely denominated in euros, they would find it completely impossible even to begin to meet the burden of that indebtedness. The result would be defaults or a massive restructuring that was far greater than any restructuring that might take place in an orderly fashion in the context of agreement within the EU or the eurozone. That would mean that our banks would have to write off substantial assets, reduce the size of their balance sheets and reduce their credit creation in this country; that the economy would suffer; that jobs would be lost; and so forth. That would be a deeply regrettable state of affairs and it is thoroughly irresponsible to wish that to happen.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10122146000047"></a>I trust that people will be guided by a rational assessment of the national interest rather than by an emotional desire to see the eurozone collapse irrespective of the consequence for either our partners in the eurozone or us. There is no doubt that the euro is not a part of this crisis. It is not a part of the problem and it is not a contributor to the problem. It has been at least a minor reducer of the scale of the problem. It must be an essential part of the solution.</p>

It reminds me of when I went to Brussels and the European Commission told me that absolute disaster was going to follow when the rouble broke up into individual countries. The Commission sounded just like the noble Lord. However, let us leave that aside.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10122146000049"></a>The noble Lord slightly overstated his case. Does he not think that the convergence of bond yields within the eurozone was a contributor to what happened, because the bond markets ceased to look at countries individually and the convergence of yields encouraged countries to spend too much and to borrow too much? The failure of the markets to distinguish between countries and that convergence of bond yields, which came from the view that Germany would ultimately bail out the other countries, was a contributing factor.</p>

I should say that I was a banker myself and sat on the board of a bank, Morgan Grenfell, which had a considerable lending book as well as being an investment bank at the time, and frequently sat on the credit committee meetings we had. I am appalled by the mistakes made by professional bankers in not wanting to look at the nature and unravel the packages of a class of asset-securitised debt packages, essentially, which were becoming very important as a class of their assets. I equally quite agree with the noble Lord that the bond markets were failing to price risk correctly in exactly the way that he describes. The rating agencies bear a tremendous part of the failings, the fault and the guilt for creating this crisis. Many bankers' excuse is, "We thought we were buying paper with an AAA credit rating and in fact the credit agencies weren't doing their job properly in unravelling these packages and seeing that what was in them was absolutely rubbish".</p>

The noble Lord may feel that the result of that might not have been entirely unfortunate for the future history of the country. Nevertheless, we would have done, and the counterpart to that would have been that we would have had lower nominal and real interest rates throughout that period. I happen to think that that would have been a good thing as well.</p>

I do not believe that there is any virtue in the fluctuation of exchange rates. I believe that exchange rate markets, like other asset markets, fluctuate quite irrationally. They swing far too far, an enormous amount of damage is created, they are never at the theoretical point of equilibrium which some people read about in their textbooks 50 years ago and enormous economic costs are caused by these fluctuations. If you can replace them with a stable currency system, as we did before 1914 with gold, as the eurozone has done, as the United States has done with the dollar and so forth, that is a very good idea, all other things being equal. We can get into the "all other things being equal" on another occasion perhaps. I think that if you take the long 20-year view, Greece, Ireland and Spain have all benefited enormously from their membership of the European Union and the eurozone, and that will continue to be the case. We now have a momentary crisis, which looks very grim at present, but we should not throw the baby out with the bath-water.</p>

I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, that it was grudging or anything of that nature. I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bew, that the Irish reaction has shown that they recognise that this was done in a full-hearted and generous fashion, and I am very pleased about that. It was done without strings, it was done quickly and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was quite right to emphasise that it was done in the British interest. Britain and Ireland are two neighbouring countries, their economies are very much bound up with each other, what is good for Ireland in terms of prosperity is good for Britain, and it is right that this should be recognised. Others have spoken of the extent to which Ireland is a major export market, of the way that the economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic are very much bound together, of the number of British companies that operate in the Republic and, of course, of the exposure of British banks, especially the Royal Bank of Scotland, to the Irish financial sector. In helping Ireland, the Government are not diverting money from worthy causes in the United Kingdom, but are acting to safeguard British jobs, British interests and British taxpayers' money. The sooner Ireland can return to prosperity, the better for us that will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10122146000058"></a>I got the impression, but perhaps I am wrong, that the Minister felt that the measures that have been taken would secure that. I hope he is right, but I have to say that I am not so sure. I feel that further pain may be on the way and that some of the pain may be felt by private lenders. That remains to be seen, and I certainly hope that the measures taken by us and by the other participants in the rescue operation have the desired effect. Like the noble Lord, Lord Bew, I see this very much in the context of the Anglo-Irish relationship, both present day and historical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10122146000059"></a>There are some who suggest-it may even be that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, will express this view-that because Ireland is a member of the eurozone, and we are not, we should somehow stand aloof from it. I think that is absurd. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as well as the Minister this evening, have repeatedly said that it is in Britain's interest that the eurozone should be a success. Of course, that does not mean that we have the same responsibilities towards each other as the members of the eurozone, but it does mean that we should recognise the nature of our links with it and the existence of our exposure to it. We are not an offshore island in that sense with a financial system separate and distinct from that of our European neighbours. The whole apparatus of British financial services and the City of London as a great international centre are intimately bound up in the wider European financial system. They are, of course, intimately bound up in the global financial system, but most intimately and most directly they are bound up within the European, and through the European, in the global financial system. The two are not mutually inconsistent. This has been a great source of profit to the United Kingdom. It continues to be so, and Mayor Boris Johnson never ceases to point out the benefits that derive to London as well as to the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10122146000060"></a>It is very much in our interest that we should participate, but I part company from the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, so far as the permanent mechanism is concerned, and I find myself much closer to the position of the Minister. As I said, we do not have the same obligations and responsibilities to the members of the eurozone as they have to each other, so I feel it is right for us not to sign up to something that would involve us in a permanent obligation. I do not mean by that that we would necessarily wish to stand apart on some future occasion. We might, or we might not. I felt that the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, drew too much on the Irish example. Our relationship with Ireland is quite different from our relationship with any other European country. However, I can well imagine that circumstances might arise-</p>

We might have the opportunity to come in later on to a deal that has already been put together by others or to try to find some bilateral solution in the face of a much bigger multinational arrangement, but surely that is not a very sensible way of conducting our country's affairs.</p>

He draws too clear a distinction between membership and non-membership. I do not want to get diverted, as others have, from the main theme of my speech, but I think that Britain is a substantial member of the European Union. Therefore, conversations do not take place in one room with Britain being excluded entirely. People need to know what Britain is thinking and there has to be a certain interchange.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10122146000063"></a>There are people who thought that if we did not join the euro, we would somehow be excluded from a lot of discussions. There are certainly discussions in which we do not take part and it may be that Ministers are rather relieved sometimes that they do not have to. But Britain is too big an entity to be entirely excluded and only brought in at the end of the discussion when everything has been decided. If Britain is to play a role in a future crisis, people will want to know beforehand what our attitude is likely to be, how far we might be able to go and under what terms we might be able to participate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10122146000064"></a>That brings me back to my line of march. When perhaps future problems arise, we should look at each of them and take a decision on their merits-certainly recognising our considerable interests in the eurozone; certainly recognising the importance of our membership of the European Union; and certainly recognising our interests in the political stability of different countries. But we should look at these things on their merits, decide our position on each one as it comes along and ensure that the decisions we take are subject to parliamentary approval. We are much more likely to carry confidence in the country and have support from

He has shown that over the years in many of his contributions to the European debate. But what is being ignored is the point that came out in the Bank of England report from which I quoted; that is, the interconnectedness of our banking systems. Although it may not be the case that British banks have a lot of sovereign debt in Greece, Portugal and Spain, they have a lot of relationships with French and German banks, which have those obligations. Therefore, we would be inextricably bound up if there was a crisis. We should be trying to take a lead in sorting this out, not waiting for the telephone call from Mrs Merkel.</p>

Perhaps I might refer to his former distinguished leader, Gordon Brown. We were not of course part of the eurozone, but, as the noble Lord says, our financial centre is intimately bound up with the rest of Europe. It is a considerable interest of ours. It is a source of profit and a great many things.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10122146000067"></a>When the crisis hit, and the Lehmann Brothers went down in the September, the fact that we were not part of the eurozone did not stop President Sarkozy calling Gordon Brown over to Paris or stop Gordon Brown playing a considerable role in the decisions which were taken. We are not going to have a situation in the European Union where a country as big as this, and as significant as this, is in one place and everyone else is huddled in another, and they do not talk until they have made up their mind. They need to know what we think, they need to know what terms we would come in on and they need to know whether we would be willing to help at one level or at another level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10122146000068"></a>Of course, I recognise our interconnectedness. Like the noble Lord, I have devoted a good deal of my life to trying to make the interconnectedness greater. But I do not think that if we are not members of the eurozone, we ought to sign up to something which carries with it the automaticity of the permanent mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10122146000069"></a>I do not entirely expect the Minister to make a comment on my final point. What goes around comes around.

<a name="10122146000071"></a><b><a name="101221-0002.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="10122146000155"></a>Lord Pearson of Rannoch:</b> My Lords, I start by confirming the clear illegality of bailing out the eurozone, which includes these loans to Ireland. I do so by quoting the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, from two days ago. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="10122146000118"></a>"We violated all the rules because we wanted to close ranks and really rescue the euro zone. The Treaty of Lisbon was very straight-forward. No bailout".</p>

<p><a name="10122146000113"></a>She went on to add that the Greek and Irish rescues, as well as the creation of the bailout funds, are,</p>
<ul><a name="10122146000121"></a>"major transgressions of the treaty".</ul>
<p><a name="10122146000114"></a>Perhaps I may ask Her Majesty's Government whether they agree with her.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10122146000072"></a>The fact that what it is doing is illegal has never stopped or troubled the EU juggernaut. I have previously regaled your Lordships with its illegal use of Article 308 of the treaty of Nice. Students of the history of the eventual collapse of the European Union may care to look up a summary of that abuse in our debates on the Lisbon treaty at col. 1073 on 18 June 2008. More recently, we have the EU's legislation on hedge funds-the alternative investment fund managers directive-which is designed to do much damage to the City of London and hence our tax base. That directive depends for its legal base on Article 53.1 of Lisbon, which is about the mutual recognition of diplomas. Can you believe it?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10122146000073"></a>There is no point in appealing to the Luxembourg Court about any of this because it is not a court of law at all. It is merely the engine of the treaties, as it has often proved in the past. Even so, history suggests that trouble lies ahead when a regime is free to break its own laws with impunity; when it is supported by a puppet court and Parliament; and when its people are powerless to remove it.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10122146000074"></a>I have a couple of questions that were not answered by the Government yesterday in our debate on last week's European Council. The first came somewhat surprisingly and most welcomely from the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on the opposition Front Bench. He reminded the Prime Minister of his promise that, if he got any chance of reopening the Lisbon treaty and having a referendum on it, he would take it. The Prime Minister also promised that we would take the first opportunity to repatriate powers to this country, especially social and labour policy, but he has broken that promise, too. Will the noble Lord explain that behaviour today?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10122146000075"></a>The second unanswered question yesterday came from me. It was on whether the Government have made any estimation of the cost for Ireland and in due course, no doubt, for Portugal, Greece, Spain, Italy and Belgium to return to their national currencies. What would the cost be? The Government tried to say that this would not be a decision that would affect the United Kingdom, so they refused to answer the question, as they have done in their response to a Written Question. But of course such a decision would affect us, because Ireland and the other countries could devalue their currencies and fix their own interest rates and then have a sporting chance of trading their way out of their present impossible situation. That would  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1045"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1045</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mean that we would no longer have to go on pouring billions down the hopeless euro drain, so we are interested in at least knowing the cost involved. Perhaps we could even help them with it. That might be a tremendous bargain, especially as the Government made it clear yesterday and again today that they do not at all rule out sending even more colossal sums to the other countries that I have mentioned. Therefore, I look forward to hearing the answer today.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10122146000076"></a>The Government keep making great play of our trade with the eurozone and with Ireland in particular. It is to safeguard this trade, they say, that we have to borrow such huge sums, which we probably will not get back, when we are cutting our own services at home in an attempt to reduce our deficit and debt. The Minister said in his opening remarks that 5 per cent of our total exports go to Ireland, but do the Government realise that only about 1 per cent of our GDP-of our total economy-goes in trade with Ireland? That is because only 9 per cent of our GDP goes in trade, in deficit, with the EU overall, of which Ireland accounts for about 10 per cent, so that makes 10 per cent of 9 per cent, or 1 per cent to be generous. Then 11 per cent of our GDP goes to the rest of the world, in surplus, and 80 per cent stays right here in the domestic economy. Yet the wonderful deal that we have done as a member of the EU means that Brussels diktats apply to and strangle the whole 100 per cent of our economy. Would the Government care to justify this position? Why is it worth borrowing so much money to safeguard only 1 per cent of our GDP, which would not be lost if we did not? Are we really saying that we would lose all that trade if we did not do this? It is not realistic.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10122146000077"></a>The Government and the Martians in Brussels talk much about growth, how they are stimulating growth and how their bailouts and loans will help it along. Every now and again, I read the Government's Written Statements about the meetings of the so-called Competition Council in Brussels and I must say that they make me weep. I have yet to detect any bureaucrat or council member contributing to those meetings who has the slightest experience of international competition in the real world. That is no doubt why they and their colleagues in the vast bureaucracy of Brussels have lumbered us with perhaps the most overregulated and least competitive regime in the world. Indeed, even their own Competition Commissioner, Mr Gunter Verheugen, said a couple of years ago that EU overregulation was costing all EU economies some 6 per cent of GDP, or over £60 billion per annum in our case. Just to be jolly, the demographic trend is moving against the continent of Europe as well, so I do not see much hope for growth. I fear that we are on the "Titanic".</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10122146000078"></a>It is not just wild-eyed Eurosceptics like me who are saying that the euro cannot survive and that the sooner it goes, the better. Just yesterday, the head of the world's largest bond fund called on Greece, Ireland and Portugal to leave the euro and restructure their debts, unless the eurozone is to submit to complete fiscal union, which seems unlikely. He went on to say that EU leaders were too quick to congratulate themselves on saving the euro last week, with a permanent bailout  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1046"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1046</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fund from 2013, which in his view comes far too late. But the EU strategy of forcing heavily indebted countries to undergo draconian fiscal austerity without offsetting stimulus is unworkable. The austerity policies are stifling the growth that is needed to stabilise debt levels. He is not alone in that. The chief European economist at RBS says that last week's Europe summit failed to grasp the nettle:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="10122146000119"></a>"None of the policy responses put in place in Europe since the start of the crisis provides a credible backstop to prevent further contagion".</p>

<p><a name="10122146000115"></a>Those policy responses include our loans to Ireland. We should not be making them.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10122146000079"></a>It is not just the euro that was designed for disaster; so was the whole project of European integration, for which the euro was supposed to be the cement to hold it together. The idea behind the great project was honourable enough, but it has turned out to be misguided. That idea was that the nation states had been responsible for the bloodshed of two world wars and the long history of carnage in Europe. Those nation states therefore had to be emasculated and diluted into a new form of supranational government, run by bureaucrats. That is the big idea. That is why the Commission still has the monopoly of proposing and enforcing EU laws, which I remind noble Lords are made in secret. It is why there is a sham Parliament and a sham court, with all of their denizens interested only in the gravy train which rolls on without the consent of the people.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10122146000080"></a>If there is one small candle of light in all this gloom, I hope that it is that more of the people of Europe will come to see that the whole EU project is also misguided. Those who are suffering from the euro are already getting very angry. The riots and strikes in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are entirely caused by the project of European integration and its misguided currency and, alas, there is more to come.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10122146000081"></a>In conclusion, I invite your Lordships to stand back for just a moment and consider a Europe without the European Union, without Brussels and Strasbourg, without the Luxembourg Court of so-called Justice. Consider a Europe of 27 national democracies trading freely among themselves and with the other 190 or so countries of the world, none of which has been foolish to join anything like the EU or the euro. What benefit does the EU bring that we could not have through genuine democracy, free trade and friendly collaboration? None, I submit. I hope that none of your Lordships will suggest peace, which was secured by NATO, and for which the EU gets no credit at all. So the EU emperor has no clothes and the quicker the people of Europe realise it, the better for all of us. If the collapse of the euro helps them to do so, that may yet prove to be a blessing in disguise. In the mean time, we should not be helping to prop it up.</p>

For many years, we have had very solid social contacts, and there is a part of my former

When the 2001 election was put off until June due to the foot and mouth outbreak, I was advised to go and knock on a number of doors in Donegal to shore up my support, but I felt that my majority was big enough that I did not have to cross the Irish Sea, which proved to be the case. So these social contacts are very important. There have been many fine Irish men and women living in my community for many years, a lot of whom fought with the British Army in the Second World War. They adapted to and assimilated the culture of the UK, notwithstanding the problems existing at a wider level between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10122155000002"></a>In its latest manifestation, we see the concept of a private debt crisis being transferred to a sovereign debt crisis. To repeat a phrase that has been used a lot in the other place, we are all in this together. That is because what is happening in Ireland affects every other country in the EU, including ourselves here in the UK. The situation is that the banks in Ireland have brought that country to the verge of bankruptcy. The tensions in Ireland that were mentioned earlier have been experienced in other countries. Ireland itself is contributing €17.5 billion from its pension funds to the very important €67 billion bailout, so the people of Ireland are already saying, "It is our money. We are contributing to this. The problem started off in the banks, but as a result of that situation, it has ended up on the streets".</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10122155000003"></a>We all have a responsibility to ensure that we manage this economic process well, taking account of the social instabilities, so that we end up with a sound economic system and a stable social system. As was said earlier, there are good reasons for the UK to provide the loan, not least of which is the fact that Ireland is a major trading partner and that UK banks are exposed in Ireland. Only last week, Lloyds and HBOS declared a £4.3 billion loss on the banking group's Irish loans. Lloyds said that it had sufficient capital to withstand the loss, but that situation is an illustration of the interdependence that exists between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10122155000004"></a>As a former Minister for Northern Ireland, I am very much aware of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic-it is so porous that it really is not a border. I well remember chairing an inquiry into the euro in 2002, when I chaired the Treasury Select Committee. One of our visits was to Newry, where the currency in use included the euro because people were travelling there from across the border. That interlink between Northern Ireland and the Republic should make certain that we provide a friend in need with a loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10122155000005"></a>If instead of doing that we were to sit on our hands, economic stagnation would take place. We need a strong Europe if we are to make the most of our competitive exchange rate. That is what the Bank of England said.

Indeed, Her Majesty's Opposition support the measure that the Minister has introduced, which means that he can bask in the general approval of the House for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10122155000007"></a>However, the Minister would not expect to sit through an hour and a half's debate without having to reply to a few questions. He would not expect an entirely straightforward ride. I am glad that tonight's debate has ranged so widely and that we have heard so many expert and considered opinions. The Minister will have a tough job in responding to it. The debate has put the Bill and the Irish loan into context, and for that we should be grateful.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10122155000008"></a>Indeed, I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bew, who put our relationship with Ireland into an historic context. Other noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord McFall, emphasised the ties between the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is right that we should come to the aid of a nation in great need with which we have close ties and, as the Minister said in his opening remarks, that is also in the British national self-interest. It is important that we put a stop to the catastrophic developments that have set the world back during the past two to three years. Unless those are tackled in a forthright and effective fashion, they will adversely affect our own people in the years to come.</p>

We see the price that has to be paid for the loan. It is also important to recognise that, given the degree of interconnectedness of our economies, the British response to the situation needs to be one of concern for our neighbours. We have already heard of the significant role that the Irish economy plays in relation to the British economy, but, in terms of a wider Europe, we recognise that without growth in Europe there is no possibility of the British economy developing on an export-led basis out of the present position and into a degree of prosperity and security. We should recognise just how much this Government have invested in such a strategy and that, without growth in Europe, there is no possibility of the British people being able to enjoy the fruits of the sacrifices that we can see are being made on all sides following the Government's fiscal tightening, of which we have seen only the first stages.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10122155000010"></a>The Minister must also respond to the wider debate reflected in the points made by my noble friend Lord Liddle and, from a different perspective, by my noble friend Lord Davies of Stamford. As regards the different issues that the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, mentioned, we recognise that there was a sophisticated debate about the nature in which Britain should relate to Europe-two somewhat different perspectives about future possibilities. I must say that Her Majesty's Opposition are more in favour of the analysis put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat-namely, that of course Britain must be close to Europe and integrate with Europe in crucial economic decisions. That is bound to be the case as a result of the sheer size of the British economy in relation to the European position and the levels of trade that we carry on.

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10122155000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, takes that point to the outer extreme by calling for withdrawal from the EU. We are all familiar with the onslaught on the European Community that he has presented tonight with his usual fervour. It is as though he does not recognise that the American economy, which is bigger than Europe's, has been in colossal trouble over the past couple of years. It is as though only Europe is being faced by these challenges. Of course, that is not so. Another big, major continental economy-the United States-has been suffering the most acute strains. One does not have to go anywhere near Detroit or any of the other major cities-</p>

We are talking about an economy in Europe that is receiving some assistance-that is the Irish economy. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is not forecasting that it will not be long before the British are bailing out the German economy, or anything as ridiculous as that.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10122155000014"></a>Given that many great economies have suffered serious difficulties in the past few years, we should recognise that this Irish crisis is reflective of a global crisis. The problem means that we have to have solutions wider than the national perspective. It also means that the solution proposed for Ireland is not in fact a solution but a bailout. The bailout creates time for the Irish economy and prevents it from descending into the abyss that it had faced. However, let us not pretend that the package is a solution to the needs of the Irish economy and the Irish people or that we will see health in European economies without more obvious programmes and developments on a more extensive scale than we have seen thus far.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10122155000015"></a>I hope that the Minister will recognise that, in the early days of the crisis when Lehman Brothers was in collapse and when the British banks were under tremendous pressure, the previous Administration adopted a global process in response. The then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was concerned to obtain a degree of consensus that would enable the world economies to come to each other's aid and to present a development that gave some security about growth. We are still looking for that. The Bill is important to one beleaguered economy in Europe but-as the strength of the debate on all sides has shown-it has to be put in the context that we need wider solutions to the issues than bailouts. We are faced with a global crisis.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10122155000016"></a>It is also quite clear that, despite the myth which the Opposition seeks to perpetrate about the British economy, the crisis was not caused by government overspending but by the banks, which had got their structures and investment wrong. That is a common feature across all the significant world economies, and that needs to be recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10122155000017"></a>The Irish are of course to be involved in some degree of austerity, as are the British people under this Government's perspective-excessive austerity in the view of Her Majesty's Opposition in comparison to what is needed. The Government have set a limited time in which fiscal balance has to be achieved, but it must surely be recognised that austerity alone is not the answer. After all, the Irish have been through several years of austerity and for 17 continuous months their economy showed negative growth, but they have not been able to avoid the need for a bailout despite the fact that they have been subjected to exactly the fiscal solutions that this Government suggest are the answer for this economy.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10122155000018"></a>I have one or two key questions for the Minister, who I know will enjoy himself before Christmas only if there is sufficient challenge in the debate. He has already been blessed by the consensual approach, on which the whole House is to be congratulated, but I should like to ask him one or two questions. First, is he aware that the size of the UK's contribution to the rescue package will, over the spending review period, more than outweigh the debt interest savings of which the Chancellor made such play in the spending review Statement? On the basis of the Chancellor's approach, we are loaning that which we have saved. Secondly, why are we able to find billions for Ireland but could not afford £90 million of strategic investment for Sheffield Forgemasters and the role that it could play in the future of our economy? Thirdly, when will the Government accept the obvious point that, unless we have an approach to the broader issues faced by Europe, we will not get the growth necessary because the markets will not be there to purchase the goods that we hope to produce?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10122155000019"></a>Finally, does not the crisis in Ireland remind us all that the economic crisis was global and that the Government, with their full responsibility for the economy and the welfare of the British people, must recognise that the solutions lie only within a global framework and not in one pursued alone?</p>

However, his comments then turned in a different direction. He went into an  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1051"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1051</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>analysis of the UK's economic challenges-an essay that I do not quite share with him-and then he asked some questions. I shall attempt to respond to his questions and to those of other noble Lords.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10122155000024"></a>The starting point, clearly, is that over the past two years Ireland has faced a series of extraordinarily difficult economic and financial challenges which have resulted in the country having debts of more than 90 per cent of its national income, high unemployment and low levels of growth-and the Irish economy, of course, remains on the brink.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10122155000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reminded us of the centrality of the Irish banking situation to the Irish crisis and how the Irish banks became increasingly reliant on central bank funding. In his analysis, the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, referred to trading but made no mention of the interconnectedness of our two banking systems, which is central to the Irish problem and to why it is so important to the UK that we should contribute to finding a solution.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10122155000026"></a>In contrast to Britain's situation, Ireland's credit rating remains under threat and its economy continues to struggle. The package we are discussing today is designed to contribute towards Ireland's solution to its problem. It starts by contributing to the recapitalisation of Ireland's banks; sets up a contingency reserve to deal with any future problems; and covers the current shortfall in the Irish budget. My noble friend Lord Tugendhat quite rightly questioned whether Ireland will grow sufficiently out of its problems. However, I remind noble Lords that the IMF has been central to the construction of the package and, from its wide experience of similar situations, it understands the importance of growth in an economy such as Ireland's. I recommend to noble Lords the IMF's interesting, well written and cogent analysis of the reasons for Ireland getting into this situation, and the logic for the construction of the package which is central to putting the Irish economy back on its feet.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10122155000027"></a>The Bill gives the Treasury the statutory authority to deliver the UK's bilateral contribution to the package. In this way, the UK will be ready in the new year to help one of our closest international partners in its hour of need. I was particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bew, and to my noble friends Lord Cope of Berkeley and Lord Tugendhat for pointing out the good will that has been created in Ireland by our response. We are doing this because it is in the economic interests of the UK to do so; nevertheless, it is good that we are doing it for a close friend. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, succinctly put the matter into its Irish historical context. I very much take his point that we need to think about how we build on the good will that has now been created. That point was indirectly touched on by the noble Lord, Lord McFall. It sits somewhat at odds with the stance taken by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, who painted a picture that I do not recognise. He tried to paint us into an "our problems, their problems" situation. I thought that my noble friend Lord Tugendhat, who has deep and distinguished European experience and contributions to draw on, painted a much more nuanced and balanced picture. Of course, we are at the centre of the European debate. We are engaged with our European partners,  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1052"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1052</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not least for the reason that my noble friend gave: that we are one of the largest economies in Europe. Whether it is leading the way on bank stress tests and getting Europe to follow where the UK started on short-term stabilisation, or looking at the other end of the range of issues that needs now to be considered-for example, questions about structural reform programmes, the Europe 2020 vision and the lessons of this crisis-the UK is absolutely at the centre of the discussions.</p>

<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="10122155000028"></a><b><a name="101221-0002.htm_spnew33"></a><a name="10122155000076"></a>Lord Liddle:</b> What plan have the British Government and the Prime Minister put forward for the eurozone? Why does the Prime Minister keep saying that it is for the eurozone to sort out its problems, while knowing that so much of the growth that is being forecast, which is absolutely essential to British interests and his own prospects of re-election, requires there to be robust export growth to the eurozone?</p>

<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="10122155000029"></a><b><a name="101221-0002.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="10122155000077"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> These are all factors that mean that we need, with the EU 27, to make sure that the structural reforms are driven through and that we get the benefits of completing the single market project and so on. However, my noble friend Lord Tugendhat again got it exactly right-I would not agree with every nuance of his analysis, but he got the essential point right-in saying that just because we are very positively engaged at the centre of all those other issues does not mean that there are not critical differences, because we are not part of the eurozone and this Government will not take us into it. It is therefore for the eurozone to sort out its own permanent mechanism for dealing with any other issues that arise out of membership of the euro. That is the fundamental difference between the UK's position and that of other of our partners in Europe. I genuinely fail to see why the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, seeks to paint the position in such stark colours. The fact is that we are in a different position from that of a number of the largest trading partners in Europe, which needs to be reflected in the permanent arrangements that will be put in place. My noble friend Lord Tugendhat explained that in much more masterly terms than I will ever be able to do.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10122155000030"></a>Some questions were asked about the economic and market analysis of the situation, not only of how we got here but how we go forward. I listened with interest to the exchange between the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, and my noble friend Lord Lamont of Lerwick. The rather succinct and pithy remarks of my noble friend better encapsulated the situation in which Europe finds itself and in which it is clear that the fact of the euro cannot be ignored. That takes us back to why the eurozone needs to think about the consequences and the lessons of this crisis for a permanent mechanism.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10122155000031"></a>In answer to the specific question of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, I restate that the loan to Ireland does not add to our deficit. It increases the borrowing on one side of the UK's balance sheet, but we have an asset in terms of the money that will be owed to us by Ireland. There will be an increment to the fiscal position by the net interest margin, estimated at current interest rates to be some £440 million. That is the only element that should go through the current balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10122155000032"></a>One or two comments were made on the process of the Bill. I am grateful to my noble friends Lord Cope of Berkeley and Lord Tugendhat for their endorsement and recognition of the fast-track approach that we have taken. It is necessary that we give confidence to our European partners and the IMF in putting this package together that the UK is ready at the earliest time to deliver on our commitments. I accept my noble friend Lord Cope's analysis of the constitutional position in another place.</p>

I understand that he is saying that it does not add to the fiscal deficit because he is setting off one financial asset against a financial liability. Will he confirm, however, that it will add to the public sector borrowing requirement? Some £2.5 billion will have to be borrowed on the financial markets and be accounted for as part of the public sector borrowing requirement which otherwise would not.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10122155000035"></a>I have already said why the Government believe that it is right that we should not be part of a permanent bailout mechanism-indeed, this is recognised in the recent Council conclusions. My noble friend Lord Newby asked about the process for adopting the treaty amendment that will be necessary. Parliament must of course give its approval to any treaty change that is agreed by member states, and ratification in the UK will be subject to the terms of the EU Bill that we are bringing forward. A treaty change will be subject to primary legislation. Since there is no question of transfer of competences in this case, the question of a referendum does not arise.</p>

Why does he not do that?</p>

There is no question of change of competencies in this case and therefore no referendum is required, but it will be the subject of primary legislation. This is not the time, if the noble Lord will permit me to say so, to start talking about other things that may or not may not be done in our relationship with Europe. We are talking about the Loans to Ireland Bill and its consequences and the position is completely clear. If the noble Lord would like me to give way, it will only eat into the time to answer his questions and other points that noble Lords have made. I am grateful to him.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10122155000038"></a>I will come to his points immediately. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, questioned the legality of this operation. The first thing that I hope we are completely  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1054"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1054</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clear about is that the bilateral loan is being made under domestic UK legislation. That is why we are here today. Provided that your Lordships see fit to give this Bill a clean passage, the question of the legality of this loan will not arise.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10122155000039"></a>If the noble Lord was also, as I suspect he was, harking back to the question of the so-called no-bailout provision in Article 122(2) and the creation of the €60 billion fund, that was agreed by the previous Government. We said at the time that we did not approve of the use of this provision, which was originally intended for natural disasters, to create this mechanism. But it was, and we are where we are. The critical thing is that the current coalition Government have a clear commitment that when in 2013 the new mechanism is put in place this will fall away and not be used again. The question of illegality does not arise. It may be regrettable, but the position is legal.</p>

Surely, the decision was taken under Article 122(2) which is by qualified majority vote. That is the very reason the Eurocrats chose the clause that allows mutual support in the event of natural disasters to pass this Act. Through our membership of the European Union and the terms of the treaties that we have signed, there was nothing that the previous Government could do about it. I asked the Minister whether he agreed with the French Finance Minister who said that the whole bailout process is illegal.</p>

If he wished to correspond with her I am sure she would explain her position. All I can do is explain the Government's position. I was not trying to be unfair to the previous Government but merely stating the facts of the situation as to when the €60 billion bailout fund was agreed. Yes, I accept that if the UK had opposed it, it would have been a matter dealt with under qualified majority voting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10122155000042"></a>I will spend one minute responding to points made by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. I am grateful to him for being clear about the Official Opposition's support for the Bill. He asked about the amount of the loan and why, if we could devote this amount of money to Ireland, we could not devote it to other causes. He quoted one possible use of funds. As I explained, the loan to Ireland does not affect the fiscal position. We are able to make it without in any way affecting the fiscal position. If it did affect it, we might need to look for other savings, but we are in a position that that is fortunately not required.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10122155000043"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the global dimension. We have talked a lot about the need for the UK to be at the heart of the European debate on this. I completely agree that the global dimension is an important one. We have heard about the importance of global growth and we will continue to engage with the G20 and the other international forums which will reinforce the ongoing drive to make sure that we learn all the lessons on fiscal and financial stability.</p>

The financial crisis has shown just how closely linked the economies of Europe and the world have become. In times of prosperity we reap the rewards but in times of hardship, one nation's problems can quickly extend beyond its own borders. That is why we must act now and early to restore stability to Ireland's economy. That is why we must be prepared and have been prepared to take the necessary steps including through the Bill. It is good for the recovery and good for growth and I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10122155000049"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that CMEC is a relatively new body-a crown non-departmental public body-created by primary legislation in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act just two years ago. It was then the subject of considerable debate. Accepting its demise via the process in this Bill therefore needs considerable justification.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10122155000050"></a>CMEC was charged with completing the operational improvement plan and to carry out a fundamental redesign of the child maintenance system. The operational improvement plan was part of a twin-track approach to radically improve the performance of the Child Support Agency.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10122155000051"></a>The CSA was established in 1993 to assess, collect and enforce child maintenance payments from non-resident parents. It was set up because the system of collecting maintenance through the courts was perceived as failing to establish fair and consistent awards which  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1056"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1056</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were not necessarily kept up to date or indeed enforced. Despite the best efforts of CSA staff, the complicated calculation process, IT failures and inadequate enforcement contributed to poor performance and unacceptable outcomes for children.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10122155000052"></a>The CSA struggled to administer the complex rules in the child maintenance system and to handle the difficult and emotional circumstances that often surround parents when child maintenance becomes an issue. It was widely seen as a means of clawing back benefit rather than providing additional resources for children. Reforms in 2000 brought some simplification to the maintenance calculation. The introduction of a child maintenance premium where those in receipt of benefit kept some of the maintenance payments was a positive development. However, the changes still did not deliver the improvements expected. In particular, there were chronic problems with the IT and operational systems, which meant that old scheme cases could not be transferred to the new, simplified system.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10122155000053"></a>Again, the result was that too many children did not receive the benefit of maintenance, which led to the approach of a three-year operational improvement plan, and the call for a longer term redesign of the child maintenance system. The latter was the subject of a report commissioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hutton, when he was Secretary of State at the DWP, from Sir David Henshaw. Sir David argued that the system's failings reflected both policy and operational problems, and recommended a break with the past to create a new start for child maintenance arrangements. CMEC was to be that new start. It was established with the primary statutory objective of maximising the number of effective maintenance arrangements. This was bolstered by subsidiary objectives of encouraging and supporting voluntary maintenance arrangements and the operation of a statutory scheme.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10122155000054"></a>CMEC is specifically charged with the promotion of raising awareness among parents of the importance of taking responsibility for and making arrangements for child maintenance. It also has a duty to provide information and guidance to parents for the purpose of helping to secure effective maintenance arrangements. Its role is to seek to ensure that all parents who live apart put in place effective arrangements to maintain their children, whether they do this privately, through the courts, or through the statutory service. This is much different from the old CSA, run directly by the DWP, which had only one function-the statutory maintenance service. The enhanced role with a new focus was considered at the time to be best undertaken by a new body, an NDPB, to be led by a commissioner for child maintenance. For certain very practical reasons, the NDPB was set up as a crown body. It was intended to operate at arm's length from government and through its commissioning powers to be able to develop a high-quality and efficient service. Its board would be focused entirely on delivering a successful child maintenance system, not distracted at the top from the shared responsibilities which the very senior managers would have as an executive agency of the DWP.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10122155000055"></a>The timeline for change was planned to span from the launch of CMEC in October 2008 until 2014, when the new unified child maintenance system is  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1057"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1057</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>planned to be fully in place. Major steps have already been completed and these include the setting up of the options service, fulfilling the information and guidance obligation for all parents, the removal of the compulsion for parents with care claiming benefits to use the CSA, implementation from April 2010 of a full maintenance disregard, and the deployment of at least some the new debt and enforcement powers. However, CMEC has just completed its first full year of operation, and the forward programme still shows much to do. In fact, 2011 is the year in which the new basis of calculation is due for introduction with a gradual migration of old cases to the new system until in 2014 when there will be a closure of all existing CSA cases and a unified system in place.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10122155000056"></a>CMEC's business plan for 2010-11 is clear that the current year will be a critical year for CMEC as it moves to the launch of the new system. The options service has, seemingly, made a good start. In its evidence to the DWP Select Committee, CMEC set out its focus on promoting the service to new and separating lone parents. It records how Jobcentre Plus and HMRC refer parents to the service when they claim relevant benefits and tax credits.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10122155000057"></a>There can be little doubt that over the period of the operational improvement plan and since, performance of the CSA has improved despite continuing problems with the CS2 system. Currently, its performance under CMEC is the best it has ever been. The number of children benefiting from statutory maintenance has exceeded 850,000, with more than £1.14 million collected. Uncleared applications, a particular bugbear of the past, have declined by over 90 per cent to under 20,000. Telephony has improved out of all recognition. Running costs have reduced from £600 million to under £500 million a year. Nevertheless, the Select Committee report shows that more remains to be done in terms of collection of arrears and maintenance outcomes.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10122155000058"></a>Unlike most of the other bodies included in this schedule, CMEC is not yet in steady state. It is part way through a programme which will finally lead to the clean break recommended by Sir David Henshaw. As the Work and Pensions Select Committee reported, it will be a challenging phase with the continuing problems with the CS2 IT programme, and the operation of three different maintenance systems through to 2014 when it was planned for there to finally be just one simplified statutory system. So in seeking to understand the decision for CMEC to become an agency of the DWP, I should be grateful if the Minister could answer the following questions.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10122155000059"></a>First, what are the type of clear policy and decision-making responsibilities which Ministers consider they are precluded from taking at present in respect of child maintenance, which drives this approach? Secondly, is there any basic change in policy for the child maintenance system? Is it still planned to proceed with the new system, starting at 2011, with the gradual migration of the old and current systems? Is it envisaged that this process will be completed before the operation becomes an executive agency? Thirdly, will the full disregard for benefits remain and will this apply also for the purposes of the universal credit? Fourthly,  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1058"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1058</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>given that CMEC is currently a crown NDPB, what will its changed status as an agency mean for the staff? Fifthly, given that the decision has already been taken for a transfer to an executive agency, is it considered that being run by DWP will bring operational efficiencies not available to CMEC? If so, what are these, and what evidence base is available to support such a conclusion?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10122155000060"></a>Sixthly, what analysis has been undertaken of the costs involved in any transfer back to the DWP, including novation of supplier contracts, changes to enforcement notifications, et cetera? Are there any VAT ramifications of a transfer, and how does this differ from transfers from non-crown NDPB's? Seventhly, on what grounds is it considered that CMEC fails all the three tests set out by the Minister for the Cabinet Office in October: does it perform a technical function; do its activities require political impartiality; and does it act independently to establish facts? Eighthly, what is the future for the options service under any changed arrangements? Is it not right that considerable effort has gone into branding this service as being at arm's length from government? What assessment has been undertaken of how parents would react to this becoming an executive agency of the DWP? Would any different requirements apply in respect of information sharing-say, income details of non-resident parents for the DWP, in contrast to CMEC as an NDPB?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10122155000061"></a>Fundamentally, on what basis can we be reassured that the switch to an executive agency will neither disrupt the vital work of getting the new maintenance system up and running as quickly as possible? Moreover, will there continue to be a clear focus on improving child maintenance outcomes as an integral part of the challenge of tackling child poverty?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10122155000062"></a>Our anxiety over this issue has been heightened by the most recent briefing note from the IFS covering child and working age poverty. Clearly, progress in improving child maintenance outcomes should contribute positively to reducing child poverty and any disruption to current arrangements need to be examined from this perspective, especially given the IFS report. This analysis makes grim reading. The conclusion is that the coalition Government's reforms have no discernable impact on absolute and relative child poverty in 2011-12, but for 2012-13, the IFS estimates that the Government's reforms will increase relative poverty for children by 100,000 and absolute poverty by 200,000. For 2013-14, it is considered that the reforms will increase relative poverty by about 200,000 children and absolute poverty by 300,000 children. So much for the claim that the Government's reforms will not have a measurable impact on child poverty. They clearly will. What role does the Minister see, therefore, for the child maintenance system in combating child poverty, especially given the shocking figures in the IFS report? I beg to move.</p>

There was a debate recently on the Child Maintenance  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Other Payments Act 2008, which informs a lot of his questions and points. However, I have not heard anything in those arguments that undermines the primary objective of the coalition Government to restore ministerial accountability for child maintenance.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10122163000002"></a>The amendment would remove the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission from the list of bodies to which the Public Bodies Bill applies. The Government's intention is to increase the accountability of Ministers for public services. This amendment would go directly against that intention.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10122163000003"></a>The change of status for CMEC from a non-departmental public body to an executive agency within the DWP is driven by the coalition Government's desire to have greater accountability for the hugely important issue of child maintenance. We feel that it is important to strengthen ministerial accountability when the Government are considering the role that the child maintenance system can play in their overall commitment to support shared parenting and promote parental responsibility.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10122163000004"></a>We acknowledge that CMEC has built a stable base, following on from the success of the operational improvement plan to which the noble Lord referred. As it currently stands, however, with CMEC operating at arm's length from the Government, the Government feel that it does not have the right level of responsibility and ministerial accountability. In order to regain that control, this change in status will make that happen. Removing the commission from Schedule 1 to the Bill would adversely impact on that intention.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10122163000005"></a>There is a long and often painful history of poor performance within the child support system, as the noble Lord pointed out. A simple picture could suggest that the Child Support Agency was a failure and that only the introduction of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission turned performance around. I would like to point out that that is not entirely the case. From 2006 to 2009, the Child Support Agency's operational improvement plan significantly improved the performance of the administration of child maintenance. That was because of the activity taken forward by the Child Support Agency, at that point an agency of the Department for Work and Pensions. Responsibility for child support functions transferred to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission in November 2008, near the end of the period covered by the operational improvement plan.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10122163000006"></a>Since its formation in 2008, CMEC has taken these improvements much further. It has also been given a much broader remit than the CSA ever had. Most notably, it has developed a very effective information and support service, Child Maintenance Options, which has received much praise in dealing sensitively with separating and separated parents. Indeed, the noble Lord endorsed it a few minutes ago. The Government want to maintain and build on the progress that CMEC has already delivered. In response to the noble Lord's question, that is one of the areas where we want to see further progress.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10122163000007"></a>Let me be clear: this is not about scrapping the commission, nor is it about undoing the progress that the commission has made through the hard work and dedication of its people. I can confirm, in answer to  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1060"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1060</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Lord's question in this area, that we are looking to see the progress made and the plans that it has. We are looking closely at our own plans for improving the position in this area.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10122163000008"></a>As the noble Lord said, however, the major reforms that were set out in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 are still to come. The improvements that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has made to date have been despite the inadequacies of its IT infrastructure. The legacy of past problems still casts a long shadow over the administration of the child maintenance system.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10122163000009"></a>The Government believe that it is right-indeed, essential-that Ministers are directly accountable for the significant changes that still need to happen within the child maintenance system, not least the introduction of a new scheme for calculating child maintenance and the associated new IT platform. This Government, in including CMEC in the Bill, are clear that we must avoid reintroducing the well catalogued problems of the past.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10122163000010"></a>To avoid destabilising the organisation at such a critical time, the new executive agency would essentially have the structure and functions of CMEC. The key difference, and the key purpose of this reform, would be the direct accountability and governance lines to Ministers. Many of the questions that the noble Lord raised are answered in that assurance about what will be happening.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10122163000011"></a>I recognise that noble Lords have a keen interest in this matter, given their involvement in the redesign of the child maintenance system in 2006. I am referring, of course, to the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Kirkwood, who, alongside the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, have proposed the amendment.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10122163000012"></a>The independent review undertaken by Sir David Henshaw made some strong recommendations about the steps required to reform child maintenance. However, the review recognised that the issue of whether or not that should be administered in a body positioned at arm's length from the Government was a finely balanced debate. The key argument on which the Government rest our position was the need for a clean break, as it was then called-I think that it was referred to today as some other kind of break, but anyway those are the essential grounds on which the argument was made, in response to the well publicised problems that the CSA had been enduring.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10122163000013"></a>I reiterate that this reform is not about dismantling the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission in its current form. Neither is it about jeopardising the performance improvements that have been made in recent years. It is fundamentally about restoring ministerial leadership and accountability at a time when child maintenance reforms are reaching a critical stage.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10122163000014"></a>I shall pick up one or two of the questions that I have not already dealt with. The implications for staff are relatively few, given the nature of the transfer. What we are trying to do in the universal credit, in terms of information, may become highly relevant here. We still need to look at that; obviously, it is at a very early stage.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1061"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1061</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101221-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10122163000015"></a>We have looked at costs overall as part of SR10. We are determined that, in undertaking the transfer, we do not divert attention away from the need to get systems up and running. Clearly, this area is vital in tackling child poverty. Family breakdown is one of the main drivers of child poverty. We are determined to move forward on this and maintain targets. As the noble Lord will know, the introduction of the universal credit will have a powerful impact on child poverty. That is not yet included in the IFS calculations, although I imagine that it is working on that. We will be looking closely at other ways of ensuring that we stem the problems arising from family breakdown. Given all this, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I have no intention of pressing this amendment, as I tabled it in order to seek information. I am comforted by what he said about the progress and planned progress of the child maintenance system and that it is still the objective to try to introduce the new basis of calculation next year and the systems that will support that. I understand that it is intended that all the CSA cases will eventually migrate to the new system by 2014.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10122163000017"></a>However, I am still a little mystified by this issue of ministerial accountability, as there is accountability to Parliament through the Secretary of State. I am a little curious as to what difference the measure would make for Ministers in practice, as for most, if not all, NDPBs there is a way for Ministers to engage and influence. A framework agreement defines not only the financing of NDPBs but their governance arrangements and their relationship with Ministers, so the argument that the Government are switching just to achieve that purpose is a little thin.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10122163000018"></a>I wish to make it clear that I certainly do not contend that improvements came about only once CMEC came into being. Improvements were made under the operational improvement plan before CMEC came into being. I certainly assert-I think that the Minister agreed with this-that CMEC has carried that on and has made continuing progress, although matters still remain to be resolved. I am comforted by the fact that this will not be done in a way that would disrupt the progress that has been made and disrupt the introduction of the new systems.</p>

As he may know from his briefing, that structure was that there was a chief executive, who reported quarterly or at six-month intervals to the Minister, supported by an advisory board and shadowed, so to speak, by a policy directorate within the department-a grade 5 and above that a grade 3-who would, so to speak, act as the interface between the policy development and the operational work done by the CSA, headed by its chief executive.

There is direct accountability for what is happening across these Dispatch Boxes and, of course, those in another place. We think that that is right, given the very many millions of parents and children affected. The figure is not quite 10 million on my count but it is getting on for that. For that reason, it is vital that there is direct political responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10122163000027"></a>I return to the options service, which was not a responsibility of the DWP or the CSA before the creation of the commission. It has been heavily, and properly, marketed as offering support for parents and information and guidance that is independent of government. I have not heard the Minister address my next point directly, but it seems to me that we need to think through the consequences of putting at risk the status that that service has achieved, where parents with care and non-resident parents can feel that they can genuinely and confidentially engage with the service and get impartial advice. I remember that during the passage of the Bill we had interesting discussions about the obligations on that service in terms of reporting its findings if it became aware of information that was inconsistent with other information in the system on benefits and income. One of my questions is whether that will change with the service no longer being conducted by an NDPB but directly by an executive agency of the DWP. It would be good to have clarity on those sorts of issues.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1064"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1064</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101221-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10122163000034"></a>The Commission for Rural Communities was created by Section 17 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006-which many noble Lords, and perhaps refugees from the House of Commons as well, will remember took up a considerable amount of discussion at the time. The Commission for Rural Communities, which was created by primary legislation, was therefore thoroughly discussed and thrashed out in your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10122163000035"></a>The Commission for Rural Communities sets out its purpose and functions as follows. It is a statutory body,</p>
<ul><a name="10122163000063"></a>"funded by government to help ensure that policies, programmes and decisions take proper account of the circumstances of rural communities. We have a particular focus on disadvantaged people and areas suffering from economic under-performance".</ul>
<p><a name="10122163000052"></a>In essence, it has,</p>
<ul><a name="10122163000064"></a>"three key functions: Advocate: acting as a voice for rural people, businesses and communities; Expert adviser: giving evidence-based, objective advice to government and others; and Independent watchdog: monitoring and reporting on the delivery of policies nationally, regionally and locally".</ul>
<p><a name="10122163000053"></a>That is a summary of what it does.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10122163000036"></a>The commission's work since it was set up has been widely praised. Much of it consists of research, and the work of the chairman, Dr Stuart Burgess, as advocate for rural areas-particularly disadvantaged rural areas-has been notable. On 29 June 2010, Caroline Spelman, the Secretary of State, announced that the CRC will be abolished and partly replaced with a strengthened rural communities policy unit within Defra.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10122163000037"></a>This amendment, like the previous one, goes to the heart of the way in which the new Government intend to carry out many of the functions that are currently carried out by autonomous bodies. In her statement on 29 June, Caroline Spelman said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="10122163000059"></a>"With an urgent need to drive down debt and reduce Government spending we will have to make some tough decisions".</p>

<p><a name="10122163000054"></a>Secondly, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="10122163000060"></a>"We are committed to improving the quality of life for those living in rural areas and we will put the fair treatment of rural communities at the centre of Government".</p>

<p><a name="10122163000055"></a>Thirdly, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="10122163000061"></a>"Focusing rural policy making within the department will give rural communities and interest groups a direct link to central policymakers and a stronger champion for rural issues at the heart of Government".</p>

<p><a name="10122163000056"></a>I think that that is what, a few years ago, used to be called rural proofing-the attempt to make sure that government policies across the patch were all checked for their effect in rural areas.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10122163000038"></a>So there are really two main reasons for this policy, and they are both clearly set out in the statement-the first is to save money, and the other it is to have a more effective service. The underlying promise is that it will not prejudice government actions for rural areas. Those are the issues that we need to probe, and the first is cost.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10122163000039"></a>There are some questions that I should like to ask the Minister. What is the transitional cost? The Government briefing suggests that it is £2.5 million. Can he tell us what makes up that figure? What is the extra cost of taking on this work within Defra, and  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1065"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1065</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therefore what is the net saving? The suggestion, again from the government briefing, is that the existing cost of the CRC is £5.8 million;, that there will be a saving of £4.5 million once the transitional costs have been paid; and that the spend within Defra will therefore be only £1.3 million compared with £5.8 million at the moment. I can believe that efficiencies might be gained by doing this within Defra, and that it might be possible to do it more cheaply; but, nevertheless, that difference is so great-£5.8 million to £1.3 million-that one has to ask what things are being done at the moment that will not be done in the future.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10122163000040"></a>Can the Minister tell us something about the transitional period? My understanding is that the intention is that the CRC should cease on 31 March 2011, but there may be transitional things to be done after that. How will that be managed?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10122163000041"></a>How many staff does the CRC have at the moment? How many have transferred into Defra, and are any more expected to do so? What will be the size of the new unit within Defra which will carry out the work that the CRC has been carrying out?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10122163000042"></a>The second broad area of questions has to be about the effectiveness of the new system. The proposal is to strengthen the rural team in Defra, to improve existing policy work, and to carry out the following functions. The first is to support Ministers, who will have much more direct accountability in future for the rural work. The second is to act as a centre of rural expertise. The third is to champion,</p>
<ul><a name="10122163000065"></a>"rural needs and issues across government departments and other bodies";</ul>
<p><a name="10122163000057"></a>and the fourth is to work,</p>
<ul><a name="10122163000066"></a>"with the civic sector to promote rural solutions at the local level".</ul>
<p><a name="10122163000043"></a>The last one is a quote and I do not understand what it means. Perhaps the Minister can tell me.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10122163000044"></a>The Secretary of State also said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="10122163000062"></a>"Ministers will lead rural policy from within my Department ... The Government believe policy advice should be carried out by Departments, not arm's-length bodies".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/6/10; col. 36WS.]</p>

<p><a name="10122163000045"></a>That is okay as far as it goes, but there are questions to be asked. The Campaign to Protect Rural England suggests that the advice to Ministers should be,</p>
<ul><a name="10122163000067"></a>"robust, independent and evidence-based policy advocacy".</ul>
<p><a name="10122163000046"></a>That is what the CRC has been doing. For example, its report on uplands, published in June, called <I>High </I><I>Ground, High Potential-A Future </I><I>f</I><I>or </I><I>England's </I><I>Upland Communities</I><I>,</I> was a model of its kind. It was well researched, evidence-based and put forward a series of proposals on behalf of the rural areas of England that are most disadvantaged. It is difficult to see how a unit within Defra could do that with the style and commitment that was evident in that report.</p>
<a name="time_35"></a>
<a name="101221-0002.htm_time12"></a><h5><a name="10122163000070"></a>8 pm</h5>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10122163000047"></a>Perhaps more important is the annual <I>S</I><I>tate of the C</I><I>ountryside</I> report that-again according to the CPRE- provides a key yardstick of the social, economic and environmental trends in rural England. The report for 2010 is divided into three main sections. One is on living in the countryside and population services; one is on the economy of rural England; and one is on  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1066"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1066</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>land and environment, including farming. This is a substantial, evidential report that is published and available to everybody. Will that report be produced in future by Defra with the same thoroughness and evidential base? I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy me that that will be the case.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10122163000048"></a>In summary, I will ask first about the strength of research in the new unit. What resources will be given to it? Will the research be on a par with that which now takes place in the arm's-length body? How will the system work of having a rural champion in the department? At the moment the Rural Affairs Minister is Richard Benyon, who is energetic, keen and capable. However, the problem with Ministers is that they come and go. Who knows whether a future Minister will take on this work with the same enthusiasm? Will a Minister who is not a Secretary of State but is more junior have the clout across government to do the advocacy, the work and the rural proofing that is required?</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10122163000049"></a>How transparent will the new processes be? Government departments are notoriously secretive. Advice to Ministers is supposed to be confidential, as we heard earlier. When my younger daughter got a temporary job in the Government Office for the North West, she said: "I've got to sign this thing called the Official Secrets Act. Is that all right, Dad?". I said: "You'd better do it if your job depends on it". When junior staff such as her have to sign the Official Secrets Act, the prospect of transparency and openness of the kind that one gets with an arm's-length body seems remote. Will the policy advice that Ministers get be genuinely independent and evidence-based? How will ministerial accountability to Parliament differ from how it is now? We know that the system exists, but we also know that it is imperfect.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10122163000050"></a>This is a typical example of a body that was set up by a substantial piece of primary legislation. The proposal is to create a system whereby it can and will be abolished by ministerial order. If the Bill goes through in its present form, this is the best opportunity that we will have before the order is made to scrutinise the proposal. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide a great deal of the information that I am asking for today. If he cannot answer all the questions this evening, I hope that he will be able to answer them between now and Report, whenever that may be.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10122163000051"></a>My final question is the one that I started with. Is this just about doing the same thing in a different, perhaps better, way: and will the Minister tell us which of the existing functions of the Commission for Rural Communities will not be performed in future? That is the crunch point. I beg to move.</p>

I pay tribute to him for the way in which he is scrutinising this Bill, and in particular the arm's-length bodies in the Defra family, as we lovingly call it. My interest in this is as the midwife of the Commission for Rural Communities. I was the Rural Affairs Minister responsible for the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, and for the creation of the Commission for Rural Communities in 2005.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1067"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1067</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101221-0002.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10122167000002"></a>For noble Lords who are not familiar with the subject, I will give a potted history. In 1999, the Countryside Agency was established out of the Rural Development Commission and the Countryside Commission. It was ably headed by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, who also served as the rural advocate. Just prior to my taking over from Alun Michael as Rural Affairs Minister, Stuart Burgess was asked to take over the rural advocate's responsibilities. At the same time, the recommendations of the review carried out in 2003 by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, were being implemented through the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill that I was pleased to steward through Parliament. The Bill took English Nature, a rural development service within Defra and the Countryside Agency, and created from those three bodies Natural England. A small element around rural advocacy was retained as the Commission for Rural Communities.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10122167000003"></a>After some searching around the real estate of government, it found a home in Cheltenham, which was where the Countryside Agency had been. On the longest day of 2005-23 June-we debated at length in Committee primary legislation that would create the Commission for Rural Communities. It is ironic that five years later, on the shortest day of the year, we are now debating its demise. Currently it has just over 60 staff based in Cheltenham, and a budget just shy of £6 million. As we have heard, its closure was announced in June. Looking through the local press cuttings, it is notable that the Member of Parliament for Cheltenham, Martin Horwood, said back in June:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="10122167000014"></a>"There hasn't been any obvious consultation and I think it leaves questions unanswered about how important independent roles are going to be fulfilled".</p>

<p><a name="10122167000008"></a>I think that the Liberal Democrat Member for Cheltenham puts his finger on the need for independent advocacy and independent rural-proofing, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, echoes his questions about how those functions will now be performed if the Commission for Rural Communities is allowed to go.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10122167000004"></a>When I was thinking about this debate today, I also noticed a fine article in the <I>Daily Telegraph-</I>not a paper that I normally peruse with great interest-of 2 July this year by Geoffrey Lean, who is easily the longest-serving environment correspondent writing in any of our national newspapers. He has been following these issues for a considerable number of years. I think it is worth quoting some of the things that he said in that article. I know that it may not be the most popular newspaper today among the government Front Benches but in an article headed "The countryside will be the poorer" Geoffrey Lean says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="10122167000015"></a>"Think about poverty in Britain, and the mind jumps to grim inner-city estates. But deprivation can be just as great amid some of the loveliest landscapes. About one in five rural families live beneath the poverty line, a rate increasing three times as fast as in the cities".</p>

<p><a name="10122167000009"></a>He goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="10122167000016"></a>"The commission's job was to tackle this. It could, perhaps, have done so more dynamically-and it could have sold itself better-but it did make a difference ... It produced regular State of the Countryside reports-the last, as it happens, comes out next week"-</p>

<p><a name="10122167000010"></a>this was written in July-</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1068"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1068</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="10122167000020"></a>"keeping a focus on rural poverty. And it persuaded the last government to stump up £180 million to maintain village post offices and enable them to provide banking services, and to propose a 50p tax on all phone bills to finance rural broadband. Now, a coalition of two parties that traditionally represented the countryside is betraying it. First to go was the broadband tax, scrapped in George Osborne's Budget. And now Ms Spelman has killed off the commission".</ul>
<p><a name="10122167000011"></a>He finishes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="10122167000017"></a>"This will save money-but not a great deal. The £3.5 million a year won't help much towards the £750 million reduction in the department's budget demanded by the Chancellor, and seems outweighed by the cost to the countryside ... So who will speak for the countryside? The Conservative and Lib Dem backbenches, perhaps? But many of the Tory knights of the shire have retired behind their moats, leaving the party more Bullingdon than bucolic, while their coalition partners seem cowed by power. The NFU, and the Country Land and Business Association, are effective, but represent sectional interests as, in a different way, does the Countryside Alliance. And the much diminished Campaign to Protect Rural England has disbanded its rural policy team".</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10122167000005"></a>Finally, there is a quotation in the article from Tim Farron:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="10122167000018"></a>"'The role of somebody outside government to look at rural policy and decisions taken by all departments is very, very important'".</p>

<p><a name="10122167000012"></a>I could not say that better. I apologise for reading to your Lordships from the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> at such length but I think that Geoffrey Lean makes a really good argument.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10122167000006"></a>It is true that at times the Commission for Rural Communities has not pulled its punches-sometimes, I am afraid, at the expense of the Government of whom I was proud to be a member until May of this year. I found a cutting from the <I>Times</I>-this must have been before the paywall was invented because it is dated 6 June 2008-on the report by Stuart Burgess as the rural advocate. The report states bluntly:</p>

<p><a name="10122167000013"></a>Stuart Burgess and his lean team of staff based in Cheltenham did an admirable job in holding us to account. It is great to see the noble Lord, Lord Hill, in his place as a schools Minister. Stuart would regularly come to see me, encouraging me to ensure that the rural schools group established by the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, was allowed to continue and to ensure that I attended it and listened to what it had to say. He was also keen to ensure that we properly rural-proofed what we were doing in education, that the presumption in favour of keeping rural schools would be retained, and that things such as the academic broadband network that schools are able to take advantage of could be piggy-backed to help to tackle the rural broadband issues that the Commission for Rural Communities was so keen to advocate.</p>

They relate to areas such as affordable rural housing, fuel poverty, climate change, transport, digital communications, health, post offices, financial inclusion and market towns. There is a whole list of areas where the commission has been active, has been reporting and has been challenging the Government

That should be allowed to continue. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will be assertive and perhaps even put it to a vote and challenge the government on this, if not now, then at some future point. This is a commission that the Government can and should be proud of and should allow to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10122168000001"></a>Will the Minister answer a couple of questions? The commission has oversight for the England Rural Development Programme; how will that continue? Will it be passed on to Natural England, or will it be dealt with in-house by Defra? It is an important source of European money for rural England and there will be some concern as to how it will continue. Similarly, I ask him to put his mind to what will happen to the rural affairs fora in the various regions. They provide a more localised form of rural-proofing. They were serviced by the Government Offices for the Regions, which are now to be disbanded, so I do not know how they are now to be serviced. If we are getting rid of the Commission for Rural Communities and, in turn, the rural affairs fora are not going to be allowed to function properly, I do not understand how there is to be any check or balance on what the Executive is up to in rural England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10122168000002"></a>Finally, or almost finally, I ask noble Lords to cast their eyes to the future and think about the need for rural-proofing as we go forward. There are real questions at the moment around the closure of the magistrates' courts and access to justice. Who is going to give a genuinely independent voice, free of any Government interference, or any suspicion of Government interference, as to whether people in rural areas are going to get access to justice? There are questions around police numbers as the fiscal constraints bite on police authorities. There are questions around school closures, the significant and radical reorganisation of the National Health Service, doing away with PCTs and strategic health authorities and how GPs in rural areas will continue to provide the full range of service to people in rural England. I have already mentioned broadband.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10122168000003"></a>Dr Stuart Burgess has been interested for a number of years in migrant labour, trying to ensure that migrants working in agriculture, particularly in rural England, who are often very low paid with very poor conditions, are properly served in communities that are not used to dealing with people who do not have English as their first language. The jobcentre network, wind farms, housing, the impact of the Localism Bill, the impact of giving all this freedom in planning and whether that will deliver on the affordable housing needs of rural areas-these need an independent rural advocate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10122168000004"></a>I cannot speak highly enough of Dr Stuart Burgess, or of the job that Ewen Cameron, now the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, did before him. I would like to see that role continue independently of government, even if some of the other functions need to be brought in-house, in order to allow the independent rural advocate to continue. Having been a rural affairs Minister, I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that we do not, as Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State, or even as Secretaries of State, as Alun Michael was, have the clout across government that an independent

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10122168000005"></a>I say finally to the Minister, listen to the voices that I have read out from newspapers and the media, listen to other Members of this House, listen to the countryside and at least retain an independent voice for rural-proofing. If at some point down the line the Minister wants to reorganise functions, it is set out in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, in Part 8, "Flexible administrative arrangements", which allows Defra functions to be transferred between Defra and Defra bodies and gives the Government the legislative freedom to do what they want to do without rushing at it here and now.</p>

What I do have is some 18 years' ministerial experience, man and boy, continuously from 1979 to 1997, at every level of government, including several years as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary, before becoming what was, in terms of nomenclature, rather more grand. In that, I share some experience with my noble friend on the Front Bench: we overlapped each other at the old DHSS, or was it by then the DSS? It might have had yet another title: they change more or less every week. I want to contribute a priori from that, picking up a couple of the points that have been made.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10122168000007"></a>First, I just do not understand the general arguments that are being put forward for the proposition in the real world, as distinct from some hypothetical world. It is said that there should be greater direct accountability by Ministers within the department and that the department should be the champion. We all know that if the Ministry of Justice decides to abolish magistrates' courts, another department cannot act as the champion for anything. We all know that what happens is that, by and large, these matters are settled at meetings of relatively junior Ministers, where you may or may not carry the day, but you cannot then go round outside that Cabinet committee saying, "I championed this but the rest would not agree". You cannot say, "We lost on this, but we will now campaign to have it reversed or to make people think again".</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10122168000008"></a>Equally, when I was such a junior Minister faced with those difficulties, I welcomed having an authoritative external body to which I could point as a support for what I wanted to get my colleagues to agree to. Far more convincing than saying, "My unit in the department tells me that this is what we want", is to say, "We have this great and good body of external people who really know what they are talking about and who have done some research, and this is what they are advocating". Some of this thinking does not connect with the real world. I would be most grateful if my noble friend would comment, if he feels able. The only other thing that I would say is that I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will not press his amendment, because I think we could have a much more productive argument when Ministers have had a chance to think about just what it is that they want to do.</p>

I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for introducing the debate and for the manner in which he did so. It was very reasoned, trying to tease out answers. Indeed, he has probably posed most of the questions which I would pose.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10122168000010"></a>I also want to take this opportunity to add my tribute to Stuart Burgess. I worked with him very closely in the days when I was chair of the Forestry Commission. We met regularly, and I found him a tower of strength. He was a most admirable individual, a very knowledgeable man and, above all, a real champion for the countryside-not for any particular vested interest in the countryside but for the people in the countryside, especially the disadvantaged. It is interesting that the report which is imminent, probably the last report from the commission, will be on that issue.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10122168000011"></a>I am a little surprised that the coalition is proposing that action. I read the local papers, as does the noble Lord, Lord Henley. We probably read the same local papers, after we have read the back page, where we share a common interest. I am always finding the coalition partners, whether it is in Penrith and the Border, Westmorland, or wherever, appearing to champion the rural areas and saying that the Labour politicians from the west of the county-although they represent huge rural areas-have no concern for the rural areas. That could not be further wrong.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10122168000012"></a>Indeed, as we have heard, it was the Labour Government who established the Commission for Rural Communities, which I believe did a great deal of good work. The great advantage was that I frequently met Stuart Burgess on the train going on a fact-finding visit, or going to hold a public meeting, a public consultation, in some village hall on housing, broadband, or whatever. Like the noble Lord, Lord Newton, as a Minister I certainly found it incredibly valuable to be able to call in experts, especially people who were as independent as the chair of the Commission for Rural Communities. It was very useful for a politician to be able to call these people in aid because one of the things I found was that-this is just a fact of life in a sense-any politician has a certain struggle, not only with his opponents across the Chamber but, inevitably, with his own department. His own civil servants may have slightly different interests in certain respects than he may have. Indeed, they may be right, because they are there for the long term and most politicians are there for the shorter term.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10122168000013"></a>What I found interesting, and the issue that I would pose to the Minister, is this. I cannot imagine civil servants in a unit in Defra going out into rural communities on winter or even summer evenings, going to village halls, meeting ordinary people and listening to them, bearing in mind that, because of the nature of the occupation, the overwhelming majority of those civil servants, most of the policy people and the people with the real authority are based here in south-east England in the Greater London area. I simply do not believe that they will be going out and collecting the information for themselves. I believe that if the Government really want the big society notion to  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work, they are really going to have to engage with people and to communicate with them. Quite honestly, I believe that members of a commission are much better at doing that than civil servants in Defra or in any other department.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10122168000014"></a>That brings me to the second point that the noble Lord, Lord Newton, made. It is a killing point. It is about who is the lead authority. Let us take broadband, which has been mentioned several times. Broadband in rural areas is difficult, but it can be piggybacked on the school network. In Cumbria, the Member for Penrith and The Border has led a campaign in the north of the county to try to get broadband, quite rightly, into these rural communities. Defra will actually have very little authority when the execution of this plan comes to the fore because, quite frankly, it is not Defra's responsibility. It is another government department's responsibility. We heard about the power of the Under-Secretary of State, but it is more than that, it is the power of the civil servants, with their pecking orders, as well. I believe that rural communities will lose out by this abolition.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10122168000015"></a>I think it was my noble friend Lord Knight who made the point about listening. I hope that the Government will listen especially to people such as Geoffrey Lean, who for many years has been the finest environmental journalist in this country and for the past 40 years has been prepared to take unpopular stances against Governments of all political hues. I thought the quote that my noble friend used was most telling, and I hope the Minister will not dismiss this and will listen to some of these points of view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10122168000017"></a>The Commission for Rural Communities was set up to promote awareness of the social and economic needs of people who live and work in rural areas, and to help decision makers across and beyond government to identify how these needs can best be addressed. It has given valuable independent advice to the Government and has produced a number of excellent reports, many of which have been referred to approvingly in recent rural affairs debates in your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10122168000018"></a>The arguments about the usefulness of outside, independent and impartial advice, rather than simply relying on departmental in-house sources of advice from civil servants, have been well aired in relation to a variety of bodies proposed to be scrapped in the Public Bodies Bill. In particular, the debate on the pesticides advisory committees and the remarks made by my noble friends Lord Whitty and Lady Quinn, and others on 29 November, were very pertinent. The value of the report of the Commission for Rural Communities was mentioned in a debate on rural affairs initiated once again by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on 15 July. That then informed your Lordships' later debate on the Prince's Countryside Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10122168000019"></a>The CRC focuses on practical outcomes for people who live and work in our rural areas. I pay tribute to Stuart Burgess who with his team accompanied a tour on the work being done in market towns, which was a strong initiative in my local area in Cheshire. The second round of the town centre initiative fund expanded excellent help towards 15 further rural local authorities; that is, 38 per cent of recipient authorities compared to only 6 per cent in the first round of that initiative. It has been involved in collaboration and partnerships through local areas, and in working to find the most effective solutions at the least cost. It has picked up on local challenges and strengths, and has been part of local economic assessments, which have been vital to the work of regional development agencies and, through the rural development of England proposals, has worked with the development agencies, which is another body we will look at after the new year. It has become a repository of expert advice and opinion to take advice of rural needs to the heart of government.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10122168000020"></a>It is clear that there has been no real consultation about the abolition of this commission, despite the assurances from the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, about consultations in an earlier debate. In answer to a Written Question, HL2837, the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="10122168000106"></a>"The decision to abolish the Commission for Rural Communities was made after full consideration within Defra and the usual consultation across government".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/10/10; col. WA 224.]</p>

<p><a name="10122168000105"></a>No wider consultations have been undertaken.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10122168000021"></a>Has the effect on rural areas really been considered? The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to costs and rightly pointed out that the upfront abolition costs are in the region of £2.5 million. Unlike many of the other Defra bodies where cost savings are negligible or non-existent, this could be one where some costs may be at issue. However, one has to look at the value for money that this expenditure has produced. If the Government commission reports in the future on the kinds of subjects that have previously been considered by the CRC, there would presumably be considerable costs in undertaking them. Furthermore, independent, impartial advice is a valuable commodity.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10122168000022"></a>The Defra Minister, Richard Benyon, has also said that proposed changes to Defra's public bodies will create modest savings. The main benefits of the proposals in the Public Bodies Bill are to increase transparency and accountability in public bodies. But how can accountability be improved if existing bodies, such as those we are discussing tonight, which publish their reports and proceedings and have excellent websites, high visibility in rural areas, and make minutes of their meetings available to everyone, are abolished and replaced by Defra in-house bodies? The CRC made a difference. This simply does not make sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10122168000023"></a>I turn now to the announcement made on 29 June by the Secretary of State. A new policy unit is to be set up within her department covering rural communities. It will work across government to ensure that rural interests are reflected in programmes. I join other noble Lords who have asked the Minister how an internal policy unit can have the profile to cut across and into other departmental activities. Can these new

I welcome the remarks of all noble Lords who have spoken about the CRC. The noble Lord, Lord Knight of Weymouth, described himself as the midwife of the body, but he was then described as its father by the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester. We are getting our metaphors a bit mixed up on this occasion. However, as I said, I want to put this into perspective, so I shall start by reminding the Committee, as other noble Lords have done, that we announced our intention way back on 29 June that, subject to the passing of legislation, we would abolish the Commission for Rural Communities along with its statutory functions as just one part of the Bill before us.</p>

<a name="101221-0002.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10122168000025"></a>I think I can speak for all my fellow Ministers and future Ministers once my time is up when I say that the decision to abolish the commission does not reflect in any way a reduction in the Government's rural commitment. On the contrary, the Government are committed to improving the quality of life for people living and working in rural areas and intend to put the fair treatment of rural communities at the centre of government. There are already many rural organisations and commentators who will continue to hold the Government to account, as happened with the previous Government. I think that noble Lords might remember one faintly rural community, the Women's Institute, which I seem to remember a former Prime Minister going to address but not coming away from that occasion exactly unbloodied. However, I think he enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10122168000026"></a>I remind the Committee of what the name Defra stands for. It is the department responsible for the environment, food and rural affairs. It is the department that works to promote the interests of rural people within all government policies. I can speak for all my colleagues in the department-I am sure it will be true of all future Ministers and, dare I say it, those like the noble Lords, Lord Knight of Weymouth and Lord Clark, who have served in similar departments in previous Governments-by saying that we will continue to push for rural affairs. Many of us have a strong rural background. The noble Lord, Lord Clark of Windermere, comes from my part of the world and I was grateful for his reference to the fact that we support the same football team and read the same newspaper. We will continue, as he and the noble Lord, Lord Knight, and others have done, to champion rural issues across the Government.</p>

I can also remember taking social security Bills through this House for my noble friend when he was the Secretary of State and that I suffered a number of defeats which ran into millions, billions and trillions of pounds and which my noble friend then had to overturn. The point I am trying to make is that what this House and another place can do is equally important. I always used to feel that any Secretary of State from another place with whom I worked needed two or three defeats in this House before they understood its importance.

That unit will expand on the existing policy work of the department, moving to a single organisation to act as the rural champion within government-and that rural champion is Defra. This will remove duplication, improve efficiency and improve our focus on priority issues for rural communities.</p>

I can assure my noble friend that 14 staff from the CRC have already transferred to Defra as they are connected to work which will be undertaken in the rural communities policy unit. This will assist in building upon the relationships that the commission has built up. In addition, any vacant posts in the new unit-and we expect there to be at least some-will be advertised so that commission staff without an automatic right of transfer can apply for those positions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10122168000034"></a>One of the most important issues to address is costs. What we are doing is not only about saving money, but we expect significant savings to come from this action. This is important in terms of our contribution to reducing the deficit. We, as a Government, inherited a very large deficit from the party opposite when they were in government and we all have to do our bit to reduce it. Obviously there will be up-front costs as a result of the change and redundancies, and those are estimated at less than £2.5 million. These will be far outweighed by the long-term savings, estimated to be in the region of £4.5 million a year. That is a significant sum. There are very good reasons for wanting to continue to attack the deficit and we will continue to do so. However, as I have made clear to the Committee, that is not the sole reason for our doing this.</p>

We have witnessed the National Grid announce a consultation on covering large parts of rural England with pylons from the North Sea. When that issue comes to be debated within government, we will hear the voices of the Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change, but those debates will be internal. Would it not enormously strengthen my noble friend's department to have an authoritative voice-not just local women's institutes-from an objective body set up for the purpose of giving a view which is clearly not parti pris but is committed to the benefit of the rural areas of this country?</p>

One of the first things that I learnt sitting at the feet of my noble friend Lord Newton was that the Treasury had a slightly greater say on these matters than other departments. Nevertheless, Defra will play its role in arguing these views in government. I do not think that the CRC would be able to stand up to the Treasury with any greater authority than, for example, my own department, but, as I said in response to earlier remarks, there are a great many other bodies outside that will also make the case for rural communities very strongly. I do not think that spending £4.5 million per year on the CRC is certain to give more prominence to the arguments of rural communities. We will do that, and do it far more cheaply than the CRC.</p>

I was delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, was representing the Labour Front Bench because at least somebody apart from me was not a past or present Minister. At one stage, the debate was developing into a past and present Minister's club, with lots of gossip that the rest of us did not quite understand. However, I am grateful to everybody and particularly the former Ministers-midwives and everybody else-who have taken part.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10122168000043"></a>I am not one of those who think that Ministers, even at a junior level, do not have any influence and cannot, with enough energy and commitment, achieve things within their departments and perhaps outside. I spent last Christmas reading Chris Mullin's diaries about his time as various kinds of junior Minister, which give a very cynical view of the person with a minor position and no power whatever. I suspect that he laid it on a little. The diaries are extremely amusing, but I think that he probably overstresses his lack of power and influence.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10122168000044"></a>Having looked at it all from the outside over many years, I have seen that Ministers with energy can achieve things, but one problem that faces all Governments and all ministerial teams is that at some stage they run out of energy and new inspiration. I would not accuse the present Government of having a lack of energy or a lack of determination to do things. In fact, I think that they sometimes rush into things far too quickly, when a little more thought and careful consideration might be helpful, although I understand why they do  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1078"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1078</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so. However, such energy does not last. The idea that a Minister at a middle or junior level within Defra will have the presence and ability to promote causes on behalf of rural areas, particularly disadvantaged rural areas, that the CRC and its chairman have at the moment is arguable at the very least and possibly wishful thinking.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10122168000045"></a>I understand that the Government have an agenda, which I share to quite a considerable degree, of looking hard at quangos, reducing their costs and doing away with them when they are not doing a useful job or where what they do can be done more efficiently or democratically. I do not disagree with that fundamental wish in any way whatever, but the quangos have to be looked at one by one.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10122168000046"></a>One specific question that I asked, to which I did not get an answer, was whether the <I>State of the countryside</I> report, as a basic piece of essential impartial, independent research, will continue in future even if within Defra. I hope that the Minister might write to us with an answer to that.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10122168000047"></a>I would also like much more information on exactly how the rural champion across government will work. One of the things that a lot of us on the Liberal Democrat Benches have learnt in the past few months is how busy Ministers are and how much of their time is taken up with activities, some of which are clearly extremely vital and some of which I wonder why they are bothering with. I wonder why they do not just say no and get on with doing something useful. It is absolutely clear that competent, keen Ministers have their time and energies fully occupied by the job that they do. Some will cynically say that such Ministers are just being run by civil servants, but I do not think that that is true of good Ministers. Nevertheless, Ministers are very busy people. To have the job of co-ordinating rural policies across government is a pretty big job. The noble Lord, Lord Knight, can tell us how he got on trying to do that kind of thing when he was recently a rural Minister.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10122168000048"></a>The other fundamental question to which I do not think that I have an answer is this: what does the CRC do at present that will not be done in future? The noble Lord, Lord Knight, set out clearly what the CRC does now. What we would like to know is which of those tasks will not be done in future, by Defra or by anybody else. If £4.5 million is to be saved-as the Minister quite rightly said, that is not a small sum, even in these days-what jobs are not going to be done because that money is not being spent? The noble Lord, Lord Henley, said, "I think that its time has come". It is probably inevitable that its time has come, no matter how much we debate it in Committee and at later stages, but it is important that we understand who is going to do what in future. I do not think that we understand that yet.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10122168000049"></a>Some of the quangos-the arm's-length bodies, or whatever they are called-that are being done away with in the long lists in this Bill will not be missed in future. In five or 10 years' time, we will look back at the list and ask ourselves, "What an earth were they? What did they do?". Such quangos will not be missed and we will wonder why we argued about them, but some of the quangos will be missed, including, I suspect,  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the CRC. Life goes round in circles, as we know, and some of those quangos will have to be reinvented in future. It is far better either that we get it right now and do not drive the bulldozer through those that are necessary or, if the organisational arrangements are to change, that we understand at least that robust structures will be set up that will deliver the same kind of thing.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10122168000050"></a>Finally, the Minister said that he did not believe that the CRC could stand up to the Treasury better than a rural advocate within Defra. That may be true in some respects, but the real difference is that the rural advocate within Defra will operate within government and behind the closed doors of government. Some of what he is doing will come out, because we will have debates in Parliament, reports will be produced and leaks will appear in newspapers. By and large, however, that process will take place within government, whereas what the CRC and other similar bodies can do is to take it all out into the public domain so that the research is published. The proposals are public proposals and, as Members of Parliament and your Lordships' House, we can use that information to call Ministers to account, to take part in debates and to take part in legislation. It is much more difficult to prise information from within the department. That is a fundamental difference, which the Government have not got quite right in a number of these issues.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10122168000051"></a>It is customary on these occasions to ask the Minister to write to us and to give us answers to the questions that have been asked that have not been answered. I hope that he will do that after this debate. I will certainly collate the questions that have been asked from all parts of the House, write them down and hope to get more thorough answers from the Government and from the civil servants in Defra and everybody else involved before we come back to Report. We may have to come back to this issue on Report, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10122168000054"></a>One could probably describe the bodies that I shall refer to in relation to this batch of amendments as not of strategic importance; this is more of a tidying-up exercise. Nevertheless, it is important to bring them to the attention of the House and to ask the Minister to try to clarify what he thinks will be the work of the department, how it will be structured and how the activities undertaken by these bodies will be done within the Government, either by independent experts or within his own department as advisory committees. </p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10122168000055"></a>Amendment 29 concerns the Committee on Agricultural Valuation. As the Minister said, it is recognised on all sides of the House that the deficit that has been created is consequential on the banking situation, and all sides of the House have proposals to tackle the deficit. We on this side were looking at that committee as a key one to tidy up and abolish in this period. It has not sat for over 10 years and, when it did so, it was largely made up of members of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers, which has been instrumental in providing advice to Defra and indeed does so now as part of the Tenancy Reform Industry Group, which has been carrying on the work of that committee to great advantage. I understand that the group is looking at draft replacement statutory instruments to be brought in on the end of tenancy valuations, concerning such erudite matters as residual manurial values-before all eyes mist over in a glaze of appreciation-and the volatility of fertiliser prices that make this job so important to the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10122168000056"></a>Amendment 35 is on environment protection advisory committees. On these, we understand that the aim is to establish more flexible non-statutory engagement arrangements at a more local level. The Environment Agency must be able to engage more actively locally with society, the public and business. Effective stakeholder engagement and partnerships are key to successful delivery on the ground. With these amendments, we are seeking to engage the Minister to clarify the successor arrangements that will be put in place. We understand and agree that the design of the detail of this new approach is an important next step. The Environment Agency will be working closely with the chairs and members of the current committees to develop thinking on how best to maximise future local community engagement and to ensure smooth transition with partnerships and local stakeholders. Can the Minister tell us what stage these discussions have reached and clarify that, as this Bill passes through its stages in this House and is enacted, these new arrangements will be programmed to come into being in parallel with these committees being wound up?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10122168000057"></a>Amendment 36 concerns Food from Britain and is a tidying-up exercise, as the body has already been administratively wound down. However, once again, it would be instrumental and helpful to be told what headway the successor arrangements are making with the activity that was carried out by Food from Britain. Looking to my interests in the farming industry, I know that that body has been very important in the past in promoting food from Britain both within this country and overseas. It would be helpful to understand how the successor bodies are being taken forward.</p>

I do so in the same spirit as my noble friend on the Front Bench in that I seek to ascertain whether the Government have the right processes in place to take over any jobs that this body may have undertaken. It would be foolish of me to oppose the abolition of this committee, as we stopped it meeting under my watch as chair of the Forestry Commission. I remember it well because we reviewed all our advisory committees and considered that there was no real justification for the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee. According to the Minister's Answer to a Parliamentary Question, it has not met since September 2005 and fell into abeyance in June 2006 when the members' terms of office expired. In the second part of the Parliamentary Question, I asked what the cost of the body was. The Minister replied that it had cost £625 since November 2005, which is about £125 a year. I suspect that it does not cost that much and that most of that money was incurred in winding up the body in the latter part of 2005 and in 2006, so in essence it is a no-cost body. That is an important point.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10122168000060"></a>I spent this afternoon looking at the Second Reading of the Forestry Bill on 5 August 1919-I was able to do so in view of the delays incurred when another matter was being discussed in the House-which set up the Forestry Commission. It is interesting how much wise debate took place when the Forestry Commission was being established. One thing that was debated at great length was whether Scotland should have its own, separate Forestry Commission. That has not changed. Almost 80 years later devolution took place to a certain extent and great powers were given back to Scotland and to Wales, as well as to England, to run their part of the forestry estate. Flexibility was also built into that legislation, which was then carried forward into the subsequent Acts affecting forestry. There was no Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee; it was simply a central advisory committee. I have never been quite sure why the Government are so intent on abolishing it.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10122168000061"></a>I come back to my other point about the big society, which seems to be the Government's underlying philosophy. This committee was a radical proposal for the time, in 1919. A very radical and progressive Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, was trying-</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10122168000064"></a>That advisory committee was a link in the new concept of state forestry-forestry belonging to the citizens-being challenged by and running side by side with the private forest interest. The Act said that between six and eight members of the advisory committee  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be appointed after consultations with forest owners-who I suggest were not exactly supporters of the Labour Party or the Opposition-and that six to eight would come from the timber merchants and allied trades. It was a genuine attempt to try to draw in expertise and to be aware of the interests not so much of those who were involved in state forestry but of those who had great knowledge of the industry. It certainly served the state forest service very well, helped to build up the Forestry Commission and also helped private forestry. That is one reason why, even today, a large body in private forestry wishes to retain the state forest service. However, we will come back to that in later amendments.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10122168000065"></a>I am simply suggesting that this is perhaps a little more than tokenism. Perhaps it is just tidying up-I concede that straight away-but if the committee does not cost anything, why abolish it? Interestingly, the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee was not set up until 1939, when there was the threat of war and the need for timber. It was established to try to ensure that that need was met. It resonates today that the first edict that it set out, facing the demands of war-it sounds obvious now-was that one should go first for the mature timber, then for the semi-mature timber, and, lastly, for the timber which should be used only in dire emergency. It classified the various parts of the country as to where the main felling should take place. It is relevant today that the two areas that the committee singled out for more or less immediate felling, because the trees were mature, were the New Forest and the Forest of Dean. I was interested that the Business Secretary in the other place, Dr Cable, who I think has a cottage in the New Forest, said recently that the New Forest certainly would not be privatised. I know also that the Forest of Dean is of great concern to my noble friend Lady Royall. We should bear in mind that forestry is a long-term game. It is many years since the end of the war, and those trees that were replanted just after it are now coming to maturity.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10122168000066"></a>I will make a further point about tokenism. When the 1919 Bill had its Second Reading in this House, much of the discussion was about devolution. The term was not used then, but that was what the discussion was about. One of my early tasks at the Forestry Commission was to devise a system of governance that allowed us to have a devolved forestry enterprise, yet at the same time keep a GB entity. We did not have a sufficient critical mass of timber in the three separate countries to sustain a viable body. We had a lot of difficulty with this until we discovered that, just as there was a central advisory committee, it was possible under the original Act to establish three national advisory committees. By reviving these committees that were there in statute, we were able to form a system of governance that has withstood almost a decade and, depending on this Bill, will probably stand the test of time for a while longer. My overall point is that if you have a system of governance with a certain amount of flexibility, it will allow you to deal with contingencies that are unexpected at the time, but which occur in long-term businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10122168000067"></a>I will make two or three further points. The reason why the Forestry Commission and the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee were established was  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that in 1919, after the war, only 4 per cent of the land in Britain was covered by trees. That figure was almost the lowest in Europe. Over the past 91 years, it has increased to 12 per cent. One may not think that is a huge rise. However, bearing in mind the long-term nature of forestry, it is true that Britain is one of the few countries in the world-if not the only country-that has reafforested. It is quite remarkable, and is recognised by bodies such as the United Nations and by countries such as China that are trying to move into the reafforestation process. Bodies such as the advisory committees have been very helpful to the Forestry Commission in developing that expertise.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10122168000068"></a>My next point concerns the flip side of this, which is timber. We still use a massive amount of timber, even in this world of plastic and synthetics. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture in 1919 told noble Lords of the day in this House that Britain imported 92 per cent of the timber that it used. The situation has got better-but not a lot. We now import in the region of 85 per cent of the timber supply of this country. This is an important reason why we need advisory committees. We are trying to establish timber and wood-using industries in this country. These are often very labour-intensive. When these companies are considering establishing themselves in the UK, their first question is: can we guarantee a sufficient supply of timber? They almost always come to the Forestry Commission-often through its advisory committees-and say, "Will you guarantee us that supply of 30 or 40 per cent?".</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10122168000069"></a>I cite as an example the quite large wood-using power station that was built on Teesside. People would not have gone ahead with that if there had not been a sufficient supply of timber from the state forest to guarantee a critical mass. One might ask, "Why just the state forest?". The answer is simply that the elasticity of supply and demand very much applies. Timber prices go up and down. When they fall, any private owner thinks, "I am not going to put my timber on the market. I'll withhold it and, when the prices rise, I'll put it on the market then". I accept immediately that that makes sense to the forest owner. However, it does not make sense to the timber and wood user, whether it is someone making pallets, chipboard, paper or whatever. Therefore, we need that critical supply. Is the Minister confident that without advisory committees-we should remember that this is only an advisory committee-there will be sufficient advice for government?</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10122168000070"></a>My final point relates to one that I made earlier and it concerns the amount of forest cover. Again, when I was at the Forestry Commission, we decided to look at carbon sequestration and the question of meeting our carbon demands. I start with a couple of statistics which I have used in this House before but which I think are worth repeating. Twenty per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are due to deafforestation, and that is equal to the total emissions from the world's transport industries. Reafforestation is a win-win situation and, because we have reafforested our country to a certain extent and are acknowledged as having done so, we believe that we have a role to play. However, that role is effective only if we have advisory committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10122168000071"></a>In order to challenge ourselves on that premise, we established an eminent advisory committee to look at the issue under the chairmanship of Professor Reed. The committee was composed of foresters, climatologists and scientists. We basically came up with the recommendation that a great deal of carbon capture was involved in afforestation. The committee came up with the second statistic that I shall cite to your Lordships. A 4 per cent increase in tree cover in this country would allow us to capture 10 per cent of our carbon emissions. It is something that the previous Government committed to do and I hope that this Government will pursue it. However, without advisory committees, it would not have been possible to come to that conclusion.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="10122168000072"></a>I simply ask the Government to bear these points in mind. Instead of abolishing the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee, which I view as tokenism, why not leave it as an advisory committee and it can be used for some unforeseen contingent problem that may occur in the future?</p>

He has made a very powerful case for the role that forestry plays, whether in the public or the private sector. However, the question for the Committee today is whether the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee will contribute to carbon sequestration and whether it will add to the contribution that forestry makes in this country. A moment's thought suggests that a committee that has not met for quite a long time is perhaps past its sell-by date.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10122168000074"></a>Having said that, I do not want to denigrate in any way the contribution that forestry makes to land management and to meeting some of our essential needs. It is very important that the forestry estate be increased. Whether the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee has a role to play, I rather doubt. Looking at this group of amendments, we recognise also that the Committee on Agricultural Valuation, as the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, reminded us, has not met for over 10 years. I think that we can assume that that is a committee that has also met its sell-by date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="10122168000075"></a>I speak, very briefly, to draw attention to Food From Britain. I have enormous admiration for the work of my late friend Lord Walker, who created Food From Britain when he was Minister of Agriculture at a time when he was appalled by agriculture's inability to react to the markets. We had been used to the socialist concept of marketing boards. The farmers-I have to declare an interest, as a farmer and an apple grower-were lamentably incapable of reacting to the needs of supermarkets as those were evolving and to the demands of the market. He pointed out that, unless we had an organisation within Government-within the Ministry of Agriculture, as it was then-that could relate the farmers' priorities adequately and make farmers more aware of the realities of the market, we would lose out to our competitors. That was very successful.</p>

While recognising that all good organisations have to recognise the realities of time, I would not wish this provision, which will consign Food From Britain to history, to go without record. I am personally enormously grateful for the contribution that it made.</p>

Those debates will, fortunately, not be tonight and I will respond to those remarks on that occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="10122168000078"></a>With these amendments, those noble Lords who can remember their Monty Python were dealing with dead parrots. Amendment 29, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, relates to the Committee on Agricultural Valuation, which, as he said, has not met for something like 10 years. From a sedentary position I said, on two or three occasions, "19 years". Is there any purpose in keeping such a body going? It has withered on the vine; it is a dead parrot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="10122168000079"></a>Moving on to Food From Britain, as I think others have said, FFB ceased its activities in 2009 following a decision by the previous Administration to reduce its grant in aid-one of those rare occasions on which the previous Government did something to reduce expenditure. It is another dead parrot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="10122168000080"></a>Coming to the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee, we will address during later debates the matters relating to the Forestry Commission that the noble Lord, Lord Clark, regaled us with at some length, but he was kind enough to remind us that, under his chairmanship of the Forestry Commission, that body last met in, I think he said, September 2005. Yet again, it is another dead parrot, which I do not think it is necessary to keep going. The noble Lord said that abolishing the advisory committee is not going to save any money and he carefully quoted from, I think, my Written Answer that it had cost something like £625 in total since 2005. He reckoned, quite rightly, that most of that money was probably in the earlier years-there were very little savings. However, I do not think that we should keep bodies going merely because they are costing nothing. If they are not doing anything, why not wind them up? This is a very useful tidying-up operation.</p>

The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee was not set up until 1939. The original Act did not include such a body, but it did include an advisory committee that could be used for different purposes.

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="10122168000084"></a>I now turn to the two remaining bodies: the environment protection advisory committees and the regional and local fisheries advisory committees. They are statutory committees that advise the Environment Agency. The Government's aim in proposing the abolition of those committees in Schedule 1 is not to remove that advisory function. Indeed, both committees have provided valuable advice to the agency, and it will continue to need that advice. However, having two sets of committees on a regional, statutory basis creates a degree of inflexibility and inefficiency that is now proving unduly restrictive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="10122168000085"></a>Defra now wishes the Environment Agency to establish more flexible non-statutory arrangements that will enable better local engagement of all interested parties at the catchment level, including in delivery, together with a more integrated approach between environmental protection, conservation and fisheries. Such a structure will have the flexibility to evolve as needed, without the constraints of a prescriptive statutory remit at the regional level, and will better address local priorities while working with partners and communities to deliver improved local engagement. That will enable civil society to take the lead where appropriate, rather than continue the current focus on advising the Environment Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="10122168000089"></a>It was created under the Enterprise Act 2002 as an executive non-departmental public body to fund and provide support services for the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the top body in court terms, which hears appeals on matters relating to competition. The Competition Service's work is dedicated entirely to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. I do not know whether it has been officially announced, and the Minister will no doubt tell me if I am wrong, but I understand that the Government have in mind that in future the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will no longer have this dedicated service of the Competition Service to assist it, will be supported and serviced by the general Tribunals Service, which was not in existence in 2007, and therefore the Government could not then make it available for the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="10122168000090"></a>The function of the Competition Appeal Tribunal, as I have indicated, is as an appeal body from the Competition Commission, and it is obvious to everyone concerned that its independent judicial role must be backed up by an independent administrative service. That is so at present. The Competition Appeal Tribunal gets an independent service and, as I understand it, is very satisfied with the service it receives from this body that the Government wish to abolish. There is no question of this public body, the Competition Service-I revert to the discussion on the previous matter-being a dead parrot, having no function. It has an important and useful administrative function.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="10122168000091"></a>It should be said that the Competition Appeal Tribunal has a UK-wide jurisdiction. It covers not just England and Wales, but Scotland too. It hears appeals and judicial reviews on competition matters and other related regulated matters, and it has a High Court judge as president, so it is a high-powered, much-respected body. My understanding is that when competition judges from different parts of the world meet together, this body we have in Britain is regarded as a very efficient and effective judicial body. The small-the Minister will, no doubt, indicate how much it costs and so on-Competition Service, which supports the Competition Appeal Tribunal, is virtually part of it. In effect, the Competition Appeal Tribunal administers itself, so if it is abolished, it would be in a much weaker position and would have to go to the more general body, the Tribunals Service, where people would have to be specially trained for the relatively rare cases it received on matters of competition. It would be very different if the Competition Appeal Tribunal was dependent on the large, general Tribunal Services for its support. I think that should be a matter of concern. Any savings from the abolition of the Competition Service seem to me to be most unlikely. It may, indeed, cost more because of the training required for the staff of the general Tribunals Service in order to cope with competition cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="10122168000092"></a>Moreover-and this is a matter on which I should be grateful for an answer-I understand that the Competition Appeal Tribunal and the Competition Service have UK-wide jurisdiction. I think I said that a little earlier, but what I want to say now is that the Tribunals Service, to which the Government seem to intend this body should go for administrative support, has jurisdiction in England and Wales only, and it is being considered by the Government for merger with

The Courts Service covers England and Wales, and the Tribunals Service is largely England and Wales, but it would not be in this particular instance. I wonder whether it is intended that if the Competition Appeal Tribunal is dealing with, say, a Scottish case, it would be administered differently from when it is dealing with an English case. Certainly, there would be expense, trouble and difficulty in training if it were otherwise. I beg to move.</p>

I just want to make a couple of points. We are told that a working group is currently examining the case for abolishing this body. Early in 2011, it will report to the Secretary of State for Justice and the Secretary of State for Business with its recommendations. No final decisions will be taken before then. Apparently, the working group consists of BIS, TS, HMT and Competition Service officials. It is examining all the relevant aspects of a possible transfer and abolition, including financial, legal, judicial and policy. It aims to produce a report for Ministers that sets out the pros and cons of such an abolition and transfer. If that consultation is taking place, it seems to us rather strange that this should appear in Schedule 1. Would it not be preferable if we awaited the outcome of the consultation process? All the other points in relation to this have been made. Given the time, I await eagerly the Minister's response.</p>

He has rightly said that the Competition Appeal Tribunal was created by the Enterprise Act 2002.

I expect the review to reach its conclusions before the Bill reaches the statute book and I assure both noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Young, that the comments they have made in the debate will be taken into account in coming to a final decision.

<a name="10122168000100"></a><b><a name="101221-0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="10122168000143"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Young of Norwood Green for speaking. He made a significant point in saying that if the Government have not yet entirely made up their mind about abolition, this body should never have been included in Schedule 1. I do not think, with respect to the noble Baroness, that she answered that satisfactorily because it could have been included in Schedule 7 if there is such a degree of uncertainty. But I add that I am delighted that there is uncertainty because it shows that the Government are willing to think again about the matter. Further, the fact that they are having discussions with Sir Gerald Barling, the president of the tribunal, is a good thing because, as I indicated earlier, the tribunal and the Competition Service are really one and the same body. I am sure that no one, neither the Government nor anyone else, would want that body to be less effective and efficient than it appears to be according to its worldwide reputation at the moment.</p>

<a name="101221-0003.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="10122168000101"></a>I am also delighted to learn from the noble Baroness that the matter of UK-wide jurisdiction is being considered by the working group. All I can say in a more general way, if I may be permitted, is that it is a great pity that working groups, whether on this particular public body or on others, were not set up before we rushed into a long list of bodies to be abolished in Schedule 1. I thank the noble Baroness and of course I shall withdraw my amendment.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="10122137000003"></a><b><a name="101221-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10122137000131"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning (John Hayes) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10122137000004"></a>I am today setting out our proposed apprenticeships provisions in the forthcoming Education Bill.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10122137000005"></a>Apprenticeship offer to Young People-The Apprenticeships, Schools, Children and Learners Act 2009 (Sections 91-99) introduced an apprenticeship offer for all suitably qualified young people who wanted one. Those young people are:</p>
young people aged 16-18;young people aged 19-24 who have a disability or learning difficulty; andyoung people aged 19-24 who have been in local authority care.
<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10122137000006"></a>This was to be achieved by placing a duty to secure sufficient number and variety of apprenticeship places for those eligible young people on the Chief Executive of Skills Funding. The sections of the Act covering the offer have not been commenced.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10122137000007"></a>The Education Bill will redefine the offer. It will place a higher duty on the Chief Executive of  Skills Funding to prioritise funding for apprenticeship  training for the same people who were covered by the apprenticeship offer and who have secured an apprenticeship.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="10122137000008"></a>This new duty will constitute a much more robust deal for these young people because it will ensure that the Chief Executive of Skills Funding gives priority for funding apprenticeship training to those eligible for the redefined offer. We will continue to work with those key stakeholders representing vulnerable and disadvantaged young people to ensure that they have equal access to redefined offer. This new duty will be more straightforward, more meaningful and less bureaucratic than the apprenticeship offer set out in Sections 91-99 of the Apprenticeships, Schools, Children and Learners Act 2009.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10122137000009"></a>Amendments to functions of the Chief Executive of Skills Funding-The Apprenticeships, Schools, Children and Learners Act 2009 (Section 6) names the Chief Executive of Skills Funding as the certifying authority for apprenticeships. We propose to amend this section in order to give the Secretary of State powers to designate the person or persons to be the certifying authority for apprenticeships in a manner which broadly mirrors similar provisions in Wales.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10122137000010"></a>The rationale for this amendment is that this Government want to see the responsibility for issuing apprenticeships certificates remain with Sector Skills Councils and other sector bodies, rather than the National Apprenticeships Service, to whom the Chief Executive of Skills Funding would delegate this role. The National Apprenticeships Service will continue to  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS172"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column WS172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have end-to-end responsibility for apprenticeships. However, under the new statutory apprenticeship arrangements, the intention is for Sector Skills Councils and sector bodies to issue apprenticeship frameworks. They are best placed, therefore, to ensure that the English framework requirements for the issue of a certificate in respect of the statutory completion conditions are met. In addition, there are currently no contingencies in the England provisions. The amended section will allow the same contingencies in England as in Wales that the Secretary of State may act as the certifying authority where there are no other appropriate persons to do so.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="10122137000012"></a><b><a name="101221-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10122137000133"></a>Lord Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Francis Maude) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10122137000013"></a>I am laying before Parliament today the Civil Service Compensation Scheme (Amendment No.2) Scheme 2010 and the associated revisions to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10122137000014"></a>The new scheme will replace the old scheme which the previous Government tried to reform in February 2010. I first announced that the coalition Government intended to reform the Civil Service compensation scheme on 6 July 2010, following which the Superannuation Bill was introduced to Parliament on 15 July to ensure that reform of the scheme could not be vetoed by any one of the unions. Extensive discussions then took place between officials and ministers and the Civil Service trade unions.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10122137000015"></a>Proposals were put to the Council of Civil Service Unions on 24 September. In the event, the council did not accept those proposals, but five of the unions-Prospect, the FDA, the Prison Officers' Association (POA), the GMB and Unite-approached the Government directly and asked to continue discussions on those terms. There followed an intensive period of meetings between the five unions and officials, which on 5 October resulted in an agreement being reached between the negotiators on terms that might form the basis of a new compensation scheme. The five unions wrote to confirm that these terms had accurately recorded an agreement, that all their negotiating teams were able to recommend positively to their executives, as being the best that might be achieved in negotiation.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10122137000016"></a>Subsequently, the POA's executive committee voted to distance itself from that agreement and to request further discussion. The sixth union, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union, had decided not  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS173"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column WS173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to take part in the talks at the point when the five other unions had agreed to negotiate separately with the Government.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10122137000017"></a>The Superannuation Act 2010, which received Royal Assent on 16 December, amended the Superannuation Act 1972 so as to remove the requirement for agreement of the Civil Service unions to any changes that could reduce the benefits of the compensation scheme. However, during the passage through Parliament of the Superannuation Bill, the Government agreed a number of changes to it, including a further amendment to the Superannuation Act 1972 so as to introduce a clear requirement that future consultation on any changes that would reduce the value of the Civil Service compensation scheme must be undertaken with a view to reaching agreement and that a report is made to Parliament setting out the details of the consultation that has been carried out with the unions.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10122137000018"></a>During the Superannuation Bill's passage through Parliament, the Government remained committed to trying to reach an agreement with the Council of Civil Service Unions and offered every opportunity to those unions that wished to engage constructively in negotiations. Five of them did so, and their proposals formed the basis of the discussions and subsequent agreement on which the new proposed scheme is based.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10122137000019"></a>On 9 November, the Council of Civil Service Unions wrote with suggestions for areas that could be considered in further talks, and I responded on 15 November. The suggestions made in the council's letter would have had the effect of reducing the level of compensation paid to many lower-paid civil servants, and I therefore did not wish those suggestions to form the basis of further discussions. Having a new scheme that provides genuinely better protection for the lowest-paid Civil Service workers, many of whom are members of the PCS, has been an important aim of the Government throughout the discussions on reform.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10122137000020"></a>I explained to the Council of Civil Service Unions that, in the absence of detailed proposals from the PCS, work would have to proceed on drafting the rules for a new scheme. On 6 December 2010 officials sent the draft rules for the new compensation scheme to the Council of Civil Service Unions to seek its views. Those rules form the basis of the new compensation scheme, which is being laid before Parliament today.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="10122137000021"></a>The Superannuation Act 2010 provides a fall-back position by introducing statutory caps on compensation which would be applied if, for any reason, the Government cannot implement the new proposals. The Government are now in a position to be able to repeal the caps set out in the Act through the Superannuation Act 2010 (Repeal of Limits on Compensation) Order 2010, which comes into force today. The repeal means that the statutory caps of a maximum of 15 months' pay for voluntary departures and 12 months' pay for compulsory departures, will not apply to the new Civil Service Compensation Scheme that is starting on 22 December 2010.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10122137000022"></a>The key points of the new Civil Service Compensation Scheme are as follows:</p>

Staff will be asked to surrender some (or all) of their severance payment to meet the cost of receiving this pension early.

one month's pay per year of service up to 12 months. All staff who may face compulsory redundancy will first have had the opportunity to exit under voluntary terms.

all staff earning less than £23,000, on a full time equivalent basis, will be treated as if they earn £23,000 for the purpose of calculating their redundancy payments; andthere will also be an upper pay threshold of £149,820. Staff earning more will have their salary capped at this figure for the purpose of calculating their redundancy payments.<h2 align="center"><a name="10122137000146"></a>Consolidated Fund Bill</h2>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="10122137000103"></a>I am today laying before the House a Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules pertaining to tier 1 and tier 2 of the points-based system. Copies of which will be available from the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="10122137000104"></a>On 28 June the Home Secretary announced in the House of Commons that the Government would introduce an interim limit on economic migration in anticipation of the introduction of a permanent limit in April 2011. This limit applied to out-of-country main applicants to tier 1 (general) between 19 July 2010 and April 2011 and numbers entering through this route would be equal to those entering in the equivalent period for 2009-10. The limit also applied to number of migrants who can be offered jobs by sponsor employers through tier 2 (general). This route was to be reduced in the interim period by 1,300 migrants, the equivalent of a 5 per cent reduction across the relevant routes of tiers 1 and 2.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="10122137000105"></a>The first of the changes in the Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules will close the tier 1 (general) category of the Immigration Rules to persons applying from outside the United Kingdom. I am taking this step as a result of the volume of applications that have been received since 19 July 2010, the date I set the interim limit on tier 1 general.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="10122137000106"></a>The second of these changes, specifying the level of the tier 2 (general) interim limit in the Immigration Rules, is being made to take account of the Divisional Court judgment of 17 December 2010 in the cases brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the English Community Care Association. The Divisional Court determined that in order for the Government's interim limit policy to have legal effect the level of the limit should be specified in the Immigration Rules, as opposed to UK Border Agency guidance.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="10122137000107"></a>The Statement of Changes remedies the matter. The interim limit on tier 2 (general) will apply from  21 December 2010 until 5 April 2011. The level of the limit is 10,832 and will apply to the number of certificates of sponsorship available to licensed tier 2 (general) sponsors. The changes will take effect immediately to ensure that employers and other users of the UK's immigration system have certainty about its operation. I would welcome the opportunity to debate these Immigration Rules changes should Members choose to pray against the Statement of Changes.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="10122137000108"></a>The Home Secretary has been granted a certificate to appeal; either directly to the Supreme Court if it grants permission or, if not, to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="10122137000109"></a>Tier 1 (general) will be closed to out of country applications because of the number of applications that have been received since 19 July 2010. The route is not being closed in response to the Divisional Court's decision.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="10122137000110"></a>The Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules laid before Parliament on 28 June 2010 was constructed to provide for the application of interim limits on the number of applications for entry clearance granted under the tier 1 (general) category. Under the Immigration Rules as amended by the changes made on 19 July, applications over and above this upper interim limit would be rolled over for consideration in a subsequent grant period. However, as the Home Secretary announced to Parliament on 23 November, the Government have decided tier 1 (general) route will not continue in its current form and will be refocused as a route aimed at entrepreneurs, investors and the exceptionally talented. This means that there will be no additional allocation of places under the tier 1 (general) category under which rolled-over applications could be considered once the current interim limit is reached.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="10122137000111"></a>We should not continue to accept applications under the existing route if they cannot be granted once the current interim limit is reached. We expect, taking into account current trends in applications and refusal rates, the interim limit to be reached imminently. The Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules therefore removes existing provision for the granting of entry clearance in the tier 1 (general) category.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para99"></a>

I also wish to clarify that the numerical limit applied to tier 1 applications under the interim limit is 5,100 and not 5,400 as the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee has previously been informed. The latter figure was the limit that would have applied if interim limits had commenced on 1 July 2010, whereas in fact they commenced on  19 July 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a><a name="10122137000113"></a>This change is effective from 23 December and applications for entry clearance as a tier 1 (general) migrant made on or after that date will not be accepted. Applications for entry clearance as a tier 1 (general) migrant made before that date will still be considered against the existing Immigration Rules. These changes do not apply to those who have existing leave in the tier 1 (general) category and require an extension of stay, nor do they apply to those presently in the United Kingdom in another category of stay and are applying for a variation of leave as a tier 1 (general) migrant.</p>

This will ensure that tier 1 continues to offer a route for those who are able to make the greatest economic contribution to the United Kingdom. These changes will be introduced in April next year and I will announce the detail of these new arrangements to Parliament in due course.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="10122137000121"></a>As I explained to the House yesterday, in light of the early and severe onset of winter last month I asked David Quarmby CBE to follow up his earlier review of winter resilience with an urgent audit of how well  


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS182"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column WS182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>highway authorities and transport operators in England have coped with the cold weather between 24 November and 9 December 2010. David's report to me is published today (transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk) and copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="10122137000122"></a>In the main, he has found that the country's transport systems coped well with the early severe weather during that period. However, given the more recent extreme cold snap, and that forecasts predict snow into the new year, we welcome David's recommendations on how we can further bolster our resilience. It is now vitally important that those to who they are addressed take these recommendations forward without delay.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="10122137000123"></a>The audit emphasises the volatile nature of British weather, but notes the Met Office's view that the three severe winters are genuinely independent events. However, as I explained to the House yesterday, I will be assessing advice from the Government's chief scientific advisor, Professor Sir John Beddington, on the longer-term implications of the changing climate and the way in which they should influence our investment decisions across the sector in relation to winter resilience.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="10122137000124"></a>The report finds that local highway authorities generally coped well with the extreme and early winter conditions, but used a significant amount of their salt stocks in doing so. To assist with salt supply over the Christmas and new year holiday period when deliveries from the mines tend to become more infrequent, I am making available to highways authorities 30,000 tonnes from the national strategic salt supply which was established earlier in the year in response to Quarmby's first review. I have also asked the Highways Agency to make arrangements for the import of further supplies of salt, up to an additional 250,000 tonnes, to strengthen further our resilience. This is expected to start arriving in January.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="10122137000125"></a>But we need to ensure that we make the best possible use of existing stocks, new mine production and imported supplies. As we cannot be sure how long the current severe weather will persist, or how often it will recur this winter, prudence requires that all highway authorities should critically examine their current levels of usage and look for economies to maximise the duration of existing stocks.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="10122137000126"></a>Varying spread rates between local highway authorities has been identified as a concern for David Quarmby. I have already asked the UK Roads Liaison Group and the National Winter Service Research Group to prepare additional straightforward guidance on spread rates based on all evidence available, so that all highway authorities can adopt the practice of the best.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="10122137000127"></a>The report also refers to the extraordinary events that occurred on the M25 at junction 3 on 30 November. Highways Agency officials have already briefed me on these events, and I look forward to a full report in due course analysing the incident and setting out the lessons that the agency have learnt.</p>

<a name="101221-wms0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a><a name="10122137000128"></a>The rail network has been particularly badly affected by the weather this year, perhaps in contrast to the  two previous winters. Quarmby's recommendations here are for the longer term; and I am asking the  rail industry to formulate proposals on contingency   


<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS183"></a><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column WS183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>timetables, real-time information and third rail alternatives.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="10122137000129"></a>Although the focus today is very much on aviation and the problems at Heathrow in particular, this was less of an issue during the period that this report covers and there are therefore no specific recommendations directed at the aviation sector. It is clear, however, that, as a separate piece of work, we will need to work with

<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="10122137000130"></a>I would like to thank David Quarmby, who has delivered this audit report to a very challenging  timetable. As with his previous reports, his analysis and recommendations are clear-sighted, and will help the transport sector to improve its resilience to winter weather.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_71"></a><a name="10122141000102"></a>The interests of the victim to be provided with the personal information of the offender, such as their release location, must be balanced against the offender's interests and privacy and the need to rehabilitate the offender. There are sound public protection reasons for doing this, as it is necessary to ensure the successful supervision and re-integration of offenders into the community and prevent reoffending. Releasing the whereabouts of a particular offender's location could undermine this process and reduce the likelihood of a successful, law abiding resettlement.</p>

A survey in 2008 established that 15 million people are severely and moderately food insecure and recent surveys suggest the situation is not improving. Through our humanitarian programme, The Department for International Development (DfID) is helping many thousands of children every year receive therapeutic food and treatment. Last year, we helped more than 55,000 children and expect to double our assistance to malnourished children in the year ahead. The UK is also tackling food insecurity by building roads, stimulating food production by making it easier for farmers to get goods to market.</p>

The NAO is typically a high-level public servant of the Treasury or Ministry of Finance in the country concerned.

Ellaone was licensed for use as a single 30 mg dose for emergency contraception by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (CHMP) in May 2009. It is used to prevent pregnancy for up to five days after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure, mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation. Ellaone is contraindicated for use during an existing or suspected pregnancy.</p>

<a name="101221w0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_117"></a><a name="10122141000175"></a>In the United Kingdom, Ellaone is licensed as a prescription-only medicine. Under medicines legislation, prescription-only medicines may generally only be sold or supplied by, or under the supervision of, a pharmacist on registered pharmacy premises against a prescription written by an independent prescriber. These legal restrictions apply equally to sale, supply and advertising of medicines via the internet.</p>

<a name="101221w0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_118"></a><a name="10122141000176"></a>Full information relating to the safe and appropriate use of a medicine is provided to healthcare professionals in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and to women in the patient information leaflet (PIL). The SmPC and PIL for Ellaone clearly inform women and healthcare professionals that it should not be taken by a woman who knows she is pregnant and that a pregnancy test should be undertaken if she suspects she is pregnant. The SmPC and PIL also provide information on the known side-effects for Ellaone, most common of which are headache, nausea, menstrual disorders, and abdominal pain.</p>

<a name="101221w0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_119"></a><a name="10122141000177"></a>There is no published experience of pregnancy termination with Ellaone and in clinical studies a 30 mg dose of ulipristal acetate did not interrupt existing pregnancies. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that such an effect could not be excluded and that Ellaone could potentially be used off-label in an attempt to terminate pregnancy. On this basis, no information on the potential use of ulipristal as an abortifacient has been included in the information provided for doctors and women. However, the publicly available risk management plan for Ellaone includes a number of measures taken to minimise the potential risk of off-label use, including a post marketing study to monitor how Ellaone is being used in real life.</p>

<a name="101221w0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_120"></a><a name="10122141000178"></a>When used in accordance with the product information, Ellaone is a safe and effective option for emergency contraception. As with all marketed medicines used in the UK, the safety of Ellaone is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with independent expert advice from the Commission on Human Medicines. In the event of any important new safety information emerging, the MHRA will take action to ensure that this is accurately reflected in the product information and communicated to health professionals and women.</p>

The Student Loans Company (SLC) is in the last phase of a three-year service transformation programme, which began in 2009 to deliver a centralised, predominantly online student finance service for students known as Student Finance England (SFE). SFE has been taking on board one new academic cohort at a time from local authorities and progressively implementing improvements to the way students apply for support and graduates throughout the UK repay their loans.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_121"></a><a name="10122141000181"></a>The weak performance of the Student Loans Company in 2009 under the previous Administration was completely unacceptable. The new Government acted quickly, replacing the company's senior team and making clear our expectation for substantial improvements for students taking out a loan last summer. The Student Loans Company has significantly improved its service this year, though there is no room for complacency. There is still more to do to ensure that the service continues to improve and that students and their families receive the level of service that they have a right to expect. My department continues to work with the SLC to that end.</p>

Immigration Act powers of detention are not time-limited, nor do they require judicial involvement. This is a long-standing position that has been accepted by the courts and is fully in accord with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Individuals who are detained under Immigration Act powers are able to apply to an immigration judge for release on bail and can challenge the lawfulness of their detention by way of judicial review. The question of possible constitutional implications does not, therefore, arise.</p>

The number of Dalit children now enrolled in school is in proportion with their share of the overall population. However, there are significant economic and social challenges in ensuring that Dalit and other disadvantaged children remain in school. The Indian Government, state governments and the Department for International Development (DfID) are working together to support disadvantaged children to complete their education, including by improving classroom practices and involving the community. We are looking at specific help for Dalit children and hope to make a further announcement on this shortly.</p>

The Kosova Force (KFOR), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation peacekeeping force, has drawn down to a deterrent presence of 8,430 military personnel, with plans for a further drawdown to 5,000 in February 2011, and to 2,500 when conditions allow. The International Civilian Office, which will remain present until the International Steering Group determines that Kosovo has implemented the terms of the Comprehensive Settlement Proposal, has already downsized aspects of its operation in line with progress made.</p>
