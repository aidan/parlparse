<a name="60131-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Willoughby de Broke </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will permit rendering plants to continue to use tallow as boiler fuel.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, rendering plants may continue to use tallow as boiler fuel provided that they comply with regulatory requirements. Those include an authorisation under the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005 and an environmental permit issued under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 incorporating the requirements of the EU Waste Incineration Directive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Willoughby de Broke: </b>   My Lords, I am only mildly grateful to the Minister for that reply. Will he admit that this is gross gold-plating of a classic kind? Will he admit, first, that the Commission has said that it is unnecessary to classify tallow under the Waste Incineration Directive, and, secondly, that no other member states, apart from Belgium, are implementing the directive in the same heavy-handed and expensive way as we are? Can the noble Lord explain to us why we are doing that and what the costs to industry are of implementing the directive in the way that he has just suggested?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I am only mildly surprised that the noble Lord is mildly disappointed with my Answer. This is not gold-plating. The EU is clear, as is our legal advice, that the burning of tallow as fuel is subject to the requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive. We do not like the fact that it is; indeed, complaints by industry and concerns expressed by fellow Ministers in Defra have resulted in the EU Environment Commissioner saying that a study will take place. It is hoped that that will result in some conclusions in 2006, but I cannot promise that the legislation will be changed this year or even next. Like the noble Lord, we are not happy with the situation, but I have to tell him that embassies around Europe tell us that many more countries than the one that he has mentioned&#151;nine in all&#151;are definitely applying the directive to tallow. Is he really suggesting that once we are a member of a club we can break the rules?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, let us be clear about this. Is my noble friend wrong when he says that, if the Government continue to insist that tallow be burnt in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_124"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

plants complying with the Waste Incineration Directive, we and Belgium will be the only countries in the EU so insisting? If that is right, what is wrong with my noble friend&#039;s criticism? Is it not obvious that the Government are showing a determination to apply European regulation in as punishing a manner as possible?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, is wrong about this, going by the inquiries that we have made of embassies in EU countries. Nine countries&#151;plus us&#151;are definitely applying the directive to tallow: Portugal, Slovenia, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic and Cyprus. Others are probably applying it, and there may be one that is not. However, as I said, if we are a member of a club, are we prepared to break the rules of that club just because some other countries do the same?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I expect that the Minister would accept that a club can occasionally get the rules wrong. This is a good example of backward thinking. There are a couple of examples where something regarded as waste should be regarded as a fuel. Does the Minister accept that the Treasury has increased the tax on waste vegetable oil&#151;industry has gone to a lot of trouble to be able to convert it into fuel, thereby making massive carbon savings&#151;by 20p per litre, confirming that the Government&#039;s attitude to the definitions of &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;fuel&quot; is as mixed as Europe&#039;s?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the EU directive sets out what constitutes waste. Our legal advice is clear that tallow is waste. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, however, that not everything that comes out of the Commission is necessarily perfect. This certainly is not. We want to see the position changed; the question is whether we break the rules until it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the vice-chairman of the British Association of Biofuels and Oils. Does the Minister agree that rendering and use of tallow as a fuel is an excellent example of waste disposal and recycling? He tells us that 10 member states are abiding by the directive, which means that 15 are not. Is that a level playing field?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I do not know about some of the other member states. I have told the House as best I can which ones are definitely applying the directive. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Carter, said at the start of his question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Glenarthur: </b>   My Lords, given the Minister&#039;s views about maintaining the rules of the club, is he suggesting that tallow burning is more of a contaminant to the environment than the burning of diesel, which would otherwise have to be used as a boiler fuel?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I am not saying that at all. I am saying that the directive and the regulation that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_125"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

has been transposed into English law say that. That is the legal advice that we have had. We want to change the situation. Biodiesel from tallow, of course, is not affected because, there, tallow is turned into another material and apparently ceases to be waste. That being so, my Lords, perhaps tallow users might consider selling their tallow to those who make biodiesel. We are very keen to encourage that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, the Minister has told us that the legal instructions are clear. Has he examined the technical facts? When it comes to breaking the rules, perhaps he could delay them somewhat.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, as usual the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, asks a wise question. There is a procedure for operators to appeal against any condition of an authorisation or permit. It is up to the Secretary of State to consider that appeal. There is no time limit on how long she has to consider the appeal. While the appeal is being considered, there is a duty on the operator to comply. However, perhaps more often than not, regulators take good notice of the fact that there has been an appeal.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spopq1"></a><b> Baroness Massey of Darwen </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What improvements they have recently made to the arrangements for transfer from primary to secondary schools.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My Lords, we have improved the admissions process for parents with effect from last year by requiring local authorities to co-ordinate secondary admissions for all schools in their area. Parents now express their school preferences on one application form and receive the best available offer of a place in line with their preferences on 1 March each year. That prevents parents holding multiple offers. We are also improving the transfer of essential pupil data from primary to secondary school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Does he agree that the transfer from primary to secondary school is one of the most important transitions in a child&#039;s life and that we must get it as right as possible? Many local authorities are striving hard. Do we have feedback from parents, pupils and schools on what works?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60131-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, parents need the best possible information on which to base their judgments on primary to secondary transfer. I know that my noble friend has a particular interest in the London Borough of Southwark in which she is a school <br>&nbsp;<br>

governor. Southwark operates a number of initiatives better to inform parents about secondary options in their area. They include an annual exhibition that all schools attend, at which information is presented by the secondary schools in the borough. It also operates an on-track initiative focused on schools with a high proportion of parents with English as a second language in which parents are given advice on options available to them, receive help with form filling and have the admissions process explained to them, including videos. The borough also lays on minibuses to transport parents and children to open evenings at schools. Those are all initiatives that we believe are worthwhile in helping better to inform parental choice.

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that four out of 10 pupils make no progress in maths or English in their first year in secondary school? In the light of that, it is important to focus on initiatives that involve the pupils. What are the Government doing to encourage initiatives such as student contact across the primary/secondary divide, buddying, and joint academic, sporting and leisure events that involve both schools?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness raises an important issue. The specialist schools programme which now includes two-thirds of all secondary schools has a particular strand focused on bringing primary and secondary schools together in joint partnerships to take forward the kind of initiatives that the noble Baroness mentioned. A crucial factor, in particular for pupils not making enough progress, is the transfer of information between primary and secondary schools on pupil progress. The department has introduced a number of initiatives including a new school-to-school secure data-transfer site to provide for the electronic transfer of information between primary and secondary schools so that secondary school teachers start off with much better information about the progress of their pupils when they arrive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, is it the Government&#039;s intention to place a similar duty on local authorities to that in Clause 12 of the Childcare Bill; that is, for the local authority to provide parents with information on all secondary education and other relevant services, thereby no doubt helping parents to make a better informed choice?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, all the local authorities that I know provide that information. I shall consider further whether there should be a legal duty on them to do so and come back to the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise the difficulties that many children in the care of the state may experience during the transition from primary to secondary school and their need for excellent support from their carers in that important process? Does the noble Lord understand the urgent need to make more attractive the role of foster carer and residential childcare worker in children&#039;s homes, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_127"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

given the fact that last year vacancy rates for staff in children&#039;s homes increased beyond an already highly unacceptable level and that there is still a significant shortage of foster carers?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Earl raises a number of important issues. It is partly to meet the concerns that he raises that we are about to lay regulations before the House to give children in care the first priority for admissions to secondary schools so that the best possible arrangements are in place for their transfer to secondary education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister tell us what is the situation for those with SENs when they transfer? Does the department issue instructions or guidance to help people get that transition correct?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the department has issued considerable guidance on the transfer of pupils with special educational needs, including the obligation on schools named in statements to accept pupils without a capacity for them to contest it. That gives pupils with special educational needs the support that they need in making the transfer to secondary education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that those who find the transition most difficult are probably those who are well behind in reading and arithmetic? Although the Government&#039;s proposal to spend &#163;335 million on catch-up in secondary schools is welcome, would it not be a good move to spend more on catch-up for such children before they make the transition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is completely right. That is precisely why we asked Jim Rose, former senior HM inspector, to look at the early teaching of reading. At the end of last year he produced his preliminary report, which emphasised the need for rigorous approaches, including synthetic phonics, to the teaching of reading at the beginning of primary education. His second report, which we expect in a month&#039;s time, will look at catch- up programmes, particularly programmes such as Reading Recovery, which appear to make a big difference for those who are falling behind in the first and second years of their primary education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Harrison: </b>   My Lords, I return to the original Question. Is there not a more methodical way of garnering feedback from pupils and parents who have gone through the experience and from schools so that we can improve the system?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, schools are always seeking to learn what works best from the experience of pupils and parents. One test of whether the system is working well is the number of parents who appeal against admissions decisions for secondary schools. The latest figures that I have, for 2003&#150;04, show a significant decline in appeals, from 50,200 to 46,500. It looks as if schools are learning something from the experiences of those who have gone before.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether they propose to make representations in line with the objectives of their housing policy concerning the proposed imminent sale by the Church Commissioners of three Octavia Hill estates in south London.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  My Lords, the Government have no locus in the arrangements. The Church Commissioners are a private landlord, and their statutory obligation is to manage their investments in the wider interests of the Church community.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Does she agree that the original intention of Octavia Hill was for the estates to be social housing in perpetuity; that the inevitable consequences of those estates being transferred to a private landlord will be that rents will rise over time to the market level; and that, as existing tenants move on, those estates will quickly cease to be social housing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I agree that when Octavia Hill was charged by the Church Commissioners with the management of the estates in the 1880s it was as housing for poor people. She was obviously a woman of strong opinions, and I suspect that she would be welcome in your Lordships&#039; House. Her progressive principles remain an inspiration to this Government, as we attempt to increase social housing in London through Housing Corporation social housing grants. I cannot speculate on future rent levels because they will depend on a number of elements, particularly on the nature of the tenancies held, which are many and various.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a member of the Church of England. Does my noble friend agree that, although the Church Commissioners have an exacting task in managing the finances of the Church well, the purpose of doing that is to enable the Church to fulfil its function as a Church? I cannot think of anything more important in the application of Christian principles than having the provision of social housing at the forefront of its priorities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60131-02_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I am delighted that my noble friend has identified himself as a member of that august body. He is right that the Church Commissioners have a responsibility to balance their responsibilities to the wider Church&#151;pensions and other clergy interests&#151;and to the tenants for whom social housing in the charge of the Church Commissioners has a particular value and provides a particular form of security.
</p>

my diocese. On the other hand, like all diocesan bishops, I am paid and housed by the Church Commissioners, and I am grateful to them for the careful way in which they manage their affairs. Nevertheless, is the Minister aware that many of us in the Church would be greatly disturbed if the Octavia Hill houses were not sold to a social landlord? We believe that no charity optimises its assets if, by maximising them, it risks damaging the charity&#039;s good name.
</p>

<a name="60131-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, there is considerable dissent among Church lawyers regarding the duties on the Church Commissioners concerning this estate. The Church Commissioners may have been advised that they have to maximise their returns in disposing of the premises. Might the Minister get the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to cast his eye over the case of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, who took the Church Commissioners to the High Court in 1991 on the issue? The judgment that came forth from the vice-chancellor gives a landmark guidance, which I suggest the Church Commissioners ought now to follow, with the consequences referred to by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60131-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I am surprised and disappointed to find that there is such dissent among the Church lawyers, which is not what might be expected from that most harmonious of institutions. I do not know the case that the noble Lord refers to. I am sure that my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General would prefer not to be involved. I will make sure that the information is drawn to the attention of other interested parties.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60131-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, will the Government confirm that the first and second Church Commissioners&#151;on behalf of the established Church&#151;are appointed by and on behalf of the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister? Therefore to go so strongly against government policy, which has wide support in the country, as well as to sail extremely close to the rules of charitable law, seems a little odd.

In a small number of instances where a hospital has exceeded its planned level of activity, they have been asked to go slower for the remainder of this financial year on a clinically safe basis. Information is not available centrally on the number of locally postponed operations. Any such postponements that are taking place should be viewed in the context that, by the end of 2005, no patient was expected to wait more than six months for in-patient treatment, compared with three to four times that long in 1997.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60131-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, some of these facts are very uncomfortable and I feel under a public duty to bring them to the attention of the House. In 1996&#150;97, the deficit in the NHS was &#163;460 million, which was about 1.5 per cent of turnover, whereas last year it was &#163;250 million, which was about 0.4 per cent of turnover. I suggest that we are seeing improving financial management under this Government as well as more investment. It is also true that next year, as with this year, the NHS will receive nearly 10 per cent extra in cash and another 10 per cent on top of that. We think that the NHS can deliver with those levels of investment.

<a name="60131-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, if all that extra money has been poured in, why is the health service in a worse state now than at any time that anyone can remember?

<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60131-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there are many statistics that I could give the noble Baroness, but I shall give a few: better death rates in relation to cancer; longer survival rates for coronary heart disease; massive improvements in waiting times; and improvements in A&E services where people wait no longer than four hours compared with perhaps 12 hours on a trolley under the previous government.

<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60131-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that no matter how much money we give to a public service&#151;in this case the health service&#151;there will always be pressures to spend more and, therefore, there will always be the anomaly to which the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, referred? There is simply no way out of the fact that public service bodies have to meet an efficiency requirement. We want them to do that and, therefore, we shall have the anomalies referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. That is totally unavoidable unless the whole of economics suddenly disappears.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>

<a name="60131-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the reason for the cancellation of so many operations at the moment is that trusts are required to implement the increased salary costs of Agenda for Change part way through a financial year at the behest of his department? In view of that, can he tell us whether the cost of financial turnaround consultants will be borne by the department or by the trusts?

<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60131-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, huge amounts of money have been given to the NHS, as I have said. We have funded those increases in the allocations that have been made to PCTs. For the record, cancellations at the last minute are down 16 per cent over the last three years. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, asked about postponements, as I understood.

Currently that cohort of doctors faces potential unemployment.

It may be helpful to the House if I spell out the document, which is available for everyone to see&#151;if they picked it up on the way in&#151;on the suggested conduct of the debate.

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The first speaker will be my noble friend the Leader of the House, who will move the principal motion. Then we will hear from the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who will move his amendment. Then we will hear from the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and from other principal players in today&#039;s debate: the leader of the Cross-Benchers, the noble Lord, Lord Williamson; the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick; and the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara. After that, we will hear the movers of the various amendments in turn: the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, will move Amendment No. 2, which is an amendment to Amendment. No. 1; then my noble friend Lord Barnett will speak to Amendments Nos. 3 and 4; and speaking to Amendment No. 5 will be my noble friend Lady Gould.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The debate will be concluded with a response from my noble friend the Leader of the House. The House will then reach a decision on the amendments as they are listed. Let me repeat the logic: the first decision will be on an amendment to the first amendment, which is the vote on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Geddes; and we will then have the vote on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. We will then decide on the other amendments in order: that is Amendment No. 3, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett; Amendment No. 4, also tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett; Amendment No. 5, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould; and then, if necessary, the decision on the principal Motion.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>I hope that that works. I hope that, if we approve the decision to have a Speaker, this will possibly be one of the last times that I have to do anything like this.

<a name="60131-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, presumably it is in order for any noble Lord to oppose any of the amendments and to speak at the appropriate points. The noble Lord has given the impression that the debate will be restricted to those he has just mentioned.

<a name="60131-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   My Lords, it is quite right to say that it is in order, but the combined wisdom of the usual channels, aided and abetted by precedent, is that the House normally finds it convenient to have a general debate on the wide question and on the amendments as moved&#151;I have listed how the amendments will be moved. Of course it would be in order, when the amendments are moved, for anyone opposing them specifically at that stage to speak. However, I am not sure that the House would be entirely thrilled if we had a series of mini-debates following the general debate. Perhaps I can test the mood of the House on that, but we will fall off that bridge when we come to it.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60131-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos </b> ) rose to move, further to the resolution of the House of 12 July 2005, that the Report of the Select Committee on the Speakership of the House of Lords (HL Paper 92) be approved; and that an election be held no later than 30 June 2006.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving the Motion standing in my name, I pay tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and to all members of the committee for their work.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>This House prides itself on taking an evolutionary approach to change. That approach has been evident in consideration of the Speakership of this House. The issue was first raised in June 2003, considered by a Select Committee and reported on in November 2003, and debated in this House in January 2004 and July 2005.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Following the debate in July last year, the House made an important decision. It resolved:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;That this House should elect its own presiding officer;&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/07/05; col. 1002.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>and that a Select Committee on the Speakership of the House be appointed to consider further how to implement this resolution, with full regard to the House&#039;s tradition of self-regulation. That committee has now done its job and has produced a report on how the House&#039;s decision could be implemented.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>I think the chairman and members of the committee have done something genuinely outstanding. Having started their inquiry with strongly held and differing views about the right way forward for the House on the issue of the Speakership, they have produced a unanimous report. I do not underestimate that achievement and thank all members of the committee for their hard work and dedication in this matter. They <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_135"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have done the House a great service in identifying a model for the Speakership around which a consensus can be built.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Noble Lords will know from the speeches I have made in this Chamber and from the evidence I gave to the committee that, in some respects, the committee&#039;s conclusions do not match my own views on the role of a Speaker in this House. There are some areas in which I would have gone further, but I am well aware of the strength of feeling and divergent views in this House. The committee has found a middle course which sits well with the traditions and history of the House while recognising the need to move forward.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>At the centre of the committee&#039;s proposals is a recognition and restatement of the importance of self-regulation to the culture and ethos of our House. In protecting that principle, the committee has crafted a role for a Speaker covering three distinct and important areas: a role in the Chamber; a role in the House, outside the Chamber; and a wider representational role, including public engagement. I attach great importance to all three areas and would like to address each in turn.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The committee makes the important point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;It is odd that the Lord on the Woolsack should be the only member of the House who is prohibited from assisting&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>the House when procedural guidance is required. The committee proposed that an elected Speaker would spend more time in the Chamber, take the Chair in Committee of the Whole House and, like other Members of the House, give procedural guidance where appropriate. I share this view. As the House knows, I would have gone further and transferred the limited role performed by the Leader at Question Time to the Speaker. I do not share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that the authority of the Leader rests with the role performed by the Leader at Question Time. However, this is a matter for the House to decide and I am happy to abide by the will of the House. With respect to the role of the Speaker outside the Chamber, the committee proposed that the Speaker should become Chairman of the House Committee, a member of the Procedure Committee, take responsibility for security and become one of the three keyholders of Westminster Hall. I endorse these proposals.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The committee also set out a role for the Speaker representing the House at home and abroad and acting as an apolitical spokesperson. The House will know that I am of the view that any Speaker should have a strong representational role and a strong role in public engagement. The committee also identified a number of other functions which could be transferred to the Speaker, including in relation to Private Notice Questions, the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule and authorising the recall of Parliament after consultation. In our debate in July I said that I do not consider having a presiding officer and self-regulation as mutually exclusive. I remain of that view. The committee has set out a role for a Speaker in this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_136"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Chamber which not only preserves the principle of self-regulation in this House but has the capacity to enhance it by ensuring that it works.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I will not go into the details of amendments standing in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, my noble friends Lord Barnett and Lady Gould, or the noble Lord, Lord Geddes. My Motion is clear: acceptance of the committee&#039;s report in its entirety. I recognise that there are some elements of the report which Members of this House will want strongly to support, and other elements which they may be willing to support. That is the nature of compromise, and it is for that reason that I will not be voting for any of the amendments put before the House today. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the members of his committee have given us a workable solution, and I endorse it.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Let me now turn to the second part of my Motion. The Motion proposes that an election be held no later than June 30. It may be helpful if I set out briefly what I think would happen between now and the end of June if, and only if, the House agrees today&#039;s Motion. The domestic committees of the House would be invited to consider the various matters set out in the report of the Speakership Committee, and the Senior Salaries Review Body would be invited to make a recommendation on remuneration, again, as suggested by the Speakership Committee. The House would then consider any recommendations put to it and make any decisions needed to allow us to hold an election in June. For example, the proposed Standing Order changes would be brought before the Procedure Committee, and then the House, for approval. From mid-May to mid-June nominations would open and candidates&#039; statements would be prepared. As with the hereditary Peers&#039; elections, the precise arrangements would be entrusted to the House authorities, under the Clerk of the Parliaments. The election itself would be held in late June; the Queen&#039;s approval of our choice would then be obtained; the results of the election would be announced in early July; and the new Speaker would take up their post.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>We are at the threshold of an important change. We have the opportunity now to enhance this House&#039;s central tradition&#151;that of self-regulation&#151;by choosing to elect a Speaker from our own number, a Speaker who will be manifestly independent and able to represent the interests of all the Members of our House, not one representing the views of the usual channels. As I have said before, I do not think it is appropriate for a government Minister to continue to be the Speaker of an independent legislative chamber. It is time to move on. We have the template and I very much hope that we will follow the example of the Select Committee on the Speakership and make this important change together and unanimously. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="60131-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Moved, further to the resolution of the House of 12 July 2005, that the Report of the Select Committee on the Speakership of the House of Lords (HL Paper 92) be approved; and that an election be held no later than 30 June 2006.&#151;(<i>Baroness Amos</i>.)

<a name="60131-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde </b>   rose to move, as an amendment to the Motion standing in the name of the Lord President, in line 3, after &quot;approved&quot; to insert &quot;except that the office of Speaker should be combined with that of Chairman of Committees&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I commend the Leader of the House for the entirely reasonable way in which she proposed her Motion. I am delighted to join her in welcoming the report. I hope she agrees with me that it shows the great benefit of having second thoughts, as this report is considerably better than the original one which was published as far back as November 2003.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>This debate is therefore the culmination of a long-running saga. The loss of the Lord Chancellor has been a bitterly divided process and many Peers on all sides will be very sad to see a line of Lord Chancellors sitting on the Woolsack, stretching back to time immemorial, now being broken. I am one of those who does not believe that we were demeaned by having a Lord Chancellor named as our Speaker, any more than the US Senate is by having the vice-president as its presiding officer. On the contrary, I have always positively welcomed the presence of the Lord Chancellor on the Woolsack. It honoured the House and represented the House in Cabinet. We shall lose both of those now. So it would be right to pay more than a passing tribute to all those Lord Chancellors whose arms we see above and about us and who served this House so well.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Also like many noble Lords, I hope that even now the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will agree to stay with us on the Woolsack for as long as he remains Lord Chancellor. Unfortunately, on page 12 of the evidence, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Indeed, I think the norm should be that if you are ministerially in charge of a department you should be in that department to provide leadership to both civil servants and fellow politicians. I therefore regard it as my role to be in Selborne House where the Department for Constitutional Affairs is based&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>So there it is. The noble and learned Lord wants to go, no doubt to do better things than this House. But I hope he will still feel that this House is his scene. We shall always be glad to see him when he visits us&#151;welcoming even&#151;although I hope he brings with him far less legislation and far better legislation than he sometimes has done in the past.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I say to those who share my sadness today that, whatever we feel, we cannot hold the noble and learned Lord here. We must agree to other arrangements now that he has said he wants to go. We must look to the future, not regret a gracious past. Of course, there is a small consolation in that the grand suite of offices in your Lordships&#039; House currently occupied by the department will now be freed up for the use of Peers.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The Select Committee, chaired so ably by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has done a good job. I congratulate it and, like the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, I agree with much of its report. I agree with the absolute central importance of self-regulation to the nature of this House. Its civility, courtesy, sense of proportion, intolerance of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_138"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

grandstanding and self-promotion&#151;so much in contrast to daily conduct in another place&#151;owe much to self-regulation. Without self-restraint we could not function. Because we have self-restraint, I believe we function outstandingly well.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that it is sensible to allow the Peer in the Chair to offer the same advice to the House on procedure as any other noble Lord, but we will still, for example, continue to look to the Whips on the government Front Bench for their invaluable guidance. We on these Benches will do all we can to assist them. Indeed, all Peers should play their part.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I welcome the committee&#039;s conclusion that the Leader of the House should continue to lead us at Question Time. As the House knows from earlier debates and my evidence to the committee, I think that it is extremely important that we do not inadvertently change the role of Leader of the House as a servant of the whole House as a by-product of this process. So I support this whole-House role and therefore cannot support the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, unless she produces a brilliantly original argument when she moves her amendment.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I am sorry that the committee did not go a further step and leave decisions on Private Notice Questions with the Leader. The committee feared that there was a risk of political bias. I disagree, and I still do not know why the committee ever thought there could be. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, will explain when he comes to speak. I have never known such political bias, or ever even suspected it. As Leader of the Opposition and leader of the party with most to lose if there was such a risk, I must tell the House that I strongly support the present system and the sense of fair play that has always been demonstrated by a succession of Leaders.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>A whole-House role is being taken from the Leader, something I think unwise. The reality is that the Leader, as a Cabinet Minister, will always be in a far better position than a Speaker to know if there is an imminent event or announcement that would render a PNQ unnecessary. What it means in reality is that such decisions will no longer be taken in this House but by Mr Speaker in another place. For I can see few circumstances in which our Speaker would allow a PNQ that Mr Speaker had disallowed.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I will not divide the House on this detailed matter, but I hope that before we elect a Speaker, the Leader of the House might agree to think further and go to the Procedure Committee to argue for the present system to stay. In essence I agree with the committee and the Leader of the House about the strictly limited nature of the role of our Speaker and the vital need, on which most of us agree, to protect self-regulation. So why am I proposing the amendment? The answer I hope by now is simple and understood by all. I cannot see that the work to be done justifies the creation of a major new post.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Currently, we have a very part-time Lord Chancellor&#151;that is, as Speaker&#151;and a relatively active Chairman of Committees. When I look at the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_139"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 139</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

roles proposed for the new Speaker in the report, it is hard to see that they make up a full-time role. Most of what is proposed is to be taken from the Chairman of Committees, leaving him with much less to do. The risk is to end up creating two half-time jobs on full-time pay. What will people outside the House think of that?
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I have to say that to me everything points to the familiar office we now have&#151;that of Chairman of Committees&#151;assuming the limited additional roles relinquished by the Lord Chancellor. The committee has worked hard to carve out a role for an additional new post, but it has not convinced me. Yet what is proposed for this limited office is a dedicated staff, possible occupation of some at least of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s suite, a pension analogous to the Lord Chancellor&#039;s, and a salary appropriate, in the report&#039;s words, to that of the Chairman of Committees. Given that their functions would be roughly divided, that salary could not be less than &#163;80,000&#151;it could be considerably more&#151;unless the SSRB decided that the salary of the Chairman of Committees should be cut. I find that inherently unlikely.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Parliament, parliamentary salaries and parliamentary pensions are under scrutiny today as never before. People will naturally ask, if we were able to function without this expensive post in the past, why do we need it now? Frankly, I would feel uncomfortable answering that question, and I suspect so too would many Members of the House. So I suggest that, rather than jump into creation of a full-blooded new post, we try an evolutionary change&#151;a word used by the noble Baroness in her opening remarks. Let us begin with the assumption that the Chairman of Committees and the Speaker be one and the same, just as the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker were one and the same too.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>If we find that the roles are indeed too onerous to combine in one office, then we can change that at a later date in the light of experience, building on this report. In the same light, the detailed question raised by my noble friend Lord Geddes in his amendment can be discussed between now and 30 June, if my amendment is accepted, and we can resolve the issue of a Deputy Chairman in the House Committee after due consideration. It is not an issue that needs to be resolved today.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>That is why, while agreeing with the Leader and the committee on most of its recommendations, I propose this modest but significant amendment. It is in line with the will of the House not to have a regulating presiding officer and with the will of the House to have an election. It builds on what we have and carries forward reform in a practical and economical way. That would be the common-sense House of Lords approach and, as such, I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="60131-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Moved, As an amendment to the Motion standing in the name of the Lord President, in line 3, after &quot;approved&quot; to insert &quot;except that the office of Speaker should be combined with that of Chairman of Committees&quot;.&#151;(<i>Lord Strathclyde</i>.)

<a name="60131-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, it is always extremely difficult to follow the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, at his most reasonable, because he is so persuasive. He was so persuasive when he tried to persuade this House to accept none of the reforms on which the proposal before us today is consequential. When plan A failed, he turned to plan B, which was to make our current Lord Chancellor the most loved Lord Chancellor, and certainly the most loved Labour Lord Chancellor, who has ever sat on the Woolsack. &quot;Do not leave us, Charlie!&quot; was his plaintive cry. Now that plan B has failed, we have before us plan C.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I make it clear from these Benches that, like the Leader of the House, I will vote for the report and for none of the amendments. As is known, the troops behind me are as disciplined as any herd of cats that one could wish to find. I will therefore be marching into the &quot;Content&quot; Lobby with a hope and a prayer.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>There is one point on which I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. I read in the newspapers that the Lord Chancellor is contemplating taking up squatters&#039; rights in his extensive accommodation. Perhaps I may quote a former Liberal leader who escaped the attention of the <i>Sun.</i> As Mr Gladstone said, &quot;Bag and baggage . . . out&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I hope that we look at this report in its entirety. As the Leader of the House said, it does not please everybody. However, I have to say that it pleases me a lot. Those who read it will see that I was given a torrid time by the committee when I gave evidence, but I was amazed to see that most of the recommendations came very close to what I had been arguing. So I have great pleasure in endorsing the committee.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>We should think carefully about the role of the Leader of the House at Question Time. I would prefer to leave the responsibility with the government Front Bench because that works very well. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, serves as a model, as he is decisive. The arrangement breaks down only if the Front Bench do not do their job. If government Front-Benchers do their job, the whole House will accept it.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I worry that once the House turns automatically to that Chair for guidance and decisions, you will begin to get the role of a Speaker in this place. The full thrust of our evidence was to keep to self-regulation. I watch some of the old retreads coming into this place from the other place and almost wanting the discipline of the other place, which the Speaker provides. I have gradually, the longer that I have been in this place, begun to understand that self-regulation is one of our distinctive attributes. I look with suspicion at any proposal that moves from self-regulation to that Chair. That is why I am very glad that the committee was supportive of that.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a> As for the title, every time I come through that door I see a little notice that refers to the Lord Speaker, which seems to have been up there for donkey&#039;s years without the world ceasing to turn on it axis. It is a perfectly sensible title&#151;it means what it says on the tin. Although I could pick out bits of this report that do not go as far as I should like, or which go further, <br>&nbsp;<br>

the report gives the House what the overwhelming majority of us have wished for&#151;the ability to keep hold of our own affairs and to go in an orderly way to this new task. I hope that we shall resist all the other siren voices that we hear this afternoon. We should vote for the report and against all the amendments. We can move forward with a Fabian proposal&#151;with &quot;the inevitability of gradualness&quot;.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60131-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Williamson of Horton: </b>   My Lords, I have spoken in the House most recently, on 12 July, about the Speakership, and I gave evidence to the Select Committee which is fully recorded in its report. Once again, I should indicate that there are differences of view among the Cross-Benchers, as among others, but I hope that what I say will be helpful to the House.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>There are three reasons why we should come to some decisions today. First, there is the fact that it will now be possible for the office of the Lord Chancellor to be held by a Member of another place, and we would then in any event have to elect a Speaker or take some other step to replace the Lord Chancellor on the Woolsack.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Secondly, we have already passed the Motion of 12 July last year. We relaunched the Select Committee to make recommendations on the role and responsibilities of the Speaker, thus setting off a process that has arrived at the finishing line&#151;namely, an agreed report covering all those points. I pay tribute to the Select Committee and its chairman, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, for presenting the report, with which I very largely agree. I attach importance to the fact that it is a unanimous report.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Thirdly, it is quite clear that the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor have expanded as he holds the office of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs; reference has been made to that. That may be why the Motion today seeks approval of the Select Committee report and also sets a timetable for the move to the election of a Speaker.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Before turning to the amendments, I should like first to say that the passage of time and the arrival of the second report have not changed the key point&#151;namely, the need to keep a self-regulating House and to avoid a situation in which the Speaker&#039;s role might risk prejudicing that. I want to emphasise that point, although we may have moved beyond it. The whole House is the master of its fate. I have made it clear throughout that I wish to avoid the slippery slope and that, in a self-regulating House, points of order or rulings by a Speaker are to be excluded. The present report is oriented strongly against going down that slippery slope, which is very welcome.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Without prejudice to self-regulation, I was prepared to go a little further in my evidence to the Select Committee by accepting that the Speaker might give the same advice to the House&#151;no more, no less&#151;than the Leader of the House does now when there is excessive competition for supplementaries at Question <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_142"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Time. That still seems reasonable. However, the Select Committee, in its second report, has clearly opted for the status quo. If so, so be it. That illustrates the careful, not to say cautious approach to the role of the Speaker in the Select Committee and, I believe, in the House.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I turn briefly to the amendments. On the first amendment, evidently it is the Chairman of Committees himself&#151;who will speak shortly&#151;who can best advise on the workload and the practical application. For myself, while I recognise that the role of the Speaker will be very constrained within the Chamber, I think it probable that his or her role outside the Chamber will steadily increase. The truth is that the role of non-political spokesman for the House at home and abroad and the educational role are now hardly done at all. I really think that we shall need both a Speaker and a Chairman of Committees. I am for the one-for-one proposal&#151;out goes the Lord Chancellor, in comes the Speaker&#151;and a minimum of disturbance of the other arrangements affecting the committees.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Although I realise that the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, have not been moved, their subject is covered by the report and we can comment on that, and I shall do so very briefly. I would not like to pass up my first opportunity, after seven years in the House, of disagreeing completely with the noble Lord. On the title, the Select Committee&#039;s report is succinct and, in my view, convincing. &quot;Lord Speaker&quot; is the existing title&#151;it is in the Standing Orders, in the <i>Companion</i> and in the Constitutional Reform Act. It should be kept. There is no need to throw out the baby with the bathwater.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>On the other point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#151;namely, the question of the guardianship of the <i>Companion</i>&#151;I incline to the view expressed by the Select Committee, and specifically in evidence to the committee by the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, and by others.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I therefore think that we should go ahead as the Motion proposes. However, life Peers also suffer from nostalgia. I am indeed sorry that we shall be ending the presence of the Lord Chancellor on the Woolsack, since this link with one of the oldest offices in our land is part of our history. I understand that perhaps the first Lord Chancellor, Angmendus, existed in one of the kingdoms of our land in 605 AD, although it is not recorded whether he had a woolsack. Let us at least hope that the office of Lord Speaker in this Chamber will have an equally long life&#151;that is to say, until 3407 AD.

It is almost exactly two years since the House debated our previous report, and the membership of the present committee is exactly the same as that of the previous one, except for being joined by&#151;and, we would all agree, enriched by the presence of&#151;the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford and by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, who is in his place.

</p>

<a name="60131-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I start by thanking my fellow members of the committee. It was a great honour and pleasure to act as their chairman. I emphasise that the report before the House is not the work of one but of us all. We should be especially grateful for the help which was provided at all times by our Clerk. The House has moved slowly in the two years since 2004, but that is as it should be. Only if we move slowly in these important matters are we likely to reach a consensus&#151;and consensus in a matter as important as this is surely highly desirable.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>At the end of his speech in 2004, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, hoped that the noble Baroness the Leader of the House would use the usual channels in an attempt to seek broad cross-party consent. He then added these words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;If we are to have a Speaker, how much better that the role be born out of consensus than be a child of division in this Chamber&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/1/04; col. 389.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I only hope he is still of the same view. That is certainly still my view, and I hope and suspect it is the view of the great majority of the House.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>It was on 12 July last year, as has been pointed out, that the House decided in principle that we should elect one of our own Members as Speaker in lieu of the Lord Chancellor. It has been our task to fill in the detail, not to say when that election should take place&#151;that has always been a task for the House as a whole, and has been put before the House today.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>By our terms of reference we were specifically required to have full regard to self-regulation. In paragraph 7 of the report we have set out what we believe self-regulation means. It is my opinion&#151;and that, I believe, of all the members of the committee&#151;that none of our proposals departs in the least degree from the principle of self-regulation. In our previous report we followed the advice of the late Lord Williams of Mostyn in two main respects: first, we adopted his phrase that the Speaker should be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;the guardian of the <i>Companion</i>&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>and, secondly, we accepted his advice that the role currently performed by the Leader of the House at Question Time should be transferred to the Speaker.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Those proposals found favour with a great many Members of the House, but it would be idle to pretend that they found favour with the House as a whole, and I do not do so. Clearly they did not. The trouble with &quot;guardian of the <i>Companion</i>&quot; was that it implied, even if it did not say, that the Speaker was to be the sole guardian. That&#151;as I recall the noble Lord, Lord Cope, pointed out, as did many others&#151;would have been inconsistent with self-regulation, because under self-regulation we are all guardians of the <i>Companion</i>.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The role of the Leader at Question Time, when he or she acts on behalf of the House as a whole and not on behalf of a particular party, was seen by many Members of the House, during the debate following our last report, as in some way symbolic of self-regulation. To transfer that small but important role to the Speaker would, it was said, not only diminish the role of the Leader herself, but could be the beginning <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_144"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of a slippery slope that would end in points of order and a Commons-type Speaker, which none of us wanted. That was what we gathered from the debate as a result of our last report, so it was clear to us that if we were going to reach a consensus in the House we would have to think again, and that is what we tried to do.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>At the start of our deliberation we came from very different standpoints. There were those who supported the original proposals as they stood, but there were those who supported the dissenting views expressed strongly by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. But gradually during our deliberation we inched towards a common view. I should not like the House to think that it was easy. Many different drafts were circulated. Almost every sentence in paragraphs 13 to 23 of the report was the subject of debate, but in the end we reached agreement, as set out in those paragraphs.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The essence of the agreement was simply that, first, the Speaker&#039;s role at Question Time should remain exactly the same as the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role at present, and there should be no change in the Leader&#039;s role. Secondly and equally importantly, at other times the Speaker, the Lord Chairman and indeed the Deputy Speakers should have the same role as any other Member of the House in advising on matters of procedure. In footnote 12 on page 8 of the report, we gave a good example of how that might help the House. We did not see the very limited role of the Speaker outside Question Time as a slippery slope. Indeed, we did not see it as a slope at all. To some extent&#151;this was confirmed by the members of the committee who had experience of being Deputy Speakers&#151;that already happens.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Whether that is right or not, we saw it as a package. We all agreed that if we allowed that package to be undone at all, the whole thing could unravel and that would be the end of any hope of consensus in the House today. Therefore, I was concerned by the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould. However, she has been kind enough to write to me today to explain the meaning of her amendment, which is simply to honour the commitment that we set out in the report.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Lastly, I come to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. Of course I can see the attraction of combining the roles if possible. It would save money, but in our view it would not work. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said in the 2004 debate, the Lord Chairman is already overloaded. The full extent of his workload is set out on page 33 of our first report and supplemented on page 35 of our second report. No doubt we shall hear shortly from the noble Lord himself. Whatever he may say, our view was clear: if we were to add the role which we see for the Speaker to the existing role of the Lord Chairman, heavy as it is, both roles would suffer.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>What is the new role that we foresee? It has already been well explained by the Leader. First is the ambassadorial role, representing the House overseas, which is currently undertaken by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. In his view, it is an important role and is likely to increase in the future. Here, I very much <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_145"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

agree with the views expressed by the Convener. Secondly, there is the representational role at home&#151;what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, called the educational role&#151;getting across to the public what the House of Lords is really for. Thirdly, and subsidiary to those, is the receiving of important foreign visitors. In our view, all those are worthwhile roles that could not really be combined with the existing duties of the Lord Chairman.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I do not think that the public would regard it as extravagant to have in this House a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker. Even if one assumed that, at the outside, the net additional cost of the Speaker and any secretarial staff he might have was of the order of, say, &#163;200,000&#151;that is simply a figure plucked out of the air&#151;that would still represent only a little over 1 per cent of the total wage bill of the House, which is currently &#163;15 million. In any event, we surely ought not to let any question of cost, small as it is likely to be, determine what we decide today.
</p>

<a name="60131-06_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I started by saying that I hoped that we would reach consensus on this matter. I end by saying that, if we are to have a Speaker, then I hope we will do it properly, and in a manner and style befitting the House.

<a name="60131-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </b>   My Lords, I declare an obvious interest, since many of the proposals in the report will affect me in my role as Chairman of Committees&#151;although I hope that they will not affect me quite to the extent that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, suggested when he discussed salaries. I will therefore restrict my remarks on the proposals to practical matters.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a> On the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, as I said in evidence to the Speakership Committee, if the only role envisaged for the Speaker is the minimal function of opening the House and sitting on the Woolsack during Questions each day, as the Lord Chancellor does at present, there might be some attraction in combining the offices of Speaker and Chairman of Committees. However, the proposal is open to two objections, one practical and one of principle.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>First, as the report makes clear, it is envisaged that the Lord Speaker, as has been said by many, will take on a greater range of functions than merely sitting on the Woolsack. He or she will have duties outside the Chamber, including a representational and educational role. That would be in addition to the job that I already do as Chairman of Committees. The two jobs could be in competition over the time needed to do them properly.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Secondly and more importantly, there is an irreconcilable difference between the role of a Speaker, who is obliged to sit in silence on the Woolsack or in the Chair, and the role of the Chairman of Committees, who has to take part in debates, make Statements and answer Questions. The House will be aware that, when I present domestic committee reports in the House, I do so from the Front Bench; someone else has to sit as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_146"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Speaker. I cannot be in two places at once&#151;nor should I be. The functions of Speaker and advocate are different.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The Speakership Committee has recommended that the Speaker should chair the House Committee. That is a good recommendation, but only if someone else acts as the spokesman of the committee in the House. In addition, presenting reports and answering Questions can, and does, become quite controversial at times. I do not mind that, but it would be inappropriate for the dignity of a Speaker to have to deal with such matters.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Similar considerations apply to private Bills. The Chairman of Committees has a central responsibility both to advise the House on procedure and, with his counsel, to maintain the quality of private legislation in Unopposed Bill Committees. It would be inappropriate for the Lord Speaker to take on a role in private legislation which the House expressly wishes to keep from him or her in public legislation. Should the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, be carried, therefore, I hope that a number of these issues would be reconsidered.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I will leave it to others to speak to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, but I shall speak briefly to the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton. In giving evidence to the committee, I agreed with the idea that the Speaker should take the role of the Leader during Question Time. Since then, however, having read the report, I see the force of the argument that the Leader&#039;s role at Question Time has a symbolic significance, as she visibly represents the interests of the House as a whole. I am therefore ambivalent about this issue, and thought that I should make this clear, in case my original view was prayed in aid of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>I am broadly in agreement with the proposals of the main report, particularly regarding the role of the Speaker within the Chamber. From my experience, it has often struck me as odd that the only person in the Chamber who is unable to assist the House when it gets into procedural difficulties is the person sitting on the Woolsack. The role for the Speaker set out in the report&#151;that he should assist, but not rule&#151;gives him no more powers than those already enjoyed by every other Member. Allowing him to intervene in this very limited way will not threaten the principle of self-regulation but should help to keep the business moving. I therefore support that recommendation.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>However, I have some reservations about the proposed role of the Speaker in relation to Private Notice Questions. I fear that there could be a temptation to test a new Speaker out by asking for a greater number of PNQs; I can only hope that this temptation will be resisted. The report gives the Speaker hardly any new powers in the Chamber and it would be unfortunate if, on his first day, his decision on a PNQ was challenged on the Floor of the House and he had to justify it from the Woolsack. I am not an expert on procedure in the House of Commons, but I understand that it is virtually impossible to challenge <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_147"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Speaker&#039;s ruling on such Questions. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, nods in agreement. Should the House decide to give the Speaker a role in PNQs, I very much hope that it would give our Speaker similar protection to that given to the Speaker in another place.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I agree with the report that it is desirable that each Deputy Speaker should normally undertake three hours&#039; duty per week, but I disagree that this means that there should be a panel of 12 deputies. By my calculations, in a typical week when the House sits Monday to Thursday and a Grand Committee sits on two days, there are 27 slots of one and a half hours. If the Speaker sits on the Woolsack for two slots each day, as the report suggests, and the Chairman of Committees continues to sit on the Woolsack for one slot each day, only 15 of the 27 slots would be left. On this basis, I think that there is a need for only eight or nine active deputies, rather than the proposed panel of 12. The problem could be solved if one or two of the deputies were &quot;inactive&quot;, as they are at present. I refer to the Government and Opposition Chief Whips who, although on the list, do not normally take on the duty.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Incidentally, I think the recommendation that the Speaker have two slots of one and a half hours a day should not be set in stone. In my evidence to the committee, I suggested that the Speaker would probably want to be in the Chamber for important business and votes, so greater flexibility by both the Speaker and his deputies will be needed than at present exists.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>A number of less important points need addressing. One concerns the procession at the opening of the House. I hope that a proper ceremonial procession continues, as in my observation it is certainly popular with the onlookers in the Peers&#039; Lobby. It should continue to follow the route it does now and should be led by a Doorkeeper, followed by the Mace, then the Lord Speaker; and, as now, Black Rod would join it in Prince&#039;s Chamber. I am sure the House would agree that that would be preferable to the mini-procession that I do as Chairman of Committees when opening the House in the absence of the Lord Chancellor, starting as it does only in Peers&#039; Lobby. I make that point because I am sure there are other issues with which the Procedure Committee will be busy between now and June.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>It remains only for me to congratulate the committee on the thorough manner in which it has performed its task. While I do not necessarily agree with the detail of every recommendation, overall the report strikes a good balance between giving the Speaker the authority to represent the House and keep the business moving, and fully respecting the tradition of self-regulation which, I think, we all wish to preserve.

<a name="60131-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Geddes </b>   rose to move, as an amendment to the amendment standing in the name of the Lord Strathclyde, at end to insert &quot;and that a Principal Deputy Chairman, not being Chairman of the European Union Committee, be appointed to assist, and when required deputise for, the Chairman of Committees&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, Amendment No. 2 comes before Amendment No. 3, although perhaps my mathematics is slightly wrong.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>When asked directions to Ballybunnion, the well-known Irishman&#151;why an Irishman I have no idea&#151;is supposed to have replied, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t start from here if I were you&quot;. I rather wish that we were not starting from here, but we are. My amendment seeks to deal with the practicalities of the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, which I fully support. What concerned me was the baldness of that amendment. It did not spell out the real situation as outlined by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees, that to put the two roles of Lord Speaker and Chairman of Committees into one role will greatly overload that person. Whether that person is male or female is irrelevant in this context.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>That is why I suggest that, rather than going for the election of a Speaker over the top of the Chairman of Committees&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;my suggestion would be preferable and, dare I say it, infinitely less expensive. However small the cost, I do not deride it. On an earlier occasion, the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, said 1 per cent. When one adds up the total package of the Lord Speaker, I would not be surprised if the cost came to around a quarter of a million pounds. For me, that is not a small amount, although it may be for other noble Lords. I would prefer another situation where, in order to relieve the burden of the joint role of Speaker/Chairman of Committees, a nominated Principal Deputy Speaker would be appointed, at infinitely less cost, who could fill in and deputise for the Speaker/Lord Chairman of Committees when he is on other duties. The precedent for that is touched on in paragraph 42 of the excellent report, a great deal of which I agree with. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Standing Orders should provide that the Chairman of Committees may act during any vacancy in the office of Speaker&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Effectively, I am saying the same thing, only with a nominated Principal Deputy Speaker to fill in on those occasions.
</p>

<a name="60131-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I have been mildly castigated for bringing in the chairman of the European Union Committee. Paragraph 47 of the report clearly and entirely rightly states that we should do away with the nonsense of the chairman of the European Union Committee&#151;he has an immense workload on his shoulders; indeed, he is in Brussels today leading a delegation&#151;being paid as the Principal Deputy Speaker. That should go. The chairman of the European Union Committee should be paid as such, and I bring him into my amendment so that there should be no doubt that, when my <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60131-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I understand that I should speak to my amendments without moving them at this stage. I say to those noble Lords who, explicitly or otherwise, have criticised my amendments that I like them too much to criticise them in return. Like most noble Lords, I like consensus, but I prefer it round something that I have already agreed, again like most noble Lords. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who knows how much I regard and respect him, would like his report to go through as it is, as would my noble friend Lady Amos. I am sure that she will forgive me for mentioning that, because, from the evidence that she gave to the committee, she seems to be opposed to the idea of a Lord Speaker; indeed, she specifically said that she prefers something else, as does the&#151;I now understand&#151;much loved present Lord Chancellor, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer. He, too, is opposed to the idea of a Lord Speaker, as I am. I ought to explain to noble Lords why.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that I have never before been described as a retread or a siren voice. After 23 years in your Lordships&#039; House, I do not consider myself a retread at this stage. I have never been accused of being a siren voice because I love this place and I have never sought to do it any harm.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Most speakers so far have overlooked the essential, central issue that the more we enhance the role of the Lord Peer on the Woolsack, the more we jeopardise the very self-regulation that we all want. That is why I am proposing to move the first amendment standing in my name. I very strongly agree with everything that the Select Committee says about the need for self-regulation. I doubt if anybody in your Lordships&#039; House is opposed to the idea of self-regulation. However, I fear that if we carry on with a Lord Speaker, as the report suggests, that will do positive damage to self-regulation.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>My noble friend Lady Amos and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, have spoken about the idea of having a Lord Speaker when there is a Speaker in another place. Paragraph 14 of the report refers to a &quot;widespread concern&quot; of a &quot;slippery slope&quot;. I imagine that all of us would go along with that. On the other hand, what we do not want&#151;and what nobody in your Lordships&#039; House wants&#151;is a Commons-type Speaker. My noble friend&#151;if I may call her that, as she occasionally sits on my Bench&#151;Lady Boothroyd is much loved by everyone and she was a tremendous Speaker in another place. Although she and the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord, Lord Weatherill&#151;who I am sure everybody wishes well and a quick return here&#151;both wanted a Lord Speaker, I hope that they will accept that they were a little prejudiced by their own success in another place. At all costs we do not want a Speaker with anything remotely like the powers of the Speaker in another place. That is one of the main reasons why I am opposed to the idea and prefer the idea of a Lord or Baroness Presiding Officer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60131-08_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Boothroyd: </b>   My Lords, I prefer &quot;Lord Speaker&quot; because, internationally, &quot;Presiding Officer&quot; is a term that is used for Speakers of both lower and upper houses&#151;it is general term used for all who take the chair. I therefore wish to discriminate between a Speaker and a Presiding Officer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60131-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I respect the views of the noble Baroness, but I believe that it would confuse the situation even more if we had two Speakers, one in another place and one here.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Paragraph 8 of the report states that there is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;overwhelming weight of evidence . . . against a House of Commons type speaker&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The more we go along that path, the more danger there is. I hope that I have persuaded at least some noble Lords to accept the amendment when I eventually come to move it. I hope to see a majority for the amendment, but we will have to wait and see.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I now move to my second amendment, which, again, is self-explanatory. The report has been much praised. I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and other members of the committee will not mind my saying that, despite the fact that they worked very hard on what is an excellent report, in one respect at least I found it both confusing and contradictory. I refer to paragraphs 9, 17 and 22.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>In paragraph 9, reference is made to the late Lord Williams of Mostyn, who was a wonderful leader of your Lordships&#039; House. He referred to the need to have a &quot;guardian of the <i>Companion</i>&quot;. In the report, the noble Lord, Lord Cope, said that that might imply that all responsibility would rest with the Speaker. That is clearly not the case. The <i>Companion</i> spells out very clearly that anyone&#151;whether the Peer sitting on the Woolsack, the Leader of the House or anyone else who offers advice&#151;can be overruled by your Lordships. Noble Lords do not have to accept the advice; we are talking about advice and not about an authoritative ruling which says, &quot;It has to be that&quot;. It does not have to be that any more than we have to agree with every word, dot and comma of the report that we are discussing. This is a self-regulating House and we accept advice, as today we accepted the advice from my noble friend Lord Grocott. We did not have to accept it; indeed, at one stage I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, was going to object to it, as he could have done. Equally, we do not have to accept the advice of the Leader of the House, a Whip, or someone sitting on the Woolsack who tells us who is to speak next at Question Time. This is a self-regulating House. That deals with paragraph 9.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_151"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60131-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>My answer to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, is that there is no such implication that authority rests with the Peer sitting on the Woolsack. He simply offers advice; that is all that he can do under the terms of the <i>Companion</i>. One only has to read the <i>Companion</i> to recognise that that is the situation. Yet we are told in paragraph 22 that most interventions quite rightly comply with the rules and would continue to do so. Then I find a rather remarkable statement: on failure to comply with the rules, we are told that the Speaker may not be able to do the job any better&#151;or, indeed, worse&#151;than Whips on the Front Bench. In my experience, while Whips on the Front Bench may appreciate what the rules are, they are not always quick to advise the House that the rules have been broken. I do not believe that it is right to suggest that they would know better than someone sitting on the Woolsack who is advised by the Clerks of your Lordships&#039; House under the arrangement that the committee suggested. Unlike the House of Commons, the Clerks sit a fair way from the Peer sitting on the Woolsack, but electronic procedures are recommended and I would welcome that. So whoever sits on the Woolsack would take the good advice that we always&#151;almost always&#151;receive from the Clerks in your Lordships&#039; House. I never like to be too dogmatic about such matters.
</p>

<a name="60131-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Paragraph 17, referring to the Peer sitting on the Woolsack, says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;Such advice should be strictly limited to . . . guidance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Of course, that is precisely what the phrase &quot;guardian of the <i>Companion</i>&quot; means. Anyone who reads the <i>Companion</i> must be clear that we are dealing only with advice from the Peer sitting on the Woolsack or from anywhere else. I would not dare to advise anyone what to do here, because noble Lords all have their own views, even if they seek consensus sometimes. In one sense, the idea about the <i>Companion</i> is rejected in paragraph 9 and partially reinstated in paragraphs 17 and 22. Therefore, I hope my second amendment will be acceptable to your Lordships.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60131-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, I want to get the tone of what the noble Lord is saying absolutely right. He is proposing the term &quot;guardian of the <i>Companion</i>&quot;. Would it be &quot;the&quot; guardian or &quot;a&quot; guardian? If it were &quot;a&quot; guardian, that would be <i>pari passu</i> with everyone else; whereas if it is &quot;the&quot; guardian, that would mean someone higher. We need to know which it is.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="60131-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, if the noble Lord wishes to move an oral amendment to my amendment, I would be happy to accept it. I hope that I have made clear to the House what I have in mind in moving my second amendment, which I shall do later. For now, I hope that I have made clear what the House may want to see and may well, at the appropriate stage, go along with. However, if, at a later stage, the House wishes to make it even more crystal clear that we are talking about only advice from the Peer sitting on the Woolsack&#151;who I hope will not be called &quot;Lord Speaker&quot;&#151;we could amend the <i>Companion</i> to that effect. Later I shall turn to the amendments themselves.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60131-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </b>   My Lords, there was considerable discussion in the Select Committee about the transfer of the role of the Leader at Question Time to the Lord Speaker. In the light of the evidence presented to the committee, members of the committee decided not to recommend changing the present position. However, the evidence was fairly limited and, as members of the committee had very differing views, we specifically stated that this was a matter for the House to decide. I have put this amendment down in that spirit to honour the words of the report agreed by us all, to give the House the opportunity to hear the arguments and to take its own decision.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>This issue was first discussed by the previous Select Committee, which recommended the transfer of the limited functions at Question Time from the Leader to the person occupying the Woolsack. We were very much influenced on that occasion by the evidence presented to us by the late Lord Williams of Mostyn, who said that he found the role invidious&#151;a view that was reiterated by my noble friend Lady Amos, from her experience. We should take the views of the two Leaders extremely seriously. The proposal for change was also supported by the noble Baronesses, Lady Boothroyd and Lady Williams of Crosby, in their oral evidence. I might well also have quoted the noble Lords, Lord Williamson and Lord Brabazon. I see that they may have had a change of mind, but perhaps they will change it back again before the end of this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>As today, the contrary view was expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. The argument is that any addition to the role currently performed by the Lord Chancellor would be a diminution of self-regulation. I disagree, because I believe that self-regulation would be maintained. I further disagree that such a move would inadvertently change the role of the Leader. My view, which I indicated to the Select Committee and which I said I would be supporting in the Chamber, is that the Lord Speaker should take on the Leader&#039;s role at Question Time. Choosing from among those seeking to ask a supplementary question can be difficult in the Leader&#039;s position on the Front Bench&#151;it is especially difficult to know whether someone behind wishes to intervene. The Woolsack is the only position that gives a full view of the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>It must also be stressed that the Lord Speaker would not be expected to call Members by name. Rather, he or she should ensure that the courtesies of the House are maintained by following the tradition of questions being asked from around the House. If there is more than one speaker from one party, or from the Cross Benches, the choice should be made by the House or by the Front Bench of the party in question.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>That extra responsibility would fit in neatly with the other proposals in the report for the role and functions of the Lord Speaker. For instance, as has already been referred to, the Lord Speaker would sit on the Woolsack at Question Time and would spend a longer time in the Chamber either on the Woolsack or in the Chair, presiding over a stage of a Bill. There are a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_153"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

number of occasions when guidance is currently given to the House by the person presiding. In actual fact, we already look to the Woolsack for guidance&#151;the Select Committee proposes a very marginal extension of that role. I appreciate that some Members are concerned that adopting that proposal would enable the role to be further extended. However, that would not happen if the role of the Lord Speaker was clearly and strictly codified in the <i>Companion</i>, to maintain standards and preserve self-regulation. There would be no selection of speakers from the Floor, no selection of amendments, no guillotine and, crucially, no points of order. The last point would be guaranteed by the Lord Speaker having no ability to rule on points of order, as noble Lords would continue to address the House.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>As I will not have a further opportunity to speak in this general debate, I would like to add one point. These additional responsibilities, and the other responsibilities outlined in the report, both in and out of the Chamber, make it clear that the job is too onerous to be combined with that of the Chairman of Committees. That case needs no further elaborations, as it was put so succinctly by the Chairman of Committees, the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon. I completely agree with his view.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>In conclusion, I believe that the proposal for the role of the Lord Speaker at Question Time would be a sensible addition to the other functions that are outlined in the Select Committee report. I hope that it will receive the support of the House later this afternoon.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60131-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Boothroyd: </b>   My Lords, the Select Committee deserves our appreciation for the work it has done over a long period, and I am grateful to it for its courtesy to me when I gave evidence. Not having spoken earlier in debates on this matter, I now seek to place on record some of my thoughts in dealing with the main issues in the report.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Our debate could not be timelier. Last month the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, listed the two principles he believes should shape our future. They were,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;the primacy of the House of Commons and the need for accountability of the second chamber&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>None of us disputes the former, nor need we fear the latter. The harder the Government try to make us more representative, the more influential we become, as Ministers and opinion outside Parliament are beginning to realise. But we have a problem, too. It is how best to adjust to changed circumstances in the way we manage our affairs. The terms of the report were narrowly drawn, and that was understandable. The House is jealous of its rights and privileges, and I applaud that.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>My perspective is conditioned by my experience as a Member of the other House in a number of capacities and by my confidence in the strength of our institution. I believe that the duties we entrust to our new Lord Speaker will enable us to conduct our proceedings <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_154"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

more effectively and enhance our public standing at a critical juncture. A strong Speaker, acting within the rules, does not mean a weak House, as many imagine. A Speaker elected for his or her judgment, impartiality and sensitivity would not undermine our traditions or distinctive ethos as a civilised debating chamber, free from the tumult and rancour of another place. There is certainly no wish on my part to go down that road.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The report&#039;s acceptance of the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument poses a false antithesis, in my opinion. The principle of self-regulation is good, but I do not think it is any longer working as it should. The report fears that giving the Lord Speaker the power to remind Members of their obligations could lead to a Commons-type Speakership. I reject that. A Commons-type Speaker is unnecessary; it is incompatible with our traditions, and nobody wants it or would suffer it&#151;least of all ex-Speakers of the Commons. The small changes advocated do not conflict with the need for self-regulation and old-fashioned courtesy which the report rightly sets such store by&#151;quite the reverse. We do ourselves no service if we ignore some of the barnacles on the <i>Companion to the Standing Orders</i> and miss the opportunity to remove them.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I listen regularly to your Lordships asking questions and making comments that have little to do with the business before the House. I observe Ministers doing their utmost to reply to detailed supplementary Questions that go well beyond the substantive Question on the Order Paper and for which we cannot expect them to be briefed. In my mind&#039;s eye, I visualise a library littered with ministerial letters answering questions which bear no or little relation to the substantive question that has been tabled. I submit that a little personal self-regulation would not go amiss in this respect.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The other day I witnessed a very brave Government Whip remind one of your Lordships that he should be speaking to the amendment and not making a Second Reading speech. The Whip did so with great tact and gentleness, if with a rather pink face. But he got Brownie points from me.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>That is something that happens frequently and I do not think it should be the Government&#039;s responsibility to correct it. It is a matter for the whole House, not the Government. It is a test of our willingness to practise what we preach when we talk of self-regulation. The House will be better served if the limited functions of assistance and guidance are transferred to the Lord Speaker; if the functions of the Speaker were to be codified in the <i>Companion</i>, such assistance and guidance would not lead to poor conduct or challenge, because the ambience of this House is different from that of the other place.

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>In this respect I would commend the supplementary memorandum from the Leader of the House to the Select Committee. As the noble Baroness rightly says, giving the Lord Speaker the limited functions currently undertaken by the Government Front Bench in guiding members merely involves,

<a name="60131-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>To use her examples, the Lord Speaker would point out if a Member was speaking to the wrong amendment, or overrunning in a time-limited debate. The very idea seems to have made the Select Committee shake in its shoes. The report tells us that enforcing such time limits is a &quot;sensitive matter&quot;. The implication is that the Lord Speaker, who has won our confidence through election, who is impartial, and in whom there can be no conflict of interest, cannot be trusted with sensitive matters. It is something that I cannot accept and I do not believe that this House should accept it either.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Let me turn to the representative role. Representing the House at home and overseas will become an important function for the future occupant of the chair. It is crucial that we get across to people, at home and abroad, the significant work carried out by this House. Much of that responsibility falls to the Chair. Having committed ourselves to the teaching of citizenship, there is substantial work explaining to foundations, to universities, to business, to commercial groups and the like what we do here and why it matters. There is an interest out there in our own country; that interest is growing and it needs to be met.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The report speaks of conferences such as the Commonwealth, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the European Union. I have absolutely no doubt at all that individual legislatures will be keen to have our Speaker meet with their constitutional committees and to address their plenary sessions to learn of the changes made and our role in this bicameral Parliament. I am not pretending that the same volume of invitations will come the way of the Lord Speaker as came to my predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, and me. But let me tell you this. Our Parliament may not receive the respect it deserves in some quarters of our society, but I know from personal experience that it is held in high regard by overseas legislatures who wish to learn more about our ways and means of doing business.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I enter a caveat here. The report accepts the importance of the Lord Speaker in representing us outside the House and providing wider understanding of our work. I subscribe to that and can testify to its value. However, the first duty of the Lord Speaker is to this House when it is in session. I trust that whoever is elected will make his or her presence a priority, and be prepared to set aside non-sitting days and parliamentary recesses to carry out representational functions, wherever they may be. With negotiation and advance planning with other bodies, I know it can be effectively accomplished.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I welcome the recommendation that the number of Deputy Speakers should be reduced. I would prefer, for effective working purposes, that number to be three or four, and for them to be remunerated. The House of Commons manages quite well with only three deputies and a similar number should be sufficient for your Lordships&#039; House. I have come to this conclusion because I envisage that a small panel of deputies, acting as a working group, would provide daily support and continuity to the Speaker and to the Speaker&#039;s office, as well as bringing a degree of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_156"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continuity into this Chamber. I believe we would all be better served by a very small number working alongside the Speaker on a regular daily basis, with a short morning meeting with the Clerks so that together they can have a wash-up session on what happened the day before and go through the current day&#039;s business in preparation. There is no substitute for homework as far as I am concerned.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Currently, the Principal Deputy Chairman is also chairman of the European Union Committee. As the report suggests, he seems to be paid for the little he does in the former role rather than for his heavy responsibilities in the latter. It would seem more sensible to abolish the office of Principal Deputy Chairman and provide proper remuneration for the chairman of the European Union Committee. The Chairman of Committees would retain the title in addition to being designated as Principal Deputy Speaker, with, as I say, a very small panel of deputies giving the daily support and continuity that both the Lord Speaker and this House should expect. Perhaps after a period of experience and reflection, the Procedure Committee may wish to look at that.
</p>

<a name="60131-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I believe that an effective Lord Speaker will enhance the efficiency and prestige of this House at a time when what we say and decide here has never been more important. At the present time I am inclined to vote against all the amendments, with the exception of the amendment standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, although I think it is limited in its application. I urge the House to seize the opportunity and be not afraid.

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60131-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dean of Harptree: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, who was the first lady Speaker in the House of Commons and, if I may say so, one of the most distinguished. I start by declaring an interest as a Deputy Speaker in both Houses of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I add my tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and his committee for the difficult job which he conceded that he would have in trying to reconcile the almost irreconcilable. First, he had to reconcile the long tradition which this House has of self-regulation with the concept of an elected Lord Speaker who has a useful job to do, while at the same time avoiding the problems associated with the type of Speakership that the House of Commons has.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The report&#151;the Leader of the House also referred to this&#151;points out that it would be very odd if the only person in your Lordships&#039; House who had no say in self-regulation was the Lord Speaker. The committee addressed this problem and suggested that the Lord Speaker should be able, in a gentle way, to give some guidance and advice on procedural matters. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;His function should be to assist and not to rule&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>As a cynical old politician, I doubt whether this will hold even in your Lordships&#039; House. I believe that advice would be regarded as ruling from the Woolsack. Therefore, how are we to avoid getting into the dreaded position of points of order? Such alien <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_157"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

content would quickly be stopped in its tracks if your Lordships&#039; House on every part were to show its strong disapproval. That would show self-regulation operating at its best.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>That would be reinforced by a clear and unqualified paragraph in the <i>Companion</i>, which I hope would be sent round to all members of your Lordships&#039; House before a Speaker was elected. That would give a good chance that the Lord Speaker on the Woolsack would have a light touch and some say in the conduct of your Lordships&#039; House without getting into a wholly inappropriate position that may be acceptable in another place but would be contrary to your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a> I turn to the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde with his usual eloquence. As I see it, and I speak as someone who has sat as a Deputy Speaker under a number of Lord Chairmen of Committees, the Lord Chairman of Committees has a full-time job, not only in this House but mostly in-House. It seems to me that there is also a job&#151;the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, made this point&#151;to represent your Lordships&#039; House in functions outside. I am thinking not only of the great affairs of state that take place in Westminster Hall and the Royal Gallery and so on, but of other Parliaments.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a> I had the privilege of serving on the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association executive for a number of years. I was very impressed by the number of people in Commonwealth Parliaments who still regard us as the Mother of Parliaments. They need our advice, and it is not only in the Commonwealth but in other countries coming out of dictatorship which are building up their parliamentary institutions. They need advice and guidance from us. It seems to me that we need a Lord Speaker who will have the status and the time to be able to fulfil that role.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a> There are three functions in which I believe that the Lord Speaker should play no part. The first is the speakers&#039; list&#151;the batting order. As far as I understand it, it works well. The usual channels decide and there is not any particular argument for the Lord Speaker to have a part. Let us keep what works working satisfactorily. The second is the selection of amendments. As your Lordships know well, one of our prides in this House is that any noble Lord who has an amendment on the paper is free to move it or to say &quot;not moved&quot;. I hope that that right will be retained and that there will be no question of the Lord Speaker having any say in the selection of amendments.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a> The third point concerns Private Notice Questions&#151;PNQs. The report suggests that the decision on this matter should be referred from the Leader of the House to the Lord Speaker. With great respect to the Select Committee, I beg to differ. The Select Committee says that such matters are &quot;often politically sensitive&quot;. Whoever makes the decision has to decide whether to accept or reject the request. If the request is rejected, the chances are that the Peer concerned will feel not best pleased. If it is accepted, a Minister will have to change his diary very fast, get himself briefed, and come down to the House to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_158"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

answer the Question. That Minister is unlikely to be best pleased. To put a new Speaker in that delicate political position would be somewhat embarrassing. I would leave it where it is. In making decisions on these matters, the Leader of the House is not doing so as a party politician; he or she is doing it as the Leader of the whole House. I would leave it where it is.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a> If your Lordships decide to have an elected Lord Speaker, it will involve a big change in our traditions and customs. We have had many changes previously in our long parliamentary history. Our forefathers have usually managed to blend the old with the new without destroying continuity. I can only hope that we in this generation, if we decide to have an elected Speaker, will manage to do the same, and that history will repeat itself.

</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60131-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, our focus in this debate should really be the work of your Lordships&#039; House. I think that we all agree that this work consists primarily, although not entirely, of scrutinising government legislation, contributing to the making of policy and setting the political and policy climate in our country. Fundamental to that in this House is self-regulation. I echo other noble Lords in saying that that requires courtesy, reasonableness, a willingness to compromise and a tendency to be party political only when necessary rather than all the time. I know that this makes us seem rather boring to some, especially as compared with the other place, although I suppose that I must refrain from making any further comment on the other place.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I shall turn to what follows from this shortly. I regard all other matters in the report, such as who represents the House at home or overseas, dress&#151;that is, the fundamental question whether a gown but not a wig should be worn&#151;precedents and the like, as fripperies.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I return to the central theme. The role of the presiding officer is to facilitate self-regulation. My late noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn coined the excellent, indeed felicitous, phrase, &quot;guardian of the <i>Companion</i>&quot;. That expresses precisely what I believe. But my noble friend the Leader of the House said that we have moved on from that. As someone who has always prided himself on being part of the avant-garde, I obviously accept what she said. Therefore, I content myself with the alternative expression of &quot;facilitator of self-regulation&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Procedural guidance should fall to the presiding officer, but this must always be guidance and no more. Therefore, I do not accept the committee&#039;s recommendation that the role of assisting the House should on some matters remain with the Leader. More broadly, I do not accept that there has been no deterioration in the way in which we scrutinise legislation or the way in which the House behaves. The noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, made that clear.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I am told that the <i>Companion</i> is not always explicit about the rules&#151;for example, what may be done at Third Reading, how many times you may speak and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_159"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other such matters. I can only say that, during all my years in opposition, there seemed to be no ambiguity whatever about those things. I suppose that I shall be accused of cynicism if I then add that it is only when we have a Labour Government that what is permissible seems to change. Therefore, I believe that self-regulation, based on the <i>Companion</i>, is both feasible and desirable, with guidance.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>To summarise, I would rather that the presiding officer&#151;not the Front-Benchers&#151;was the person who advised the House on time limits and on individual Peers sticking to the rules. On the title, I certainly prefer the term &quot;presiding officer&quot;, because it gives us&#151;I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has already made this point, but I repeat it&#151;at least a partial guarantee that the role of the Speaker will not be enlarged and will certainly not be like that of the Speaker in the other place. What follows from that is that, since the role will be that of a facilitator&#151;and, I hope, strictly limited&#151;any staff for the presiding officer should be at the absolute minimum and should certainly not be left to the House Committee, especially if the presiding officer is the chairman of that committee.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a> On the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, let me add that the various tasks set out in paragraphs 25, 26 and 27 of the report read as if the committee, having accepted that the presiding officer should be full time, with a full salary and pension, suddenly realised that it had better find something for the presiding officer to do and so invented these things so that it would not look as if he or she was being overpaid.
</p>

<a name="60131-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a> I always feel obliged in this House to tell the truth, so I conclude by saying&#151;in case it is not abundantly clear&#151;that, unlike all other noble Lords, I really do not think much of this report. I find it totally impossible to congratulate the chairman or the members of the committee, as I do not think that the report remotely does the job. It lacks logic and it lacks evidence and, if the House divides, I should try to find a way in which to vote against it. I certainly do not accept the argument that we should accept it simply <i>faute de mieux</i> because otherwise we shall have to have another one of these debates.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60131-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </b>   My Lords, I shall make three observations on the report&#151;and in support of it, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Peston.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>First, the character of this Chamber differs markedly from the other two in which I have served&#151;the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament&#151;and should continue to differ markedly from those other two chambers. When the Life Peerages Act 1959 was going through Parliament, I was studying constitutional law at the University of Edinburgh. I remember still the sentence that the late Professor JDB Mitchell dinned into us about the House of Lords, because it came up as an examination question later. He said that the House of Lords was the only institution in the world kept efficient by the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_160"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 160</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

persistent absenteeism of the majority of its members. That of course was true&#151;and is still true to a certain extent. But the fact is that the House is changing, is continuing to change, and the election of a Lord Speaker is part of that process.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I firmly agree with the report&#039;s conclusions that none of those changes should alter the nature of our proceedings. Courtesy and self-regulation are the hallmark of this Chamber and mark it out as different. Frankly, I get a little concerned when I see some of my fellow refugees from the other place arriving here and bringing with them some of the unnecessary, petty party point-scoring, which is an inevitable part of an elected chamber. We do not have to impress our electorate, our constituency parties or the editor of our local newspaper. It is all entirely unnecessary. Because we are not elected, we are in a far better position when we stick to the arguments before us&#151;even when they are of a partisan nature&#151;rather than importing the sucks-yah-boo tendencies from the other place. As long as we retain our decorum, there is no need for an interventionist Speaker.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Secondly, contrary to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, I believe that the role of the Lord Speaker will turn out to be more important outside the Chamber than within it. I want to quote what is probably the smallest paragraph in the report, paragraph 31, which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;In addition to overseas visits the Speaker will take over the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role in entertaining visiting speakers and parliamentarians from abroad&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>I give the House a word of warning: that innocent little paragraph contains a real trap. When I became Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, I was well aware that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, quite rightly, regularly uses other people in public life to help to entertain its many visitors&#151;for example, Mr Speaker, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Presiding Officers in Scotland and Wales.

</p>

<a name="60131-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The burden in my case was, frankly, so unexpected that I concluded that there must be a cell of civil servants in the basement of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office saying to all visitors as they arrive, &quot;Go ye unto Edinburgh and see this thing which has come to pass&quot;, because the flood was remarkable. I had only two deputies, and we all shared in that burden. However, on one occasion I remember that we had four lunches; I had to corral the convener of the education committee to entertain a visiting education minister.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>I seriously fear that that might become a much greater part of the Lord Speaker&#039;s role than the innocent little paragraph in the report suggests. On another occasion, I remember the Foreign Secretary asking me if I would mind entertaining the president of an African country. Since Robin Cook is, sadly, no longer with us and that president is no longer in office, I think that I can tell your Lordships that I found the president a complete pain in the neck&#151;and I told the Foreign Secretary so afterwards. That was in happy contrast to having President Mbeki of South Africa visit us as part of his state visit.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_161"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60131-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>My point is that the role will, I fear, be much greater than the report suggests. The Lord Speaker will find him or herself having to host endless visitors. It will be important that their staff keep a note of the countries of interest to your Lordships, so that appropriate people can be invited on those occasions. I fear that future Lord Speakers will find themselves eating for their country as part of the job.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>My third observation is to support strongly the committee&#039;s conclusion in paragraph 28&#151;and the evidence given to the committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, and by my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby&#151;on the educational and public relations role of the future Lord Speaker. Let us be frank; the role of this Chamber really is not understood widely in the country. The reason is, partly, that we are only ever covered in the media when we are in conflict with the House of Commons or the Government, or both. Yet we have three distinct roles, which ought to be made clear to the public.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>First, there is the painstaking scrutiny and amendment of legislation, which we do rather well. Secondly, we hold high-level debates on subjects using the expertise in our midst, such as in our debate before Christmas on climate change. The other place cannot manage debates of that character. Thirdly, there is our important capacity to delay, or to require the elected Chamber to think again&#151;a particularly important power during years when the government of the day happen to have an overwhelming, artificial majority in the other place, as has occurred during both the Thatcher and Blair governments. The Lord Speaker needs to be able to address multifarious audiences. I would like to see a future Speaker fronting a short DVD which could explain our role in a much clearer way and be distributed widely to schools, colleges, universities and libraries.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>As one of your Lordships has already said, that role has to be non-partisan. The 2003 report of the committee said that this person will need to be &quot;someone of considerable stature&quot;, which makes me think that it may be an ideal job for a retiring bishop. What we need, in short, is someone who will be decently reticent in the Chamber and highly articulate outside it.

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60131-11_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, the more one listens to this debate, the more one recognises the wisdom of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in saying that we should accept the report in its entirety and reject all the amendments. I say this for two reasons. First, it is clear that as soon as you start picking at the edge of the report, it begins to unravel. If one person&#039;s point is taken, someone else&#039;s point goes the other way, and you start unravelling until suddenly the whole knitting <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_162"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

falls apart. Secondly, many of the things for which amendments are being made on hypotheses are things that we could do in the future if those hypotheses proved true, but which we would find very difficult to reverse once they had happened. The clearest example of that is the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. Along with the noble Lord, I think anything that has a slimming-down effect is highly desirable, but we must not prevent this report working before it has been given a chance.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The most common complaint made by Members of this House is that their work is not understood or appreciated outside the House. This report gives us an opportunity to have someone to deal with that; to give this House the proper explanation and publicity it should receive in public, both at home and abroad. If you roll the two roles into one, you make it impossible to do that. If you allow two roles&#151;those of the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees&#151;you allow that to be tried. If that is a dismal failure, and no one wants the Lord Speaker to come and explain to them what we do or represent us overseas, in five years&#039; time we could say, &quot;These are only two half-jobs&#151;amalgamate them&quot;. But if they are amalgamated from the start, the Lord Speaker will never have the opportunity to fulfil that role of representing, explaining and justifying us to the public. If you scupper that from the start, you will never be able to build it again.

<a name="60131-11_para11"></a>

<a name="60131-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, I am glad the noble Viscount got in ahead of me, because I agree with every word he said. I join enthusiastically with those who have congratulated the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, on his chairmanship of the committee. He had an unusually difficult task. He chaired the original committee; then the assumptions the committee had been forced to make turned out not be valid, and he was asked to do the job again. I think he has done so in an extremely efficient and courteous way.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I found myself also in a slightly strange position because, together with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford, I was the only new boy on the committee, which had already expressed very firm views on nearly all the subjects we had to consider.

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I still deeply regret the fact that we will not have a Lord Chancellor sitting on the Woolsack, but it became apparent that there was a threat&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;that the Government might appoint a Lord Chancellor in the Commons. In those circumstances the individual might not be prepared to serve, and as a result we would have to sort out the <br>&nbsp;<br>

whole of this business at very short notice. But it is unfortunate that we have not managed to retain that title, given its historic significance.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>We were trying to deal with two problems. One was what you might call work-sharing, and the other was the question of self-regulation. So far as the first is concerned, paragraph 24 is crucial:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The evidence we have received suggests that there is a case for combining the role of the Speaker with some of the functions now performed by the Chairman of Committees. We have already indicated that the new Speaker should spend much more time on the Woolsack than the Lord Chancellor does at present&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>When I first saw the amendment put forward by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, I thought that he was simply supporting what the committee said, but almost immediately I realised that that was not the case. We were suggesting that the present role of the Lord Chancellor&#151;which is minimal, although we thought that it should be undertaken more enthusiastically&#151;and the work of the Chairman of Committees should be divided more evenly. In that circumstance, there are two jobs to be done.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>It is also the case&#151;this is an important point rather ignored by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde&#151;that some jobs now done by the Chairman of Committees would not be appropriately done by the Speaker, and we spell that out in some detail. But, perhaps more importantly, if the two jobs were carried out by only one person, that person would not have a deputy. Clearly there are circumstances when the person on the Woolsack has to be away or has other duties to perform. As was rightly pointed out by my noble friend Lord Geddes, the present role fulfilled by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, is quite separate and does not really provide back-up in any sense for whoever happens to be on the Woolsack. It is abundantly clear that if only one person were doing both jobs, there would certainly not be time for him to fulfil any of the important functions which many Members, and indeed the committee, see the new Lord Speaker fulfilling either within the Palace of Westminster or, perhaps more importantly, beyond.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>For all those reasons, I do not support the amendment put forward by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde and I hope that, on reflection, he will feel that it is appropriate to withdraw it.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>There is also the whole question of self-regulation. I refer here to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. For 40 years now, depending on which sides of the House we are sitting, he has proposed amendments to which I have objected or I have proposed amendments to which he has objected. If noble Lords were to go through the Finance Bill records, I think they would find thousands of examples where that situation has existed. But I believe that the noble Lord is wrong to resurrect the idea of a guardian of the <i>Companion</i>. I suspect that once someone on the Woolsack is said to be the guardian of the <i>Companion</i>, inevitably&#151;this point was made by my noble friend Lord Elton&#151;he will become so, and that will lead us towards a House of Commons-type Speaker, to which many of us are fervently opposed. We need to bear that point in mind.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60131-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I turn to the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness and the whole question of self-regulation. I believe that Question Time is now working a great deal better than it ever has done during my time in the House because the Front Bench is more active. Those on the Front Bench are occasionally a little dogmatic. I think that they should phrase their interventions in terms of reflecting the will of the House rather than just saying, &quot;It is now the Liberals&#039; turn&quot;, as someone said the other day, or whatever it may be. That is an important aspect, and I profoundly believe that it is right to leave Question Time as it is. We do not want a House of Commons-type Speaker intervening at Question Time.
</p>

<a name="60131-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The other situation where self-regulation can be rather difficult is on occasions when the Government Chief Whip indicates that, in order to finish at a reasonable hour, each of us should speak for, say, 10 minutes. The reality often is&#151;particularly if one is waiting to speak next&#151;that the person on his feet does not stick to that rule. I do not think that any Member does it with malice aforethought. I think they do it for two reasons: either they did not notice what time they got up and therefore do not realise how long they have been going; or perhaps they are reading their speech and are quite incapable of bringing it to a conclusion unless they get to the end.

<a name="60131-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, I therefore draw your Lordships&#039; attention to footnote 14 on page 9, suggesting that we should have a clock, similar to that in the House of Commons, which starts flashing when the person on his feet has been speaking to within a minute of the time when he ought to sit down. When he reaches the limit, it flashes very fast indeed. This would ensure that people do not go over the time limit. Certainly, if it is flashing, the House itself is more likely to suggest that perhaps we have heard enough of whatever it is that the noble Lord happens to be saying. While this is in a footnote, it is not an unimportant point.
</p>

<a name="60131-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Overall, however, as the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, pointed out, this is a unanimous report; there was a considerable degree of compromise on a number of points. It would be helpful to whoever takes over this task, however, if there was as little dissent as possible this afternoon. I therefore hope&#151;along with the noble Baroness the Leader of the House&#151;that we can agree to the report, which should provide a foundation for us to move forward, given that we have been put in this position by what the Government have done about the Lord Chancellor.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>With my experience on the two Select Committees, I hope that the House will not accept the amendments in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Geddes. The two committees have worked hard on this, and identified the two full-time jobs of Lord Speaker and Lord Chairman. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, gave us some powerful evidence to support our view. He is doing the job of Lord Chairman&#151;very well indeed&#151;and his advice should be taken on this.

<a name="60131-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>On what we rather grandly call the ambassadorial role, I am sure that I am not the only noble Lord who is invited to speak on the House of Lords to seminars, academic institutions and conferences around the country. I never cease to be amazed at the degree of ignorance of otherwise well informed people about the work that we do. Anything we can do to the role of the Lord Speaker to improve that is worthwhile.
</p>

<a name="60131-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>The amendment of my noble friend Lady Gould of Potternewton on Question Time must be put to the vote so that we can decide one way or the other. The Select Committee said that this was a matter for the House to decide. We must do that. The issue is a simple one, as we know: should the Lord Speaker take over from the Deputy Speaker in a limited role at Question Time? If the amendment is agreed to, the <i>Companion</i> will clearly state the strict limitation on that responsibility.
</p>

<a name="60131-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I know that, for some noble Lords, the prospect of a Lord Speaker saying, &quot;I think it is time we moved on&quot;, is equivalent to hearing the tumbrels rattling around Parliament Square. I ask your Lordships to consider some practical points. Let us think of the first great day&#151;the first time the Lord Speaker processes in. No doubt there would be a packed House and Gallery, with the media present and giving their full attention. All the dignity and history of the Speaker&#039;s procession would be followed by nothing. He or she would sit for 30 minutes in complete silence while the House carried on, ignoring him or her. I am not sure that that is in keeping with the dignity of the House. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House conducts her role well at Question Time, as have her predecessors. A member of the Executive is controlling the House, which holds the Executive to account at Question Time. We decided that a member of the Executive should not be on the Woolsack but we wished a member of the Executive to supervise our Question Time.
</p>

<a name="60131-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I know that there is much concern about slippery slopes, thin ends of wedges, and so on. Our Lord Speaker can do only what the House allows him or her to do. The <i>Companion</i> will lay that down precisely. We say that we are a self-regulating House and are proud of it but we are not. When we have a problem at Question Time, the Leader of the House sorts it out, and sometimes the Government Chief Whip has to intervene. Those of us who have the role of Deputy Speaker break the rules; to guide the House when it is going wrong, we intervene although we are not <br>&nbsp;<br>

supposed to do so. We all know what we mean by self-regulation. Would not it be better to have a Lord Speaker effectively to take over the roles I have described?
</p>

<a name="60131-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I have made this point previously. In this House, there is no such thing as a point of order precisely because there is no one to rule on it. So long as our standing orders in the <i>Companion</i> state that the House is responsible for its own order, the Lord Speaker will be constrained by that and self-regulation will work.

It would be very nice if we could return to those courtesies.

I doubt whether its two main propositions are consistent. The first one, with which virtually everyone concurs, is that this House must remain self-regulating. I am absolutely of that view. I think that we too easily accept the extraordinary way in which this place carries on from hour to hour and day to day with a minimum of time lost and a maximum of politeness. This is an environment within which nobody feels afraid to say what they want to say. But I believe that that golden achievement will not survive a Speakership with the role given to it by the committee.

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The new Speaker&#151;I much prefer the title proposed in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, but let us talk of the Speaker&#151;will apparently be an ambassador for this House in the country and an ambassador for visiting politicians. He will be responsible for education about this House in the country at large, and will apparently be responsible for security. He will become a Privy Counsellor. Above all, he will, for the first time as far as I am aware, be an office holder of this place elected by this House. I am not sure that there is a precedent for that in our entire history. It is unrealistic for anybody to suggest that, with that panoply of power, authority and prestige, things can go on here as they have heretofore. One has only to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, speak to have a sense that, if she were our first new Speaker, the prospect of her remaining timidly on that seat saying nowt and with no clout cannot be visualised. We must face the reality that if these powers are given to whomever we elect, it will be goodbye to self-regulation as we know it. Self-regulation has a delicate chemistry. I am so concerned to preserve the extraordinary virtue of our self-regulation that, if this report is voted on, I shall vote against it.

<a name="60131-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, I want to make only one general point and raise one specific issue. The general point can be very quickly made because it was admirably made by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and by my noble friend Lord Higgins. I agreed with almost everything they said. This is one of the very rare occasions when I cannot support my noble friend Lord Strathclyde. Having listened to all the speeches in the debate, I have been forced to one clear conclusion&#151;that I should support the report of the committee so admirably chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. Once you start accepting one differing argument you are led down a path of disruption and fracture that I think will lead us into a great deal of trouble. I will therefore warmly endorse the support of the committee.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The general point has already been raised in a rather tentative way and I would like some answers on it. My noble friend Lord Strathclyde gently teased the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor about a once-stated view that he would like to be out of this place and in Selborne House, which I believe is where his office is. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, also ribbed the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor a little on this. Paragraph 50 of the report before us states:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_168"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 168</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;The rooms recently occupied by the Lord Chancellor, his Permanent Secretary and his private office are likely to provide more than enough space for the Speaker and any staff, and we leave it to the Administration and Works Committee to settle the arrangements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I would like to know whether the arrangements have been settled or whether they are likely to be settled in the near future. Surely the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, having decided to remove himself from his historic role, cannot want to retain the perks of his spacious accommodation but will, like all other Cabinet Ministers, be content with the relatively modest offices that they occupy.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Those who have been Cabinet Ministers in another place will know that along the Cabinet Office corridor there are a number of perfectly useful and acceptable rooms. In my time&#151;and I believe it is the case today&#151;Cabinet Ministers did not feel they had to have their permanent secretaries, staff and assistants with them in this place. It would come particularly ill from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, who has told the Law Lords that they must move to not very salubrious premises on the far side of Parliament Square. I hope that having taken that decisive bid for leadership, he will now follow the route that he has set and quickly make these spaces available&#151;and not just for the new Lord Speaker. Incidentally, I hope he will be a Lord Speaker and not a presiding officer which alarmingly reminds me of the Welsh Assembly.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I hope that the Lord Chancellor will do that because, within the last few weeks, two committees of this House have had to sit outside this building because there are not enough committee rooms available. I hope that we will receive an assurance that the spaces will be made available and that we may have some additional committee room space in this House.

This issue may well not be dealt with in some detail during the course of proceedings and it is important that we address the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who had an open mind on that issue during his contribution.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I am very much in favour of deregulation. The delicate chemistry referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, is an issue of which I am very conscious. Will noble Lords consider what happens in Question Time in this Chamber and how that is considered outside this House? I do not know if Members of this House often speak to members of the public about what happens in Question Time in this Chamber, particularly when there has been a fracas on the Floor with a conflict between Members shouting to be heard. This offers a very undignified spectacle of the way we conduct ourselves in this Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Some noble Lords may say that they will leave such matters to a noble friend or those on their Front Bench to resolve, but it is sometimes impossible for them to know what is going on behind them. Furthermore, it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_169"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 169</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

extremely embarrassing for them to have to rise during the course of our debates and select between two Members on the other side of the House who are arguing about who is to be heard. These matters should be dealt with in a far more delicate way and there should be an independent person who can unravel those conflicts very quickly before they develop into some of the difficult circumstances which we have witnessed on a number of occasions&#151;certainly during my time here.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Secondly, has anyone ever stopped to wonder who it is that asks most of the questions as supplementary questions during Question Time in this Chamber? If you look at the records of our proceedings over recent weeks&#151;and this is true also of my memory of proceedings long before that&#151;you will find that it is invariably Members who have been in the House of Commons or who have the courage to get up and take on conflict when it arises. There is a distinction between those who ask Questions only when they have tabled them themselves, knowing that they will not be involved in conflict, and those who are prepared to stand up at Question Time to ask supplementaries. I know from conversations with my noble friends that some people in the House simply avoid being heard at Question Time because they do not want to be involved in such embarrassment. There must be some other way of dealing with these issues.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>My final point may not have the unanimous support of my colleagues. It concerns the problem that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, has on his Front Bench every day of the week during Question Time. I sit here with my noble friends and we notice what is happening. Yesterday was an ideal example. Although Question Time is for Back Benchers, in my view, the Opposition Front Bench should be heard. To me, the voice of the Opposition Front Bench is quite important in winding up Question Time and trying to establish the opposition position. I have often noticed noble Lords on the Opposition Front Bench wondering when to intervene. I have watched the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, talking to his colleagues about the stage at which they should intervene. Should they intervene in the middle, whereby they cut out their noble friends on the Back Benches&#151;they do not want to do that because they do not want to interrupt the debate and the to and fro of Question Time in any way&#151;or should they intervene later? The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, is nodding. He knows that goes on every day of the week.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The result is that as the Clock ticks round and as we get nearer to the eighth minute, all panic ensues on the Opposition Front Bench. I do not say that out of any sense of criticism. The reality is that because they want to be courteous to their own people, they find it very difficult to intervene until the last moment and, as it is the last moment, they find themselves in difficulties. Sometimes they are excluded. I have seen Members sitting on that Front Bench become quite angry. Only recently, I remember that two Members in particular were quite upset&#151;the noble Baronesses, Lady <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_170"></a>

Rawlings and Lady Miller. Both were unsettled when they found that they could not be heard because of the way that Question Time rolled.
</p>

<a name="60131-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I am trying to address the issue that the noble Lord wanted us to address when he said that he had an open mind and that he might be convinced by the argument if there were a substantial argument. I think that this is a very substantial argument as it affects the Opposition Front Bench. Only yesterday, my noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport&#151;I say this without any disrespect to him&#151;intervened at the 29th minute.

My noble friend was heard and the noble Lord, Lord Howell, gave way. He was not pleased to give way, but he gave way.

<a name="60131-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Some of my noble friends believe that Question Time is for Back Benchers and that these matters are not of great importance, but I think that they are important in so far as there is a role for the Opposition Front Bench at Question Time. The reality was that yesterday the Opposition Front Bench lost out. There has to be some means by which that matter can be redressed. It is impossible for that problem to be sorted out by my noble friends who sit behind the Dispatch Box and cannot see what is happening around the Chamber. We need someone sitting on the Woolsack who can see the whole House and who, at the end of each Question, is prepared to say that it is now the time of the Opposition Front Bench. I ask for that just at Question Time and I ask for no more intervention than that. I ask the noble Lord to take that into account.

I associate myself with those who congratulated the noble and learned Lord and his committee on the work that they have done. It was not easy and they have done a very considerable job of work.

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Everyone appears to want the continuation of self-regulation. That has come out forcefully in the report and this afternoon in the debate. If we gave the new Speaker the obligation of being guardian of the <i>Companion</i>, he would have considerable and increasing authority. I rather like the words of the Leader of the House when, using a lovely phrase, she said in her evidence to the committee, &quot;I think we have moved on from that&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I am glad that the report suggested that the Leader should retain the duty of assisting the House. We all know the complications of logistics, but on the whole that has worked well. I gather that it will be the government Whips who will continue to advise the House on speaking times and that the function of the occupant of the Woolsack will be to assist and not to rule. That is an important and a neat distinction. The idea of installing some form of electronic wizardry so that the Clerks can be in touch with the Woolsack about 15 yards away seems to me bizarre. I think it would be inelegant, vulgar and inappropriate and I hope someone will find another way of doing that.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>In the end, where do we all stand? The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor says that he cannot manage one and a half hours a week as Speaker, that he wants to get rid of that as he has other responsibilities to carry out and that if he got rid of those responsibilities, life would be a great deal easier. I have often wondered what those responsibilities are and how the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who is in his place, managed them. He was present a lot in the House, as were the late Lord Hailsham and the late Lord Gardiner, who was assiduous in his duty to the House. He was here hour after hour, way beyond what was necessary for a Speaker.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>If the noble and learned Lord does not want to undertake the responsibilities associated with his office, he should do the proper thing and resign. Plenty of people have done that when they have jobs that they do not like. In effect, he is saying, &quot;I do not want to do this and I&#039;m going to make sure that no one else does it either, so I am going to get rid of the office&quot;. That is rather like the boy who says, &quot;I don&#039;t like that chocolate, but I&#039;m going to see that no one else has it either so I&#039;ll throw it down the pan&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I believe that this phase on which we are embarking is most regrettable. After all the advice that the committee chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has taken into account, what will the new Speaker do? He will not run the House; he will not be the guardian of the <i>Companion</i>; he will not vote; he must not be bossy; but he will be Speaker for one and a half hours per week.

As my noble friend Lord Crickhowell says, they will presumably be in the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department in the House of Lords. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is now a departmental Secretary of State with premises outside your Lordships&#039; House, he cannot be expected to need or retain the use of rooms the purposes of which he has discarded. I do hope that we will be told that the Lord Chancellor&#039;s premises in your Lordships&#039; House will be vacated by the present incumbent and made available for his successor.

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Strathclyde. There cannot be work for both a new Speaker and a Lord Chairman.

I hope that your Lordships will agree with the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The fact is that we have all been put into this desperate situation of manipulation in order to try to find a way around the unnecessary and tragic problem of the constitution yet again being assaulted. The Government call it modernisation, but it is not modernisation. It will not be an improvement and everyone knows that things will not be better.

My noble friend Lord Strathclyde quoted the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, as saying that he wanted to &quot;be in his department&quot;. That is what my noble friend Lord Strathclyde understood. I will just quote what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said in evidence to the first committee of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. He said:

I do not agree with that. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, in my assessment of the strength of the ethos and the culture of self-regulation in this House. I believe that it is robust, that it will be enduring and that it is quite capable of being not threatened, but enhanced, by the very limited and cautious proposals in the report. It pains me to take up <br>&nbsp;<br>

my noble friend Lord Peston on logic, or my noble friend Lord Barnett on anything&#151;I owed him &#163;140 million for an aeroplane many years ago, so I really should not do so&#151;but they are deluded if they believe that not calling the presiding officer of this House &quot;Lord Speaker&quot; will provide the defence against the role becoming that of a Commons Speaker. It is the role, not the name, that is important in this context.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I was reflecting this week&#151;it is just about 10 years since I made my maiden speech in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;on why I had enjoyed being here so much more than I had enjoyed, privileged though it was, being a Member of another place. I think that it is to do with the strength and the enduring thread of that ethos and culture of self-regulation. That has to be preserved, but it has to be preserved in the changing circumstances that we are faced with. I believe that the report of the Select Committee gives us an opportunity to do just that.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>One other word: I have confidence in the strength of self-regulation, but I have less confidence that outside this House&#151;or even, dare I say it, along the Corridor&#151;the work of this House is very well understood. I suspect that I agree with many who have spoken that the priority of this post should be domestic rather than foreign. I believe that the educational and representational role of this House is very important. As well as looking at the threats to self-regulation and guarding against them, we should look at the opportunities that would arise if this House had a representative and an ambassador outside it.

<a name="60131-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, it is obviously not without some sadness that we have reached this point. But we have reached it and we must be realistic about the future with regard to where we now are. Contrary to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I think that the Committee has done an excellent job in a difficult situation. I would like to thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, as the chairman, and all the members of the committee&#151;both the previous committee and the present, augmented committee&#151;for the work that they have done in putting together a compromise on which I hope the House as a whole will be able to agree without giving effect to any of the amendments.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>First, on the amendment of my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, I believe that, if we had a Speaker on the lines suggested by the committee, there would be plenty for him or her to do. After all, there are the proceedings of the House day by day. He or she would have the option to attend the House as far as time permits. If the Speaker of the House did not regard the proceedings as important, we could not expect people outside to do so. When I had the honour of holding the office of Lord Chancellor along with, and being paid as, Speaker of the House of Lords, I tried to be here as often as I could. Certainly, one of the rules in existence then was that Cabinet committees or meetings did not take priority over the Lord Chancellor&#039;s position in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_174"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relation to the opening of the House. I believe that there is plenty for the Lord Speaker to do in the way of being here and listening to what is going on, apart from anything else. That is always of considerable interest and the standard of debate is high. I do not feel able to support the amendment moved by my noble friend, particularly in the light of what the Lord Chairman has said about the responsibilities that he has. I have altered my views about this over the months, but I am very happy to accept the view of the committee.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>My second point relates to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, concerning the &quot;Lord Presiding Officer&quot;. The Lord Speaker has been a phrase associated with the Lord Chancellor for a long time. As the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has pointed out, you only have to come in from the other end of the Chamber to see it. I also think that the name is enshrined in the Constitutional Reform Act. When the Government were altering the priority&#151;it used to be the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons, in that order, and they wanted to put the Speaker of the House of Commons first&#151;the title given to the presiding officer in this House was the Lord Speaker. We would be in some difficulty if we contradicted the Act, which is now on the statute book.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I find my third point more difficult. It relates to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton&#151;I should know her name because I was privileged to be present at her introduction. I feel strongly that this is a difficult and rather delicate issue. For my part, I would prefer to leave matters as the committee has recommended, although, as the noble Lord, Lord Carter, has pointed out, it was a matter for the House to decide. The committee&#039;s view was that this was better left as it is. As has been pointed out, it could readily be altered if it turns out that something similar should happen. I got the impression that the proposal was that the Woolsack should have the right to choose only the area of the House from which the person came and then it would be for the Front Bench&#151;perhaps the Convenor of the Cross Benches&#151;to say which if there was competition within one of the groups. That would make for a rather complicated procedure; if that is what is in mind, I do not think it would be a very wise step, but it could be revisited.
</p>

<a name="60131-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I would like to see the report, as it is, passed by the House, if possible unanimously.

</p>

<a name="60131-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The longer this goes on, the more attractive the report becomes. It has been produced by a dozen of your Lordships. In addition, 52 of your Lordships have given evidence, and a further 10 have taken part today. That means that 74 of your Lordships have now taken part in producing the report or in its aftermath. &quot;Self-restraint&quot; was mentioned earlier, and I am going to indulge in that. We have had a substantial debate. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_175"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I am like a lot of others&#151;I do not agree with everything in the report, but I will accept it as a compromise.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, will keep going with his amendment, because not many seem to have said that it is a good idea. The case has been made that there are three jobs. However, it is not our job to suggest what the emoluments may be. We cannot say that there is &#163;150,000 available, or whatever, which should be split three ways. That will be someone else&#039;s responsibility.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Perhaps the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, is designed to get us back to where the report is. That is how I see it. On the first amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, I am not keen on the title &quot;Lord Speaker&quot;, but neither am I any keener on &quot;Lord Presiding Officer&quot;. There is nothing in it. My suggestion was &quot;Lord Woolsack&quot; but if people cannot cope with such innovation, I will settle for what is printed on the door, and we will save on paint. I am not keen on the second amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, either, as I believe that it is everybody&#039;s job to be the guardian of the <i>Companion</i>.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The amendment that concerns me most is that of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould. The words &quot;slippery slope&quot; have been used because Question Time is a very important time in this House. Attendance is maximised then and the tone would be set. That is why people are so bothered about being self-regulating, particularly at Question Time. If people want to think further about this, I will give another suggestion. On whichever Bench the Question starts, who goes next should be determined by going clockwise or anti-clockwise. Then, at least, it would be only for the Benches to sort out. That suggestion may not find favour, but it is one way of sorting things out without the squabbles that sometimes arise, although we should not get over-excited about how often they happen.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para4"></a>

<a name="60131-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I shall not attempt to respond to the whole debate, but I think that the House wants to move to a decision on these matters. In view of my normal activities, let me reassure your Lordships that, these being House matters, there will be free votes, and that I speak for myself alone.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Like almost everyone else, I echo the gratitude to the Select Committee for its very hard work and its excellent report. With regard to the proposal in Amendment No. 3 about the title to be given to the Peer on the Woolsack, on balance, I concur with the Select Committee that it would be best to stick to &quot;Lord Speaker&quot;, the title that has been used for some centuries in our Standing Orders and elsewhere. It has been approved by both noble Lords who have been Speakers of another place. I am not attracted to the title &quot;Lord Presiding Officer&quot;. The term &quot;Lord Chairman&quot; gained some credibility at one time, but it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_176"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

seems inappropriate for someone who is going to sit not on a chair but on a sack. I support the title &quot;Lord Speaker&quot;, particularly as we all seem agreed that this person will have to go around the country speaking to the nation on behalf of the House, in addition to the other duties involved.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It will not surprise the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, to learn that I also oppose the other amendment in his name. When speaking to Amendment No. 3, the noble Lord waxed lyrical in his support for self-regulation, but I believe that Amendment No. 4 would potentially do much more to undermine self-regulation. He seemed at one point to be advancing a new Barnett formula, which I found difficult to understand. I had to struggle with the Barnett formula in the Treasury for a while.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>While the name of the office is of course significant, the role is crucial. I do not think that any one Peer should be the principal, let alone the sole, guardian of the <i>Companion</i>. We are all equally guardians of the <i>Companion</i>&#151;the whole House is the guardian. We believe in self-regulation, not a regulator. We should set an example of self-discipline to the nation. It has not been mentioned much today, but one difficulty is that regulators inevitably lead to more regulation. I think that that would happen, as it did over the centuries in the Commons, particularly in the 19th century.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I acknowledge that we of the usual channels have a special duty to help to keep the House in order and to correct Peers, either at the time or afterwards, if they have strayed from the <i>Companion</i> in some way. Senior Peers, too, have that duty, and nobody would do it better than the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. I encourage him, with his tact and humour, to do so from time to time if he feels that someone is straying from the straight and narrow path. For that matter, I encourage the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, to do that if she feels strongly that someone is straying. While mentioning her, I would have no objection if Ministers more often said that a particular supplementary being proposed was wide of the original Question and declined to answer it. The <i>Companion</i> says that they can do so; it also says that they can decline to answer more than two supplementaries. I say to my own people, and I am happy to say it to the House, that if you ask three or four supplementaries, you give the Minister the choice of which two to answer. Not only is doing that not in accordance with the <i>Companion,</i> it is also unwise. However, that is another point.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I accept, because I think that we should try to accept the whole report, the limited role proposed for advice in paragraph 17. However, I think that if the Peer on the Woolsack were regarded as the guardian of the <i>Companion</i>, even if he or she were only available to give advice to the House, as has been suggested, he or she would be the one whose duty it is to say that a Peer has strayed, and not the usual channels or a senior Member. Like my noble friend Lord Dean, I believe that, given the habits of the House, advice from the Peer on the Woolsack would become, in effect, rules set in stone in around five minutes. I do not think that advice would be taken as anything other than rule.

</p>

<a name="60131-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>It would be only a very short time before someone suggested to the Woolsack that they should draw some Peer back on to the straight and narrow in a particular case, when that Peer were thought to be doing the wrong thing. In other words, we would have points of order, because that is what a point of order is. The Speaker in the other place is the guardian of the Standing Orders, so if somebody believes that the Standing Orders are being broken, the proper thing to do is to say so to the Speaker. That is a point of order; that is why they do it; and that is the danger that we are looking at here.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>There has not been so much talk of this today, but in earlier debates there has been talk of Peers overrunning their time. I quite like the suggestion of the flashing clock in time-limited debates. I am sure that we can look at the matter very carefully. On the other hand, the recent Unstarred Question on Palestine was scheduled for one hour in the dinner break. It was a timely debate, with strong feelings cutting across party lines. Because 16 Peers wished to speak, they were, apart from the opening speaker and the Minister, limited to two minutes each. Under stricter arithmetic&#151;and I am an accountant by original profession&#151;they could have had two minutes and 30 seconds, but our clocks are not that specific. In the event, every speaker stuck to the time and, at the end, the House had to be suspended for eight minutes to fill the hour promised for dinner. We can do it. Self-regulation works and is worth preserving.
</p>

<a name="60131-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The Leader of the House was right to say in her evidence that we should not use the phrase at this stage. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, was right to warn against it in his evidence, and again today. I got a bit confused when the noble Lord suddenly said, just at a time when I was not paying quite as much attention as I should, &quot;Do not leave us, Charlie&quot;. I thought that he was talking about some other competition that was going on. Anyway, I realised after a moment what he meant. The committee was also right to step back from the phrase, as it did in its report. I hope that the House will oppose Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 4 and will support the Select Committee&#039;s conclusions on those matters.

I totally concur that the present role of the Chairman of Committees is already onerous and that support would be needed if it were to be a joint role.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have listened to the whole of this debate with very great interest and pleasure, although I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Cope, that I had no intention of moving a new Barnett formula; as he will well know, I do not like the existing one. I do not resile from all that I said initially; I believe that there is a serious danger, if we have the title of Lord Speaker, to the very self-regulation we all care about. I therefore beg to move.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="60131-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith </b>   moved Amendment No. 29A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>Page 8, line 21, leave out &quot;or&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 29A is very interesting. Section 24A of the Theft Act 1968 makes it an offence&#151;it is technically an offence of theft rather than fraud&#151;for a person to retain a credit made to his account if he knows or believes that it derives from fraud, theft, blackmail or stolen goods. The person need not have been involved in the crime. Criminal liability is triggered simply by his knowing that his account has been wrongfully credited and his dishonestly not seeking to cancel that credit. That is the background to the amendment. It is a technical amendment, because it would expand the existing definition of &quot;account&quot; in Section 24A to provide that electronic money accounts will be covered by the offence in the same way as conventional bank accounts when funds are wrongfully credited to them. Amendments Nos. 29C and 29D refer to Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60131-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>On 25 January, I wrote to the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, providing details on the substance of these government amendments. I hope that that was helpful. But as this is the first time that this matter comes before the Committee, I should say a few more words about the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60131-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Electronic or e-money is defined as monetary value. It is represented by a claim on the issuer, stored on an electronic device, issued on receipt of funds and accepted as a means of payment by persons other than the issuer. It is apparently used principally for Internet shopping, such as on eBay, Internet gambling, money transfer and as a substitute for travellers&#039; cheques. It is not legal tender. It has to be backed up by a float of cash. E-money accounts are excluded from the definition of deposit-taking, and e-money institutions are forbidden to grant credit.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>A substantial amount of e-money is being used. At the end of 2005, approximately &#163;137 million of e-money was in circulation in the UK, issued by specialist e-money issuers. What is more, e-money in issue in the UK is likely to expand significantly as the prepaid debit card starts to take off.

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>As it stands, Section 24A sets out the definition of &quot;account&quot; in terms of deposit-taking accounts, so e-money accounts would not be caught by the offence. The majority of cases of the fraudulent misuse of another&#039;s e-money account would be covered by the Bill&#039;s new offences, but as the focus of the Bill is on the dishonest behaviour of the defendant, or indeed the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, it would be wise, given that the e-money industry is relatively new but growing rapidly, to ensure that it too is covered by Section 24A.

(a)   if the fraud involved an intention to make a gain and the gain occurred, that occurrence;


<br>
(b)   if the fraud involved an intention to cause a loss or to expose another to a risk of loss and the loss occurred, that occurrence.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_136"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 35A. The amendments look complex but they have a simple aim; that is, to ensure that our courts continue to have jurisdiction over frauds where the only element of the crime that takes place here is the actual gain or loss of property.
</p>

<a name="60131-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 currently gives our courts jurisdiction over fraud offences,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;any act or omission or other event (including any result of one or more acts or omissions), proof of which is required for conviction of the offence.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The existing offence of obtaining property by deception requires both the deception of a victim and the obtaining of property. The offences of obtaining a money transfer by deception and obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception also contain these two distinct elements: the deception and the obtaining. In our global economy, it is frequently the case that the deception can take place in a different country from that in which the transfer takes place. False representation may be made abroad which convinces people in England or Wales to transfer funds to a bank account in London and then on to the fraudster&#039;s account in some other country. At the moment, our courts have jurisdiction over these cases, because, although the deception takes place abroad, the transfer, which is another element of the offence, takes <br>&nbsp;<br>

place in the UK. Similarly, if the transfer takes place abroad but the deception takes place in the UK, our courts have jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="60131-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Schedule 1 already makes consequential amendments to the 1993 Act to provide that it applies to the new offences in the Bill. However, at the moment, the effect of the 1993 Act on the new general fraud offences would be limited due to one crucial difference between the existing deception offences and the new general offence which this Bill will create. Noble Lords will know that under the new fraud offences the emphasis is on the dishonest intention of the defendant to commit the fraud. There is no need to prove that property has actually been obtained. While that is a step forward in prosecuting fraud&#151;we have been over that ground&#151;it means that the jurisdictional provisions in the 1993 Act will not bite on the new offence if the only act within our jurisdiction is the obtaining of property because that would cease to be a &quot;relevant event&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Our concern grows from the fact that people are ever more mobile and more global in outlook, and that outsourced banking and international transactions of all sorts are increasingly taking place. I consider that it is highly desirable to ensure that our courts will continue to have jurisdiction over frauds when the gain or loss that the fraudster makes takes place here. These amendments will ensure that any gain or loss that the fraudster intends to make that actually occurs here will constitute a &quot;relevant event&quot; for the purposes of the jurisdictional provisions. That should ensure that our courts continue to have jurisdiction when property is fraudulently gained in England or Wales, even though the deception has taken place in another country. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>
<a name="60131-18_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 1, line 8, leave out &quot;, in particular&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My noble friends and I thought that we would start with a really difficult and contentious issue. So I will start with a bang by proposing that in Clause 1(2) the words &quot;in particular&quot; should be left out of the introductory words before the lettered paragraphs. It seems perverse that any reference to the London Olympics includes anything which forms part of the games including, in particular matters which one might think were not necessarily central to the games. I am not sure that I would agree that an event taking place outside London will not be as much part of the Olympics or Paralympics as any other event. In paragraph (a),

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;an event, other than a sporting event&quot;,</p>

</p>

<a name="60131-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>The term is used more naturally elsewhere in the Bill. I found in Clause 12(1)(b), for example, a list of the persons, such as highway authorities, that are to co-operate with the ODA in particular with regard to transport services. Clearly, this is not a matter of major politics, but I hope that the Minister can explain what we are to understand by the words &quot;in particular&quot;. I beg to move.

amendment. All I can say is that I quake at what is to come if this is defined in those terms. Let me make the obvious point. Everybody knows what is meant by the games of the Thirtieth Olympiad. The main part of the games will be the sporting events that take place in London in the summer of 2012.
</p>

<a name="60131-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>However, the games go beyond sport, and, in line with the International Olympic Committee&#039;s host city contract, there will be an ongoing, nationwide cultural festival to accompany the sporting occasion. It will include, for instance, the relay for the Olympic torch before the games and the Olympic carnival to be held during their course. The point of Clause 1(2) is to make clear that when the Bill refers to the London Olympics, it refers to the official cultural events to be held under the aegis of the games as well as to the major sporting events which we all understand.
</p>

<a name="60131-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>I also want to make it clear that the events to be held outside London form part of the official definition of the London Olympics. The clause states that a reference to the &quot;London Olympics&quot; includes, in particular, the non-sporting events that are required under the host city contract and the events due to take place outside London. We use the words &quot;in particular&quot; to emphasise the inclusion of these two classes. The amendment would take that away.
</p>

<a name="60131-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>Of course I accept that the main focus of the Olympics will be on sport and on London, where the majority of the activities are to take place, but the central meaning of the &quot;London Olympics&quot; is in fact the games of the Thirtieth Olympiad and the Paralympic Games that will take place in the same year. It is important to recognise the wider scope of the games. We are obliged to recognise it, but we do so with great enthusiasm because they represent the breadth of the concept of the Thirtieth Olympiad. Given that, I hope the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60131-18_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I had to listen to what the noble Lord had to say before deciding whether I would intervene. The breadth and spirit of the Olympiad is a given. We do not need to argue about that. The question being asked by the noble Baroness is why we have to refer to events &quot;in particular&quot;. I am sorry, but his explanation of the breadth of the games is inaccurate and his explanation of the use of those two words is inadequate. They represent what I would call legislative draftsmen&#039;s politesse, to make the subsection look a little better. Perhaps they are paid by the word; I do not know. The phrase adds nothing to the sense of the Bill or, indeed, to the wider concept of the Olympiad.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_5"></a>
<a name="60131-18_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I hear what the noble Lord says, and he is right to say that the words do not have any legal significance. However, I shall reiterate the point I seek to emphasise here. The common understanding of the London Olympics will be the sporting events to be held in London. The Thirtieth Olympiad is wider than that in concept, in geographical area and in function because of the cultural dimension as well as that of sport. We have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC67"></a>

included the words &quot;in particular&quot; because they help to convey the concept of the breadth of the Thirtieth Olympiad&#151;of which, of course, we are proud.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_6"></a>
<a name="60131-18_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   That seems extremely reasonable and Members opposite may be making heavy weather right at the beginning of the Bill. The Title of the Bill refers to the Olympic Games and therefore it might be thought that it does not cover matters other than the games themselves. The word &quot;London&quot; is also used in the title and therefore it might be thought that the Bill does not cover events held outside the capital. Surely it is desirable to make it clear early in the legislation that, in particular, these matters are covered.

However, I fear that at some point someone, probably a lawyer, will ask why these issues are particularised. To that end, the Minister&#039;s explanation is one about the word &quot;including&quot;, not an explanation of the words &quot;in particular&quot;. A problem may arise because those words are used elsewhere in the Bill. I was brought up to believe that a phrase should always mean the same thing and be used clearly and consistently throughout a text.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>My amendments deal with the membership of, and other matters relating to, the constitution of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The first amendment proposes that the chair of the London Organising Committee shall be a member of that authority. LOCOG and the ODA have separate responsibilities, but there needs to be co-ordination. The Minister in the Commons said at the first sitting of the Committee on the Bill, in col. 10 of the <i>Official Report</i>, that it was right that the chair of LOCOG had a role in the overall governance of the Olympic project; but he went on to say that that should be through the Olympic board and that the chair should not have a supervisory role over the ODA chair. I am not proposing that, but the Minister talked about the two jobs being complementary.

<a name="60131-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>I do not understand from those comments why there was an objection to the chair of LOCOG, or its representative, being part of the ODA to ensure that close working. A formal link would seem appropriate in this case. A complicated diagram is doing the rounds showing those relationships. In practice, a close working relationship goes up through the Olympic board, involving the Secretary of State, the Mayor and the British Olympic Association. Going up through the board and coming back down again seems unnecessarily tortuous and heavy-handed.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>Amendment No. 5 would leave out paragraphs 7 and 8, which require the approval of the Secretary of State for the appointment of a finance director and director of transport of the ODA. I have tabled Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to ask the Minister why it is necessary not only to provide that the ODA shall have finance and transport directors, but that they shall be individuals approved by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>I have tabled amendments to be considered later seeking greater understanding of the control that it seems that the Secretary of State will have at every stage of every decision that the ODA will take, but at this point I am asking why the Secretary of State needs to be involved in these two appointments and why, right at the start of the schedule, there is such a distrust of the Secretary of State&#039;s appointees to the board. I would have thought that they would and should get on with the job. Amendment No. 6 is consequential. I beg to move.

The reason for my disagreement is that I know that the chairman of LOCOG and his team want to be absolutely apolitical. The ODA will be in part a political organisation.

<a name="60131-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>The structure makes clear that LOCOG and the ODA have separate, if mainly complementary, roles and responsibilities. Basically, LOCOG organises the games&#151;the events themselves. The ODA gets everything else ready for the games&#151;the venues, the transport and the infrastructure. Those two organisations are brought together at the level of the Olympic board which, as Members of the Committee will know, consists of the Secretary of State, the Mayor, the chair of the British Olympic Association and the chair of LOCOG. The chair of the ODA will also attend all the meetings of the Olympic board and will be expected to provide monthly progress reports on the project. The chair of LOCOG will have the opportunity to raise in that forum any concerns about the work of the ODA and its impact on the games themselves at the highest organisational level.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>That was the point that my right honourable friend sought to make in Committee in the other place. I hope that the Committee will recognise that we have thought the model through&#151;where those two bodies have their separate and clear responsibilities; where they need to interlock and be made accountable; and where LOCOG can question the ODA effectively at the highest level. Of course, that model has been agreed with the International Olympic Committee, which has a very obvious interest in the preparations that we are making. We do not think that it would be appropriate to confuse the direct lines of accountability that we are establishing for the ODA by putting a LOCOG representative on the board, which would change the nature of that role.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>The ODA is directly accountable to the Secretary of State and to both Houses of Parliament. It is appropriate that a non-departmental public body should be so, because the ODA will be spending a very considerable amount of public money. It must remain independent of the London organising committee. It must be focused on its task, and it must bear down on costs. The ODA must work closely with all Olympic stakeholders. It will report on progress to those stakeholders at the Olympic board level, on which as I have indicated LOCOG will be represented through its chair. It is that board that will provide overall strategic co-ordination and monitoring of the entire Olympic project. That is why it is so important that we ensure that the chair of LOCOG has a seat on that <br>&nbsp;<br>

board. I understand the point that the noble Baroness is making, and we considered it very carefully, but the accountability is on a model that has won the acceptance of the IOC and which will make sure that there is clear accountability for the two distinct roles of the bodies.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, mentioned Amendment No. 4. I, too, regret the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, but we all understand the pressing business elsewhere, in which I am sure he takes a consuming interest. I am sure that everyone in this room takes a consuming interest in what is happening elsewhere, but we have rather more extensive obligations in regard to this matter. I recognise the point that noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, makes that the relationship with the London boroughs is important. The amendment would require the ODA board to include at least one member on the board who represents the interests of the London boroughs. We all recognise that the interests of the London boroughs will be of the greatest importance to the delivery of the games, and we are greatly heartened at the response of the key boroughs to the work that is going on. It is obviously essential that the ODA works closely with the borough councils.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>When we considered how the ODA ought to interact with the borough councils and with others that greatly impact on its work&#151;and on which it is in many ways dependent&#151;we took the decision that the ODA board members should be chosen not for their representative quality, which is not the role of the board, but for the expertise that they bring to the overall organisation of the infrastructure relating to the games. We do not think that that would be achieved by arguing that there should be representation of any particular group. The noble Baroness might, in all fairness, say that if the amendment were carried and the crucial local London boroughs were included on the board, she could think of other interests that had at least an equal representative right. We would be faced with the concept of a representative board rather than a functional board brought together for its expertise. It is that latter model that we are working on. If the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, was here, that would be the reply that I would give him. By proxy, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred to the amendment, that is our argument against that amendment.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>The ODA&#039;s task will change and evolve over the next six years from planning and construction to co-ordination of games time arrangements, and to the reconfiguring of legacy venues when the games are concluded. It is probable that the membership of the board will need to change to reflect the different skills and expertise which will be required as these functions alter. That is why we want the board to be functional and task-related, not representative.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_26"></a>I recognise it is important that the board must have a good level of local knowledge and awareness. That is why paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 1 stipulates that when appointing members, the Secretary of State shall have regard to their experience of the places where the authority will carry out its functions. Clearly, one could not expect the ODA to fail to consist of some <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

individuals with a real knowledge of the part of London where the games will be mainly focused. In advertising for board members, we make clear that one of the specific appointments of expertise will be someone with experience of community liaison; with an understanding of key local, social and political issues in east London; with significant leadership experience in local government; and with a clear vision of how to ensure delivery of a legacy for the local area. We cannot get more explicit than that in indicating that we recognise the strength of the concept that has been put forward. We hope that these measures will ensure that the board is appointed with the right skills to carry out the changing tasks, but will also have a sufficiently high level of local knowledge to exercise its functions sensitively.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_27"></a>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would remove from the Bill the requirements for the ODA to appoint finance and transport directors and the requirements for the Secretary of State to approve those two appointments, which are of cardinal significance. They are the two key executive appointments. The director of transport will be the head of the Olympic Transport Authority, operating within the ODA, and co-ordinating all transport plans for the games. It is no secret that we had to overcome in the successful bid the real challenge with regard to transport and the games. It was always stated in the context of Paris, but also for other cities which were competitors in the last stages, that it had got a comparatively easy transport proforma in comparison to the challenge of London. I think that at Second Reading, noble Lords were at pain to point out what a challenge London presents in terms of transport. It is, which is why we will discuss how these transport challenges are to be met and the arrangements for them.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a>There is no doubt that the emphasis that we placed on transport planning within the ODA played a key part in convincing the International Olympics Committee that London was equipped to stage the games and could meet the challenge of transport. We all recognise that it is one of the most complex and congested cities in the world. I might particularly refer to the east London position, although I dare not say that east London is more ill favoured at present than other areas, because all the other areas of London will say, &quot;Have you learnt anything at all in your role as transport spokesman in their Lordships&#039; House, if you have not recognised the problems of other parts of London?&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a> I think that the Committee will recognise that there is much to do about the infrastructure of transport and the plans that we will need, which is why we have put such a great emphasis on this role. It is painfully obvious that the finance director will manage very large sums of public money that the ODA will be spending and will bear down on the costs of the construction project. That is a massive challenge. These two figures are crucial to making the Olympic project work effectively, on time and on budget. These two appointments need to be specified in the Bill. From the good governance point of view, given that <br>&nbsp;<br>

those appointments will be made very early on in the life of the ODA, the Secretary of State should approve the appointments. She eventually takes the ultimate responsibility with regard to the development of the games.

<a name="gc_time_1"></a>

</p>

<a name="60131-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>The ODA will of course lead the recruitment process and make the appointments. The Bill provides only that the Secretary of State, with her ultimate responsibility, makes such key decisions. That is why it is included in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60131-19_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness says and hope that I have convinced her that in being specific about these two positions, we recognise their salience to the success of the project. These are early days and these appointments will be made in early days. They will need the confidence of the Secretary of State.

<a name="60131-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I am sure that my noble friend Lady Hamwee will deal with the substance of the Minister&#039;s remarks. However, I want to return to the detailed structural points he made, for which I thank him. He made it clear several times&#151;indeed, the Olympic staging structures chart makes it clear&#151;that the chairman of the ODA, Mr Lemley, will be only an observer; he will have no representation on the board, yet the Minister, throughout his remarks, has made clear the importance of the role of the ODA.
</p>

<a name="60131-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>Getting the structures right at the beginning is crucial and I do not understand why observer status has been granted to the chairman of the ODA and not full membership of the board. As the Minister said, the Olympic board is responsible for oversight and monitoring of the entire Olympic project. Surely, having the chair of the ODA on the board as a full member would be a more effective way of doing that.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_13"></a>
<a name="60131-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I hear what the noble Lord says. He or she will attend all meetings and will be expected to report. There is no doubt that the report of the ODA chair will be of great significance to the Olympic board in the overall consideration of the project. The noble Lord will recognise that we are being extremely careful in the composition of the board. He will also recognise the significance of those figures. We believe that the structure is right and that the ODA chair attends all meetings but in a reporting function. It is a non-governmental public body, so it has a particular relationship with the Secretary of State in the way it spends public money. We do not put such chairs on an overall governing body in those terms. Obviously, on their own body they play that role, but when they are reporting they are answerable for the work they have done. That is the reason for this structure.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_14"></a>
<a name="60131-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I am slightly surprised that the chairman of the ODA will be &quot;non-executive&quot;. In today&#039;s modern world, I thought there was no longer such a thing as a truly non-executive chairman of anything, certainly not of corporations and companies. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The longest experience I have had was 11&#189; years on the Millennium Commission and the chairman was always the Secretary of State. I reminded one Secretary of State, Chris Smith, on behalf of the commissioners, that he was chairman of the Millennium Commission when he was with us and that his Permanent Secretary and his Red Box stayed outside the door. He and all his other colleagues who had been chairmen performed in that way. Nevertheless, occasionally a vote had to be taken and the chairman had the casting vote. Do I understand that under this legislation, the chairman of the ODA in this vitally important role will not have the casting vote in a decision-making situation because he is purely an observer? Have I misunderstood something?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_15"></a>
<a name="60131-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We are talking about his attendance at the Olympic board, which is chaired by the Secretary of State. This individual is chair of a non-governmental public body. Of course he is responsible for the discharge of his functions to the Secretary of State and, wider, to Parliament, as I have indicated. But he is not an equal voting member on the board because of that relationship. He is answerable to the Olympic board and we see that as clear lines of responsibility and answerability, not executive responsibility. The chair, in his report, will be a crucial part of every meeting of the Olympic board, but he certainly does not need to be a member and we do not think it is right that he should be.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_16"></a>
<a name="60131-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   Perhaps I may press the Minister on this. The logic of what he says is that the Secretary of State takes responsibility for the actions of the ODA at the Olympic board meetings. If the Minister confirms that that is what the Secretary of State is doing, and that the ODA has a reporting function, he is saying that the Secretary of State is assuming the entire responsibility for the actions of the ODA as regards the meetings of the board. If that is the case, it is a clear line of governance, but it is one that the public need to recognise. All those involved in the Olympics should recognise that the Secretary of State is assuming that level of responsibility.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_17"></a>
<a name="60131-20_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Let us be careful about the issues of responsibility. I indicated that the chair of the ODA is the chair of a non-governmental public body and is ultimately responsible to the Secretary of State and to Parliament for expenditures. But there is another line of accountability. The Olympic board is responsible to the International Olympic Committee for the conduct of the games. The Mayor is there because he is the Mayor of the host city, London. The chair of the British Olympic Association is there because he is chair of the host body for the Olympic movement. The LOCOG chair is there because he is responsible for the organisation committee of the London Olympic Games. The Secretary of State is there because she is also a joint signatory to the underwriting bid. That body of four is answerable to the International Olympic Committee.
</p>

<a name="60131-20_para1"></a>

of the board. It is inconceivable that a great deal of the work of the Olympic board at its meetings would not consist of such a crucial report. But that body is not designated in terms of any responsibility to the International Olympic Committee. The other members on the Olympic board are. That is why they are in that particular relationship.

A rather more practical and less high-flown level was in my head.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>I shall deal first with paragraphs 7 and 8 in the schedule relating to the directors of finance and transport. My point was not that there should not be such directors, but that it is for the ODA to address its structures and the individuals appointed. After all, there will be enough control by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State has more than a hand in the appointment of the chair of the ODA. I cannot conceive that the Secretary of State would appoint a chair of the authority she did not trust to take sensible decisions about the structure. However, I have made that point.

In discussing this, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, or the Minister in response to him made the point about LOCOG being apolitical. The converse is, as LOCOG is apolitical, so the ODA is political. That is how it has been described. That raises some interesting issues, given that we are told it is to be an executive body. There are many issues around governance and the executive nature of these bodies, which I find perplexing. It might be clear when we see it in black and white on a page.

The structure that the Government are putting in place would result in the chairs of LOCOG and the ODA meeting on the fringes of the Olympic board to discuss matters which should go across. No line on the diagram links LOCOG and the ODA. You have to go right up the page and come down again to see where the links might be.

The theme running through the amendments is an attempt to discover how the Government have gone about acquiring expertise to deal with disability and the functions of and limitations on those confronted with disability. We must ensure that initially we have the knowledge and ability to be able to address the problems.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>I am sure that the Government have a process in mind in that regard. However, it would be beneficial to be given a description of it, to be told how it is progressing and what they are going to achieve. For example, as regards the housing legacy of the Olympic village, will all housing adhere to the lifetime homes standards as a minimum standard&#151;that is, a standard which allows for greater ease of conversion and different types of conversion? If that is the case, it will be easier to get rid of the on-costs. If all the facilities can be converted, you will be able to convert them to suit different kinds of disability. That would be a very sensible provision to include with regard to all housing, but in this case I suggest that it would be an absolute &quot;no-brainer&quot; not to include it.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>What status does accessibility have as regards planning consents? Is it at the forefront of consideration in that area? There are always trade-offs in that regard but accessibility should come towards the forefront of consideration of the Paralympic Games. I believe that 1 per cent of those watching the games will require seats in the main stadium which are suitable for disabled people and I suggest that for the Paralympic Games that figure will be higher, as will the number of support staff who may want to watch. The usual way to become a member of the support staff is to have participated in the relevant sport oneself. I suggest that many of those participating in the Paralympic Games will use wheelchairs.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_47"></a>Clause 10 is concerned with transport&#151;a matter with which the noble Lord, Lord Davies, and I are familiar.

We may not have reached the highest point in any international table, but we have a record to be proud of&#151;and I am talking about the product of more than one administration. The Disability Act 1995 was passed under the previous administration and we have extended that work. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, was involved in those developments. So we have a good legislative basis to underpin that work, which provides obligations on public authorities.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>In addition, the International Olympic Committee requires that the needs of all disabled people be addressed. I made that point at Second Reading, as was recognised in the House. It is inconceivable that the IOC can put such a stress on the virtues and advantages of the Paralympics without being concerned about spectators and participants being able to access the Olympic Games and the Paralympics. So the Olympic committee has real concerns and stipulations in this area. The London bid would not have been successful unless it had included a very significant indication of how far we were advanced in legislative terms on concerns for the disabled in terms of our public bodies and those responsible for broad planning for the games, and <br>&nbsp;<br>

particularly how we would meet some of the detailed points that the noble Lord has raised in his amendments.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>He will recognise that I am in some difficulty on the detail; the ODA is only just being established. I hasten to add that the work has already started. I will do my best to reassure him, but he will know that there is a great deal of work to be done. The ODA is a public authority within the meaning of the relevant provisions of disability legislation, so it would be governed by all the legislation that we have in place. Section 49D of the Disability Discrimination Act allows Ministers to place listed public sector bodies under specific duties to publish equality schemes, to involve the views of disabled people in their planning and to report on their progress. The ODA fits into those requirements as a public body. The Government believe that those duties on the public sector are important tools in transforming our society into one that is more equal and provides greater opportunities for disabled people.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>The noble Lord will appreciate the obvious point that legislation takes time to enact. I recall that he was very active in transport legislation, and we have huge investments in certain aspects of transport. He will know that already great progress has been made on disabled access to London buses, which then led to criticism that some old favourites did not match up&#151;the famous Routemaster debate. I am not able to reassure him on the general position of disabled access to trains until we have reached a renewed rolling stock as far ahead as 2018. He also knows that we have progressive targets, and implementation of disabled regulations, that all new rolling stock has to be geared to the requirements. We have a programme of progress on this.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>Rome was not built in a day, and, when it comes to essential support for the disabled and the conversion of many existing structures, these things take time. I assure him that as a public body the ODA will be working against those timetables and in a framework in which we as a Government are concerned to improve the position for the disabled&#151;of course to meet his points on the Olympic Games, but also in the wider society. The ODA will satisfy all the criteria to suggest that it should develop a disability equality scheme, and that will be a requirement.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>In developing the Olympic park, the ODA will be bound by the terms of Olympic planning permission, as I mentioned. The International Olympic Committee is concerned about these matters, and it requires the production of an access-for-all framework, which must be approved by local planning authorities. The noble Lord will be aware of the extent to which local planning authorities also have to have due regard to disability legislation. I could in this Committee&#151;if the Committee had that degree of tolerance&#151;list all the requirements on planning authorities. It would be a long list. The planning authorities will need to meet the requirements of the International Olympic Committee and our legislation concerning disabled people.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>The LDA commissioned the Centre for Accessible Environments to produce the access-for-all framework. It now exists in draft form and will be shortly issued for consultation with the relevant local authorities. So progress is being made.
<a name="gc_time_3"></a>
<a name="60131-21_time1"></a><h5>4.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60131-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>I turn to the amendments, having placed them in the context that we entirely share the noble Lord&#039;s objectives and are working towards them. Amendment No. 3 would include experience of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_7"></a>&quot;equality matters, including disability access&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_60"></a>as an additional criterion for the Secretary of State to consider in making ODA appointments. We do not doubt the importance of ensuring that there are board members with real understanding of those issues. We are looking for one board member with significant experience of working successfully with disability groups as an adviser or lobbyist; an understanding of access for the disabled; a working knowledge of the Disability Discrimination Act; and the experience of staging or advising on national or international events, preferably sporting.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_61"></a>So we are making specifications for a board member, but I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that it would add an inordinate amount of detail to specify all that for the ODA board in the Bill. I entirely recognise his point about the significance of the disabled, but we would then be obliged to specify a whole plethora of expertise that would be essential to the effectiveness of the board&#039;s workings. That degree of detail would be out of place in the Bill. I assure him that we expect an individual to be appointed to the ODA by advertisement under that essential specification.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>Amendment No. 19 would require the ODA, when fulfilling its functions under Clause 4, to ensure that premises and facilities are fully accessible to disabled people. As I said, the ODA will be subject to the law of the land, including Section 49 of the Disability Discrimination Act, and we expect it to draw up the disability scheme that I mentioned.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>Amendment No. 28 would require the ODA to have regard to social inclusion and the promotion of diversity and equality in carrying out all of its functions. As an employer, the ODA will be governed by race relations and disability discrimination legislation to ensure that it offers opportunities for all. The Bill also spells out some specific responsibilities for the ODA, in its role as the manager of a future construction project, to contribute to sustainable development and to keep a constant eye on the legacy, which will include the social legacy of the games as well as the economic and environmental legacy. I think that that is what the noble Lord was driving at when he said that he expected to see advancement of the interests of the disabled to be part of the social legacy of the games.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>So at the heart of that project, which will regenerate east London, is a crucial expectation of improvement in facilities for the disabled, but the noble Lord will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recognise that the body with the overall responsibility for that is not the ODA. That is for the GLA. We cannot give the responsibilities of the GLA to what is essentially a technocratic delivery agency, such as the ODA. However, the ODA will certainly be governed by that broad framework. The noble Lord will know the extent to which the Greater London Authority is concerned to make progress on those matters.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para26"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>Amendment No. 84 would introduce a new clause to provide the Secretary of State with a specific power to make grants to a range of bodies beyond the ODA. That was discussed in Committee in another place. The Minister there made clear that the Secretary of State already holds the necessary powers and will use them where they are required.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para27"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>Amendment Nos. 44, 45 and 48 are aimed at ensuring that the Olympic transport plan takes account of the needs of disabled people. I have already referred to the real progress that we are making on transport matters. The transport plan submitted to the International Olympic Committee emphasised that it met IOC requirements for the disabled and went beyond them. As I mentioned before, for London to present a successful bid, it had to meet the very demanding transport requirements of the IOC. That was an important part of our successful bid, and we intend to fulfil it.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para28"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>Amendment No. 48 would require the ODA to consult the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee and other representatives of disabled groups. It is not possible for us to list all the ODA&#039;s obligations with its significant responsibilities. We cannot list every body which it would need to consult by putting them in the Bill, but I expect the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee to be consulted by the ODA; in fact, it is unthinkable that the ODA could deliver its functions in this area without being in consultation with such an important body.
</p>

<a name="60131-21_para29"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>I want to assure the noble Lord that he is not pushing at an open door; he is joining a willing team in wanting to make significant advances with regard to the rights of the disabled. The Olympic games offers many opportunities. This is a great one and we intend to take it. I am grateful to him for highlighting the importance of these issues with his amendments.

<a name="60131-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I think that the Minister has answered the point I wished to raise. But, to go back to his words, he said that the local planning authority has to approve the conditions regarding the disabled. That is fine. Local planning authorities and members of local authorities are subject to a raft of legislation. They are familiar with the obligations that that would impose. But, in this instance, on the main Olympic site, the local planning authority is the Olympic Delivery Authority. It is created as the authority to undertake the development of the site. I was not quite sure whether the Minister said that in establishing this authority it will be subject to all the same external legislation which would apply to a local authority, which is not necessarily a part of the planning regulations.

I am not absolutely certain from what the Minister has said so far that the obligations which authorities across the country accept are imposed on the ODA.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_25"></a>
<a name="60131-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Of course the ODA is not a planning authority in the same way that local authorities are. I was seeking to emphasise that, first, it can do its work only in consultation with local planning authorities, and all are governed by these requirements. Secondly, the ODA, as a non-governmental public body, has responsibilities under legislation and will be expected to hit the same targets as public bodies with regard to legislation for the disabled.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_26"></a>
<a name="60131-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   I have a further question for the Minister. Is he giving us the assurance that&#151;for instance&#151;the high minimum standards for these new state-of-the-art developments would be the normal way of proceeding within the Olympic village and its facilities? Would that be the norm; that is, the highest that we can attain at the moment? The housing situation has cropped up several times. It would help if we can be given an assurance that the lifetime home standard or some other relevant standard would be a minimum standard. I know that that was not the question on the Marshalled List in the form of the amendment, but if that is the way that the thinking is going, many worries would start to disappear.
</p>

<a name="60131-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>The noble Lord has given a very helpful answer, but perhaps he can give us a little more information. I do not particularly want to come back to this if we can get the information now. I just wondered whether he could go a little further, or perhaps he does not have the information at the moment.


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_27"></a>
<a name="60131-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I may need to write to the noble Lord about that degree of detail. In broad terms, I emphasise that we expect the development of the Olympic Games to be a trailblazer achievement for this country in all respects. By 2012, the last time that we hosted the games will have been 64 years ago. We hosted those games under wartime privation; we hope to conduct these games in far happier times. The heart of the Olympic bid was the trailblazing quality of its provision, particularly for social inclusion. Disability provision was crucial.
</p>

<a name="60131-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>The ODA will be bound by the terms of the Olympic planning permissions, and it requires the production of an access-for-all framework, as I emphasised in my opening remarks. We have our objectives. Even if we had not won the bid, we would have&#151;as we do&#151;ambitious legislation for increased opportunity for the disabled, and our legislation will undoubtedly be improved as the years go by. The Olympic Games impose an additional demand on us. In winning the bid, we had to tell the International Olympic Committee that we would meet Olympic planning permissions related to access-for-all. We did meet those specifications, and it was a crucial part of our winning bid. I assure the Committee that in doing so <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC82"></a>

we set up a significant series of criteria that we had to meet. I had sought not to bore the Committee by listing them all; it would take me an extensive period of time. I am prepared to include those in a note to the noble Lord, and I am sure that he will then be satisfied.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>Page 32, line 27, leave out &quot;, with the approval of the Secretary of State,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_30"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 7, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, 13 to 18 and 22. What unites all the amendments is the issue of the autonomy&#151;or otherwise&#151;of the Olympic Delivery Authority. I have already said that there seems to be an extraordinary degree of control by the Secretary of State written into the Bill. The Secretary of State has the right to approve people who are not members of the ODA as members of an ODA committee. Amendment No. 7 addresses that by removing it. The Secretary of State has the right to approve people who are not members either of the ODA or of an ODA committee as members of an ODA sub-committee. That is addressed in Amendment No. 8.

</p>

<a name="60131-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_74"></a>The Secretary of State has the right of direction of the Olympic Delivery Authority under Paragraph 18(1)(b) of Schedule 1. It is not just a question of giving guidance to the authority, but a direction with which the authority must comply. Sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) flesh out the issue of the direction by saying that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_9"></a>&quot;A direction may, in particular&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_75"></a>it is a different particularity from the first amendment&#151;do certain things. It requires the Olympic Delivery Authority to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>&quot;obtain the Secretary of State&#039;s consent before taking action of a specified kind&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>In other words, this is a sort of negative power of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may also under a direction,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_11"></a>&quot;require the Authority to accept or assume specified duties, rights or liabilities under contracts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>That is a positive power on the part of the Secretary of State.

</p>

<a name="60131-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>I appreciate that the Secretary of State is under certain obligations to consult. I realise that if I had been a little more sophisticated in my amendments, I would have changed sub-paragraphs (3) and (4). Although they may apply to directions, in particular they would apply to guidance. However, my general point concerns the level of directions. The Secretary of State&#039;s control extends a very long way into the operation of the ODA, including board matters that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one would expect an organisation just to get on with. The remuneration of the chair and members is dealt with in Amendment No. 13.
</p>

<a name="60131-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>On travelling and other allowances, dealt with under paragraph 28(1)(b), I wonder whether the Secretary of State will have to sign chitties allowing rail travel to Manchester and perhaps saying, &quot;Well, you can go, but only if you can go at a cheap rate&quot;. I cannot imagine that that will be the case, but such a degree of potential intervention is beyond my comprehension. On pensions allowances or gratuities, it is hard to know how one should distinguish between some of the allowances referred to&#151;in particular, what gratuities might be justified. Perhaps this is a hint that the Secretary of State will not agree to pay any members, so that they get gratuities instead. Are pensions allowances and gratuities a matter for the ODA? Given current controversies, one would think that a Secretary of State would wish to avoid getting involved in issues of compensation for loss of office, but perhaps that will die down before any of this becomes relevant.
</p>

<a name="60131-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>Amendment No. 22 refers to Clause 4(2)(k), which states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_12"></a>&quot;financial assistance [to the ODA] in connection with anything done or to be done by another person for a purpose&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>of the authority taking the actions that it considers necessary is also subject to the Secretary of State&#039;s consent. That is in a different category from the other amendments in this group, but it raises questions about what sort of detail it is anticipated that the Secretary of State will be involved with. I may be wrong, but I read paragraph (k) as dealing with contracts which the ODA will sign. The amendment is intended to elicit how it is anticipated that that will work. For example, does the Secretary of State expect to approve every contract, or will approval of financial assistance up to a certain limit be given in a blanket way?
</p>

<a name="60131-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>The other amendments deal with the authority&#039;s internal workings. The provisions anticipate that the Government will not trust the authority. If they cannot trust the authority to decide whom to co-opt to sub-committees, do they trust the ODA to deliver the 2012 Olympic Games? I beg to move.

When I read the Bill on the back of the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments, on thinking about it, it is incomprehensible how the Government can think that a body that it intends to set up as an authority with, arguably, more powers than most local authorities&#151;certainly in specific areas&#151;could operate and work effectively with continuous and repeated departmental interference. That is what &quot;the Secretary of State&#039;s approval&quot; means. She is not going to look at every decision that is made. It will be departmental interference on a massive scale.

If the Government want an authority that will do the job that they ask it to do, to deliver and perform, it will not be a government department&#151;with all due respect to members of the Civil Service present&#151;it will be a group who have operated effectively and efficiently in the private sector and who are used to being supported well by their staff, but who make their own decisions for their own reasons and deliver. If there is one thing in the Bill that will guarantee failure of the ODA, it is that it will be messed about and continually interfered with, particularly in its early days when it is trying to get its act together, by the department.

One may start with the proposition that the Secretary of State should give his approval to members of the committee&#151;they might be significant committees&#151;and that sounds reasonable. One may start with the proposition that the Secretary of State should have a final approval role with regard to remuneration. One is then asked to consider all the other possibilities&#151;not just committees but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said at the end of her remarks, sub-committees&#151;and not just remuneration but all kinds of allowances and the price of a railway ticket, and so one could go on.

I am delighted that Members of the Committee opposite conceded one point: that an official rather than the Secretary of State might do that. This is not about trust, it is about accountability. The Secretary of State must be in that position in the Bill in relation to the functions of the Olympic Delivery Authority because that body will spend millions of pounds of public money. It must be accountable: it is accountable to the Secretary of State and through her to Parliament. That is why the Secretary of State is identified as the body to which the ODA is accountable. That is not the same as saying that every detailed decision that the ODA is involved in is subject to the Secretary of State. There could be decisions of very great significance. I am sure <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC85"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that Members of the Committee opposite do not envisage creating an ODA without accountability, with the Secretary of State having been deleted. How will that body be accountable?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_34"></a>
<a name="60131-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   This body will be auditable. It will report to Parliament.

<a name="60131-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Those checks and balances are there and I do not underestimate their significance, but I know who takes the rap if things go wrong. This body will be ultimately accountable to the Secretary of State, which is why the body must be accountable for its decisions. I accept entirely the representations made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that it would be absurd if we pitched the level of accountability too low. We are concerned to identify powers and structures in the Bill.

<a name="60131-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a>I make clear that those are largely reserve powers for the Secretary of State. They need to be. She needs to be mentioned in the Bill because she is ultimately responsible to Parliament for the work of the body. She needs to know just what the board is doing. One might say, &quot;Can&#039;t the ODA be trusted to make additional appointments?&quot;, which is the issue at stake in the noble Baroness&#039;s Amendments Nos. 7 and 8. Let us be absolutely clear, the ODA has considerable power. The Secretary of State has appointed the original board. But are Members suggesting that the delivery authority could be free to make additional appointments without any sanction from anyone? Of course it is to be trusted, but if things went wrong, if injudicious appointments were made, only one person would be accountable for that. It would not be the chair going before a Select Committee or national audit. Responsibility would be with the Secretary of State who had appointed that individual. There must be a reserve position.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>Is it then suggested that the Secretary of State will interfere in every decision? Of course not. That is not the concept at all, but in legislation we need to make it absolutely clear that the ODA in exercising its power has these areas of final responsibility. It has to be accountable to Ministers and to Parliament. Otherwise, we are going against prudence in suggesting that we can take away the reserve responsibility of the Secretary of State and say, &quot;Well, we have created a public body, and it has been appointed by the Secretary of State. We know from all public bodies throughout the whole history of our country that nothing can ever go wrong. It is therefore not necessary for that body to be answerable to the Secretary of State&quot;. Such a position cannot seriously be maintained.

<a name="60131-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>If the noble Baroness is saying that the concern here is that the Secretary of State will involve herself or her officials in the minutiae of the operation of the ODA, I hope that we are able to occupy our civil servants in the department much more intelligently than in <br>&nbsp;<br>

supervising travel chits for ODA members. But given the huge expenditures for which the ODA will be responsible, ultimate accountability for that expenditure must rest with the Secretary of State. Common sense should prevail at each level, and I take it that at this point we are arguing a point of principle.

</p>

<a name="60131-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>Let me take another illustration. If the Olympic Delivery Authority appoints individuals to carry out valuable but nonetheless lowly tasks in the organisation, neither the Secretary of State nor anyone acting on her behalf in the department will be interested in pay and conditions at that level; of course not. But surely it is not seriously contended that the pay and conditions of the chair and board members of such a significant body should not be a matter for the Secretary of State. I do not know of a comparable public body, bearing responsibilities of this kind, in which a Secretary of State would not take a real interest in the level of remuneration. How would you know what you are pitching for in the market in the quality of the individuals you seek if you are not interested in pay and conditions? I am sorry if Members on the other side of the Committee feel that this is a bit demeaning to the Secretary of State, but it is not bad management practice&#151;here I concede to the greater management expertise of many noble Lords&#151;to care a great deal about the pay and conditions of the staff one employs. It is a principle of effective corporate operation. I do not have the slightest hesitation in suggesting that the Secretary of State should concern herself with those matters at the highest level.
</p>

<a name="60131-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>I concede entirely the point that the pitch must be right, but we are talking about legislation. If we remove the provision, the Secretary of State will have no responsibility. All I seek to do to sustain my case is to point out that there are circumstances in which it is clear that this responsibility and the need to be answerable to the Secretary of State will be necessary.
</p>

<a name="60131-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 would remove the Secretary of State&#039;s power to issue a direction to the ODA. I should point out that this is a reserve power. We hope that it will never be used. I am certain in my own mind that the operation of the ODA would have to be in dire straits if such a power had to be used. It would suggest a breakdown in trust and of operational capacity that presented us with very real difficulties. But if things ultimately went wrong, the Secretary of State is answerable to Parliament and to the people of this country for the successful operation of this body. Given that, she must have a reserve power.
</p>

<a name="60131-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>I accept that much can be made of the fact that because the Secretary of State appears in this guise&#151;her function would be deleted by these amendments&#151;it may look like the exercise of overweening power. That is not so, rather it is the exercise of proper accountability. No one would suggest that the ODA could possibly function if it did not have significant power over and responsibility for its own operations. Moreover, the quality of the people the we seek to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60131-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   Can the Minister pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, about the National Audit Office? Can he give us any examples of other comparable bodies audited by the NAO to which we might look for guidance on how these things might be done? While he thinks about that, I am not sure whether he gave a detailed response to Amendment No. 22, which is included in this group. In the excitement, I may have missed his remarks.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_37"></a>
<a name="60131-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am sorry if I did not reply directly to Amendment No. 22, which concerns the question of consent before the ODA supplies funding to any other body to carry out work in connection with Olympic purposes. We want the ODA to have the flexibility to make financial arrangements, and of course it will do so. But really major projects cannot be commissioned without first checking with the Secretary of State, who will be responsible for them. Some of the contracts will be very large indeed. I do not doubt that the exercise of these powers will be limited, but we cannot hand over to a non-elected body answerable only to the Secretary of State significant powers to enable huge expenditures and say only that at some stage the National Audit Office will pick up aspects of its operation.
</p>

<a name="60131-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>The National Audit Office has a broad sweep of responsibility for a large number of public bodies. The Secretary of State is responsible for one of the most critical of all the functions over the new few years for the success of our Olympic Games. I seek merely to emphasise the obvious responsibility for big projects. Again, we hope that the ODA will develop such a degree of trust in its efficiency, judgment and capacity that none of these issues will ever arise. As I said earlier regarding the reserve power, I do not expect it to be exercised in the lifetime of the ODA. But the body must be accountable.
</p>

<a name="60131-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>The noble Baroness asked me to cite examples. Public bodies in other areas have exactly these responsibilities. I had the enormous good fortune to chair a public body&#151;the Further Education Funding Council, which was responsible for investing billions of pounds in the further education sector. The council was open to challenge by the National Audit Office. It could look at our books to guard against the misuse of public money. But our accountability in terms of the role we played within our democracy was to the Secretary of State for Education, for the obvious reason that he&#151;it was a &quot;he&quot; at the time&#151;answered for the council in the House. The same applies to this body.

</p>

to propose a deletion in order to have a debate. I hope that I have made it clear that that was in a category quite different from issues such as travel allowances. I understand that there will be enormous contracts. I may be wrong, but I believe that the undergrounding of the power lines will be in the order of &#163;2.75 billion. I appreciate that you do not sign a cheque for that without thinking very hard and being accountable. My question was on how this would operate and at what level the Secretary of State is likely to be involved. It may be that the Minister has given me a commonsense answer, that we will see how it goes&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_39"></a>
<a name="60131-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I may not have been as accurate in my commonsense as I sought to be. I understand the noble Baroness&#039;s anxiety. The Committee is concerned about whether the degree of control will be exercised at such a level as to be absurdly burdensome and interfere with the effective operation of the ODA and, what is more, whether the Secretary of State will have excessive power. I understand those reservations. I am seeking to indicate that we must have in the legislation the reserve position of the Secretary of State, but I must be able to assure the Committee about the pitch. I am having great difficulty with that and the noble Baroness is rightly reflecting that in her summing up of her amendments.
</p>

<a name="60131-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>The financial memorandum and management statement, the control mechanisms of the ODA, will be set. They will be the delegated levels of expenditure for the authority, and we will be talking in terms of millions. The Secretary of State will agree what is proper for the body to spend, like other public bodies which spend considerable amounts of public money. They are answerable to their relevant Secretary of State, but it is not expected that the Secretary of State signs the travel chits for any member of the body. That is the same with this organisation; there will be an agreement about the levels.
</p>

<a name="60131-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>As regards the reserve powers, I am talking about when things may go massively wrong with expenditure at that level. As regards contracts, I am not talking about the drawing-pin contracts but the big ones in which the Secretary of State would necessarily play a part if there were public anxiety about the way in which a contract had been awarded. The National Audit Commission would not move into action, but the other place and this House would ask questions and Ministers would be answerable.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_40"></a>
<a name="60131-24_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   We are getting nearer agreement, but there is still room for much re-writing. I have read nowhere about the Government&#039;s intention to present a set of financial directions to the ODA. In the Millennium Commission, we spent several billions over years&#151;big money. One of the first things we were presented with, and which we debated with government, was a set of financial directions. That controlled the things that the Minister spoke of wanting to control without having continuous interference. That, and having to report to the committee in the other place, the overseeing of the NAO and the normal audit procedures is a better way <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC89"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC89</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of gaining accountability, which I clearly understand and support, than is proposed in the Bill. Of course the Minister needs accountability in considerable detail, but the way it is being tackled is not the best way. There are better ways and the use of financial directions and advice from the NAO and elsewhere will provide better and more succinct ways of assuring accountability without interference. We must bear in mind that this body will be under continuous time pressure to make decisions. We know that various government organisations and bodies are not good at delivering rapid decisions. It is very important for the success of this body that it is never held up waiting for decisions.
</p>

<a name="60131-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>We have also had some discussion of remuneration packages. Again, going back to the commission and other lottery bodies, every year the payroll for pay rises, remuneration packages, and so on was submitted to the Treasury. At times I had to ask a friendly Minister in this place whether he could extract the payroll from the Treasury as we needed it to submit the final accounts. The payroll was held up in the Treasury. Nevertheless, that was the process. It was not conducted by means of continual interference on the part of the DCMS but through a series of procedures that were well understood and laid down. I suggest that there is room for improvement.

<p><a name="gc_st_44"></a>
<a name="60131-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I join the noble Baroness in seeking an explanation of the provision. Everybody involved in local government knows precisely what the word &quot;interest&quot; means. Indeed, everybody across government and elsewhere knows precisely what it means. However, the word &quot;involved&quot; is an entirely different matter. Every member of the ODA acting as a planning authority will be involved. You cannot be a member of a committee of that kind taking such decisions without being involved. The term &quot;involved in&quot; comprises loose drafting; a more precise term would be desirable.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_45"></a>
<a name="60131-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We are all agreed on the objectives. The noble Baroness indicated, and the noble Lord supports, that the intention behind the subsection is to create a Chinese wall between the people in the ODA who will be drawing up applications for planning permission and those people who will be taking decisions on those applications. We want a very clear separation, for reasons which will be well understood. I hear what the noble Baroness said. She accepts the concept of the separation. The effect of our paragraph is to ensure that anyone in the ODA engaged in the plans for the development of a piece of land may not participate in the deliberations of the ODA planning committee on that subject.
</p>

<a name="60131-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>The noble Baroness reduces that by saying, &quot;has an interest&quot; in the ODA&#039;s functions. If I accept the amendment, it would not give effect to the intention of this paragraph. We seek to avoid conflicts of interest within the ODA as an organisation while fulfilling its role as a local planning authority. That is why we are so rigid about this and why this Chinese wall is erected so substantially and so high. I will resist any suggestion that its impact should be reduced, because it is in the public good.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_46"></a>
<a name="60131-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   It is unbelievable that a planning application for the major arena, the great central stadium which will be the core of the whole operation, could arrive at the planning application stage without every member of the Olympic Delivery Authority being involved in discussions on its designs, specifications and so on. If we include this question of involvement, the planning authority will have disqualified itself. I do not see how a decision on that scale can be made without the involvement of everyone in the ODA in deciding the details. Then we no longer have a planning authority to deal with, and we have a major dilemma. Perhaps I am daydreaming, but I am intensely puzzled.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_47"></a>
<a name="60131-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I hear what the noble Lord says. We do not want to arrive at that situation, which would be absurd. &quot;Interest&quot; will be clearly defined in terms of an interest in the land. With &quot;involvement&quot; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC91</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we are trying to create a clear separation between the group of people who involve themselves in plans for the development of a piece of land. We want a separate group to take the decision as the planning committee on that land and we want no linkage between the two. We want that separation for reasons of public probity. I hear the noble Lord asking, &quot;Well, doesn&#039;t involvement mean if you are anywhere near the ODA you are involved?&quot;. We seek to have a clear separation between those proposals and the personnel involved, for the reasons that I have stated.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_48"></a>
<a name="60131-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   The mechanics of this sound awfully difficult. It will be clear from the beginning when in the ODA there is some discussion about land&#151;whether that be the main arena or all sorts of other places. It will be clear that any discussions will eventually end up with the need for planning permission and the need for the ODA and its special role as a planning authority to make that determination.
</p>

<a name="60131-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>I am puzzled by my noble friend&#039;s explanation. Does he mean that right from the beginning, whenever there is any discussion about land by the ODA, it had better bear in mind that it is desirable that those people who form part of the planning role of the ODA should have nothing to do with the preliminary arrangements? In that way they will be preserved in aspic, so to speak, for the moment when the planning decision has to be made. Is that what the Minister means, and does it involve the careful evolution of the set-up from the beginning both of members and of employees&#151;they are mentioned as well&#151;to ensure that the key people who will be engaged in planning decisions have nothing whatever to do with the preliminary arrangements and negotiations?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_49"></a>
<a name="60131-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has put his finger on the point here. Much of the deliberation of the ODA will involve land. Therefore what we are really seeking is a two-tier system. At the outset some people will be designated to deal with planning, while another group on the board of the ODA will be those allowed to deliberate at large. I suppose the Minister has a reasonably clear idea of what he thinks that means, but the essence of this lies in the interpretation of the Bill and the Act it eventually will become. Under what other circumstances has this sort of interpretation been made? Is the word &quot;involvement&quot; defined anywhere else? Is there case law to which people can refer? We need to tease this out.

<a name="60131-25_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Billingham: </b>   Perhaps I may add a brief point. I chair an urban regeneration company.

I appreciate the concept, but if the ODA is supposed to be a relatively tightly constrained body in terms of its size, we may be in deep water because there will definitely be two classes of member. I am not sure that I would want to be a second-class citizen involved in the planning procedure or, indeed, a second-class citizen unable to hold discussions on the development of what ultimately will have to be a comprehensive plan.
</p>

<a name="60131-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>Under normal circumstances, such plans would involve intense discussions between the promoters of the development and the planners in order to work out what would be acceptable. We seem to be saying that such discussion cannot take place because that would constitute &quot;involvement&quot;. Perhaps we are getting lost in the exact meaning of certain words, but I should say that I am finding this point acutely difficult.

<a name="60131-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>What we envisage with the ODA is not dissimilar to the issue of urban regeneration corporations&#151;that the planning committee for the ODA is extended beyond the membership of that body. It will take membership from outside its formal structures because it will require additional expertise. The negotiations with the ODA to which noble Lords referred regarding the land developers will take place on the part of one group of officials working on behalf of the ODA. The decisions will be taken by the larger body which is separate from the work that is done and the officials acting on behalf the ODA at the lower level. That is where the Chinese wall will be erected for the public good.

<a name="60131-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I wonder whether what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is doing is finding a delicate way of getting around the memorandum of understanding and the various statements made by the Secretary of State and the Mayor so that if the budget of the games over-runs everyone will be frightfully civilised and talk about how the over-run will be paid for. That is how I read the memorandum of understanding, which has left some of us dissatisfied. That is the reason for my amendment&#151;only this morning I realised something which I hope the Minister will take away and consider, not as a party political point which might be read into my amendment.

</p>

<a name="60131-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_110"></a>However, it has become clear that one of the reasons it is right to pursue the question of a cap on the total amount raised from the Mayor&#039;s precept is because Londoners in particular signed up for texts, e-mails and all sorts of things relating to the games on the basis that they pay &#163;10 a year. I will not weary the Committee regarding whether everyone has understood that that is band D of the council tax and so forth, or even if they have understood that it might go on for 12 years rather than 10. But there is a public understanding and support for the games in London.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_111"></a>The &#163;10 a year results from the calculation of what it is necessary to achieve&#151;either the &#163;550 million or the total of &#163;625 million over a period of 10 or 12 years&#151;taking into account the tax base, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

collection rate and the fact that these will be variables. I credit the Mayor of London&#151;I try to be fair when I think he deserves credit&#151;there is some explanation of this in next year&#039;s draft budget, which has just been published. There is not enough, but there is some.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_112"></a>There are other aspects of the funding of the games that I want to explore. One is the taking forward of the debate, which we began at Second Reading. The Minister said that if you cap the funding provided by one source, that provokes everyone else to overspend. I am not sure that I fully understood that and he might want to correct it. It seems to me that it forces everyone responsible for the project to keep tight control of the costs, otherwise they would suffer a disproportionate effect.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>Parts of the funding have not had much public discussion. There will be interest on the amount raised by the precept&#151;it is &#163;57.2 million in a year. The nicely worded note I received from officials in the GLA is that the starting point for the Assembly is that the interest is public money and it would not set out to gain or lose money from interest earnings. However, I would not want to pay it over to the ODA if the DCMS slowed down its payment. They say that this will need careful thought and agreement with other funders. I bet it will.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>The &#163;10 is not the totality of what will be raised. I am sure that other items of Olympic funding will be increased in the Mayor&#039;s budget. I do not, as it happens, argue that there should be nothing above the &#163;10, because amounts may be required to ensure the legacy for Londoners. But my point, which takes me on to my serious practical point, is transparency. This is not political mischief-making. I believe that everyone agrees that there should be as much clarity as possible in the amount required and the amount levied towards the Olympics. To that end, this should be made clear on council tax bills.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_115"></a>There is good will to try to achieve that. I have heard that from every side&#151;not, as it happens, from the Government because I have not had that debate with them&#151;and I believe that legislative change is required to ensure that. Can the Minister consider whether this Bill could be the mechanism, knowing that legislation takes a long time to proceed when it begins with only a twinkle in someone&#039;s eye? There might be issues around the Long Title and this would be too late for 2006&#150;07. But the Mayor, the Assembly and the boroughs want it. If we can use this legislation to sort that out, many people would be satisfied. Most importantly it would ensure that the public&#151;those who read council tax bills&#151;have as much information as possible.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_116"></a>If possible, it would be good if this could be bottomed out before Report. I can table an amendment on Report, but it would not be as good as one that the Minister might be able to bring forward. If it would be helpful, I volunteer to have a meeting before the next stage to discuss whether this might be a sensible proposition and the implications of it. This occurred to me only this morning and I have not had a chance to talk to anybody else about this, other than <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a couple of members of staff who were close by but who were aware of the issue. Having made some possibly mischievous points early on&#151;and I know that the Minister will resist the amendment as it is tabled&#151;I think this issue might be worth pursuing.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_62"></a>
<a name="60131-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My noble friend has made a compelling case for capping the liability of Londoners. I shall add a further matter for the Minister to deal with in his reply. In the bid documentation, the Government effectively state that in the relationship with the IOC they are the ultimate guarantor of the cost of the games. However, when it comes to the relationship with the Mayor, the lottery distributors and so on, the position is otherwise. The guarantee is far from clear about exactly what the Government are really saying. It would be extremely helpful if the Minister specified what the Government are undertaking to do. We know that they have undertaken to set in place the necessary legislation and we are embarked on that. They have undertaken to put the ODA in place and have embarked on that. But what financial contribution are they making at the moment towards the games in terms of the fulfilment of the costs of the games? What does that guarantee mean? My noble friend has argued for transparency in the council tax, but we also need transparency about who is bearing the costs of the games and how the costs are going to be met.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_63"></a>
<a name="60131-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I shall first come back to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. The Bill provides that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_18"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State may give financial assistance to the Authority if he thinks that other sources of financial assistance will or may be insufficient for a purpose&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_117"></a>My amendment proposes that the word should be &quot;shall&quot; rather than &quot;may&quot; and I still believe that. I do not believe that that gives any form of open hand to anybody because the Bill refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_19"></a>&quot;other sources of financial assistance [which] will or may be insufficient for a purpose&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, relates to a cap. In another place, my party supported a cap and felt the need for one. As the noble Lord said, we need more clarity. We think that we know where the money is coming from. LOCOG has to raise &#163;750 million and there are various other sources. However, it would be nice to be a bit clearer. It is also important that Londoners welcome these games. They are much more likely to welcome them if they know what the final cost to them will be. I strongly support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which provides for a cap.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_64"></a>
<a name="60131-26_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Far be it for me to suggest that any political points have been made over a cap on council tax. I recognise that the suggestion is put forward in the benevolent way in which the noble Baroness always introduces her amendments. The reason why I resist this amendment and why I was very grateful for the intervention of my noble friend Lord Borrie on Amendment No. 12 is that, if they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

were accepted, both amendments would have the Government effectively writing an open cheque for the costs of these games.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>It is different, with the Government being the final guarantor, to say that they should dangle an open cheque book in the air. The concept of &quot;final guarantor&quot; is clear. The Olympic Games will be delivered to the satisfaction of the International Olympic Committee because that is what we have signed up to. We have a responsibility there and we know that we will fulfil our obligations. The Government have some responsibility for guaranteeing that.
<a name="gc_time_8"></a>
<a name="60131-26_time1"></a><h5>5.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60131-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>However, when it comes to the question of who pays, then of course we have some clear illustrations of how the games are to be paid for and how much is involved. The noble Baroness said that it would be helpful if Londoners knew what they were in for. First, we know what Londoners have signed up for with regard to the games. They have signed up to pay for &#163;625 million over the period. On average, that is &#163;10 a year. It is &#163;20 a year for those in band D, or 38p a week. All additional costs will obviously cause some concern, but 38p a week for the Olympic Games seems to be a pretty good deal. It is set against a background not only of a general welcome for the games from all sides of the Committee, in the House at Second Reading and also in the country, but also against the background of the lasting benefits which we recognise will come to London.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>During the bidding period, the deal was in the Memorandum of Understanding of May 2003. It was publicly known two years before London succeeded with the bid&#151;to universal joy. &quot;Universal&quot; is perhaps an excessive description but there was general joy that our bid was successful. Everyone tells me that they know exactly where they were at 12.47 pm on 6 July last year. Again, it may be an exaggeration to say &quot;everyone&quot; but certainly that was the case for a very large number of people. There was huge delight. The costs for London were set out in the deal.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>The noble Baroness is saying that, in addition to that understanding of where we stood in winning the bid, we now want, as does the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, to translate the Government from being guarantor of the games into being the underwriter of the cheques for the games. First, I know that at some stage local elections will intrude before any general election takes place. I understand the preoccupation with local events, which may relate to local financing at this stage, but, as sure as night follows day, sooner or later we are all answerable to the taxpayer. So I warn Members of the Committee not to be too cavalier in thinking that the Government have an automatic open cheque book for however worthy a project, lest, at some stage in the future, a taxpayer dares to say, &quot;How dare you spend money in this cavalier and irresponsible way&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>It is a broad charge for me to use the word &quot;irresponsible&quot; and I do not want to go that far, but I want to emphasise our responsibility. If we are to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC97"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC97</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

keep costs under control, if we are to ensure that financial management is sufficiently rigorous, and if all parties to this are to have confidence that all other parties are working to deliver the highest value at the lowest cost, then all parties must be subject to risk. The trouble with the concept of capping the council tax is that it says in relation to one party, &quot;That&#039;s the end game. Whatever these costs amount to and whatever goes on from now on, we&#039;re out of it because we know what we are paying and the rest must come from someone else&#039;s pocket&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>I do not think that that is responsible government; responsible government is that all parties to this project&#151;all contributors and all of us&#151;have a responsibility for delivering these games and for delivering them in the most excellent form we can, while keeping costs as low as we can because we are answerable to those who are obliged to meet those costs. The Government are concerned that that answerability should remain.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_125"></a>The noble Baroness presents excellent advocacy on behalf of a particular group&#151;London council tax payers&#151;and on how their responsibilities count. That would be at the expense of all of us&#151;not just if the costs were higher than anticipated but when the additional costs go beyond that factor. It would be a cost to all of us as we would have taken out of the equation one group who should be concerned about costs. Whatever it did, whatever expenditure levels were lighted upon and whatever went on, no more will come from its particular pocket. We do not think that that makes sense.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>We are prepared to meet one of the requests of the noble Baroness&#151;should not some attempt be made to keep Londoners informed of what is going on? We understand that that will be the case. Material will be sent out alongside council tax bills which will identify the progress regarding the games. I cannot be specific about that at this stage; I am responding to what I think is an entirely legitimate request and demand. We want to see that that is done. We have not worked out the details of how we will do it, but that is an entirely legitimate request. Therefore, I accept it.
</p>

<a name="60131-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>I turn to the more general issue of whether the Government are jolly well going to pay up, come what may. Therefore, we take all constraints off all other contributors at this ridiculously early stage, or, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, wants, a more modest concept that only London council tax payers should be taken out of the equation&#151;that they know what they have to pay and no more. We intend to keep rigorous control of costs. The best way is to ensure that all those involved with this venture remain responsible for the delivery of the games in the most efficient and cost-effective way.

<a name="60131-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I do not know whether the Minister can distinguish those Londoners among those sitting in this room who pay only council tax and not national tax in some form or other.

</p>

<a name="60131-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>The noble Lord says that London council tax payers, if this amendment were agreed, could say &quot;Oh, we are out of it at &#163;625 million&quot;. But we go and change our hats and find that we were not out of it. So it does not seek to exempt Londoners entirely, but only council tax payers. He also said that it was 38 pence a week. It is much more proper to think of this in terms of the amount per year. One pays very little on a weekly basis these days. But whether it is &#163;10 per year or 38 pence a week it is a really good deal. That is why I seek to cap it.


</p>

<a name="60131-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>On the serious point of council tax bills, material can be included with them. As I said, the thought came to me only about an hour before the Committee started this afternoon: if there is something to be done, the Government might see their way to agreeing to it. There are other parties involved, but this seems to me a very good legislative opportunity, one which will not come along again in a hurry unless someone knows something about forthcoming local government legislation which I do not. Perhaps that is something we can pursue outside the Committee.

</p>

<a name="60131-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>Clause 4 contains long and detailed provisions concerning the purposes for which the Olympic Delivery Authority can take action. It amounts more or less to a power of general competence&#151;which some of us have tried for years to secure for local government, though we have come a lot closer to it recently. It is clear from the various functions of the ODA, some of which we have already discussed, that there will be some cross-over with the work of other authorities, for example street lighting, planning and so on.

<a name="60131-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 51 is clear. We believe that anyone operating a railway franchise&#151;it is not stated in the amendment, but it is meant to include the people operating the Docklands Light Railway franchise and those for London bus services&#151;should not be distracted from the responsibility of providing the best possible service for visitors to London coming to enjoy the Olympics by being involved in franchising processes at the same time.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_139"></a>One franchise that has recently been let is the Great Western franchise, which is let for seven years from March and will expire in 2013. The problem is that the bidding process extends over a long period before a franchise is let. Often the best people from a franchise or tender are engaged in the protracted bidding process. The performance of the operator of franchises that have been re-let drops in the immediate two-year run-up period before the franchise is re-let. That is because the best brains in the outfit are directing their attention to the business of winning the tender or franchise for the next period.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>There were four bidders for the Great Western franchise. The bidding documents submitted to the department by the successful bidder filled 11 volumes. It is an enormous process involving consultation with a lot of people. It involves consultation between the franchisee and the person who is providing the rolling stock. The bidder must look forward quite a long way in putting together a franchise.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_141"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to create a period in the run-up to and during the games. The best brains available to the operator should be focused on providing the very best service, not distracted by the bidding process. I suggest that the re-bidding process should recommence after the games. That could be dealt with by simply extending some existing franchises and ensuring that competitions are delayed until we are well clear of the games period. London cannot afford to have competent people distracted from providing an excellent transport service.

with the noble Lord, but this is slight overkill because it is the second time in two days, so he will forgive me if I hold back from that pleasure for a moment.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_142"></a>Let me deal with Amendment No. 20. I can reassure the noble Baroness about the cardinal point of her amendment: that the ODA may be involved in a takeover of the functions of any other authority. It cannot and it will not do that. Clause 4 does not allow the ODA to override any other body&#039;s functions. Another clause specifies provisions for that and it is very limited.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_143"></a>Otherwise, except in those limited circumstances, the ODA is governed by the laws of the land and has no right to override, and nor do we conceive of it overriding, other authorities. In preparing and maintaining its Olympic transport plan, the ODA will be responsible for setting the overall strategic framework, but in practice the plan will be implemented by other authorities much better placed to deliver or enforce those arrangements on its behalf and which have the legal entitlement to do so. The ODA will not take over those functions. It will draw up a plan for others to implement under its supervision.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a>There are specific provisions in the Bill to enable the ODA to discharge functions in parallel with other authorities, including some functions relating to transport, which has largely been the issue under this amendment, but not to take over any of those functions or replace any other authority. For example, the step-in provisions in Clauses 12 and 15 would allow the ODA, with the consent of the Secretary of State, to exercise certain traffic, highway and street functions or to act as the enforcement authority for particular roads, but only where the relevant authority had already failed to exercise its functions and to comply with a direction from the Secretary of State that it should exercise its functions. So the other authority has the first responsibility to comply with the plan.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_145"></a>Clause 14 allows the ODA to make traffic regulation orders over roads forming part of the Olympic route network but, again, the consent of the Secretary of State is required. We shall consider that more closely when we reach Clause 14. The intention is to allow the ODA to implement a uniform and consistent approach to traffic regulation on the Olympic route network for a targeted and time-limited purpose only, not to allow it to take over the functions of others. The Bill does not allow the ODA to take over the functions of other bodies. To do so would require primary legislation to enable the ODA to replace another body entirely. It can be seen in the Bill that we are far from doing that. We are being very proscriptive about where the ODA can act. Even the provisions of Schedule 2 relating to transfer schemes are limited to the transfer of property, rights and liabilities. They do not extend to the transfer of functions.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_146"></a>It is essential that we are able to deliver our plans in accordance with our commitments to the IOC and we would normally look to the relevant authority to exercise the necessary functions. For example, Transport for London will procure new DLR rolling stock for the Olympics. Although the procurement will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be part-funded from the public sector funding package for the Olympics, it will be managed by TfL, not by any other body, because it is the responsible authority.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_147"></a>There is little difference between what the amendment intends to achieve and the approach that we are taking. The practical arrangements for the delivery of various plans and projects and the provisions we have already made in the Bill supplement the responsibilities of other authorities. However, if other authorities are unable to meet those requirements, then subject to the consent of the Secretary of State, the ODA will take up additional responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="60131-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_148"></a>I seek to reassure the noble Baroness that the ODA will not trample over or appropriate the rights of other bodies. It will work with them. We have got off to what we all regard as a very encouraging start in collaboration with other bodies. The Committee will recognise that it is impossible for the ODA to deliver the plan without the fullest co-operation, but we need reserve powers to ensure that we deliver.

<a name="60131-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I was just dwelling on the joys of discussing rail franchises with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, not once but twice this week. I am grateful for his amendment, which addresses an important issue. He is absolutely right that the continuity of rail franchises and services over this period is of the greatest importance. The Committee will be all too aware that rail provides an essential service to London at all times. Although the Olympic Games are to take place in August, that does not alter the fact that a very large number of our fellow citizens will require normal rail services to be maintained over the period; continuity is important.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_151"></a>The Olympic Delivery Authority is not going to be responsible for anything to do with the awarding of franchises to rail operators or for setting the terms under which those franchises are obliged to operate. I can assure the noble Lord that the companies will be operating under the franchises they have already signed up to. The major rail franchises such as the integrated Kent franchise, Thameslink and the One franchise, which has recently been renewed, will be the predominant franchises serving the area of the Olympic park. Those franchises, and others that will be renewed between now and the games, contain clauses for co-operation on the provision of Olympic services. The rail companies have already signed up to them, and the new franchises will include those explicit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provisions. The services they will be asked to provide during the period of the games will be for them to agree to in normal commercial negotiations with the Department for Transport. Work on designing the service specifications for the Olympic Games is already under way. We are all too well aware of the fact&#151;and if we were not the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, would have reminded me&#151;that you cannot plan too far ahead in the rail industry, certainly not with regard to franchises. We are taking the Olympic Games issue seriously.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_152"></a>The level of services to be provided for the two years either side of the games will remain as set out in the terms of the individual franchises. Continuity is not a matter for the ODA. The noble Lord has rightly identified that when we are considering transport arrangements for the games, we must have a keen eye to ensuring that we provide adequate transport facilities for those wanting to attend the games and to participate in them, thus making the games the success we intend them to be. By the same token, we also have obligations to many of our fellow citizens who will continue to come into London. Some of them will take great delight in using the rail services to get to London for the games, but inevitably a percentage of our population will need to travel for other purposes. We must ensure that adequate rail services are maintained throughout the period.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>Of course, the actual period of the games is restricted to a matter of weeks. The noble Lord was concerned to emphasise that the period of challenge for the railways is longer than that, and I take that fully on board. I am grateful to him for raising the issue. Transport is of great importance to the success of the games. I reassure the noble Lord&#151;as if he needed reassurance&#151;that the Olympic Delivery Authority&#039;s status is very limited in relation to franchises. The Government are ensuring that the Department for Transport, in negotiating the railway franchises that obtain over that period, will make sure that due provision is made in the franchises to meet the challenges presented by the Olympic Games.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_73"></a>
<a name="60131-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for his reply. I understand that the tenders for services are not the responsibility of the ODA. I know that his remit extends further than that. When he goes back to the Department for Transport, I hope he will underline the fact that it would not be appropriate to renew the arrangements for the Docklands Light Railway right in the middle of the Olympic Games. It would mean a period of uncertainty not just for the management but for everyone who works for it as to whether they still have a job.

<a name="60131-28_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   This is a large group of amendments and only two have been spoken to. No wonder we are confused. The Division intervening in the debate means that I am left responding to the Minister on my Amendment No. 20. That was what I wrote down. I was reassured by what the Minister said and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_75"></a>
<a name="60131-28_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee </b>   moved Amendment No. 21:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC103"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_22"></a>Page 3, line 7, after &quot;State&quot; insert &quot;and the Mayor of London&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_76"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 4(2)(b) permits the disposal of land at less than arm&#039;s-length consideration with the consent of the Secretary of State. My amendment would also require the consent of the Mayor of London. The current Mayor of London has frequently explained that in assessing the funding available for the games as a whole, one needs to take into account that the land in the Olympic park area and perhaps other land too, will be subject to a big rise in value merely by virtue of the games. That future capital gain can be taken into account. It has become virtually a given with regard to one of the funding streams&#151;perhaps a slightly dodgy one, but there it is. The ODA is a particular vehicle&#151;I was going to say pot&#151;for expenditure. This is all public funding. Although perhaps not going as far as requiring the consent of the Mayor of London, at least consultation might be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has tabled Amendment No. 31 in this group. I will not try to pre-empt his arguments about the Mayor&#039;s role in planning, but I hope that when the Minister replies, as well as dealing with the principle of the issue, he can address the term &quot;specified case&quot; in which, under the Bill, the Mayor will have the power to direct refusal. Will he tell the Committee what the procedure is for specifying the case? Currently, the Mayor of London has powers to direct refusal in respect of strategic sites, as those are defined under an order. I would be interested to know whether an order is envisaged to specify the cases under the Bill. There are some points on association rights, but I will not trespass on to ground which my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones might want to cover. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_77"></a>
<a name="60131-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I am not at all easy about the relationship in various parts of the Bill between the Mayor and the Secretary of State. When the Secretary of State is involved, she must be paramount. By definition, she is a Secretary of State. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, knows considerably more about the operation of local authorities in London than I do, but as regards Amendment No. 21, I believe that nothing would be gained by inserting &quot;the Mayor&quot; alongside the Secretary of State as a decision maker.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>I would have thought it was correct to maintain the Secretary of State, as the Bill has it, but the noble Baroness might persuade me that it is right that it should be the Mayor, because of future values and future financial interests to London. So at the moment, I would oppose her amendment. I shall leave discussion of Amendment No. 31 until we come to it.

</p>

<a name="60131-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>Again, the amendment refers to the Mayor. I am afraid that I shudder that in this particular operation the Mayor should have the authority to refuse a planning permission. That is why I tabled an amendment to page 4, line 33, to remove subsection (4)(b), where,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_23"></a>&quot;the Mayor of London may direct the Authority to refuse an application for planning permission in a specified case&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>I do not think that the provision makes sense at all in the progress that we are trying to make with the Bill. It could cause all sorts of problems that are currently unforeseeable, and it is an authority that does not need to be there&#151;indeed, it should not be there.
</p>

<a name="60131-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_159"></a>Amendment No. 32 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_24"></a> &quot;Where the Mayor of London objects to a particular application to the Olympic Delivery Authority he shall consult the relevant bodies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_160"></a>I can quite see that the Mayor could be involved, as long as he is forced to consult other relevant bodies, which would presumably include the Secretary of State, the ODA and all sorts of other people. Amendment No. 31 would remove the Mayor&#039;s outright authority to direct the ODA to refuse an application for planning. Amendment No. 32 would put some conditions under which we feel that would be acceptable. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_80"></a>
<a name="60131-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I have Amendments Nos. 77, 78 and 80 in this group. This group is all about relationships, and I have put my name to Amendment No. 32 because, like my noble friend, I saw that subsection (4)(b) in effect gives a mayoral veto. Frankly, if the situation ever develops to the point when the Mayor has to put his foot down in the way that the provision implies he might, we are heading for disaster. The successful achievement of these Games will depend above all else on people working together, co-operating and agreeing. However, in this instance, as my noble friend has said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_25"></a>&quot;the Mayor of London may direct the Authority to refuse an application&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_161"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the subsection refers to &quot;a specified case&quot;&#151;but all planning applications are very tightly and closely specified, so that presumably implies that he might do it in one instance or two instances, perhaps.
</p>

<a name="60131-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_162"></a>We do not know how the Olympic Delivery Authority is going to work. Presumably the area over which it is the planning authority will be tightly defined; so within that it may have a strategic plan which would presumably be agreed in principle&#151;and within that the authority may deal with it building by building, or it may not. It may decide to do the whole thing in a blanket way. Perhaps the Minister can tell us that the way in which the authority deals with the planning aspect is specified in greater detail than is specified in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60131-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a>It could be a master plan with detailed planning; it could be all sorts of things. We do not know at the moment. So the amendments have been tabled partly to tease that out, and particularly to tease out the relationship between the ODA and the Mayor. If we proceed by agreement, that is fine, but if the Mayor <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ever has to implement this provision, something will have broken down. We need to be very concerned about that. It may be that someone can foresee circumstances in which that might be justified, but I would like to have that spelt out, because it worries me a great deal.
</p>

<a name="60131-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>Amendments Nos. 77, 78 and 80 deal with a different aspect of the relationship&#151;the relationship between the ODA and the Greater London Authority. I was fascinated on first reading the Bill, having read Clause (4)(2)(f) to (k) on page 3 suddenly to find on page 24, Clause 34(2)(a) to (f). The wording of those two parts of the Bill is precisely the same. So here we have the ODA and the GLA with identical powers in relation to the London Olympics. I entirely accept that the ODA is concerned with the main Olympic site and the GLA will be concerned, I assume, with a whole number of sites across London. But what is not spelled out in the Bill, as far as I can see, is the relationship between the ODA and the GLA&#151;more importantly because there must be some arrangements somewhere for this, which I admit that I have not picked up. Therefore, the Minister will have the dreadful burden of explaining to someone who ought to understand something that he does not understand. Presumably there must be some arrangements for funding. The GLA may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_26"></a>&quot;arrange for the construction, improvement or adaptation of premises . . . the provision of services . . . undertake works of any description . . . acquire land or other property&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>and so on. My noble friend picked up the point that the GLA may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_27"></a>&quot;take action in respect of places outside London&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>That is quite a leap in responsibilities for the GLA. But presumably it is in relation only to the Olympics.
</p>

<a name="60131-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_167"></a>The amendments that I have tabled try to put in a relationship between the GLA and the ODA, when they are working together, as one hopes that inevitably they will, to provide all the facilities that are required in London for the Olympics&#151;much greater than the core site with which the ODA is primarily concerned. Because I have not been able to tease out that working relationship from what I have read, I thought it worth tabling the amendments simply to probe the Minister and give him the opportunity to explain exactly what the relationships are and how they will work. One accepts that someone in the end has to provide the overall plan and the drive to achieve it, but if there is not a great amount of co-operation and agreement, we are frankly heading for disaster. It was to avoid that that I thought we should have a bit more explanation, which I am sure the Minister looks forward to giving.


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_81"></a>
<a name="60131-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful for the way in which noble Lords have spoken to their amendments. The thought crossed my mind at one moment that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, could slug it out between the two of them about the power of the Mayor, and I could sit here as a beneficiary of the resulting conflict. It is rare for governments to be able to take such an inactive stance, and therefore I am obliged to be fairly clear on where we stand regarding the amendments. It will be a <br>&nbsp;<br>

bit of, &quot;On one hand and on the other&quot;, but I will reject both cases, so at least in conflict the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will have the consolation that they are both opposed by the Minister.
</p>

<a name="60131-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_168"></a>On Amendment No. 21, I emphasise that one of the key selling points in London&#039;s bid was the regenerative effect that it would have on the east end of London. The Olympic Delivery Authority will be responsible for acquiring land and carrying out much of the critical regeneration work. After the games the ODA will no longer be required, and its land will have to be transferred to other bodies. It is likely that local authorities and other public sector organisations may take over much of the ODA&#039;s land. In those cases, it may be desirable for the ODA to dispose of the land at a value below the usual commercial rates. The Bill sets out that the ODA can dispose of land in that way only with the consent of the Secretary of State. It will be recognised that we need a safeguard in these circumstances, as we are dealing with valuable land and valuable assets. It will be disposed of by a body that itself is due to disappear. Therefore, it is essential that the public purse has some security over a changing situation, so we do insist on the consent of the Secretary of State.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_82"></a>
<a name="60131-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I rise because the Minister has raised the issue of the final disposal of the site. On the total funding involved, if there is a possibility that the cost is greater than the original estimate, the value at which the sites are disposed of might be very influential on whether there is an overall deficit. Although it might be highly desirable to dispose of the sites at less than their obvious realisable value, if there is a financial deficit to make up the opposite might apply. Will the Minister say a bit more about that? We want to be open about this right from the start.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_83"></a>
<a name="60131-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The noble Lord is right&#151;these are difficult issues because we cannot foresee with accuracy the situation that will obtain in 2012 after the Olympic Games. We do not know whether we are aiming for a surplus, as the noble Lord will recognise. LOCOG is setting itself the objective of a surplus. If there were a surplus, and we were in a benign state, it might well be that public authorities would be the beneficiary. After all, public authorities have been supporting this through their contributions. The noble Baroness was only too emphatic about that earlier on regarding council tax and other public contributions. Public authorities would have some expectation that the land might be disposed of at below market rate; but we might be at the other end of the spectrum.
</p>

<a name="60131-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_169"></a>As the noble Lord indicated, we might have a substantial deficit that could be reduced by the sale of the land on market principles. We cannot foresee the accuracy of that, but we can say that there is a public interest in such an issue and it is important that these decisions are taken by a body that is responsible. All I am emphasising at this stage is that the ODA will be subject to the Secretary of State&#039;s scrutiny during this critical period.

</p>

<a name="60131-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_170"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has a brighter wheeze than this, namely, that the Mayor of London should also be involved in giving consent alongside the Secretary of State for any such proposal. I understand her point that through the council tax of course London will have contributed. But only one person is responsible to Parliament for the actions of the ODA&#151;the Secretary of State. That is a direct and clear line of responsibility. I hear what the noble Baroness said about the interests of Londoners and of the Mayor, which are important, but the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, indicated that he had reservations about how significant that was in relation to crucial decisions post the games. We think that responsibility rests with the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="gc_st_85"></a>
<a name="60131-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I understand that and I was responding partly to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, which was directed more to the immediate post-games situation. I accept entirely what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said about the overall position during the intervening period and I am merely emphasising that the same considerations apply, namely that the actual responsibility to Parliament for public money lies with the Secretary of State&#151;remember that there are several sources of public money for development that the ODA spends and will spend to some considerable extent.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_171"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is all too well aware, the Mayor will have oversight of the authority&#039;s activities, including disposal of land, because he will be on the Olympic board, which oversees the ODA. So he will be fully appraised of what the ODA is doing, and under the arrangement the Mayor will be aware of, and able to comment on, the ODA&#039;s strategy for the disposal of land, because he will be in a critical position when the ODA makes its report to the Olympic board. So the Mayor has plenty of opportunities and sufficient involvement in the oversight of the ODA, but it is important&#151;and I was grateful for the point that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith made&#151;that not only in the build-up to the games but in the disposal of assets afterwards there are clear lines of responsibility. As the Bill is drafted, they lie properly with the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_172"></a>Whereas Amendment No. 21 would have increased the Mayor&#039;s powers, the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, would place further restrictions on the Mayor&#039;s role. I emphasise that under the Greater London Authority Act 1999, the Mayor has responsibility for strategic planning across London and ensuring that the strategic planning interests of London as a whole are taken into account by decision makers. In order to carry out that responsibility, the Mayor must have a means of intervening in the decision-making process on issues of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC108"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC108</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

strategic importance. The Mayor has the right to direct a local planning authority to refuse a specific application for planning permission if he considers that the proposal would undermine the spatial development strategy or otherwise would be contrary to good strategic planning in London.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_173"></a>When the noble Baroness asked what the specified cases were, that is what I meant. That is what is set out in Clause 5. It states that certain provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act do not apply where the ODA takes over functions that the planning authorities normally exercise. But perhaps I may stress by way of reassurance to the noble Baroness that we have reserved for the Mayor his right under that legislation to refuse applications in specified cases&#151;and those specified cases relate to the special spatial development strategy; cases which are otherwise contrary to good strategic planning in London. I want to reassure her that the Mayor retains his position in that regard. I shall give way to the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_86"></a>
<a name="60131-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I am sorry to intervene again but I am becoming increasingly puzzled. Given all the work the Mayor has done to find the site and attract the Olympics to London, while the Minister may have a more vivid imagination than I, I cannot conceive of a planning application for the Olympic site that is outwith the spatial development plan for London. If it were, the Mayor would not have been able to win the contract from the Olympic association in the first place.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_87"></a>
<a name="60131-30_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   Perhaps I may add a point to the question here. If the specified case is one where the application is contrary to the spatial development strategy, the London Plan, does the plan remain a material consideration in taking the planning decision? I am sorry; perhaps I may put that a little more clearly. What will be the status of the London Plan, which normally would be at least a material consideration in the decision on a particular application? As the Minister puts it, the London Plan appears to assume a greater status because it falls within Clause 5(4)(b). I should have thought that it had that status anyway. I do not argue against it having the status, rather I seek to understand whether Clause 5(4)(b) goes further than that.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_88"></a>
<a name="60131-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I want to make it clear that within the framework of the Bill, the Mayor retains that power. In other words, when the ODA develops its plans it will have to square that particular interest. It may be that disagreements arise. We have already discussed what will happen to reconcile such disagreements. With the consent of the Secretary of State, the ODA may be able to override such a position, but we hope that that does not obtain. But the absolutely clear expectation is that the ODA would not automatically take responsibility as the planning authority; far from it. It will negotiate with the existing planning authorities and it is exactly in this area where the Mayor has a proper responsibility.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_174"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, argues that the Mayor ought not to be involved. I want to emphasise that these powers of the Mayor exist in a proper, well-defined, restricted area of planning which is already protected. We are not enhancing the Mayor&#039;s powers here, if that is the anxiety of the noble Lord, we are merely defining them. On that basis I hope that he will feel able not to press Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 relating to the issue.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has taken me down a different track. He too is anxious about the position of the Mayor. At Second Reading concerns were expressed from more than one quarter about the scope of the power. The Bill makes it clear that the Olympic specific power is just that. It allows the Greater London Authority to do things only for the purposes of complying with an obligation under the host city contract, signed by the Mayor on behalf of the authority, in preparing for or managing the games.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_176"></a>In carrying out the power, the GLA is required to have regard to the legacy of the games. The power is time-limited and will be switched off once the games are over. Hence I was able to respond to the point made earlier by the noble Lord about the responsibilities of the Secretary of State and the ODA regarding the disposal of land after the games have finished.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>The power in Clause 34 is necessary for two main reasons. First, the GLA will be one of the funders of the ODA. The noble Baroness was very clear on that point when we discussed the council tax earlier today. The ODA will carry out work on venues across the UK, in addition to those in London. The GLA therefore needs to be able to fund such activity. I recognise that the GLA will be only a partial funder of these projects, but that is the position.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>Secondly, the GLA is directly liable to the International Olympic Committee for the delivery of the games in accordance with the successful London bid&#151;and the Mayor is a signatory to that. However, he cannot be a signatory to the host city contract to ensure delivery of the games, and backed by the GLA, unless he has some responsibility for those sites and venues situated outside London. It is of course highly unlikely that the venues outside London will not be ready for the games, but if adequate preparations are not made and the Mayor and the GLA become anxious about delivery, the Bill gives the authority a locus to act to ensure their completion. It needs such a locus because it has signed the host city contract. Those are the limited areas in which the GLA, through the Mayor, has power to act.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>These requirements must be fulfilled and I do not think it appropriate to look for ways to curb or hamper the use of the new Olympic power on a day-to-day basis. Therefore the problem with the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, while important and probing a difficult area in order to seek clarification, is that that is what they would achieve. The GLA is already carrying out a large amount of work on the Olympic project. We have provided the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC110"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC110</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Olympic specific power to build on the powers already being used by the GLA to make it clear that the authority has a specified role in relation to the delivery of the games. We need to provide that power to minimise the risk of a legal challenge that might derail the whole Olympic project.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>For that reason, I cannot accept Amendment No. 77. It would require the GLA to secure the agreement of the ODA before being able to conduct any activity under these powers. The GLA bears responsibilities for the host city contract. Moreover, the noble Lord will recognise that we could have a strange situation in which the ODA would be able to dictate to the Greater London Authority, but the authority partially funds the ODA. That would raise some interesting relationship issues.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_181"></a>I am also not able to accept Amendment No. 78, stipulating that all GLA Olympic activity should be carried out in co-operation with the ODA and local authorities. However, I expect that most of the activity will be carried out in a cooperative way; I cannot see how these obligations can be fulfilled without that level of cooperation.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 80, in some cases where major activity is planned it will be appropriate for the GLA to consult the other Olympic stakeholders on the use of its Olympic power. The Olympic board provides the appropriate forum for those discussions, just as they are already taking place on the work the LDA is doing to acquire land for the Olympic park&#151;and of course the Mayor sits on that board.

<a name="gc_time_11"></a>
<a name="60131-30_time0"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60131-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>There will be many other cases of day-to-day work that might involve GLA staff using the Olympic power, but it would not be proportionate to consult all other stakeholders. So, I cannot agree that the broad requirement to consult, which is imposed by Amendment No. 80, should be written into the Bill, although I accept the thinking behind the amendment that co-operation is essential for the fulfilment of the GLA and the Mayor&#039;s purposes.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_184"></a>Amendment No. 79 returns to a subject that was discussed extensively in the other place. The Government do not believe that Clause 34 can or should be amended to prevent the GLA using its narrow specific power to act outside London. We have put a great deal of thought into this matter as it is not a light issue for the GLA to exercise authority outside its boundaries. We of course listened carefully to representations made in forceful and clear terms in the other place. We have considered a number of different ways to limit the GLA&#039;s powers outside London.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_185"></a>We have concluded that the Bill makes it clear that the GLA can only act outside London for a purpose connected with preparing for or managing the London Olympics or complying with the host city contract. That gives an effective restriction to the GLA&#039;s powers and provides a safeguard that an action outside London will only ever be in places connected with a London Olympics. Therefore, I hope that I have allayed those concerns that what might be vouchsafed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC111"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC111</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to the Mayor and to the GLA by this legislation would be a very extensive power outside London. That is not so.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_186"></a>Further safeguards are provided through the scrutiny of the GLA by the London Assembly and committees of Parliament. Such scrutiny ensures that the GLA will be accountable for any actions it undertakes in relation to the Olympics. I am sure that the Mayor and, indeed, all members of the GLA are all too well aware of the degree of scrutiny that will follow their actions on what is, after all, the greatest project that one can envisage the city undertaking in the foreseeable future.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_187"></a>Finally, Clause 35 provides that the powers conferred on the GLA can be repealed by the Secretary of State, following consultation by the Mayor, by order using the negative resolution procedure. That provision ensures that the powers of the GLA can be terminated when no longer needed. We emphasise that they are Olympic specific, and, therefore, that termination proposal, which is only a requirement of an instrument of this House, would then be tabled.
</p>

<a name="60131-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_188"></a>I hope I have offered the Committee some reassurance that we have considered very carefully the powers given to the GLA. We recognise that certain powers are essential for it to meet the requirements which the Mayor has signed up to on behalf of London as the host city, but we believe that the powers, as drafted, are necessary to ensure delivery of the games&#151;but only to ensure the successful delivery of the games. I hope therefore that Amendment No. 73 can also be withdrawn.

<a name="60131-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. This is a complex area and he has unquestionably given us a great deal of reassurance. On the veto, almost from what he is saying&#151;I hope that the Mayor is not listening&#151;he is formally recognising a power which exists, but Heaven help us if he ever has to implement it. It seems to me that it is a power that will remain just that: it is a formal recognition of a position, which has to be maintained. That I understand. Equally, I am completely clear in my mind that if the Mayor ever found himself in a position of needing to exercise it, something would have failed&#151;and failed very seriously.
</p>

<a name="60131-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_189"></a>For the rest, I am very grateful for the explanation that we have had of the relationship between the ODA and the GLA and particularly the reasons for going outside London. The Minister has clarified my question about the funding stream. Clearly, if I understood the noble Lord correctly, he is envisaging that some of the London funding will be spent directly by the GLA on Olympic facilities rather than be remitted to the ODA and then go back again. That may well be a sensible way of doing things but there will have to be some fairly sophisticated accounting within the GLA if that is the case. I do not know whether I am prompting another whole line of inquiry but it will be very important as regards defining the <br>&nbsp;<br>

cost of the games that the actual expenditure is very precisely identifiable and identified and cannot get confused with any other GLA expenditure.

<p><a name="gc_st_90"></a>
<a name="60131-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I wondered whether the Minister would respond to that. It is not my understanding of the situation although there will be GLA expenditure on Olympics-related matters and no doubt expenditure on the part of the police and the fire authorities. However, that is not the subject of this debate.

<a name="60131-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_190"></a>I sat back to let the noble Lord intervene as my Amendment No. 21 is the first in this rather disparate group of amendments so it is the only one that is withdrawable, if I can put it that way.

It does not wholly answers my concerns but I am glad that the Minister understood the point I made&#151;that the Secretary of State and the Mayor should be involved in these matters. If I may say so, the Minister made a very good case on my behalf when he described the contribution of London council tax payers. However, I do not think that I can tempt him further on that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_194"></a>Clause 4(3) provides that the ODA shall have regard to certain matters when it is exercising its functions under that clause. My Amendment No. 23 asks why it does not have to have regard to those matters when it is exercising other functions. Is the answer that it cannot exercise any function unless subsection (3) allows it to? That might be the answer. Subsequent clauses dealing with, for instance, the transport plan, include important issues such as having regard to achieving sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60131-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_195"></a>I am not sure whether that is the answer, as Clause 23(6)(a) states that the ODA shall,

<a name="60131-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_196"></a>As there is a similar reference elsewhere confined to a section rather than extending to the whole Act, it seems to me that if we are to ensure that the ODA has regard to legacy issues and to achieving sustainable development in everything that it does, we need to apply the relevant measure in Clause 4 to the whole of the Act.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_197"></a>Amendment No. 24 continues a debate which we first started in this context in 1997 when regional development agencies were established. I have discovered that it reflects an amendment which my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer will move in connection with NERC. It escapes me what that acronym stands for, but Members of the Committee will recognise the reference to the Bill going through the House. This Bill states that these matters will be taken into account &quot;wherever relevant&quot;. These issues are always relevant, so the amendment seeks to delete those words. Unless they are deleted, it is open to the ODA to say, &quot;Well, we have thought about these and they are not relevant&quot;. The limitation under by the Bill in saying &quot;wherever relevant&quot; gives permission to the ODA, in effect, not to have regard to these matters. I think that there is not even a presumption that they are relevant, which the ODA might overturn.

that the ODA can play its part fully in delivering the most sustainable games ever, which the Mayor of London and government departments promised.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>A sustainable games is critical to achieving a truly sustainable legacy for present and future generations. In that regard&#151;this underlies the amendments&#151;they want a stronger duty placed on the Olympic Delivery Authority regarding sustainable development to contribute to the protection, enhancement and management of biodiversity for present and future generations. That would emphasise the importance of the authority&#039;s role both in the run-up to 2012 and, particularly, in its role in creating a sustainable legacy thereafter.
</p>

<a name="60131-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_202"></a>I will quote back to the Minister the remarks that he made towards the end of his wind-up speech at Second Reading. They were addressed to both the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and to me. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_33"></a>&quot;the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, dwelt on the sustainable aspect of the Games, particularly on the sustainable environment in relation to the Lea Valley. That is a very important point. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, reminded us, the Mayor cannot call these the green Games if what we leave behind is very different from greenness and there is no environmental sustainability. That is an important dimension; we will need to reassure ourselves that it is in place, and we will have the opportunity to explore it in Committee&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11/1/06; col.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_204"></a>There is little evidence&#151;perhaps there should not be in the Bill&#151;about the design and delivery of the park and the games. That is a particular pre-occupation in the context of the natural environment for those interested in that aspect of the preparations. We will obviously be moving into the design and build stage. The fear is that if there are funding problems, there may be short cuts on necessary structures. There is therefore a concern to see greater specificity on green issues. There is a series of ways, which can be shared, on how that greenness could be communicated. If funds become tight, and if such specificities are not in the Bill, such add-ons will run the risk of being ignored. I say that because in the nature of things there is no particular clarity about who will take over the responsibility of the legacy&#151;about which we are all very proud and which has played some part in our getting the games&#151;once the ODA ceases to exist. We need to know more about who is likely to take that role. The chance of the legacy going well will be greater if it is well planned now. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.

<a name="60131-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful for the discussion on these amendments. I understand that the noble Baroness, in her Amendments Nos. 23 and 24, seeks to strengthen the duties of the ODA to have regard to legacy and to contribute to sustainable development. I meant what I said in reply to both representations at Second Reading and the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. We take these issues seriously. These duties are of paramount importance to the success of the games and they were an important element in London&#039;s successful bid, where <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC115"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column GC115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sustainability was emphasised. We have included this in the Bill in a prominent position, but I do not believe that the amendments help us in strengthening the provision.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>In drafting the Bill, we have been clear that in carrying out its general functions, the ODA must, wherever relevant, have regard to the legacy of the games, defined as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_34"></a>&quot;the desirability of maximising the benefits to be derived after the London Olympics from things done in preparation for them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60131-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>That definition was drawn broadly so as to include the economic and social legacy of the games as well as the sporting legacy. We wanted to ensure that due regard was paid by the ODA to the situation inherited on the conclusion of the games. We required the ODA to contribute, wherever relevant, to achieving sustainable development through the exercise of all its general functions.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_207"></a>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 highlight two aspects of these provisions. The first is that these requirements apply to all the general functions listed in Clause 4. Amendment No. 23 implies that this list could be broadened out by referring instead to all the functions set out in the Act. However, Clause 4 is where we have provided the broadest possible list of all the functions the ODA will need to carry out&#151;all the headings under which other work will be done. While there may be more specific duties and requirements in other clauses, they are all subsumed under the general functions set out in Clause 4, particularly in subsection (1). This is a deliberate drafting decision, and I think it is the right one. The problem with the amendment is that it would apply across the board to all the functions of the ODA.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_208"></a>Amendment No. 24 suggests that the phrase &quot;wherever relevant&quot; be deleted. The effect of such a change would be to require the ODA to have regard to legacy and to contribute to sustainable development in absolutely everything it does. We certainly want the ODA to have regard to sustainable development and the post-games legacy on a whole range of issues, but to suggest that everything done by the authority should have regard to those is to take things a little too far. Some duties are bound to be somewhat more mundane, and it is difficult to see how they relate directly to legacy; I suggest duties such as street cleaning and so forth. These are important areas so far as concerns the success of the games themselves, but they are limited in terms of a sustainable legacy. It does not make sense to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. While we share with the noble Baroness the objectives of having regard to the legacy, given the breadth of Clause 4(1), the amendment would create an unrealistic aim.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_209"></a>We are pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, has been able to join us in our deliberations. He has arrived quite late, but we understand why the proceedings in the Chamber would have held some attraction for him. That has been the case for all Members of the Committee, and certainly for me when I was under some pressure here.

</p>

<a name="60131-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_210"></a>I reiterate that we share with the noble Lord his objectives regarding the environmental benefits of the games, and we seek to maximise those as far as possible. We want the games to be the greenest ever. Indeed, we emphasised this element in our original bid. However, the purpose of the requirement in Clause 4(3)(a) is to ensure that the ODA, in exercising its functions, has regard to maximising the benefits to be derived from all the things it does in preparation for the games. This relates not only to environmental benefits, but also to the wider social and economic benefits, which also form an important part of the legacy. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out, she was anxious that the effect of Amendment No. 25 would be to limit those aims. Instead of concerning ourselves with the broad benefits of the legacy, we would narrow them down to those concerning the environment. I am sure that the noble Lord recognises that while we share with him the importance of emphasising the protection of the environment, it should not be the exclusive aim of the legacy.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>Amendment No. 27 would require the ODA to have regard, in carrying out its functions, to the functions of local authorities and other authorities. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out that we have already had a fairly substantial discussion on these points, and I hope that I have satisfied her with the broad argument. In that light, I hope that she will be happy to withdraw this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>On Amendment No. 29, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, for raising the issue. We are keen to develop the greenest games ever, and that was integral to the commitments that we made in the candidature file for the International Olympic Committee and the document <i>Towards a One Planet Olympics</i>, which was prepared by London 2012 alongside the WWF and BioRegional. Those commitments included ensuring that the games will be low-carbon, zero waste, conserve biodiversity and promote environmental awareness. The ODA, LOCOG, and the main stakeholders&#151;the Government and the Mayor&#151;will not want to lose sight of what we said, and they will ensure that we can deliver on the commitments in the candidature file, which is an explicit description of our intention to observe the demands of the environmental legacy.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>Clause 4(3)(a) ensures that the ODA will have regard to maximise the benefits from all the preparations that it makes. That will include the environmental benefits, such as conserving biodiversity, in the way in which the noble Lord suggested when he argued for the amendments. On the issue that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, raised with regard to the legacy beyond the ODA&#039;s specific functions, the Olympic board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the legacy of these games will be delivered. It will want to ensure that the benefits of the legacy are delivered as widely as possible, both in London and beyond. In addition, local authorities and RDAs will be working hard to maximise the benefits of the games beyond London and across the United Kingdom. The Government and the Olympic board will support that effort. We cannot commit <br>&nbsp;<br>

ourselves to an exclusive concern with the environmental issues, but I reassure him that it is a prominent concern in terms of the overall legacy of the games. The social, economic and environmental legacy was an essential component of the successful bid.

<a name="60131-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   I will take advantage of the kindness of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in responding on the amendments that I moved before she winds up on the group as a whole. I am very familiar with the reluctance of government draftsmen and Ministers to include long lists. I tell the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury, that I have taken his name in vain prior to his arrival in the room. He could not have timed his arrival better.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_214"></a>The draftsmen and Ministers are not enthusiastic about lists, because once you have started lists people can put down amendments adding to them. In the Bill that created the Greater London Authority, I warned Mr Raynsford, the then Minister in charge of the Bill, that in speaking about the Mayor having regard to the care of archives, I had both a short speech and a long speech. I was going to make the short speech first, but if he showed no enthusiasm at all for my suggestions, I would make the long speech in winding up. I did make the long speech, because he had rejected my idea for the list curtailment reason, but I am delighted to say that, perhaps in a modest way as a result of the very long speech that I made in Committee in the Commons, the archives were added to the list in the House of Lords, and the story ended happily. I assure the Minister that I am not going to do the same thing today.
</p>

<a name="60131-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>I took the point when the noble Baroness made it about &quot;environmental&quot; being exclusive; I was not intending it to be exclusive. It might be described as not so much a probing amendment as an exhortatory one, and it certainly managed to raise the subject and has enabled us to discuss it. The green-ness is in the bid; the Government&#039;s justification for part of the Bill is to fulfil their contract to the Olympic authorities, and we will be coming on to aspects of that later in the Bill. The Minister made perfectly admirable reference to detail and to the things to which the Government are committed in the bid. It is helpful to have those on the record again beyond the references that we had to them at Second Reading.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_216"></a>At the end of the day, the Government can satisfy the Olympic authorities that they have delivered what they said they would in the bid without necessarily securing the optimal environmental return that might have been achieved in other circumstances.

<a name="60131-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   When the Minister began, I thought that he overlooked the fact that Clause 4(3) does not require the ODA always to apply the matters that have been referred to, but only to &quot;have regard&quot; to them. He later used that terminology but not, I am sorry to say, persuasively enough to prevent me returning to this on Report and possibly confining my amendment to subsection (3)(b).
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_217"></a>The example that he gave was not persuasive in respect of Amendment No. 23, which extends the context from Clause 4 to the whole of the Act. To say that when the ODA undertakes street cleaning it does not need to have regard to sustainable development made me write down, &quot;products and methods&quot;. I should have thought that any authority should have regard to sustainability issues by choosing methods of street cleaning and using products that do not damage the environment. I take issue on that, too, and I thought that I should warn him now, because I might mention it next time.

<a name="60131-33_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Afghanistan</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60131-33_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>The Afghan and UK Governments are signing a 10-year development partnership arrangement at an international conference on Afghanistan in London on 31 January and 1 February 2006. At the conference, the Afghan Government will launch the Afghanistan compact, a framework for the international community&#039;s engagement in Afghanistan over the next five years, and its interim national development strategy.

</p>

<a name="60131-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The purpose of the development partnership arrangement is to reaffirm the UK Government&#039;s long-term commitment to the Afghan Government&#039;s development plans, and set out the nature of this arrangement. Afghanistan has achieved good progress since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 under a government committed to reducing poverty. But as a new democracy emerging from conflict and constrained by weak capacity, low revenue and a dominant narcotics industry, Afghanistan risks regressing without long-term commitment from the international community. We hope that a 10-year DPA will help to build the Afghan Government&#039;s confidence and further strengthen their commitment to reducing poverty.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The DPA covers only UK commitments on international development assistance provided through the Department for International Development (DfID). The DPA also transparently sets out Afghan government commitments needed for DfID to continue with substantial long-term development support. These include commitments on reducing poverty and the millennium development goals; respecting human rights and other relevant international obligations; and strengthening financial management and accountability, which reduces the risk of funds being misused through weak administration or corruption. The DPA specifies what each government will commit to, and what happens if the Afghan Government are in breach of a commitment. These commitments should help to strengthen the Afghan Government&#039;s planning and budgeting through more effective delivery and use of aid, resulting in greater impact on poverty. Through the DPA, the UK Government are outlining an indicative financial commitment of &#163;330 million from DfID for 2006&#150;09, as part of a larger UK spend in Afghanistan, expected at around &#163;500 million in total over three years. DfID is committing to give the Afghan Government aid figures on a three-year rolling basis in future years to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60131-33_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Common Agricultural Policy</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="60131-33_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  On 19 January 2005 the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) announced that payments under the new CAP single payment scheme (SPS) were expected to commence in February 2006, well within the EU regulatory window of 1 December 2005 to 30 June 2006. Over the past year, staff at the RPA have worked exceedingly hard to ensure that this expectation was turned into a reality.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>At the EFRA Select Committee hearing on 11 January, I made clear that payments would begin, in line with the RPA&#039;s forecast, before the end of February and that an announcement would be made by the end of this month on whether they would be full or partial payments. Having considered the latest progress reports on the processing of farmers&#039; claims I am pleased to confirm today that the RPA will now proceed to make full payments. The contingency system to make partial payments will not, therefore, be invoked.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The RPA will now proceed to definitively establish entitlements on 14 February, details of which will be communicated to individual farmers within two weeks of that date. This will allow for the trading of entitlements to commence in preparation for the 2006 scheme.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>Where 2005 SPS applications have been fully validated, payments will start before the end of February, with the bulk being made in March. In the minority of cases where queries remain unresolved, the validation process will continue beyond March, but farmers may be assured that the RPA will make every effort to complete the task in the shortest possible time frame.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>I hope that this Statement will provide some reassurance to the farming industry about the progress of the scheme. I want to acknowledge the co-operation and patience of everyone who has made a claim.

</p>

<a name="60131-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>At its meeting of 24 January 2006, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council took note of a presentation from the current Austrian and future Finnish presidencies on a work programme for ECOFIN for 2006.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>The Austrian presidency concluded that, subject to confirmation by the Czech Republic, Poland and Cyprus, political agreement could be reached on an extension of the arrangements for reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services until 2010. The presidency subsequently announced on 30 January that the Czech Republic and Cyprus had agreed the proposal. Discussions are ongoing between the presidency and Poland.

<a name="60131-33_head3"></a><h3 align=center>Higher Education: Student Finance in England</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="60131-33_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The department is today publishing the report of the end-to-end review of the arrangements for the delivery of financial support to higher education students, and its collection from borrowers, in England. The start of the review was announced on 7 June. Copies of the report are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The department welcomes the report. Its initial response is set out below.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The principles underpinning the report are that student finance delivery arrangements must meet demand from customers for clear information about their entitlement to support, faster decisions once applications have been made, timely payments upon starting a course, and accurate repayments when these come to be made. They must also meet taxpayers&#039; expectations that value for money is being achieved. While much has been achieved in recent years, the report makes clear that significant further improvements in performance are required. The department agrees with this analysis and with the challenging new objectives and targets the report recommends.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The report makes 44 specific recommendations. The department accepts these in principle, subject to the further detailed work on costs and practicalities which some will require. In particular, the department supports the report&#039;s vision of a future in which a large majority of students will apply for financial support online, and the changes which will be needed to achieve this. It welcomes the report&#039;s identification of changes which will increase repayments, and it will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS12"></a>

respond actively to the report&#039;s call for DfES leadership to ensure accessible, accurate and consistent information, advice and guidance at national and local level.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The report also sets out options for a new delivery structure. In the case of assessments and payment, delivery will need to reflect the move to online applications. It will also need to improve the current variability of customer service, and to achieve efficiencies. For these reasons, the department is attracted to the option of a centrally provided service for which a single organisation would be responsible, working with others to ensure that we meet the needs of individuals requiring local assistance. However, this needs to be discussed with local authority representatives given the impact on their staff.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The report offers three options for the national organisation: an NDPB, a private sector contractor chosen through procurement, and a new relationship with the Student Loans Company. In considering these the department will focus not only on delivery capability and value for money, but also on which option is most likely to produce the significant cultural shift that the report rightly calls for if the service is to become truly customer-focused. The department will consider the options in the report for the collections process.
</p>

<a name="60131-33_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The department will now discuss the report with key stakeholders and will make a detailed response in the spring.

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="60131-34_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  The judicial appointments annual report, covering the period 1 April 2004 to 30 September 2005, is published today, 31 January. This year the report continues to focus on developments and achievements within the judicial appointments process and the work undertaken ahead of the new Judicial Appointments Commission. We have placed the full statistical tables, which give the results of the various competitions held within the period of the report and their supporting narrative, on the departmental website at www.dca.gov.uk. The report also shows that: 549 appointments were made during 2004&#150;05 from around 3,500 applications; appointments, including lay appointments, of minority ethnic candidates accounted for 12 per cent of those made over the 18-month period; women accounted for 37 per cent of appointments; since 1   April 2005, women have made up 46 per cent and   minority ethnic groups 17 per cent of all appointments. The report also outlines improvements made to the judicial appointments process, including the introduction of competence-based selection for all judicial appointments and the pilots of assessment centre-based recruitment for recorder and employment tribunal appointments.

<a name="60131-34_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>I am pleased to announce to Parliament my decision on the future of the Met Office forecast production network.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The Met Office has a responsibility to provide value for money to the taxpayer, to deliver the UK&#039;s public weather service in the most efficient and effective manner possible and to provide the best possible service to all its customers. A thorough review and analysis of the Met Office&#039;s production network has been carried out. This included an extensive consultation exercise, which took place between July    and November 2005, involving customers, parliamentarians, trade unions, staff and other interested parties.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>I am grateful to the many individuals and groups who took part in this consultation. It generated a great deal of useful feedback. Indeed, based on a number of the constructive comments received, the Met Office was able to produce an additional option for consultation, as a result of which I agreed an extension to the consultation period.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>Having carefully weighed the various issues and arguments, I have decided that the best solution for the future of the Met Office and its customers is to centralise more forecast production at the Met Office HQ in Exeter, while retaining production capability in Aberdeen and a reduced regional network focusing primarily on service delivery. Forecast advisers within the regional network will take a proactive role with customers to identify regional weather impacts, and deliver the Met Office&#039;s OpenRoad, marine and public weather services.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>I am confident that this decision will deliver significant benefits to the Met Office, the UK taxpayer and all the Met Office&#039;s customers.

<a name="60131-34_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  The Pingat Jasa Malaysia (PJM) is a commemorative medal which the Government of Malaysia would like to award to eligible British citizens, for their service in Malaya or Malaysia between 31 August 1957 and 12 August 1966.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals, the official committee which advises Her Majesty the Queen on matters of honours policy, has recommended that an exception to two of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS14"></a>

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column WS14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the long-established rules governing the accepting and wearing of foreign (including Commonwealth) awards be made, to enable the Malaysian Government to present the PJM. Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to approve this recommendation.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>This exception to the rules means that all of the many thousands of eligible former members of the Armed Forces/veterans, and others, may receive the PJM. This will be in addition to the British General Service Medal, with appropriate Malaya/Borneo clasp, that many veterans will have been eligible to receive for their service in Malaya/Borneo.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>Permission to wear the PJM will not, however, formally be given. It is longstanding government policy that non-British medals will not be approved for events or service: that took place more than five years before initial consideration, or in connection with events that took place in the distant past (e.g. commemorative medals); and if the recipient has received a British award for the same service.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>However, Her Majesty&#039;s Government welcome, and believe it is important to recognise, the generous gesture by the King and Government of Malaysia, and their wish to acknowledge the service given by veterans and others in the years immediately after Malaysian independence. The exception recommended reflects this and our strong and important relationship with Malaysia.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>The Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals reviewed the five-year and double medalling rules, and considered that, while there were sound reasons why they should be retained, there will be occasions when specific circumstances require exceptions to the rules to be recommended. When such exceptions are contemplated, the committee will consider each request on a case-by-case basis, taking into account any special circumstances at the time. The fact that a similar request has been approved in the past will not mean that permission will be granted in future cases.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>Applications for the PJM, and its subsequent distribution will essentially be a matter for the Malaysian authorities, in collaboration with the relevant British government departments. Large numbers may be involved. It will take some time for the applications to be processed and for the medal to be distributed. The Malaysian High Commission and the relevant British government agencies will work together to determine eligible applicants. Veterans&#039; organisations and service and regimental associations will also be involved.

The figures will be available on the department&#039;s and the IAEA&#039;s websites.
</p>

<a name="60131-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>The figures show that stocks of unirradiated plutonium in the UK totalled 102.7 tonnes at the end of 2004. Changes from the corresponding figures for 2003 are a consequence of continuing reprocessing operations (e.g. as reflected in the increased quantity of &quot;unirradiated separated plutonium in product stores at reprocessing plants&quot;). The decrease in the civil depleted, natural and low-enriched uranium figures reflects the change in requirements for these materials at fuel fabrication plants and reactors.

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60131w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  As part of its ongoing bilateral dialogue with the Government of Pakistan, and in the context of the    forthcoming deployment of UK troops to Afghanistan, the Government regularly discuss with the Government of Pakistan the security situation in the federally administered tribal areas. This issue will remain high on the UK/Pakistan bilateral agenda, including on military channels. Travel to the federally administered tribal areas in north Pakistan is difficult for UK officials and therefore infrequent. However, members of staff from the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi visit Balochistan regularly, most recently in January 2006.

<a name="60131w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan is already helping to sustain the alliance by demonstrating NATO&#039;s relevance to changed post-Cold War threats, its ability to undertake out-of-area deployments and its role in complex civilian-military peace support missions. As such, ISAF is also a spur to the wider modernisation and transformation of the alliance.

British troops deployed under the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) play an important role in creating the conditions in which reconstruction can take place.

<p><a name="wa_st_8"></a>
<a name="60131w01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The United Kingdom already benefits from long-established and effective real-time co-operation between civil and military air traffic controllers. These joint and integrated arrangements are kept under review by the statutory Joint Air Navigation Services Council, chaired by the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s Director of Airspace Policy and comprising senior members of the Ministry of Defence and National Air Traffic Services.
</p>

<a name="60131w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The United Kingdom is a strong supporter of the EC&#039;s single European sky initiative, which aims to secure more efficient airspace management and promotes the flexible use of airspace between civil and military users. The UK model for joint and integrated service provision is unique within Europe and is seen by many as a benchmark, particularly as regards the real-time co-ordination between civil and military air traffic controllers.

<a name="60131w07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   We are in the process of assessing various options submitted to us by forces and authorities in December 2005. This will include likely set-up costs. It would be inappropriate to comment on this issue until the assessment has been completed. There are likely to be initial set-up and transitional costs, although these will be outweighed by the longer-term benefits to policing and the community.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_65"></a>How they reconcile their defence industrial strategy with their decision to remove most of the business of the Defence Aircraft Repair Agency from St Athan immediately after investing &#163;104 million in a superhangar to enable that business to be undertaken there.  [HL3484]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_63"></a>
<a name="60131w07_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  The decision to build the Red Dragon superhangar in south Wales was taken on the basis of the best available information, and was a welcome development for the area. A subsequent fundamental review of defence logistics looked across the whole logistics process. It concluded that there were clear benefits from consolidating fast jet support at RAF bases and rotary wing support at DARA Fleetlands in order to best serve the needs of defence. These new arrangements are fully in line with the principles of the defence industrial strategy, which emphasise the importance of improving the effectiveness of through-life capability management and support for our fast jet fleets. This move will help sustain this critical capability in the most cost-effective manner.
</p>

<a name="60131w07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"></a>The Ministry of Defence expects to recover its investment in the Red Dragon project by the proposed drawdown date of April 2007. The MoD expects to achieve this through the major rationalisation of the St   Athan site and the DARA manpower, overheads and efficiency savings which follow the move into the Red Dragon superhangar.

<a name="60131w07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The former Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s fares review, published in June 2003, concluded that the regulation of saver returns, a leisure fare introduced by British Rail in the 1980s, had caused overcrowding on many long-distance trains and had constrained the introduction of more innovative, customer-focused fares structures. It proposed further work on saver regulation with a view to replacing it in due course with a more appropriate regime. Work continues but no decision on the future of saver regulation has yet been made.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_16"></a>issuing codes of practice for admissions and admission appeals, giving clear guidance on acceptable practices to admission authorities and schools;


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_17"></a>giving local authorities and schools the right to object to the schools adjudicator about admission arrangements they think are unfair or discriminatory, and giving parents the right to object to some admission arrangements, including some forms of selection;

These are: physical education or sport; the performing arts; visual arts; modern foreign languages; and design and technology and information technology.

<p><a name="wa_st_67"></a>
<a name="60131w07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   Pupil banding allows oversubscribed schools to admit pupils from across the full ability range of all their applicants, after applying the other oversubscription criteria.

</p>

<a name="60131w07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>At present, the admission authority for a school must publish, consult on and seek approval of a statutory proposal to introduce banding arrangements. The Government intend to remove the requirement for maintained schools, including foundation schools with a foundation (trust), to go through this process. Instead, they will be able to propose to use banding in their oversubscription criteria as part of their statutory annual consultation on proposed admission arrangements.
