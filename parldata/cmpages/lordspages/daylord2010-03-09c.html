This has provided more than 240,000 manufacturing reviews with companies and nearly 1,600 consultancy-supported projects. The businesses that are assisted by the Manufacturing Advisory Service in the West Midlands have reported total benefits of £105 million, and additional sales turnover of £156 million.</p>

I should point out that the West Midlands Manufacturing Advisory Service has indeed been a great success in the Midlands for manufacturing since its inception in 2002. Will my noble friend assure this House that a Labour Government will continue to support manufacturing in the West Midlands and the West Midlands Manufacturing Advisory Service, together with Advantage West Midlands, which is doing such a fine job for our region?</p>

I thank my noble friend for that question. I assure him that the West Midlands Manufacturing Advisory Service is a good example of the very practical and effective support that is available to manufacturers through manufacturing advisory services across the country. In the past financial year, it has helped more than 8,000 manufacturers to achieve an added value of £120 million. As we know, support to manufacturers is vital if the UK is to rebalance the economy. We have directly invested a further £8 million in the Manufacturing Advisory Service, and nearly £1 million of vital investment for the West Midlands as part of the Strategic Investment Fund, to carry on the good work and to support opportunities in low-carbon and advanced manufacturing where the UK has capability and there is the potential for significant growth.</p>

Does he accept that his Government have singularly failed to resolve blockages in trade finance that underpins UK global trade, which is so vital to facilitate British exports?</p>

If we were to proceed in the way in which Her Majesty's Opposition would like us to go, we would be scrapping the regional development agency against the wishes of business and the chamber of commerce, which seems to me surprising. In attempts to ensure that we do boost the economy, it is noticeable that, when things such as the vehicle scrappage scheme have been introduced, they have been opposed by the Opposition, even though they have provided a huge boost to the car industry. Industry figures have shown again and again the benefits of that scheme.</p>

In looking at the overall position of manufacturing advisory services throughout the country, is the Minister prepared to share with the House the evaluation which, presumably, the Government have done as to exactly what the benefit is overall, as we approach this period when cuts in services are inevitable?</p>

We have seen the figures for the improvements in profitability, to which I referred in my opening remarks. Since the programme started in 2002, more than 12,000 projects with manufacturing companies have resulted in added value to the companies of more than £700 million. We believe that to be a very worthwhile investment.</p>

We are not just the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world. In the West Midlands and in other areas, we have the most advanced industries: sub-sea platforms, aerospace, the creative industries-one could list them for ages, but if one reads the papers, one would think there is no manufacturing industry left in this country. So can we please try to get that message over through these bodies?</p>

So we will be giving an extension to the Accelerate programme for automotive companies-an additional £5 million of support through the advisory service. There is also a highly successful £11 million advantage transition bridge fund, and support for the regions' community development finance institutions, offering loans of up to £50,000 for small and medium enterprises.

The risk of carbon leakage is reviewed regularly in close consultation with UK business, and my department has commissioned further research on this risk, which we hope will be completed in the summer.</p>

We are part of the EU and it is entirely appropriate that we should be part of the EU emissions trading system, which is consistent with the targets for carbon reduction that the EU has agreed. On the substantive question, from the research that has been undertaken, there is very little evidence that companies are at risk of competitive disadvantage because of the emissions scheme. In phase 3 of the EU ETS, a number of decisions have been made which could mitigate it if such evidence arose.</p>

Perhaps one of the ways to solve this problem is to have a more level playing field globally. What are the Commission and the Government doing in terms of working with other Administrations, such as the states on the west coast of America and the Canadian provinces, all of which have their own schemes, to ensure that they tie up globally and co-operate so that there is not the carbon leakage that we could otherwise have?</p>

I think that he is really suggesting the creation of a global carbon market, and he is absolutely right to do so. Not only would that have a positive impact on emission reductions, it would mean a level playing field, and some of the issues of concern that are always being raised would then not arise. We had hoped that we would see the necessary steps at Copenhagen, but there has been a setback. However, I can assure the noble Lord that we will work very hard as a country and as part of the EU in encouraging the development of carbon markets worldwide.</p>

It has an impact on electricity and other prices, but the Government believe it is much better that we reduce emissions as quickly as possible. The work of the noble Lord, Lord Stern, shows that it is more cost-effective to take action now. There is no long-term future in high-carbon industry, and the fact is that the Emissions Trading Scheme is a market-based approach that incentivises companies to reduce their emissions.

Is not the rule now simply an obstacle to serious historical scholarship? Does it not run counter to the Government's otherwise admirable policy on the freedom of information?</p>

It will result in increased transparency and accountability in government by allowing the public automatically to access and scrutinise large numbers of important historical documents a good deal earlier. My noble friend's question relates really to the Radcliffe rules and the issue of ministerial and civil servant memoirs. These have been the subject of two recent reviews and we do not believe that a full independent review is necessary. However, the Cabinet Office will revisit the Radcliffe rules in light of the comments in the 30-year rule review.</p>

Would government Ministers be prepared to consider even a 100-year rule for these? What justification is there for an indefinite application of the exemption? Are the Government afraid that information from 1910 might jeopardise our relationship with Germany? I can assure him that on these Benches a full disclosure of the economic stewardship of David Lloyd George would be very welcome.</p>

We have removed a number of exemptions and some exemptions that were absolute are now qualified. The absolute exemptions that still remain cover information provided by what is called a Section 23 body, such as the security agencies, the Special Forces and the serious organised crime agencies. In relation to national security, there is no time limit but a qualified exemption so that information can be got out if that is in the public interest. Information whose disclosure would prejudice our international relations is, again, qualified, while information that would be prejudicial to the prevention and detection of crime and the administration of justice-the category subject to the 100-year rule-is also qualified.</p>

This approach should not be used either to allow underperformers to continue, or to freeze out partners in the independent and third sector, but where existing providers fail to improve services, or in the procurement of new service models, all providers should have a fair and equal opportunity to bid.</p>

Is she aware that in the east of England, 14 primary care trusts have been prevented from offering community services from PCTs, and put them out to tender? Is she further aware that this policy contradicts the 2005 manifesto, which sought to increase diversity of providers? That is on page 63, if she wants the reference. Can she confirm that the Department of Health lawyers have said that this policy is ultra vires under UK procurement law and is therefore illegal?</p>

I am sure we can agree that, where the NHS is providing excellent, high quality and cost-effective services, we would not wish to see tendering for the sake of tendering. I am aware that tendering for services in the east of England has been halted temporarily to ensure that those bodies that are discussing what to do with their community services have the most up-to-date guidance-that was published on 5 February-and that they are taking note of the fairness that we wish to have in the system.

It seems to us that the preferred provider policy sets out the grounds on which NHS services can be challenged, so that staff know where they stand and so that they will have the opportunity to improve services before those services are put out to tender. There is no expectation or intention either to freeze out private or third sector providers, or to diminish their contribution to NHS services. The decisions of the co-operation and competition panel are based on our policy. I will go back and investigate whether there is a problem here, but I think the noble Baroness is mistaken.</p>

Of course, we are proud of our National Health Service, but it is only fair to say that the NHS has depended on contributions of providers from the independent and third sectors since its inception in 1948. At the moment, we have a thriving third sector in the provision of NHS services. I might mention Macmillan Cancer Support, Marie Curie Cancer Care and Diabetes UK, as well as smaller groups who are providing innovative care, such as Turning Point and Whizz-Kidz. We also have a growing independent sector providing excellent services within our NHS framework.</p>

<p><a name="10030971000105"></a>In fact, operators of a category A facility will be required to submit applications by April 2011. No guidance has yet been published to indicate what information these operators must provide or how soon they will know the designation of their category. When will they have these answers?</p>

<a name="100309-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="10030971000066"></a>It is still unclear exactly which sites will be category A, where a refusal of a permit would result in operations being forced to cease. Closure is a complex process, and closing such a facility prematurely and suddenly could pose greater risk to life, health and the environment than allowing time for proper engineering and other procedures. This would clearly run counter to the principal aims of the mining waste directive of protecting the environment and human health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10030971000067"></a>Ceasing operations could have a severe economic impact on the industry by disrupting the production and supply of minerals essential to the UK economy.</p>

<a name="100309-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10030971000068"></a>There are already very effective regulations and controls in place in this country. Interestingly, Germany and Sweden have decided that their existing controls are sufficient to comply with the new EU directive. Many believe that the UK could have taken this view. The UK minerals industry has an exemplary safety record and there have been no significant incidents since the 1964 Aberfan disaster.</p>

<a name="100309-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10030971000069"></a>The industry welcomes efforts to protect environmental and public health. Introducing a formal arbitration or mediation process between operators and the local authority emergency planning services would prevent unnecessary refusals and the resultant impact on the supply of essential minerals. This process could also help to ensure that permits were in place by May 2012, as required by the mining waste directive. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain when people will know which category they are in and what information they need to provide.</p>

These regulations are on an area where there is a very strong obligation-a must-for the authorities to refuse a permit for ongoing mining where there is even a question that there might not be sufficient information to make a plan, even though that might not be in the control of the company concerned. Given the timescale, it is important that this is looked at again, and I too would very much appreciate the Minister's response.</p>

I had in process a draft of a letter to respond to all noble Lords who participated in the Committee; but when it became clear that the noble Baroness was going to raise this issue in the House on the regulations-an unusual initiative, but one which is perfectly proper-I looked again at the letter and felt that we needed more work on it in an area in which all noble Lords recognise is both very important and very difficult.</p>

Essentially, I propose that the Government of the day report to Parliament on their success or otherwise in hitting the interim target of halving child poverty in 2010-11. That report should be prepared when figures are available. Before going into the reasons why this would be a valuable exercise, I will deal with the changes to the amendment since the Committee stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10030971000075"></a>The Minister's arguments against our original amendment were based, as far as I can assess, entirely on the issue of timing. According to him, the household below average income data would not have been available for the original three-month deadline. It would not capture the impact of recent measures or that of Budget measures to come for this year. The Minister argued that the electoral cycle would create practical publication problems. He argued that annual reports on progress towards targets are anyway required from the Secretary of State to Parliament. However, this is not the same as a report on the specific target of halving child poverty in 2010. I will summarise the underlying arguments for why such a report would be valuable. I will aim to move quickly over ground already covered.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_143"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100309-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10030971000076"></a>Odd things have been happening in the battle against child poverty since 2004, when the improvements that we had seen ground to a halt and, on some measures, deteriorated. We debated at some length in Committee what the reasons for that might be. My overwhelming sense is that we are looking at a period in which real earnings growth was very disappointing, but we do not need to rerun those discussions in depth. However, we need a report at the appropriate time to put the various economic factors into context for this reason. The post-war periods in which child poverty has fallen have been rather rare-five or six years in the last 30, for instance. They are the exception rather than the rule. Some other major questions need answering. There was a reduction in relative poverty among children in workless households, but not in working households. How much has been caused by income transfers, rather than by tackling the causes of poverty? This is an area of particular interest to us, since our approach to the problem will be oriented towards tackling the causes of child poverty.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10030971000077"></a>This amendment would also give the Government the chance to accept measurements of performance against targets during its last 13 years in power. The Government have been accused of using diversionary tactics in this Bill by encouraging voters not to look at this performance and switching attention to the far horizon of 2020. They have also been accused of creating a poisoned pill for future Governments-they can ignore their own likely failure to achieve modest targets in benign conditions while lambasting the Government of the day for failing to achieve more difficult targets in a more difficult economy. Stephen Timms in another place acknowledged both the tougher nature of the 2020 targets and the more difficult economic environment that we face. I emphasise that I am not making these accusations; I am suggesting that the Government may find it convenient to tackle them head on by accepting responsibility for their own targets. I beg to move.</p>

The unspoken question is not only the complexion of the Government who will have to pick up the baton on this Bill but whether that new Government will want to be confronted in the very near future with this amendment if it should become part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10030971000079"></a>It is little wonder that the Minister delicately and hypothetically asked the noble Lord, Lord Freud, about this in Grand Committee. Quite understandably, the noble Lord, Lord Freud, refused to be pinned down. He has now tabled a similar amendment on Report. However, the three-month reporting period, which was in the Committee amendment, has gone and a more realistic timetable has been set out-at least I hope so; I have not examined in great detail the new amendment, which was tabled only yesterday, but I think that it has that timetable in it.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10030971000080"></a>Having this amendment in the Bill would mean that a new Government, of whatever complexion, would have to consider almost straightaway what has been  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_144"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>done in the past to try to reduce child poverty, what is being done right now and what should be done in the future given the economic circumstances of the country. The assessment of progress will be invaluable, particularly to the new Child Poverty Commission as it starts its work. There is little doubt that the 2010 target does not have a chance of being met-apart from anything else, because of the recession. We all know that unemployment is likely to rise, with the loss of many jobs in the public sector, and that, although the Government are trying to give lone parents help in getting to work when their child is ever younger, there are often not the part-time jobs or, yet, enough suitable wrap-around childcare available throughout the country.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10030971000081"></a>Any report on progress towards meeting the 2010 target is not likely to be very optimistic but it should be able to point the way to how the 2020 target of "eradicating" child poverty might be met. For this reason, we support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="10030971000082"></a><b><a name="100309-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10030971000225"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I, too, support this amendment because I want to see my Government or an alternative Government after the general election continuing to commit to the eradication of child poverty. That is what this amendment seeks to do. That commitment should be made whether this is the right format or whether my noble friend might suggest that there is some other way of approaching it.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10030971000083"></a>We all know why it is difficult, particularly since 2004. Most of the tests of child poverty are relative; most of the children who are poor are on benefits; benefits increase by prices; and the wealth of the country increases by wages. The only way in which you can reduce that gap over time and ensure that more children are above the poverty line is to see benefits rise not only in line with earnings but faster than earnings. However, that then brings the dilemma over how attractive work is for those who are unskilled, in large families and low paid. That is part of the juggling act that any member of a Government has always to seek to respond to.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10030971000084"></a>Any way of lifting children on benefits above the poverty line has implications for the effectiveness of encouraging people into the labour market if they are very poorly paid. The only way in which you can address that is to increase tax credits to make their pay worth more, whereupon you raise the standard of average median earnings and more children come below the line. It is almost like a spiral. It is very difficult to resolve, as I think we all understand. That is why I was pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Freud, did not attribute it to any negligence of government but rather to a reflection-I am afraid-of the economic prosperity that we have enjoyed, in which we have seen wages soar ahead of cost/price-linked benefits.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10030971000085"></a>Even if this amendment cannot address and resolve that problem-it is one of those where you are continually keeping these three considerations juggled in the air-it would at least focus the mind of any Government, any civil servant and the commission on seeking to drive forward to meet that target. In so far as the noble Lord's amendment would help this Government, or any Government, to progress that, I hope that my noble friend will support it.</p>

<a name="10030971000086"></a><b><a name="100309-0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10030971000226"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, I speak to Amendment 1A, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Freud. The aim of the Bill is to drive the long-term sustainable eradication of child poverty, ensuring that tackling child poverty is a priority for everyone. We will continue to be held to account on the 2010 target, but this Bill is focused on ensuring that we do not lose sight of the long-term goal.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10030971000087"></a>The Bill increases the accountability of the Government with regard to their child poverty goal. It sets out a rigorous process of reporting and accountability that will hold the Government to account. It also creates the Child Poverty Commission, which will provide valuable expertise and advice to feed into the reports and the strategies on progress. The Bill does not weaken our commitment to tackling child poverty; it strengthens it.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10030971000088"></a>The amendment would require the Secretary of State to publish a report as soon as is reasonably practicable after the end of the 2010 target year and no later than 30 June 2012, setting out an assessment of progress towards the 2010 child poverty target as defined in public service agreement 9-fewer than 1.7 million children in qualifying households living below the 60 per cent median income threshold.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10030971000089"></a>As I explained in Committee, Clause 8 requires the Secretary of State to publish a strategy setting out the measures that will be taken to meet the four child poverty targets in Clauses 2 to 5. To ensure that the Secretary of State reports on the progress in tackling child poverty, Clause 13 requires him to produce and lay before Parliament an annual progress report setting out the progress that has been made in tackling child poverty. Subsection (1)(a) of Clause 13 requires that the annual reports report progress against each of the targets.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10030971000090"></a>The first strategy must be laid within 12 months of Royal Assent and the first report must be laid within a year of the anniversary of the strategy being published. This will report on progress against our relative poverty target, from which it will be clear what the progress is on the 2010 target. In addition to this, the HBAI data on the relative low income target are published every year, so progress can be tracked in that way.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10030971000091"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Freud, said, this is not the time to revisit all the arguments and analysis about what has happened since 2004 and the reasons why there are challenges in meeting the child poverty targets. Government action and investment over the past decade have stopped and reversed the upward trend in child poverty. Whereas the number of children in poverty more than doubled between 1979 and 1997, 500,000 children have been lifted out of child poverty since 1998-9. There were 2.9 million children living in relative poverty in 2007-08. Absolute poverty has been halved. We expect the measures introduced in and since Budget 2007 to lift around a further 550,000 children out of poverty. Although this is still some way from the 2010 target, it represents real and significant progress since 1997.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10030971000092"></a>This amendment does not add any value. The Government are happy to be held to account for our record on child poverty. Indeed, we cannot possibly avoid being held to account for it. The 2010 target is tough, as it should be, and we need to bear in mind

All the other amendments in the group are consequential on the first one. Amendment 2 would add the after housing costs as a fifth target in Clause 1 to the measure of child poverty. The relative low income in a household would be calculated by capturing both the before and after housing costs. This would give a much truer picture throughout the country of the disposable income of a qualifying family.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10030971000095"></a>As I have said before, both these sets of figures are collected by the households below average income surveys. The amendment does not mean that extra statistics will have to be collected. Our contention is that using the before housing costs figure masks a lot of child poverty; a much more accurate picture is achieved by using the after housing costs figure. This is illustrated by the number of children recorded as living in poverty: 2.9 million in the before housing costs figure, rising to 4 million in the after housing costs figure.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10030971000096"></a>We had a long debate in Committee encompassing housing itself, how poor housing can impact on child poverty, the problem of overcrowding and what is being done to provide more affordable homes. These are all important matters which affect child poverty. Although each is worthy of debate, I do not intend to go down any of those roads today. I will concentrate on why it is important that after housing costs should be added to the targets in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10030971000097"></a>In his reply to my similar amendment in Committee, the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030971000123"></a>"the Government recognise the importance of housing costs to families' disposable incomes and the impact of those costs on their overall living standards".</ul>
<p><a name="10030971000098"></a>He went on to say that,</p>

It is one thing if it is in an urban area, well away from the south-east, where there is quite a lot of social housing. It is a variation if it is in an outer suburb of London but with good transport links. In both cases, rents-including private sector rents-may be pretty reasonable. It is another matter if the house is in a rural area where there is little if any social housing, such as areas of rural Herefordshire where all that is available is private sector rented housing. Housing is likely to take up a far larger proportion of a family's disposable income. If it is in London, where rents are sky-high, that is another matter altogether. It is no coincidence that London is where child poverty is worst of all. The <I>London Evening Standard</I> has been doing a good job of highlighting child poverty in its reports on the dispossessed. It quotes Fergus Drake of Save the Children UK, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="10030971000117"></a>"We are outraged that one in five children in London still live in severe poverty, often going without hot meals, the clothes they need or without proper heating at home. We are losing hundreds of thousands of children to poverty, which is killing their childhoods".</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10030971000099"></a>We often try not to use London as an example of where our policy should be specially considered, because we who live here sometimes bend over backwards not to sound London-centric. However, on this occasion we should not duck the issue. Because of the huge variations in the cost of housing throughout the country, both before housing costs and after housing costs must be included in the targets, otherwise we are in danger of missing those families whose poverty is not addressed in the before housing cost figures.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10030971000100"></a>I repeat what I said at Second Reading: housing benefit is not discounted in the before housing cost figures, so a relatively large family may look as though it has a sizeable disposable income. Of course, it has nothing of the sort, because the housing benefit chunk of that income is its rent. The Minister countered that argument by saying that a householder uses his or her total income, not just housing benefit, to pay housing costs, and might choose to live in a nice house and a nice area. However, that is unrealistic. Most people who receive housing benefit use that sum to pay the rent because that is all they have for rent.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10030971000101"></a>In Grand Committee, the Minister was keen to quote the recent report of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, entitled <I>Poverty and Inequality in the UK</I><I>:</I><I> 2009</I>. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="10030971000118"></a>"When deciding whether or not to measure living standards on an AHC basis as well as BHC, the main issues are whether people face genuine choices over their housing and whether housing cost differentials accurately reflect differences in housing quality. It is often argued that some individuals do not have much choice over the type or cost of housing services that they consume, whereas they have considerably more choice over the purchase of other consumption goods (such as food or clothing). For these individuals, it could be argued that an AHC measure is a more suitable measure of their well-being".</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10030971000102"></a>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which uses the AHC measure, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10030971000119"></a>"Lack of choice over housing costs and quality is particularly important in the social rented sector, where individuals tend to have little choice over their housing and where rents have often been set with little reference to housing quality or the prevailing market rents".</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10030971000103"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission also endorses AHC, pointing out that using material deprivation is an indirect method of taking into account the various costs that qualifying households face. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10030971000120"></a>"We are not convinced that the combined low income and material deprivation target will provide a full solution to this issue. Although we strongly support the inclusion of the material deprivation target, we do not agree that it suitably addresses the issue of differing housing costs in the way that using an AHC measure would".</p>

<p><a name="10030971000107"></a>Crucially, it goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10030971000121"></a>"Material deprivation is not a suitable means of attributing the cause of the deprivation (for example, whether it is due to housing costs, living in a rural area, a member of the family having a disability etc.) and it will therefore be difficult to implement the correct policy response".</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10030971000104"></a>The arguments are not rocket science. Nearly all commentators recognise that the further down the income scale one looks, the more important are the after housing costs, because housing tends to make up a greater proportion of income at the bottom of the income scale. If one looks at incomes over the whole spectrum, before housing costs may be more reasonable, but the Bill is concerned solely with child poverty and therefore with families at the lower end of the income scale.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10030978000001"></a>In many low-income areas, such as the most rural areas of the country, there is very little social housing and many families simply do not have a choice whether or not to live in a nice house or an expensive area. They have to live in the private rented sector, perhaps to be within reach of schools, jobs and transport.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10030978000002"></a>As for the argument that many families in qualifying households live in cheaper housing but near good transport links, particularly around London, I found some comments made by Doreen Kenny from the Greater London Authority to be illuminating. Giving evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee in another place, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10030978000026"></a>"People are reluctant to travel for the length of time it takes to commute into where the part-time jobs are, which is mainly in inner London. Coupled with that is the low pay for most part-time jobs. Half the part-time jobs in London pay less than £7 an hour, so it is just not worth working part-time unless they are very local and it fits in with the school and childcare responsibilities, or they are very well paid and flexible."</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10030978000003"></a>If the before housing targets were thought to give the truest picture of poverty throughout the country, why do all the think tanks, academic institutions and pressure groups that I have come across prefer to use the after housing costs for those at the lower end of the income scale? Why, come to that, will the Government continue to collect the after housing costs if they are not to be relevant to this Bill? To what will they be relevant? After all, we are not saying that the Government should remove the before housing costs from the Bill, just that they should add the after housing costs target too. It will not cost them a penny more because they are collected in the household surveys anyway.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10030978000004"></a>I hope that the Minister and I can continue our understanding not to mention international comparisons. I still believe that there is an unanswerable case for the after housing costs target to be in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I understand the intent, which I think is decent, but I would like to explain my reservations, which we discussed in Committee. The first is to make a distinction between information and target. As the noble Baroness rightly said, the information is already there in the major document which will steer any commission working through the statistics. For a house with below average income, on the left-hand page are the statistics on before housing, on the right-hand page should be the statistics on after housing income. The statistics are publicly available, and will inform the considerations of the commission to the extent which is appropriate. They are there as information, and nothing that the noble Baroness has said today will take that away.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10030978000006"></a>Why should the information therefore not go one step further and be a target? My problem here is, as the noble Baroness confesses, that it is London-centric. House prices and rents are much higher in London, but the offset, particularly if you are looking for a part-time job, is infinitely cheaper transport costs. For example, housing costs in East Anglia are between a half to two-thirds of those of London, but transport costs can be three times higher. People can spend £50 or £70 a week catching trains between Yarmouth and Norwich every day, even for part-time jobs. If we are going to have households' after housing costs included, then in all fairness, you have to include transport costs because rents are high where transport costs are low and rents are low where transport costs are high. There is almost a perfect connection between the two.</p>

<a name="100309-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10030978000007"></a>If we take account, as a target, of households' after housing costs, we should simultaneously abate that by the other real expenditure which offsets the housing costs. In rural areas which do not have the Tube-glory be, that would be wonderful-or sometimes even buses but perhaps the occasional train, people are more likely to have to rely on an old banger, with all the costs of insurance, so those transport costs would need to be taken into account. If my noble friend was willing to go down the route suggested by the noble Baroness to have this as a target as opposed to having information, I hope that, in all fairness, transport costs would be included. Once you start doing that, we are on a slippery slope to widening the reach of yet another target in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10030978000009"></a>Joseph Rowntree and his son, Seebohm Rowntree, pioneered the task of measuring poverty more than 100 years ago, and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has had to grapple for years with the question of which measurement-before housing costs or after housing costs-is the most sensible. We concluded that the after housing costs measure was better. Let me explain why.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_150"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10030978000010"></a>Suppose that a tenant's income is a little below the poverty line of 60 per cent median income and their rent rises. Their housing benefit-or local housing allowance, as it is now to be-will go up to cover the extra rent. Their before housing costs total income will now include the extra housing benefit, which can take them above the poverty line. Apparently, they will have escaped poverty, but in reality, all the extra income goes on the extra rent. The tenant has seen no material change in their situation, but the before housing costs measure creates a false impression of the tenant's relative poverty. The after housing costs measure represents the true picture.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10030978000011"></a>To reinforce the case made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, it is also necessary to go for the after housing costs measure if we are to make accurate comparisons of poverty in different parts of the UK. A low-income tenant in a privately rented flat in London might receive housing benefit, or local housing allowance, of £200 a week. A low-income council tenant in, say, Hull, might receive housing benefit of £50 a week. Before housing costs, it appears that the London tenant is £150 richer than the Hull tenant, but the reality is that, after paying rent of £200 in London and £50 in Hull, the two tenants are just as poor as each other. It is the after housing costs measure which reveals the true position. The before housing costs measure understates poverty in London and other high-cost areas.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10030978000012"></a>I know that there has been discussion of the value of using the before housing costs measure as the main measure because it is compatible with European practice and makes international comparisons easier. Most European social security systems contribute towards housing costs on the basis of fixed allowances that do not march directly in line with rents. The difference arises because of the UK's extraordinary variation in rent levels between different areas-between, yes, London and, say, Hull-and between different kinds of landlords, councils, housing associations and private landlords. Those wide variations do not occur to anything like the same degree in most other European countries, and it is those variations which require us to have our special housing benefit-local housing allowance-system, which is highly sensitive to actual rent levels. That means that in the UK, we need the extra measurement of poverty that comes only with the use of the after housing costs measure. I support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10030978000014"></a>I support any amendment that considers housing and at the same time tries to tackle child poverty. In my previous constituency, there were many non-traditional houses. They were built in good faith. Some of them were multi-storey dwellings, some were maisonettes. Often, there was severe dampness, so income had to go to not only transport but heating, and there was terrible fuel poverty in some of those houses. I recall going to a constituent's house where there was a built-in wardrobe. When the lady took out the clothing that was hung up in the wardrobe it was green with mould. In the west of Scotland they used to pray for a good summer. For a good summer in the west of Scotland you need a lot of prayers, believe me.</p>

<p><a name="10030978000024"></a>Talking about child poverty, there was a slogan under Prime Minister Blair's Government, "education, education, education". I always used to say, "housing, housing, housing", because how can a young child who is bright at school go home and do their homework with dampness coming down the walls? Rents, not only in London or in the rural areas, but in the larger cities throughout the United Kingdom and indeed the rural areas of the highlands, can be very expensive. The poorer a person is the more they will spend on rent-or a mortgage, for that matter. It is not easy for a family to up sticks and move because often they are in a house that is difficult to live in because it is the best that the local authority can offer.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10030978000025"></a>All credit must go to the housing associations throughout the country, particularly the ones I know. In houses where there was damp, such as I have described, the housing associations took over and, with the help of central Government, who must get credit as well, they were able to put central heating into houses which were non-traditional and give people decent, warm homes. It makes a significant difference for the whole family.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10030978000015"></a>I know what the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is saying-do we make this another target, another thing on the wish list? What is the point of having a child poverty Bill if we do not tackle poverty? If we are going to tackle poverty we must make sure that we look at the home that people are living in. That is why we have municipal housing. The reason local authorities started municipal housing all those years ago was because people were living in terrible slums. It had a severe effect on them. Even though they had their job in the mills or the factories, the fact that they were going back to homes that were overcrowded and were not getting decent sunlight and where the children all had to sleep in the same bed led to bad health. If we do not tackle the housing situation in terms of looking at the struggle people have to keep a roof over their heads there is no point in having a child poverty Bill.</p>

First, people might think this is a technical issue and the noble Lord, Lord Best, has demonstrated that it is indeed a very important technical issue, because when you look at the way in which the difference between before and after housing costs affects individual households, it has a dramatic effect. I am not making a claim for this amendment on the basis of technicalities.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10030978000017"></a>I have studied this Bill. At the beginning, I thought that it was not very useful in terms of making any difference. After listening to the very good debates in Committee, I changed my mind. This amendment, however, is a litmus test for me for a number of reasons. As my noble friend said in introducing her amendment, it captures the levels of poverty that we are going to have to address to be successful by 2020 at the lower levels of household income. I am convinced about that.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10030978000018"></a>If the Government are only going to use before housing costs that is a change; to date the pressure group community has always been very comfortable with using an informal target-both before and after

Dropping the after housing costs measurement is a significant change. Indeed, I think the researchers in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation or wherever would say that that was so. There is a real risk of the Government being accused of running away from the awkward, inconvenient truth that a million extra people will be caught by the after housing costs amendment. For my money, it is important that the Government should be brave and say, "Yes, we are prepared to take the bad news with the good news", and take both halves of this important equation on board in their targets. I am now absolutely persuaded that these targets are right, and I now want this Bill because it is useful, but it will be worth less as a Bill if we lose the after housing costs. I genuinely feel that very strongly.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10030978000019"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, always makes very incisive contributions to these debates, and I value her judgment. This is strange coming from me-I said this in Committee-because I come from south-east Scotland, which is even more rural than the noble Baroness's home patch, but I think that London will be a core part of the debate over the next 10 years. You cannot get away from that. I live in a village with no public transport of any kind; the nearest public transport is seven miles away. Transport is important in its own way and has to be addressed, but it does not come into the same category as the use or disuse-the desuetude, really-of the whole after housing costs argument, which has been such an important part of the way in which this whole subject has been considered over the past 15 to 20 years, to my certain knowledge.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10030978000020"></a>This is not a technical amendment. This is an important amendment that will be an earnest of the Government's good faith in tackling these technical problems properly in the 10 years to come.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Best, made clear, the key issue is that housing is in extremely short supply in many parts of this country and can be extraordinarily expensive, particularly in the capital. For many households, housing has moved from being an item of choice to being forced expenditure. One can therefore argue that housing can be the lone factor. In other words, it does not follow that we need to look at poverty in the light of people's costs for childcare, disability and so forth, if we accept this group of amendments.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10030978000022"></a>We can obtain vital information about trends when we look at poverty levels after housing costs. It is probably the best proxy to tell us how the poor have fared as a result of housing booms and growing leverage in the economy. It is no accident that the after housing trends for the poor have been worse than the before housing trends in recent years. We have suffered an extraordinary housing boom that was built on unsustainable levels of debt, for which I blame a complacent Government. The effect is that considerably more children are living in poverty on the after housing costs measure than on the before housing costs measure: 4 million, as against 2.9 million, on the latest figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10030978000023"></a>However, the issue changes when we move from useful information for making measurements to statutory targets, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, pointed out. The amendment is not a switch from before housing costs to after housing costs-the noble Lord, Lord Best, seemed to argue that one was preferable; it is a switch to looking at both of them. In this way, we will end up with a ratchet effect between the two measures. Whichever is the worse will become the target, which is highly likely to fluctuate in the difficult times ahead. For that reason, I do not support the amendment.</p>

<a name="10030976000001"></a><b><a name="100309-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10030976000325"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for moving the amendment. It has been a good but short debate. To a certain extent, we have gone over old ground, as the noble Baroness anticipated when she moved her amendment. I say from the start that the Government are with my noble friend Lady Hollis and the noble Lord, Lord Freud, on this issue. There is a difference between having information which is useful information that could be put into the development of the strategies and something that is an additional target.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10030976000002"></a>We have already had quite a full debate around the questions of whether poverty should be measured before or after housing costs and whether an additional after housing costs target should be added to the Bill. I am afraid, therefore, that the arguments I will make in response to this amendment will not be new; I will briefly reiterate them one last time in the hope of persuading the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and her colleagues to accept the Government's point of view.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10030976000003"></a>We have measured poverty on a before housing costs basis since the 2003 <I>Measuring Child Poverty</I> consultation, and have retained this measure in the Bill. The reasons for this are threefold. First, we consider that the material deprivation measure captures the impact of poor housing on living standards, both because specific measures of housing quality are included in the list of items used for the combined low-income material deprivation measure; and also because, if a family has high housing costs, this will impact on their disposable income, and therefore on whether they can afford other items on the list. So it is not just the two specific housing-related items that are on that list; it is the impact on the rest of the collective items on that list.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10030976000004"></a>Secondly, we consider that there are drawbacks with an after housing costs measure which can understate the relative standard of living that some individuals may have by paying more for better quality accommodation. Thirdly-and I recognise that I might risk the wrath of the noble Baroness in mentioning this-the vast majority of European countries only produce and publish poverty statistics using the before housing costs measure. It is important for our goal to be among the best in Europe in the child poverty stakes that we are able to compare ourselves against these countries. But I accept that the noble Baroness is seeking to add an additional target and not to substitute one.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10030976000005"></a>We consider that the four challenging targets that we have in this Bill already enable us effectively to capture the different facets of poverty. We do not consider that adding a fifth target is beneficial. I should also comment on the 10 per cent target level proposed in  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_154"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the amendment. As I noted during Grand Committee, the level of relative poverty after housing costs is 31 per cent or 4 million children. Meeting this target would require a reduction to less than 1.3 million. As a number of noble Lords have recognised, meeting the existing targets in the Bill by 2020 is already extremely ambitious. Including the additional after housing cost target proposed would clearly make the goals set by the Bill even more challenging, with resulting resource implications. To the extent to which the after housing costs measure will understate the relative standards of living of some individuals, we would be using additional resources in an untargeted way.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10030976000006"></a>The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that children live in suitable, good-quality, affordable housing. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Martin, that it is absolutely essential; it is a key part of our strategy. We recognise the detrimental impact of poor housing conditions on children's health and educational development. This is reflected in Clause 8(5)(d), which requires the Secretary of State, in preparing the UK child poverty strategy, to consider what measures ought to be taken in regard to housing. Similarly, Part 2 of the Bill will require local authorities and their delivery partners to address housing issues where these arise in their local areas. For example, we expect the needs assessment process to identify the quality of housing experienced by families with children that live in poverty in the local areas.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10030976000007"></a>I shall pick up on one or two of the more specific points. The noble Lord, Lord Best, ran through how local housing allowance works and its implications, but I would say that we have four targets in the Bill that the Secretary of State has a duty to meet, and relative income is only one of them. The material deprivation target is key as well, and therefore in making an overall judgment, we have to look at all four targets. The noble Lord, Lord Martin, expressed his support for the mantra of "housing, housing, housing", and I think we all subscribe to that. The Government have already done much in terms of tackling overcrowding by investing to make sure that we address the issue of the lack of affordable housing. Over the two years 2009 to 2011 we will invest around £7.5 billion in affordable housing, and we expect to deliver 112,000 affordable homes. Whether you are for or against the amendment, embedded within the strategy and our approach to tackling child poverty is a strong determination to deal with housing issues. The noble Lord also talked about the need for people to be able to keep warm. He may wish to know that currently one of the items in the material deprivation measure is being able to keep accommodation warm enough in winter, so the issue is addressed specifically in that target.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10030976000008"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Best, talked about including housing benefit as income in the before housing costs measure of poverty. It is right that housing benefit is included in the before housing costs calculation. Households in receipt of housing benefit pay housing costs using their total income, including housing benefit. Households not receiving housing benefit will need to pay housing costs through their total income. The noble Baroness smiles because she has heard it before, but that does not make it any less true. Including housing benefit  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_155"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enables like-for-like comparisons between the incomes that households have with which to pay housing costs and to meet their other needs. I agree with my noble friend Lady Hollis that if you are looking at after housing costs, you have to look at issues around transport as well in order to see the total picture.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10030976000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that not having the after housing cost measure represents a change. The PSA targets are based on the before housing costs measure, which has been established since the 2004 consultation on tackling child poverty, and that is why the Bill also targets the before housing costs measure.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10030976000010"></a>I end by saying that the after housing costs figures are still going to be available and will help to inform the debate and the development of strategies around child poverty. However, what we do not support is making those figures an additional target in the Bill. For the reasons I have advanced, the targets set out in Clauses 2 to 5 measure on the before rather than after housing costs basis and in other ways the strategies set out in the Bill arising from them will ensure that the impact of housing costs on families' living standards is taken into account. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will not press her amendment. If she does, the Government will oppose it.</p>

<a name="10030976000011"></a><b><a name="100309-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10030976000326"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Best, whose experience in this field is unparalleled. I wonder why we have not heard some of the arguments set out today from the academic institutions and lobby groups; that is, all those who know about these figures in detail. I do not think one can compare housing with transport, and I answered the point in my opening speech when I quoted Doreen Kenny from the Greater London Authority, who has talked about the difficulties people face travelling quite a long way into London and having to cope with childcare and so on. It is not as easy as it sounds. There are many different forms of transport, and a lot of people cycle these days. I mention the noble Lord, Lord Freud, who I even saw cycling on the stage of the National Theatre, although it was in fact someone who was playing him in a production that was well worth seeing. Housing and transport cannot be equated.</p>

<a name="100309-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10030976000012"></a>I was puzzled by the noble Lord's argument about fluctuating house prices, because I do not think they make that big a difference to the figures collected. Just because house prices go up or down a bit, that does not mean the after housing costs will become unstable. I find that a very curious argument. Let us face it, the after housing costs will be worse for whichever Government are in power because more children are captured. That means more children are living in poverty, and they are the children we want this Bill to address. That is the reason I shall press this amendment. I beg to test the opinion of the House.</p>

Indeed, it has been accepted and acknowledged that the Bill and the duty under Clause 1 are legally enforceable in the courts of the United Kingdom by way of judicial review. In a letter to the Law Society of Scotland on 24 February this year, the Minister confirmed this, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="10030976000072"></a>"The duty in section 1 is legally enforceable by anyone in the United Kingdom".</p>

<p><a name="10030976000063"></a>He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="10030976000073"></a>"It is true that because of differences between the two legal systems, it might be more difficult for an interest to bring a judicial review in Scotland than in England and Wales".</p>

<p><a name="10030976000014"></a>The main interest in tabling this amendment is not only to ensure that the fact that the duty is enforceable is stated in the Bill, but also to address the problem that could arise with regard to efforts to enforce that duty in Scotland.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10030976000015"></a>In Scotland, judicial reviews do not tend to run in the name of a special interest group, unless that group is an association involving members who have title and interest in the particular case. Also, an individual will have such title to sue only if he or she is a party to some legal relationship giving him or her a right that has been infringed or denied. Of course, while the Bill imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, it does not confer any direct benefit on an individual. Therefore, it would be for the Scottish courts to determine whether a pursuer had title and interest in the circumstances of a particular case. Importing this amendment into the Bill would make it clear that the duty referred to was justiciable in the Scottish courts.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10030976000016"></a>The Minister also indicated in his letter to the Law Society of Scotland:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="10030976000074"></a>"Even if the organisation operates only in Scotland, a challenge could be brought against the Secretary of State in the English courts. The group would have to show standing in the same way as a UK-wide or England-only interest group would".</p>

<p><a name="10030976000017"></a>As a statement of the law, I do not dispute that-I think that it is right-but it does beg some important questions, which I know that the Minister has had flagged up to him by the Law Society of Scotland. For example, would an organisation that operates only in Scotland have a title and interest to sue in the English courts? Would such an organisation operating only in Scotland qualify for legal aid from the Legal Services Commission? Would the cost of raising an action in the English courts not create a barrier to a Scottish organisation if it were not funded by legal aid? The kinds of organisation that would have an interest in raising an action to enforce the duty of the Secretary of State would be, almost by their very nature, less likely to have access to substantial funds.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10030976000018"></a>If the duty is to be enforceable in all parts of the United Kingdom, it is important that people should have access to the courts where they live and should not have to travel to find somewhere where they could raise an action. It was to the credit of the Government back in 1998 when, with the Human Rights Act, they brought rights home and made rights that had previously been enforceable only in the court in Strasbourg enforceable in our own domestic courts. It would be regrettable if, at the end of their period of office, they were to bring about a situation whereby a duty could not be enforced in the domestic courts in Scotland, so that interest groups from Scotland would have to go south of the border in order to enforce the duty on the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10030976000019"></a>That said, one would hope that this would all be academic; we hope that the duty will be fulfilled and the targets will be met. Just in case they are not, though, some reassurances from the Minister would be welcome. I beg to move.</p>

I am grateful for the letter that the Minister sent me-unfortunately, I got it just a couple of hours ago, so I was able only to scan briefly his discussion of the case law. What is the likely result of a successful judicial review against a Secretary of State who failed to meet one or more of these targets and was found to be in breach of his duties? What punishment or penalty does the Minister anticipate that a judge would impose on the Secretary of State?</p>

It gives us the chance to put something clearly on the record. As the noble Lord has outlined, the amendment has been prompted by correspondence from the Law Society of Scotland and concerns that it has expressed regarding the extent to which the duties in the Bill could be enforceable in Scotland, given the different legal system there. Some noble Lords present may have seen my response to that correspondence, but for the benefit of others I shall set out the arguments again today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10030976000022"></a>I assume that the intention behind the amendment is to explore whether a judicial review of failure to comply with the duty in Clause 1 to meet the targets is available. It may also be to make it clear that judicial review can be brought in relation to breaches of the Clause 1 duties in the courts in Scotland as well as in England and Wales-indeed, I think that that was the thrust of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10030976000023"></a>It is not clear that the amendment as drafted would achieve its purpose. The amendment uses a number of terms that are more generally used in private law and are therefore unclear in this context. In addition, as I understand it, the sheriff court does not hear judicial reviews in Scotland; that is for the Court of Session. Furthermore, in other contexts where the word "actionable" is used, it is explained who may bring an action, but the amendment is silent on this point.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10030976000024"></a>As I have previously explained, the Bill is not intended to create duties in private law. It is also not intended to create any individual rights or any rights to damages for financial loss. The Bill is about placing a duty on the Secretary of State to meet targets, and using the Bill to grant individual rights would detract from that. The amendment therefore adds very little, if anything, to the Bill, because the duties in the Bill can be enforced through judicial review in the courts in Scotland and in England and Wales. The duties in Clause 1 are legally enforceable by anyone in the UK and the court may grant such remedy as it considers appropriate. I shall come back to that in more detail in response to the probing of the noble Lord, Lord Freud.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10030976000025"></a>If an individual wishes to bring an action against the Secretary of State, that individual must pursue the action through the administrative courts by way of judicial review, which will involve showing title and interest in Scotland-the noble Lord acknowledged that-or standing in England. The amendment would not change the rules on title, interest and standing, and any person bringing a challenge would still need

The rules on standing are in place so that purely academic claims are not brought and to ensure that a claimant or petitioner has a real interest in the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10030976000026"></a>It is true that-and this is a quote from the correspondence-</p>
<ul><a name="10030976000079"></a>"because of the differences between the two legal systems, it may be more difficult for an interest group to bring a judicial review in Scotland than in England and Wales".</ul>
<p><a name="10030976000064"></a>However, it remains a matter for the Scottish courts to decide whether a pursuer has title and interest, just as it would be for the courts in England and Wales to consider in each case whether an interest group has standing. What I am trying to say is that the amendment would not create that standing or that interest, which would have to be assessed by the court in all the circumstances of the case.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10030976000027"></a>The noble Lord asked how legal aid might operate. I understand that there are no restrictions on residents on getting legal aid from the Legal Services Commission. Therefore, if a claimant meets the normal means and merits tests for legal aid, there would be nothing to prevent a Scottish claimant from getting legal aid to pursue a claim in the English courts. However, it should be noted that legal aid is available only to individuals, not to businesses or companies. In the case of a judicial review, if a group of individuals brings a judicial review in the name of an interest group, it is possible for the group to get legal aid or, more usually, a contribution towards its legal costs even if the case is brought in the name of the charity or group.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10030976000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, asked about the consequences of an adverse judicial review. I apologise to him if he has only just received the correspondence, which picked up on the discussion that we had in Committee on enforceability. All judicial review remedies are at the discretion of the court. The court might grant a declaration that the Government had acted in breach of their statutory duties. Therefore, if the targets are not met in 2020, the court might declare that the Secretary of State had acted in breach of the requirement in the Bill to meet them, which could result in political embarrassment.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10030976000029"></a>The court could also grant an order quashing a particular policy decision or making a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to take a particular course of action. As to what power the courts would have to order that necessary resources should be made available, it is difficult to predict what remedies the court would prescribe and it is not appropriate for the Government to attempt to do so. The full range of judicial review remedies would be available to the court.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10030976000030"></a>I hope that, on that basis, the noble Lord will not press his amendment. We believe that the form of it is more focused on issues of private law, whereas we are dealing here with judicial review. We believe that the existing rules around judicial review are sufficient to enable enforcement in Scotland as well as in England and Wales. I hope that I have dealt with the particular issues about costs and legal aid.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10030976000032"></a>We should note that the Minister repeated what he said in his letter to the Law Society of Scotland-namely, that it could be more difficult for an interest group to bring a judicial review in Scotland than in England and Wales. It is regrettable, when we are establishing law in this House, that we should merely acknowledge that that will be the case, when in fact, at this stage, we have an opportunity to do something about it. If the Minister feels that the terms of the amendment are not sufficient to ensure that there is equality of access to remedy and to take action in all parts of the United Kingdom, perhaps it would have been better if he had been able to indicate that the Government would come forward with their own amendment to ensure that that was the case.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10030976000033"></a>The Minister makes the point that judicial reviews are not normally available in the sheriff court in Scotland. Of course, the amendment does not refer to judicial reviews, but we are talking to a novel kind of statutory duty and it may well be that novel procedures are required if these duties are going to be more than just aspirations, albeit important and noble aspirations. That is why the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Freud, was important, because he asked what would happen in 2020 if these duties had not been fulfilled.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10030976000034"></a>I was not overwhelmed or persuaded by the Minister's reply that a declaration might be politically embarrassing. We probably need a court to give us that declaration. There will be plenty of political debate about it anyway. He said that the court might be able to order a course of action by a Minister, but how in the world would the resources ever be ordered to will the means to the end? It is therefore unfortunate that what was a worthy aspiration may not have judicial backing. I think that this is widely accepted. However, I welcome the comments about legal aid, which were helpful if it ever comes to that. I do not intend to press the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>us over the Bill-that is, how best to tackle the problem of child poverty. Simply put, there are two approaches. We can transfer income until nobody is below the relative target line, or we can take measures which will help many people to move above the relative target under their own steam. I labour the distinction because until recently the Government have been essentially wedded to the first approach, as reflected by the Treasury being the department responsible for the child poverty agenda. I repeat the words of Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury Permanent Secretary, to the Treasury Select Committee, quite recently, in 2007:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="10030976000078"></a>"The primary reason that the Treasury has led on Child Poverty is that we control the levers which are critical for meeting the 2010 target, as we set the levels of financial support for families. Employment will have an important impact on achieving our goal of halving child poverty, but financial support is the most important lever".</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10030976000036"></a>As I acknowledged in Grand Committee, this position has modified recently. The impact assessment on the Bill talked about combining,</p>
<ul><a name="10030976000080"></a>"action on income with other social policies",</ul>
<p><a name="10030976000065"></a>designed,</p>
<ul><a name="10030976000081"></a>"to reduce the disadvantages of growing up in poor families and deprived neighbourhoods".</ul>
<p><a name="10030976000037"></a>However, the Bill has not been rebalanced in this way. The "other social policies" referred to in the impact assessment are dealt with in Clause 8, which places the Secretary of State under instruction to take various issues into account, including the employment and skills of parents. They are absolutely not targets in the sense that the financial measures are targets. This leads to the conclusion that, in practice, the Bill is a reinforcement of the Treasury's approach, and that the talk of balance between the two approaches in the impact statement is so much hot air. The concern is further amplified by the fact that under this Government-I am informed by the Minister-the Treasury will retain a key interest in the work of the Child Poverty Commission, alongside the DWP and the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The risk we are running is that policy develops exclusively on track 1-that is, on financial transfers.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10030976000038"></a>The purpose of introducing formal non-financial targets is to make sure that the obligations are balanced; that these goals receive an equivalent weighting to the financial measures and are not tucked away in Clause 8; and that there are targets that provide a powerful base for the DWP and the DCSF in the debate about how to tackle child poverty. After all, there is strong evidence that a pound earned is worth more to the recipient than a pound transferred. I cite the DWP's own research report 219, <I>The Dynamics of Deprivation</I>.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10030976000039"></a>I turn to the specific non-financial targets in the amendment. I make absolutely clear that these represent a best attempt to isolate what appear to be major sources of, or at least correlations with, poverty and poor child well-being. Much of the debate surrounding this proposition in Committee focused on the precise nature of these financial targets. Therefore, should the Government be tempted to adopt this approach, I would be absolutely open to fine-tuning the specific targets. Indeed, if a clause along these lines were  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_163"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>acceptable, I would be happy to establish these specific items following consultation with the proposed Child Poverty Commission.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10030976000040"></a>Let me lay out why the Government should consider this proposition. This is a Bill about the next 10 years, in which it is important that there is bipartisan support. The Government should therefore be interested in ensuring that this Bill is useful for whichever party is in power. I also point out that the Minister, as a representative of the DWP, should welcome an amendment that reinforces the position of that department in tackling child poverty. I am particularly conscious that he has just piloted the Welfare Reform Bill through the House, with its emphasis on individualised intervention to help the economically inactive. Therefore, he has an intimate understanding of the importance of such interventions. He will be as conscious as I am of the internal government battles to establish strategies in this area-battles that would be exacerbated by the three-way structure of management this Government propose.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10030976000041"></a>I turn to the specific drivers of poverty that I have specified in this amendment. Since we have discussed these in Committee I will not dwell on them at length. The first and last, covering work and training, are essentially uncontentious and are reflected in Clause 8 as key areas for the Secretary of State or the three Secretaries of State to take action in. The other two are not so straightforward. The importance of stable relationships does not seem to be accepted by this Government. The Minister stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030976000082"></a>"although child poverty is associated with family breakdown, there is no clear causal link".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/01/10; cols. GC 171-72.]</ul>
<p><a name="10030976000042"></a>I think that is a wilful misinterpretation of the evidence, although I admit that there does not seem to be a lot of it around.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10030976000043"></a>However, I was able to uncover one important piece of research that focuses on this question that suggests exactly the opposite. I refer to Stephen Jenkins's work on <I>M</I><I>arital </I><I>Splits and I</I><I>ncome </I><I>C</I><I>hanges over the </I><I>L</I><I>ong</I><I>er</I><I></I><I>T</I><I>erm</I>, published by the Institute for Social and Economic Research in February 2008. This found that, after a marital split, all women in the study who did not move into paid work remained below the poverty line for each of the next five years after experiencing the largest initial fall of the group in income. You can take out all those weasel words about correlation and bury them. This is straight cause and effect. The study did not cover splits by cohabitees. It is likely that the impact is amplified for this group because they are less well protected. We await specific research on this.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10030976000044"></a>Interestingly, there is some good news in this survey. The secular rise in women's labour force participation rates, combined with in-work benefit, means that those women who move into work come close to recovering their pre-split incomes after five years. This finding underpins the importance of two of the factors in this amendment: work and reducing relationship breakdowns. It also underpins the equally sophisticated work undertaken by the Child Poverty Action Group, which I quoted in Committee. This research is ground-breaking in the sense that it aims to capture the relative importance  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_164"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the factors surrounding poverty by using a new statistical technique called structural equation modelling, which was developed in around 2000. The Child Poverty Action Group found that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030976000083"></a>"the effect of separation on a couple (whether married or cohabiting) in terms of increasing the risk of poverty was much greater than for any other triggers, including job loss".</ul>
<p><a name="10030976000066"></a>Parts of this Government still seem to be in denial about the importance of stable family relationships-certainly, the part of the Government in the Chamber today. Does the Minister agree with Ed Balls, when, at the turn of the year, he said that adult relationships are,</p>
<ul><a name="10030976000084"></a>"important for the progress of the children"?</ul>
<p><a name="10030976000067"></a>Was that a statement about cause and effect or just another correlation? I would be most interested in the Minister's response to this pivotal question. I was pleased to provide the references to the Minister's team for the two important pieces of research to which I have referred, so I look forward to a most informed assessment of them from him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10030976000045"></a>The purpose of paragraph (a) in the amendment is to ensure that we monitor, and have strategies to encourage, family stability whether the parents are married or cohabiting. The evidence that I spelt out in Committee suggests that the greatest concern should lie with the latter.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10030976000046"></a>I shall deal with paragraph (c) in the amendment briefly as I have a later amendment that deals with the issue so far as it concerns financial transfers. The aspect I shall deal with now is that of relying on targets which ignore the impact of parental addiction. This is quite different in kind from the other targets and is disgracefully ignored in the Bill. As far as I can see, it does not contain a single reference to addiction. What is the use of a financial target when it ignores the fact that resources will be diverted from the children to feed a parent's habit? If we ignore this issue, we will make great efforts and spend considerable resources to reduce poverty but many children will simply not see any benefit whatever. The main beneficiaries will be the local drug dealers and off-licences.</p>

<a name="100309-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10030976000047"></a>The target must incorporate an assessment of the impact of addiction. If we had one-as I am proposing-the state would be forced to find a way to deal with this issue and channel resources towards children more effectively. This issue is entirely different in kind from the others, as addictive parents undermine the whole concept of tackling child poverty by measures focused solely on relative household incomes. That is why we need to supplement the financial targets with targets on addiction. Otherwise, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne-I do not see him in his place-will be calling for the Bill to be renamed the child poverty and delight of drug dealers Bill. I beg to move.</p>

That is the disagreement between us: not whether these things matter to children-they clearly do-but whether it is reasonable to talk about non-financial targets when in so many of these areas we are trespassing on a private life where the Government have no levers to pull. The noble Lord is quite right to say that two of those four targets, worklessness and education, are part of the Government's strategy. There would not be any dispute between us that they are being pursued in other avenues and ways-we hope with increasing success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10030976000050"></a>On keeping records of children who are brought up in relationships that are marriage, civil partnership or long-lasting cohabitation, is that "long-lasting" for three years, or five, or 10? What counts as a target? On addiction to gambling, drugs and alcohol, is that one bottle a week or 10? What about smoking? We know that half of all lone parents smoke and that because they smoke they are poor. Why is smoking not included? Those who saw that programme about MPs going to live temporarily for a week or so in flats saw that smoking could take up quite a lot of the disposable budget. Many of us might argue, "If only it was spent on fruit or yoghurt," but one is dealing with something beyond the reach of Government. How will the noble Lord define this?</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10030976000051"></a>I really worry when the Front Bench spokesman on this tries to put in the Bill non-financial targets which the Government could monitor only with the most impertinent entry into family life. Even if they did that, they would still find it difficult to turn these into targets, which by definition have to be numerical. They have to assess something and have to put a figure to it. How much booze or gambling, how many cigarettes and drugs, and for how many years? If you are not careful, the Bill will not be about child poverty but about remoralising the parents of those children who happen to be poor. The state is then going into the territory that child poverty is about the fecklessness of adults and using legislation to "send a message"-that is the usual vocabulary-that this sort of thing is undesirable, as though people who may exhibit these traits read the legislation. This is completely inappropriate for legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10030976000052"></a>Nobody doubts the decency of the intent. Nobody is on the other side of the noble Lord, saying these things do not matter. Yet he gave it away himself. He quoted absolutely rightly-I would have produced this evidence if he had not-that those lone parents that go into poverty following, for example, a break-up of marriage or cohabitation regain their status when they go into work. He also knows, as I have sent details of the research to him, that lone parenthood is often fairly highly correlated with young male unemployment. Get the young men into work and they become that

Then the families may be stable. It is right that government go down those avenues of creating work, encouraging people back into the labour market and making benefits conditional on them doing so.

What about if he lives in the next-door house or is semi-cohabiting? For heaven's sake, surely no politician can believe it appropriate for these sorts of non-financial targets, however well-meaning, to be turned into something that can be counted and tracked in a Bill. That turns it into a war on the fecklessness of parents and imposes an ideology which is quite inappropriate and, frankly, rather impertinent.</p>

I cling to where we can find common ground with the noble Lord-we discussed this at some length in Committee. He is not alone in understanding the importance of allowing people to trade their own way out of poverty, whether child poverty or any other kind. No one any more is saying that this is all about financial transfers. The noble Lord is on to something here. He is trying to harness the power of government to get people into a better place. That is the way the debate is moving. I was at a breakfast this morning staged by Tomorrow's People. The organisation is working with families and households in a welfare-to-work context. The project will pay dividends and repay careful study.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10030976000055"></a>The development of policies, alongside the Bill as well as within it, is going in that direction. The noble Lord is not alone in pursuing what he is trying to achieve in the amendment. However, the list is the problem, because it is incomplete. The noble Lord said that he was willing to talk about what is not in the amendment that should be. I would certainly be willing to talk to him about that. I agree that worklessness and lacking level 2 key skills are both no-brainers. We want to work on that.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10030976000056"></a>However, there are worries. If the noble Lord thinks that paragraphs (a) and (c) of the proposed new clause are uncontentious, he is wrong. That is not to say that we are not willing to discuss with him how he gets to where he wants to go. But how do we do this? How do Her Majesty's Government create stability in marriage? What lever does the Secretary of State pull in order to achieve that? In Committee, we discussed domestic violence and a raft of other things that you would want in any such list if it were to be comprehensive. Therefore, this is not the place for the amendment.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10030976000057"></a>I encourage the noble Lord to continue to think through what can be done. There is scope for reaching agreement on some of these issues in order, as he says, to shift the focus to embrace a more holistic and biopsychosocial model of assisting low-income households to get into a better position to deal with poverty over the next 20 years, and thereby indirectly to bear down on child poverty. This territory is worth revisiting, but I do not support the amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Freud, has made a helpful adjustment to the Bill. I hear what has been said and understand the concerns. I am reminded of the UNICEF report, published I think in 2006, which looked at the 26 developed countries, and in which the UK came last. It was a rich report that looked at many dimensions of child poverty. For instance, it looked at how often children had time to spend with their parents over a meal. It commented in particular that Italy was the country where children spent most time with their parents. It looked at the relationships of children with their parents, and at a range of other issues.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10030976000059"></a>One striking thing about the report is that the dimension in which the UK did best was health and safety. There is irony in that. It seems to me-again, the amendment speaks to this-that one problem in our culture is that we are very good at measuring what is concrete but not very good at being more imaginative and thinking more widely about the emotional needs of children. There is a DH Lawrence story about a young boy who has the ability of forecasting who will win horse races. He rocks on his rocking horse for some time, at the end of which he knows who will win a horse race. He tells his mother which horse will win, and the mother goes off and makes money on the races. He gets quite sick doing this, but carries on: everything is going well because they are making lots of money. This is a caricature of what the Government are seeking to achieve: that in our country anything that is measurable is worthwhile, while that which is not easily measurable is not. It does credit to the noble Lord, Lord Freud, that he is trying to reach things that are not easily measurable but which are very important to children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10030976000060"></a>In the recently produced Green Paper on family relationships, the Government have recognised the importance of stable parental relationships in terms of child welfare and child outcomes. This arises from American research which demonstrates that parenting interventions can be very effective, not when they are directed at the parent and child but when they are directed at the two parents together. This is perhaps obvious to your Lordships, but the stronger the parental relationship, the better the children fare.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10030976000061"></a>There is a lot to be said for this amendment. If one is looking for a lever for government to improve parental relationships, the current proposals in the Children, Schools and Families Bill to introduce personal, social, health and economic education as a statutory part of the curriculum would be one way to encourage more children to avoid teenage pregnancies and to make better decisions about life partners. Their children would therefore have the benefit of growing up in a two-parent family.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10030976000062"></a>I know your Lordships will have your own experiences and familiarity with working-class white and black boys, but I can remember working with a young black man several years ago who grew up in a lone parent family. He bewailed the fact that his mother had to work so hard for him and his younger brother because she was bringing them up on her own. Another young white boy at a local primary school would give me all

Eventually I met him with his mother and realised he was without a father. It brought home to me the plight of those young boys who really want to have a father but are growing up without one, so they will embrace any young man who is around to fill that vacuum. I support the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and I hope the Minister can give him some comfort.</p>

I thank him for his amendment and noble Lords who have joined in this debate. As he recognised, the themes raised by the amendment were debated at great length in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10030981000002"></a>I do not agree with the noble Lord's repeated assertion that the Bill is only or primarily concerned with income poverty and financial transfers. This Bill is actually focused on tackling income poverty, material deprivation and socio-economic disadvantage. He made several references, citing the role of the Treasury in all this in support of his proposition. He quoted Nick Macpherson speaking before the Select Committee about the PSA targets sitting with HMT because it has responsibility for financial support but, as the noble Lord acknowledged, that comment was made in relation to the 2010 PSA target. The situation is different in regard to the 2020 goal and the targets in the Bill. The levers to address this are no longer just about income transfers; they are more far-reaching, which is why we list a range of levers on building blocks in Clause 8 on the strategy. They can hardly be described as buried in the back of the Bill.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10030981000003"></a>Our aims are that children in the UK should not live in poverty and suffer the effects of wider socio-economic disadvantage. Ensuring a focus on income and material deprivation is central to that, but so is taking action beyond financial poverty. Having a set of income targets to measure progress and define success does not mean that we are not aware of the drivers of poverty that need to be addressed to meet the goals in this Bill. They will be addressed through the child poverty strategy.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10030981000004"></a>Our strategy needs to be multifaceted if we are to break intergenerational cycles of poverty and so truly end child poverty. The UK strategy will need to meet both the purposes set out in Clause 8(2), and Clause 8(5) requires the strategy to consider what measures, if any, ought to be taken across a range of key policy areas. Those building blocks have been determined through analysis of evidence that shows that they have the potential to make the biggest impact in tackling the causes and consequences of growing up in socio-economic disadvantage.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10030981000005"></a>Turning to the four elements listed in the amendment, the Government agree, as did the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that education and employment are crucial aspects in any effort to tackle child poverty, which is why they are included in the building blocks in Clause 8(5). We also recognise that support for parents and better parenting skills are important. Indeed, shortly, we will be moving a government amendment to add a new building block to Clause 8(5) to address the matter of supporting parents-in response to the tenor of the debate that we had in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10030981000006"></a>We take issues of addiction very seriously. However, we consider that that is already covered by the existing building blocks, such as health, education and social services. I hope that I have made it clear that there is no need for the amendment, as the Bill already covers most of those matters. I agree again, and as usual, with my noble friend Lady Hollis: if we go down the route of having a list of all the things that we think ought to be covered, it will be never-ending. However, I contend that there is no firm evidence that family breakdown or addiction constitute the main drivers of poverty. Indeed, there was much debate about the difference between correlation and causation, which I do not want to reopen now; we had a good go at that in Committee.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10030981000007"></a>In Committee, noble Lords queried what the policy responses to targets on addiction and family breakdown might be; we heard that again this afternoon. The question posed by my noble friend was absolutely right: how are you going to go about measuring the things that you want to? We wonder how the noble Lord would go about ensuring that adults lived only in couples and whether re-establishing the married couple's allowance may be linked to that. It would do little to help the poorest, but it would certainly line the pockets of the richer. On addiction, the noble Lord seems to be proposing withholding financial provision to households where one or more parents have an addiction. That would increase the risk of poverty for children in that household, so I would not support it.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10030981000008"></a>The noble Lord has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of the data underpinning the income targets in the Bill. I question the accuracy of any data on addiction or family breakdown. Both issues would be difficult to address using a survey methodology, so it would be difficult to produce robust national estimates to inform statutory targets. Such data are also unlikely to be as rigorous as the ONS-approved HBAI data that the Government use for the targets in the Bill. I am surprised that the noble Lord would want the Government to collect, store and use such sensitive personal data on individual parents.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10030981000009"></a>I think that the noble Lord acknowledged that our approach is to have the Treasury, DCSF and DWP heavily engaged. I know, as does the noble Lord from his previous experience, the strength of the DWP and its commitment to helping people to get closer to and into the labour market. Helping people into sustainable work in which they can flourish will be key to tackling child poverty.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10030981000010"></a>The noble Lord pressed me on issues about stable relationships. As I said, we will move an amendment to add a building block about support for parents generally. We agree that stable family relationships are important in helping to nurture young people. Indeed, the noble Lord attended our small seminar giving an early preview of the strategic directions paper. That featured in our discussion there.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10030981000011"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis pointed out the risks of moralising on these issues by seeking to pursue targets in that way. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, made reference to the UNICEF report placing the UK at the bottom of the league. I think this was a 2006 report. The data used at the time were very out of  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_170"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>date; none was later than 2003. Much of it related to 1999 and 2001. The noble Earl gave an interesting illustration of the young black lad concerned about his mother, who was working to try and sustain the family. The importance of role models in work so that you break the cycle of intergenerational poverty is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10030981000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that this is not just about financial transfers. We have common cause across the House on this issue. It is now thoroughly accepted that financial transfers are just part of it. We are not just looking at this to have a short-term fix on a target; we are looking at something sustainable. Financial transfers certainly have a contribution to make and it would be quite wrong to suggest otherwise. We need to do more, however, to make sure that the strategy is sustainable.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10030981000013"></a>I hope I have demonstrated why I think this amendment is unnecessary. The Bill will already require action to be taken on both income and non-income factors to address poverty and socio-economic disadvantage. I have also revealed the problems with the direction in which this amendment would take us with regard to particular targets on family breakdown and addiction. On this basis, I hope the noble Lord will not press his amendment.</p>

One can collect such survey data in exactly the same way as one can collect survey data on income. This is not focusing on individual parents and keeping those data; it is carrying out a survey. We already have a lot of the information, for instance, on the type of family formation so it is not a huge extra burden. I think it is even in the HBAI as it stands, which goes through the types of family that there are. The data will not be an extra intrusion to collect. This amendment does not aim to send a moral message to anyone; it does something quite different. It requires the state to develop strategies which underpin the things we know help to reduce poverty.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10030981000015"></a>As I said when I introduced the amendment, it may not be exactly the right grouping but there are probably no more than one or two more than the four types of household that we put forward in this amendment which are critical in allowing families to pull themselves out of poverty rather than relying on the state to do so.</p>

<a name="100309-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10030981000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about the levers for stability-what can one do? The Minister referred to incentives for married people in the tax system. There is a much simpler lever-the effective couple penalty in the benefits and tax credits system, which runs at about £1,300 a year for couples. That is why the data show that there seem to be 200,000 more single parents than there really are. According to the IFS, people need to misrepresent their circumstances because of the perverse nature of the support system at that level.</p>

The noble Lord says that there is a penalty when two people come together, because the total benefit is reduced compared with the two single benefits. How, then, would he assess housing benefit? If that couple subsequently broke up, would they really receive half of what they had been receiving, even though they had to go on to form two separate households instead of one?</p>

This is clearly an immensely complicated issue. The figures that I am using are from the Centre for Social Justice. They are average figures, which take account of all the benefits and credits. As I say, I think that the figure is roughly £1,300. The point is that the benefit to the couple is material; it is based on the difference between the actual costs of living as a couple and the actual costs of living separately. It certainly seems to be the most reliable calculation that I have seen in the research that I have read. It is the real penalty of the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10030981000023"></a>I make it absolutely clear to the Minister that the item on addiction has nothing to do with withholding funding from particular families. I made it clear at the beginning that it is no good having a system that just puts the money into the pocket of someone who is addicted and who will spend the money on their addiction. We must find a way, in those circumstances, of making sure that the money that we spend for the benefit of the children is indeed spent for the benefit of the children. That is a quite different proposition from the one that the Minister implied that I seek. I am glad that, since Grand Committee, the Minister seems to be a convert to the importance of a stable relationship between parents. He seems to have moved quite some way from what he said previously about correlations in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10030981000024"></a>I accept that many of the things that I seek are in Clause 8. The amendment is important because it seeks to balance the purely financial targets in the Bill, which are the main driver, with the causes of poverty. That is why I seek to give many of those elements the same weight as the financial targets. I am sure that the debate on this will continue, albeit in another form.</p>

He estimates that the informal economy's share of gross domestic product is likely to be 10.9 per cent in the UK in this year alone. That is a massive amount of undeclared activity-in the region of £140 billion. Clearly it covers a multitude of activity, from underdeclared earnings, or tax evasion, to illegal activity such as drug dealing, to welfare fraud. Nevertheless, some of it will inevitably be distorting the data on which the child poverty strategy are based. The risk is that we worry about children who are living in families

Strategies to help those children would, therefore, effectively be steering resources away from children who were living in households in genuine need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10030981000029"></a>This amendment is designed to reinforce the importance of the work of the Office for National Statistics in this area. To judge by its 2005 report <I>Identifying Sources on Entrepreneurship and the Informal </I><I>E</I><I>conomy</I>, it is already getting to grips with the issue in assessing the relevant data sets. In the years to come, this amendment should encourage significantly further advances.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10030981000030"></a>The second aspect that this amendment is designed to encourage is the valuation of support that may be in kind rather than in cash. I am indebted to a briefing from the Minister's team for informing me how the survey data already put a value on many passported and in-kind benefits, such as free school meals. My concern arises from a series of recommendations in the 2009 OECD report <I>Doing Better for Children</I>, which concluded that support for some of the hardest-to-help families can be better delivered in kind than in cash. I pick out the key issue in a quotation from the report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="10030981000037"></a>"Children at greater risk may benefit more from in-kind services because their parents may not be capable of functioning as agents acting in the best interests of their children with income transfers".</p>

<p><a name="10030981000033"></a>If this is true, we need a child poverty measurement basis that does not discriminate against in-kind services and where such services would do a better job because they would not count in the battle against child poverty. The amendment would make sure that valuable interventions such as these were not ruled out purely for reasons of measurement. I beg to move.</p>

I am thinking of families where there is substance misuse. An agency called, I think, the substance misuse advisory group identified a large number of children growing up in such families. I am not suggesting that those families should be particularly targeted, but if at the birth of the child one were to offer the parents either a generous package of clothing, footwear and general requisites for an infant during the first 12 months of life or a sum of money worth a lot less than the package, perhaps some of the families would choose the package. One might find that the infants were better clothed, with the right footwear and sufficient changes of nappy, which they might not have had if the measure being proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, was not in place because we had inadvertently prejudiced ourselves against in-kind benefits.</p>

We read the wording of the amendment to try to determine what it meant because it is not entirely clear. However, the noble Lord has explained it. We had assumed that its purpose was to ensure that any measure of income within this context should focus only on those items that have a clear and direct impact on the child, and indeed there is some merit in that argument.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10030992000002"></a>As I have explained before, the four targets in the Bill have been chosen on the basis of extensive consultation, including the consultation on measuring  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_174"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>child poverty in 2003. In establishing four targets, we have recognised the need for a comprehensive definition of success which captures the many facets of poverty. Long-term poverty and the material deprivation that results can reinforce the negative impact of low income on childhood well-being and life chances, so the targets ensure that policy will have to tackle poor living standards and persistent poverty as well as raising incomes at a given point in time. We strongly believe that together, these targets reflect the reality that income, the length of time experienced on low income, and the lived experience of poverty matter. So while I welcome the contribution of the noble Lord and acknowledge, as I have done previously, that a range of difficulties are involved in accurately measuring income, it remains difficult to determine what additional benefits would arise from the suggested addition to Clause 6.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10030992000003"></a>I would ask the noble Lord to consider the practical implications of the approach that seems to be implicit in his amendment, that it would seek to specify in regulations particular items or sources of income which are or seem to be child-focused. We know that income sources are distributed in different ways in different households, and that people living in poverty often sacrifice their own well-being to reduce the impact that low income has on their children. Furthermore, accurately following income from source to expenditure would be difficult, and perhaps impossible. However, I am not sure if that proposition flows from what the noble Lord is seeking.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10030992000004"></a>The noble Lord referred to the major lacuna in the data, and indeed we discussed that at some length in Committee, largely as a result of his probing. He referred again today to the informal economy. It is absolutely right that we need to make sure that the data are as robust and secure as possible. Dealing with the informal economy is not easy. It has to be tackled in a number of ways. The noble Lord will acknowledge that the Government were seeking to tackle fraud over declaration of income and tax evasion. I am tempted to say that I am not sure how a non-dom would fill in the questionnaire for these purposes, but perhaps one should not be unkind enough to stray in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10030992000005"></a>The noble Lord made reference to income or resources being made available in kind rather than cash if that were beneficial-we are thinking here about free school meals and those sorts of issues-and was suggesting that somehow the measurements would run counter to that. The noble Lord will recall a discussion we had after Committee; we said that if these things did develop, we would expect the surveys to be built with such provisions in mind so that they would be counted as income. In Committee we ran through the principle and the basis on which so-called benefits in kind could and should be included in the statistics.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10030992000006"></a>In terms of the robustness of the data, the noble Lord referred to the IFS judgment. We have heard some criticisms from the IFS on the data, but it nevertheless considers the data robust enough to use as the basis for much of the evidence that it produces-for example, in the following recent studies. The IFS tax benefits model, TAXBEN, was based on the FRS and used for <I>Analysis of </I><I>T</I><I>ax and </I><I>B</I><I>enefit</I><I> Changes a</I><I>ffecting

In <I>More Un</I><I>equal-</I><I>but W</I><I>hy?</I> the IFS analysed the change in inequality, commenting that the FRS offers a substantially larger sample than the previous survey used. This work has contributed to the large study undertaken by the National Equality Panel. The annual IFS report, <I>Poverty and Inequality in the UK</I>, presents the most recent HBAI data it helped to validate. The data have also been used by a variety of other respected research organisations, including the London School of Economics, the National Policy Institute, the University of Cambridge, the Fawcett Society and the University of Oxford. We have common cause with the noble Lord in wanting the data to be as robust as possible and we believe that significant efforts have been undertaken. We shared with the noble Lord some of the background-questionnaires and the approaches taken to the survey-which led to the production of the data. There is, of course, a constant desire to make sure that we keep that as up to date as possible.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10030992000007"></a>The income statistics we will use to measure progress against the targets in the Bill provide the best available proxy for child poverty. The statistics used in the <I>Households Below Average Income</I> publication comply with best practice on measuring household income. The survey underpinning HBAI exploits the best available methodologies to capture household income. A huge amount of time and effort is invested in ensuring that our estimates are robust and the Family Resources Survey is widely recognised as a world-class instrument for poverty measurement. In addition, HBAI is produced to national statistics standards. Among other things, this means it meets agreed standards for integrity and quality.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10030992000008"></a>More generally, the range of targets included in the Bill means that we will make a robust assessment of the levels of child poverty. The combined low income and material deprivation measure will ensure that we capture the essence of what this amendment is seeking to address. If income is not being spent to the benefit of the child, then this will be seen by the fact that the child is more likely to be materially deprived. Indeed, even those basic items associated with the adult or adults in the household are likely to be negatively affected if income is not being appropriately or effectively used.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10030992000009"></a>I consider this amendment to be unnecessary. We have in place appropriate measures to capture material deprivation, and any additional flexibility in measuring income that may have been intended from this amendment will not add value. The noble Lord may wish to note that HBAI is already subject to reviews which ensure that the statistics will benefit from any developments in income measurement-for example, along the lines suggested by the noble Lord-so that we make sure that best practice is always applied. I hope, on that basis, that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

Maybe I should apologise for it not being completely clear what this amendment was driving at. Interestingly-it may have caught him little by surprise-he seemed to agree with the main thrust of this amendment on both of the aspects that we have discussed. This amendment is clearly aiming to put a forcing mechanism behind both of those aspects.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_176"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10030992000011"></a>First, there should be a forcing mechanism to get better data on what the informal economy really represents in this area. Although I agree that the HBAI statistics are highly respected and widely used, one can make the argument that if they are the main instrument, of course they will be used. The IFS made it clear that the figures below the 40 per cent median are utterly unreliable. I think that is a reasonable interpretation of what it said. That is exactly the point. It shows that the informal economy is having a real impact at that level, as one would suspect.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10030992000012"></a>Secondly, on in-kind versus cash, I am grateful for the little briefing that the Minister's team provided me with a couple of weeks ago. Clearly, the HBAI survey includes much of the in-kind provision. However, I refer to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel-and I thank him for his valuable contribution. If this research comes out as saying that for many families in-kind is a far superior form of support than cash, instead of the Minister's response that we will be able to take in-kind payments into account in the survey, what is so difficult about taking them into account at this stage of a Bill which is meant to deal with these issues? Rather than an assurance, albeit on the Floor of this House, that the survey will take in-kind payments into account, why not have it in the Bill as an obligation?</p>

For that reason I think I can promise your Lordships a very short debate. Schedule 1 sets up the arrangements for the appointment, payment, functions, governance, and so on, of the Child Poverty Commission. It was my intention when I raised these matters in Committee to try to ensure that the commission is as independent as possible of Government, but your Lordships will see from page 18 of the Bill that the Secretary of State appoints all its members apart from those who are appointed by the devolved Administrations.</p>

I hope this legislation will encourage recruitment from communities where there is deprivation and where there are men and women who have experienced the terrible poverty that exists throughout our country. In the poorer areas of the city of Glasgow a person is lucky if they become a justice of the peace; it is in the west end of Glasgow that you will see appointments to commissions. I do not mean to be disrespectful, but that is where the academics live. They also live in certain parts of Edinburgh, and noble Lords will know of other areas where good, clever people live.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10030992000017"></a>However, the commission will need not only good, clever people but men and women of good will who have experienced the terrible poverty of deprived communities. I am sick and tired of the media talking about areas of multiple deprivation as though everyone in such communities is helpless-they are not. If you were to visit Glasgow, I could take you to see men and women who have set up disablement groups. There would be a lot of lonely disabled people if it was not for one woman, in particular, who created an organisation which now delivers meals to disabled and housebound people; it has a meeting place where people can come together and talk about their problems, enjoy themselves and arrange holidays. These are the achievements of people who live in these so-called areas of multiple deprivation.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10030992000018"></a>However, when appointments are made to what we used to call quangos-I do not know whether they are still called that-people from areas where the problems are being experienced are passed by. The Bill will be a failure unless we appoint people to the commission who can say, "That problem will not be resolved if you handle it in that way". To give a comparison, it was written into the legislation on the Electoral Commission-about which I have some experience-that no one who was involved politically could be a member of the Electoral Commission. This meant that former Labour, Liberal and Conservative Party agents could not be on the commission and lend the years of experience they had gained from hands-on work in the communities such as delivering leaflets and arranging to get people to the polls. We wrote into the legislation that we could not use these people, who had a lifetime of experience, and so what did we get? We got former returning officers from local government who did not know what it was to go into a housing estate to deliver a leaflet and meet a Doberman standing in the garden which would not let you do so; and if you got past the Doberman you had to look out for the Rottweiler on the other side of the door.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10030992000019"></a>The point I make about this commission, which I wish to put on record, is that if we do not appoint to it people who live in these communities and who have a proven record of helping themselves, their communities and their neighbours-and there are many of them-we will have failed.</p>

In both this House and the other place we have repeatedly made it clear that the value of the commission lies in the quality and independence of its advice. Provisions in the Bill and commitments we have made with regard to the approved appointments process of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments will establish a commission that has the capacity to provide advice which is of high quality and independent.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="100309100000002"></a>The provenance of the amendment stems from the important discussions we had in Grand Committee.

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="100309100000003"></a>Malnutrition is a subject that I have come to quite recently. It was the noble Lord, Lord Rea, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and reflecting upon their very powerful speeches in Committee that made me go away and look again at its significance and the direct relationship between malnutrition and child poverty. It is that that promoted the idea that it worth spending a moment or two on Report on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="100309100000004"></a>I do not want to make a long speech, but I now believe, with all the passion I can muster, that babies that are underweight at birth are, by definition, disadvantaged. All the statistics show that they are immediately part of a group that is, almost inevitably, heading for disadvantage in later life. That is an essential part of the intergenerational poverty that the Bill seeks to address. If we do not think carefully about what can be done in the Bill, against that background, we will be missing an opportunity.</p>

<a name="100309-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="100309100000005"></a>I am struck by the recent improvements in nutritional science, which is getting very much better at diagnosing and suggesting remedies and methods of dealing with malnutrition, and the developments that are now available. There is a very clear relationship and link-even as a layperson, I can see it-between diet and underdevelopment; underdevelopment not just in terms of health, but in terms of socio-economic background, well-being in the broadest sense, education and a whole range of other factors. Children learn to be poor by the time they are three or four years of age and therefore, if that is true and if we can determine-as we can very easily-that children who are born underweight are subject and susceptible to being in that position, we are derelict in our duty if we do not do something about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="100309100000006"></a>My Amendment 11 is easier for the Government to accept than Amendment 23, which also stands in my name. Since the Minister was very generous in accepting a Conservative amendment earlier, I think it is only fair that, in the course of an eight-hour debate, he is equal handed. This may be his moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="100309100000007"></a>Turning briefly to Amendment 23-although I am dealing with these amendments briefly, I mean them most sincerely-minimum income standards are something I am much more familiar with and have been arguing for over many years and in earlier incarnations. Minimum income standards are not targets-we had a very good discussion about this in Committee-nobody is suggesting that. Minimum income standards are used by many sister European countries to great effect as a tool, in real time, to calculate and demonstrate to ordinary men and women in the street the differences between what people have to live on and what they should be living on. All this technical stuff that we are fond of discussing here is very important and the Bill is important-I have already conceded that I now accept that-but minimum income standards

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="100309100000008"></a>Frankly, I think it is a disgrace that 1.7 million children are in this situation in 2010. Minimum income standards are a valuable and useful tool to demonstrate the extent of the disadvantage and they are much more accessible in the course of the public debate that we need to engage in to persuade people that this work is essential if we are not to deprive people of life choices and circumstances in the future.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="100309100000009"></a>It is against that background that I am moving Amendment 11. I think that the amendment is worth testing the opinion of the House on. I would be very interested to know who would be opposed-against the background of the Bill and the explanation that I have given-to the idea that people would be better able to understand the force of the argument if it is conducted with the information about malnutrition that would be available if we had an annual report, as Amendment 11 proposes.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="100309100000010"></a>I have a dual purpose here: obviously, I will listen to what colleagues have to say about this, and I hope that the amendment finds favour, but I would like to find out, just as a matter of interest, whether this is something that colleagues in the House think is important. The only way of doing that is to test the opinion of the House, but I look forward to what colleagues and the Minister have to say. I beg to move.</p>

At their heart, they demand the answer to a simple question: are the poverty targets set in the Bill the right ones? Do they do the job? In particular, do families above the poverty line, as measured by the Bill, have adequate resources for nutrition and warmth, among other necessities?</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="100309100000012"></a>The problem is that the 60 per cent target has not been derived from any process at all, as far as I can gather, other than consensus among academics that it is about the right figure. It has certainly not been based on minimum income standards and, as we discussed in Committee, the poverty line is very considerably below the minimum income standard set by the Rowntree study-more than 15 per cent, as best I could judge.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="100309100000013"></a>We may find ourselves brought face to face with this conflict before too long, to judge by developments in Germany on this issue. Germany's Supreme Court has given the German Government until the end of the year to come up with benefit figures that ensure a "dignified minimum"-I am not sure what that is in German. Hans-Jürgen Papier, the president of Germany's Constitutional Court-I think that he is retired now-said that benefits must be based on "reliable figures" and "comprehensible calculations". Rough estimates, he said, are unconstitutional. Given the way that these trends develop within the EU, I would not be surprised to see academic consensus on poverty move away from relative poverty lines towards "dignified minimums" across Europe.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="100309100000014"></a>However, to switch horses from relative poverty to minimum income standards at this stage, would, I think, destroy the Bill in its tracks. It is an entirely different approach, so while I am sympathetic to

However, the debate on child and maternal nutrition can, I think, be extracted from the general position and made a specific requirement of the Bill.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="100309100000015"></a>The evidence from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord Rea, in Committee was compelling in its focus on the importance of early maternal, and even pre-maternal, nutrition. The importance is amplified by recent reports that young girls have the worst diet of any group in society. So this is an issue about targeted measures and information, as well as incomes. The income element is, I anticipate, trivial against the long-term gains of healthy babies and children, and while it might be a stretch to use DEL-AME switches in a formal way in this context, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, suggested in Committee, the gains from getting this right are indeed substantial.</p>

The Minister said that minimum income standards were ruled out because different research methods tended to make different assumptions, and it was difficult to get one answer to the question of how much income was enough. I am not particularly persuaded that this was a very robust response, but that is the later amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="100309100000017"></a>Amendment 11 concentrates on the malnutrition of children, something that just should not occur in a wealthy country at the beginning of the 21st century, yet there is clearly child malnutrition in this country. We need to find out as much about it as we can because it can lead to bad health outcomes later in life, as well as a multitude of other problems. I support my noble friend's amendment.</p>

As I moved a similar amendment in Committee, I thought I should say a word about this one, although I shall not be moving it in her place. I hope this is in order. Under Amendment 18, the Secretary of State would have to consider the desirability of extending eligibility for free school lunches and milk to secondary school pupils whose parents were in receipt of working families tax credit. Although there is much to commend the amendment, as I said in Committee, I was persuaded by the Minister in his reply that primary legislation was not necessary for this to be brought about as it would be done by secondary legislation.</p>

While we talk in terms of vague figures, aims, targets and so on, it is better to have vague targets than no targets at all-although obviously I would prefer accurate ones.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="100309100000020"></a>I shall speak particularly on Amendment 23, and I shall refer to some of the research being asked for in that amendment. Such research is already being carried out in Bradford, and some of the findings of the Born in Bradford project are due to be published in June. Born in Bradford is seeking to monitor the development of every child born in the district over a three-year period, beginning as near conception as possible and going through birth and infancy into childhood, and indeed beyond into adulthood. It is an enormous task; from memory, the number of children being studied approaches 14,000. There is something like an 80 per cent response from mothers and, in spite of what might be regarded as intrusive questions in the light of previous comments, even DNA samples of the babies are being collected-willingly.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="100309100000021"></a>Born in Bradford is seeking to tie together medical, social and cultural factors that affect health and well-being. The premise behind it, which came up in all the applications for funding from the project, is that what happens to us in the womb and in the first couple of years of life influences our health when we are 40, 60 and way beyond. Trying to measure social deprivation is much harder, however, in minority ethnic groups. Assuming that the amendment goes through, the Secretary of State will need to take account of that. Ninety-five per cent of white mothers know their partner's income but only 65 per cent of south Asian mothers do, and this skews the information. Born in Bradford is exploring other ways of measuring poverty, including looking at perceived poverty, but better measurements are needed.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="100309100000022"></a>At the heart of our concern is the fact that poor maternal nutrition, pre-conception and post-conception, substantially increases the risk of poor cognitive abilities and serious brain disorders in the lives of many children. The unemployment benefit for women aged 18 to 25 is £50.95, and if she eats according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation minimum standards, which the noble Lord, Lord Freud, has already mentioned, she will spend £43 of this on food, leaving less than £8 for fuel, clothing and other necessities. That is the reality today. The value of this unemployment benefit has not increased in real terms since 1980. There has almost certainly been an increase in the proportion of ill people since then, and it has been costing the taxpayer billions through the National Health Service, through our schools and through the administration of justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="100309100000023"></a>A few weeks ago, fortuitously, Sir Michael Marmot produced his report on health inequalities. He recommended that we give priority to prenatal and postnatal intervention that reduces adverse outcomes from pregnancy and infancy, that we establish a minimum income for the health of all people and that we reduce the social gradient in the standards of living through changes in fiscal policy. The report included a rather scary graph that showed that bright ladies who were rich and did well intellectually would continue to do well intellectually as they grew older; those who were

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="100309100000024"></a>I mentioned this in my maiden speech so I hope that noble Lords will bear with me, but about three years ago I visited a school that has since become an academy, thanks to the funding that is available. I was there for prize-giving. The school served a particularly socially deprived, predominantly white area of Bradford. The then head teacher said to me, "Just look at the size of these children. They are all smaller than average. They are also underdeveloped intellectually, emotionally, socially and spiritually". I could see in those people-in the girls particularly, obviously-that the future cycle of deprivation and underachievement was simply going to continue in the lives of the people of a city that has among the highest levels of social deprivation. That is why I support Amendment 23.</p>

Amendment 23 asks the Government to commission research into minimum household income. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and my noble friend are aware that considerable research on this has already been published, mainly from three sources-we are awaiting the Bradford study. Those sources are the Family Budget Unit of the University of York, the Loughborough University Centre for Research in Social Policy and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where this work was initiated by the late Professor Jerry Morris. Because they all use slightly different methods of calculating minimum income standards, the recommendations from the three units are somewhat different. However, in one respect they all agree, which is that the incomes that they recommend are well above current benefit levels, some of which are extremely low and only just above subsistence level.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="100309111000002"></a>It is not sufficient, as other noble Lords have said, in the 21st century, simply to use scales which cover subsistence living costs. Certain additional items are necessary for people, especially families with children, to engage in society and live healthy social lives as well as physically healthy lives. They may need items such as refrigerators, which are actually owned by 80 per cent of the population now. Of course, 50 years ago it was not an item which would be thought of to be included in minimum income. In addition there are other domestic hardware items, possibly a television, some components of travel costs, and other social necessities to help people engage in life, or lead a "dignified" life, as the noble Lord has put it, as was said in Germany.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="100309111000003"></a>All these matters must be taken into account, and I think the Government do that to some extent, but not in a systematic way, when setting the level of benefits. The Government should work with the existing research units to achieve a consensus level of what is required, perhaps setting up a co-ordinating unit within the

As the right reverend Prelate has said, this would be particularly relevant today in the month after the publication of the Marmot report, which gives a detailed account of the persistence of inequalities in health in the UK. The important finding in all of Professor Marmot's work is that there is a continuous gradient throughout the social spectrum. A basic first step must be to ensure that support levels are more than just adequate; they must be sufficient to enable the poorest to engage in society so as to move up the poverty inequality scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="100309111000005"></a>I have just a couple of points. First, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that my understanding is that if he moves a vote on the first amendment, Amendment 11, that also brigades with it the other two amendments; and were he to be successful and the other two amendments were to be passed as well, that would be very interesting because together they would be very high-cost. Normally where amendments are grouped, the first one is regarded as trailing to the other two, and therefore carrying the other two. I merely put that to him. He would have to make that very clear; otherwise there may be some difficulties.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="100309111000006"></a>The second point is to the noble Lord, Lord Freud, who quoted, very interestingly, the German supreme court or high court about a "dignified" existence.</p>

The noble Lord will know that both benefits and taxes within the EU are ring-fenced and are therefore not available because, clearly, there would be huge implications for eastern Europe and everywhere else where benefit levels and so on are extremely low. What Germany is doing may be appropriate for Germany; I suspect it would have no implications at all for the rest of the EU unless individual member states choose to follow the same path, because benefits, as with taxes, are excluded from EU purview for obvious reasons.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="100309111000009"></a>I want to ask my noble friend a couple of questions, first, on Amendment 11. The noble Lord, Lord Freud, is correct to say that the diet of many young girls may be inadequate; they may only discover that they are pregnant quite late; and this may affect low birth weight. Traditionally, very low birth weight, below five pounds, has been associated with feeding and respiratory difficulties, vulnerability to summer diarrhoea, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="100309111000010"></a>In Committee, I suggested to my noble friend, and I had some support for this, that it would be useful to look at the possibility of breaking the Sure Start maternity grant, which I believe is about £600 now, into stages to assist with prenatal care to ensure that,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_185"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with help and guidance, it was diverted into good nutrition. Has my noble friend been able to do any further work on that? It seems to me that it is a nil cost budget item that could have useful implications for the dietary standards of those young women who realise, perhaps partway through their pregnancy, that they are indeed pregnant and that their diet so far has not helped ensure that they will have a normal weight child.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="100309111000011"></a>The second point is on the school dinners amendment, which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, would have spoken to had she been here. Again, I perfectly understand that this is a high budget item as far as my noble friend is concerned, and that the Government have made it clear that they will not go down the path of that amendment. However, in Committee, we sought to press my noble friend on the point that there are some lone parents who, as a result of the Government's own changes in the Welfare Reform Bill, will now find themselves entering the labour market not when their youngest child is 16, but when their youngest child is seven, and they may be doing work preparation even before that, from when their youngest child is three.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="100309111000012"></a>Particularly when their youngest child is seven, that lone parent may have two of her three children, say, above the age of primary school and in secondary school. My experience when working with lone parents in the past was that the single biggest tipping factor for lone parents trying to calculate the best-buy package of going into work or not was when they had two or probably three or more children, and some of those children were of secondary school age. The cost of school dinners, which at £10 per child, could be £30 a week or £40 a week for four children, was the tipping factor. Even though my right honourable friend the Secretary of State said in the other place that anybody going in to the labour market would be at least £40 a week better off in work, that can be completely wiped out by the cost of school dinners. Therefore there need be no actual gain, particularly for a large family.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="100309111000013"></a>My noble friend and the department ought to be congratulated on the strides that they are making regarding children in primary school. It is right to focus there because that is where most child development will occur. It is also the place where younger children can be encouraged strenuously into taking nourishing school dinners rather than relying on the chip shop's chips and fizz for their lunches in a way that older secondary school children may not be. None the less, there will be a cohort of lone parents coming into the labour market for the first time who will be exposing their children to this situation where they have not had the advantage and will not get the advantage of free school dinners for their older children. I wonder if my noble friend can help me on that cohort for at least the first year or two, so that we can ensure that the transition into the labour market is not at the cost of the financial well-being of some of the older children because that parent is having to pay a school dinner bill that she has never before had to address; and going into work will make her worse off.</p>

The amendments discuss the malnourishment of children. Today I attended the Westminster Health Forum, which looked at maternity services. Speaking to midwives with a great deal of experience, I was very concerned to hear from them about high levels of turnover among midwives; the lack of support for midwives; the lack of management of their case loads; and the difficulty that poses for continuity of care for parents. We know that the people who benefit most from continuity of care are those parents who are most vulnerable and in poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="100309111000016"></a>I believe this is of relevance to what we are discussing. If there is a good relationship with the midwife, she can advise the parents on good nutrition so that the foetus can be well nourished in the womb. She can also advise them on how to continue once the baby is born. Your Lordships will want to know that there is great concern about turnover among midwives. There is a need for more consistent support for midwives and to make sure that they do not get case loads that are too large for them to manage. It is so important to support parents well around the births of their children, particularly the parents we are talking about, who are living in poverty.</p>

Perhaps I can clarify what I understand to be the position should the noble Lord wish to press one of his amendments but not all those in the group. I understand that as long as he makes that clear when he does it, it will be in order. I am bound to say that I would discourage him from doing so, but-to be fair to the noble Lord-he should know what the rules are.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="100309111000018"></a>I start with Amendment 23. We had an interesting and wide-ranging debate in Committee on minimum income standards. As I said then, the Government welcome the research that has already been carried out on minimum income standards, such as that completed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the other research that my noble friend Lord Rea referred to. We continue to follow this research with interest. The Government consulted extensively on the most appropriate long-term measures of child poverty. Minimum income standards were ruled out because different research methods tend to make different assumptions and it is difficult to get one answer to the question, "How much is enough?". To be clear, the researchers themselves explicitly say that minimum income standards should not be treated as a poverty threshold.</p>

<a name="100309-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="100309111000019"></a>The latest research by the JRF, published in 2008 and updated in July 2009, is robust and I understand that it is also planning on updating this analysis. Requiring the Government to replicate this research, as this amendment does, is not a good use of government resources, particularly at this time. However, if in the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_187"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>future the JRF chose not to continue with this research, I am sure the Government would consider whether they could take it on. However, I agree with the noble Lord that minimum income standards are relevant to the discussion on poverty and standards of living. Consideration of minimum income standards must be balanced against other equally valid and important considerations-for example, labour market incentives and long-term sustainability. Therefore, I hope the noble Lord will not press Amendment 23, at least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="100309111000020"></a>Amendment 11 would require the commission to produce a report in respect of each calendar year, stating the number of malnourished children in the United Kingdom and an assessment of how the level of child poverty has influenced the number of malnourished children. The terms "malnourished" and "level of child poverty" are not defined in the amendment or the Bill, so it is not clear how the commission would go about assessing these levels. It is also not clear what the commission is to do with the report once it is drafted. Leaving these matters aside, like other noble Lords I have sympathy with the noble Lord's intention. The Government are clear that everyone should be able to choose and have reliable access to affordable, healthy and safe food. The barriers to accessing a healthy, sustainable diet are complex, but through initiatives like Healthy Start we are making sure that those on the lowest incomes can access healthy, nutritious food. As I said in Committee, there are other government programmes aimed at improving maternal nutrition, such as the health in pregnancy grant and the Sure Start maternity grant.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="100309111000021"></a>I think we dropped my noble friend Lady Hollis a line in response to her inquiry. The answer is that it is not possible to split the grant for the reasons that were set out in that letter, which I cannot immediately bring to mind. I will follow up and write to my noble friend.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="100309111000024"></a>The Marmot review, to which several noble Lords referred, considered these matters in some detail and the Government are now considering their response. Until that is set out, it is not appropriate to set out legislative duties in the Bill on issues of nutrition or minimum incomes. However, we support the necessity to consider diet and healthy eating in any effort to tackle child poverty. Health is a key building block that the Secretary of State is required to consider when developing the strategy, under Clause 8(5). Officials in the child poverty unit are working with colleagues across Whitehall, including those from the Department of Health, to explore the links between health inequalities and poverty as part of the work underpinning the child poverty strategy.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="100309111000025"></a>In considering Amendment 11 it is also important to note that inadequate income is one likely contributing factor to poor diets, but it is not the only one, since parents' spending decisions, knowledge about nutrition  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_188"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and access to affordable healthy food are also important. There is good research evidence to show that many poor parents go without an adequate diet themselves to ensure that their children have an adequate diet. This is a complex problem that requires well thought-out solutions that go beyond the scope of the Bill.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="100309111000026"></a>Returning to the amendment, I am not aware of a dataset that explicitly links child poverty to child nutrition. I do not know if the noble Lord, Lord Freud, with his great knowledge of these things, is aware of one; the Government certainly are not. It is likely that substantial further survey work would be needed to fulfil this amendment. This would be expensive and time-consuming for the commission to formulate and carry out, particularly on an annual basis. This would also significantly impinge on its independence. It might also divert the commission's limited time and financial resources away from other matters that it may wish to investigate and provide advice to the Secretary of State on. I am also not persuaded that elevating one issue over another is the right approach. If the amendment were made, there is a strong risk that the commission would have neither the time nor the resources available to look into matters other than child malnutrition. I do not think we want the commission to be tied down in this way.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="100309111000027"></a>Furthermore, if child poverty is seen as the major cause of malnutrition, as the amendment presumes, then the solution is surely to tackle child poverty and monitor and report on poverty levels annually, which is what the Bill sets out to do. This is not to say that the commission will not wish to consider these matters. Indeed, the Bill allows the commission to pursue an independent research agenda, but it should be for the commission to decide where to focus its research and analytical efforts. I hope I have demonstrated that overprescribing what the commission should do is not the best way forward and that the noble Lord will not press that amendment.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="100309111000028"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment 18. I recognise that several noble Lords have spoken to it, even though the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is unable to move it formally herself. The Government announced in the Pre-Budget Report in December that they would extend free school meals to primary school pupils in working families with an income of up to £16,190 in England from September 2010. Clause 25 was added to the Bill during Grand Committee. Although the Secretary of State proposes to make an order extending eligibility to children of primary school age, starting with those at key stage 1 or younger from September 2010 and rolling out to those at key stages 2 and 3 from September 2011, it would be possible to make further orders at some point in the future to extend eligibility to secondary school-age children, if it was felt appropriate. As my noble friend has acknowledged, this would not require further primary legislation.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="100309113000001"></a>As set out in the Pre-Budget Report, the Government chose to focus the available resources on primary school children rather than secondary school children. This is consistent with the strategy of early intervention having more impact on encouraging healthy eating habits, which are more likely to be carried on independently at secondary school. While I am sympathetic to the result that this amendment is seeking,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_189"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the cost of including secondary school children across the UK is of real substance. When fully rolled out in England alone, extending eligibility to primary school children in low-income working families will cost over £200 million a year. Any additional rollout would put significant additional new pressures on school budgets, which would have to be met from reducing other school services that are already committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="100309113000002"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that he was going to speak with all the passion he could muster and indeed he did; we know that he can muster considerable passion. He referred to Marmot, whose first recommendation was to give every child the best start in life. What happens during the early years, starting in the womb, has lifelong effects on many aspects of health and well-being from obesity, heart disease and mental health to educational achievement and economic status. A number of noble Lords, particularly the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bradford, covered that in their contributions, and we agree.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="100309113000003"></a>The right reverend Prelate spoke about the Born in Bradford work and research and, in a sense, endorsed the thrust of the Marmot recommendations. I make it clear to him that we want to challenge child poverty through a range of routes and specific targets, which the Secretary of State has a duty to meet over four areas, including material deprivation, which I will come back to. There is also the obligation to produce strategies, making sure that-so far as is practical-people do not suffer socio-economic disadvantage. I am sure that we are going to define that at a later stage.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="100309113000004"></a>A range of 21 issues in all, which academics have tried to identify as the dividing line between poor and non-poor families, determine how to look at material deprivation. This includes holidays away from home for at least one week, having family or friends around for a drink or meal at least once a month, two pairs of all-weather shoes for each adult, enough money to keep your home in a decent state of decoration, household contents insurance and a whole range of other things. If we are looking to make sure that we channel and tackle material deprivation then we are not just looking at subsistence levels of income for people; we are very clear about that.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="100309113000005"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, talked about midwives. The Government have been involved in a very substantial programme of training midwives. I am happy to write to him about that. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, pressed on the extension of eligibility for free school meals in the first years of secondary school. As I said a moment ago, the primary legislation will allow orders to be made to cover secondary school children. Also, given the lone-parent obligations-we are down to the youngest child being seven by October of this year-and the first tranche of the additional free-school meals support for primary schools kicking in in September, there is an alignment at least for those younger children in primary school. I understand the point that my noble friend makes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="100309113000006"></a>A number of noble Lords touched upon the Marmot review. We are working through that at the moment and considering how best to take forward its

My noble friend Lord Rea talked about the breadth of the research. I hope that I have been able to address each of the points that noble Lords have made. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, is keen to press his amendment. I have tried to point out-not just by relying on the technicalities-that it is quite difficult to accept it in its current form. He might not wish to press it tonight. I am very happy without commitment to have a discussion with him away from the sitting this evening. The matter is up to him. On the basis that it is defective, I hope he will not press the amendment.</p>

It has been a high-quality debate. I apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. I tabled Amendment 11 at the close of business on Friday. There was some confusion about how it relates to Amendment 23. Amendment 23 is not consequential on Amendment 11; I should have made that clear at the beginning and maybe tabled the amendment earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="100309113000008"></a>I understand that Amendment 23 is a bridge too far for the Government; Amendment 11 is not a bridge too far for anybody. It is a serious mistake. Over the next 10 years, Marmot and all that will indicate that malnutrition and low-weight intergenerational transmission of poverty will become a much bigger factor than it is today. I am confidant about that. People outside this place often wonder, if you make speeches with passion, what the devil it means merely to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the debate. We have won the argument this afternoon. I am prepared to take my chances in the Lobbies. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100309113000009"></a><b><a name="100309-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100309113000234"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, we are now venturing into a Dadaesque land of the absurd. There are two Bills before the House using the expression "socio-economic disadvantage". Unfortunately, neither defines the term and the responsible Ministers in both Houses have made a virtue of this fact. The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="100309113000043"></a>"We want socio-economic disadvantage to be considered in a common-sense manner in a way that is relevant to each public body's functions".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/1/10; col. 328.]</p>

<p><a name="100309113000033"></a>The Minister told us that in the context of this Bill it relates to,</p>
<ul><a name="100309113000045"></a>"a child's access to material and social resources, and their ability to participate in society".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/10; col. GC 182.]</ul>
<p><a name="100309113000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, told us:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="100309113000044"></a>"It is partly about basic inequality-that is straight poverty-but it is also about the lack of aspirations and expectations and about the complex interplay of factors such as health, housing, education and family background that so often combine to keep people in poverty and limit their chances of upward ... mobility".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/1/10; col. 328.]</p>

<p><a name="100309113000035"></a>I thought that we were writing law here and I am baffled as to how such a portmanteau definition as this can really be pinned down.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="100309113000010"></a>Let us say that I am a local official on whom the duty of ensuring that children do not suffer socio-economic disadvantage is imposed. What do I do? I know that I will be reading guidance notes until the end of time because the guide warns me to expect that, but how do I defend myself against the accusation of dereliction? Can I say that I thought that I had reduced socio-economic disadvantage enough-but what is enough? How do I set the duty of reduction against other priorities that might be pressing on me, such as getting a piece of infrastructure built to time and budget? How many forms will I have to fill in to make sure that the buck does not stop with me? How many boxes should I tick? How much case law will I have to study to see how the courts interpret "socio-economic" in the common-sense manner that the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, is so confident that they will? I have noticed that one man's common sense is often another's madness.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="100309113000011"></a>Therefore, in this amendment I am seeking to pin down what we mean by "socio-economic disadvantage". It seems to me that we are developing a body of indicators about child well-being that may serve the function very well. These are the UNICEF measures of well-being. If we use these as a base, we can assess whether child well-being in the widest possible sense is improving. We can measure our performance and we can target specific actions to improve that performance.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="100309113000012"></a>If we combine poverty and child well-being measures, as this amendment suggests, we will really start to get a handle on the problem. This is particularly important because, according to Professor Jonathan Bradshaw of the University of York, we are simply not getting the outcomes in terms of child well-being that our relatively high expenditure on children should obtain. In simple words, we seem to be wasting a lot of the money devoted to our children. The combination

<ul><a name="100309113000046"></a>"the child poverty rate explains only about 30 per cent of the variation in overall wellbeing".</ul>
<p><a name="100309113000036"></a>He concludes that,</p>
<ul><a name="100309113000047"></a>"the relative child poverty rate which has been adopted by the EU as the only child related primary or secondary indicator of social inclusion is not adequate to represent variations in child well-being across the EU25",</ul>
<p><a name="100309113000037"></a>and that a multidimensional index is likely to be the best approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="100309113000013"></a>The sad truth is that we do not seem to be doing well on these measures of well-being. The Government may be reluctant to accept the UNICEF-style well-being assessment because they have done so badly on this measure-as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, reminded us earlier this evening. Though the Minister defended the Government's record by arguing that the data were old, the 2007 UNICEF table of 21 rich countries makes sorry reading. We are not half way down these tables; we seem to come out bottom on virtually every measure, including family and peer relationships, behaviours and risk, and subjective well-being. That means our kids feel more miserable than anyone else's. We are only just off the bottom-18th-in education and material well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="100309113000014"></a>If we want specific goals to tackle socio-economic disadvantage, let us start here. That is my common-sense definition of the term. Perhaps the Minister will tell me I am mad. I beg to move.</p>

I too am somewhat concerned about the meaning of "socio-economic disadvantage", particularly because it does not appear in the interpretation in Clause 17-that is, page 10 of the Bill-where a lot of phrases are interpreted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="100309113000016"></a>"Socio-economic" comes through both parts of the Bill, not only the first part. There is the UK strategy in Clause 8(2)(b), that children,</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="100309113000017"></a>The UK strategy in Clause 8(5) deals with matters such as financial support and the,</p>
<ul><a name="100309113000049"></a>"development of the skills of parents ... health, education, childcare and social services, and ... housing, the built or natural environment and the promotion of social inclusion".</ul>
<p><a name="100309113000038"></a>It worries me that it is not at all clear what "socio-economic disadvantage" means. It seems it means something to do with the deprivation of those matters under Clause 8(5). I respectfully recommend that the Minister at least considers putting in the phrase "socio-economic disadvantage" as part of the interpretation of Part 1 and possibly in Part 2. Then at least those who work with this Bill when it becomes law know what it is they have to target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="100309113000019"></a>We have a tendency in this House and the other place of using jargon. For example, when the financial crisis came up, everybody spoke about "sub-prime lending". If they had just said "bad debt", everybody would have known. The dogs in the street would have known but we do not say that. It seems we have in-words so that we can understand. We know what we are talking about but no one else does. If we are trying to reach the poorest of the poor in our communities then we had best use language that is understood, or how can they know that they are the ones we are trying to help?</p>

On the point of the noble Lord, Lord Martin, and the need to talk to people in language that they understand, he is absolutely right about engaging with people in their terms. We are dealing here with a specific term in a piece of legislation. Not many people are going to go back to the source of the primary legislation. The fact that one wants to and should engage with people in their terms is not of itself inconsistent with having legalese or particular provisions in a piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="100309113000021"></a>This is again about seeking to define "socio-economic disadvantage". The noble Lord's suggestion is that we should add to that term, so that it,</p>
<ul><a name="100309113000050"></a>"is not limited to financial considerations and must, in particular, have regard to international definitions of child well-being".</ul>
<p><a name="100309113000039"></a>We debated at length in Committee the use of "socio-economic disadvantage" as it appears in Clause 8(2)(b). Frankly, I thought I made a good attempt then to clarify what we understood the term to mean and why putting more specific wording in the Bill was not helpful. Clearly I have not been wholly successful in doing that so will try again this afternoon.</p>

<a name="100309-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="100309113000022"></a>In doing this, I refer noble Lords to the discussion on the Equality Bill, to which the noble Lord, Lord Freud, referred. In Committee on that Bill, a similar amendment was tabled that sought to compel a definition of socio-economic disadvantage to be placed in the Bill. My noble friend Lady Royall explained in Committee what the Government meant by the term. My script says I should repeat her words. Given that the noble Lord has pre-empted me on that I do not propose to do so but what my noble friend said on that Bill holds true for this one. Although noble Lords will appreciate the slight difference in context, the concept is clear.</p>

As I previously said, in preparing her strategy the Secretary of State will be obliged to consider the measures necessary in each of the areas set down in Clause 8(5) for the dual purposes of complying with the duties in Clause 1, ensuring as far as possible that children in the UK do not experience socio-economic disadvantage.</p>

While it is true that the targets focus on income poverty-although I contend that the combined low-income and material deprivation target is broader than that-we have always been clear that the Bill is concerned not only with tackling low incomes but with improving child well-being and ensuring a sustainable end to child poverty.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="100309113000025"></a>As required by Clause 8, the UK child poverty strategy will drive further action to tackle child poverty across the building blocks. The action will include measures to enhance child well-being; to support parents to undertake their role as well as possible, enabling children to stay safe and supported; to improve the quality of services and space in neighbourhoods so that children can thrive in safe and cohesive communities; to ensure that all children live in decent housing; and to narrow the educational attainment gap for disadvantaged children. Those of you who attended the mini-seminar that we organised a few weeks ago will know that officials in the child poverty unit are already doing a huge amount of work to consider how action in each of these areas can help to tackle child poverty. We expect to set out more details of our analysis in a strategic direction paper that we hope to publish shortly.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="100309113000026"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that our approach in Clause 8(5) of naming specific policy areas that must be considered in a UK child poverty strategy is a more effective way of illustrating the broad approach that we expect this strategy to take than that proposed by the amendment. Adding a formal definition to the Bill in the way that this amendment proposes could have a detrimental effect and lead to an inflexible interpretation of socio-economic disadvantage, which could hinder the Secretary of State in preparing strategy.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="100309113000027"></a>This is particularly the case with the amendment, which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="100309113000051"></a>"international definitions of child well-being",</ul>
<p><a name="100309113000040"></a>without being clear what is meant by this. There is no universally agreed, unique definition of child well-being, as reports from the Children's Society and the OECD acknowledge. International reports, such as the ones from UNICEF and the OECD, use a multidimensional approach to measure well-being, which varies between reports. As there is no agreed definition of measuring well-being, either internationally or domestically, it would not be possible to incorporate such definitions in a meaningful way. The absence of an agreed international definition would cause great ambiguity in defining the purposes of a child poverty strategy.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="100309113000028"></a>The noble Lord referred to UNICEF's index of well-being. As I mentioned, it uses data that are very out of date. The report fails to register significant progress in key areas, such as improved provision of universal childcare, reductions in the rate of teenage conceptions, improved educational attainment, reduced risk of accidental injury and a falling infant mortality rate. Therefore, for the reasons that I have set out, it is not necessary to define socio-economic disadvantage in legislation. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

As she said, this term should be included in the interpretation. The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Martin, is equally powerful. Here we have a declaratory Bill that uses words that most of the people whom it aims to help will not understand. That would seem to defeat the purpose.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="100309113000030"></a>There is a fundamental issue. The Minister said that defining the term could hinder the Secretary of State. The other way of looking at that is that the Secretary of State can interpret it in any way she wants. If she does, it becomes an irrelevant requirement because the term is undefined. It reads well to some people-although not to the people whom the noble Lord, Lord Martin, is concerned about-but most will say that it does not impose any duty on anyone because it is an uninterpreted term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="100309113000031"></a>When the Minister leans on the crutch of his defence for our poor showing in the UNICEF tables, I remind him that a leading authority in the area, Professor Jonathan Bradshaw, observed that the data were out of date, but that we had a very long way to go and he was waiting to see whether we would improve. One can read a tone of some doubt in what he wrote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="100309129000002"></a>I listened with interest to arguments put forward in Committee, particularly by the noble Lords, Lord Freud and Lord Northbourne-the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is unable to be with us today-on the impact that improving parenting skills and promoting parental support can make in tackling child poverty and disadvantage. Noble Lords were concerned that the Bill concentrated too much on the provision of financial support and improving job skills for parents, and not enough on the wider role that parents must play in their children's lives, and on the wider support that government can offer to parents. The Government recognise the important role of parents, and are committed to strengthening parental engagement. There is a range of help available to parents to support them in developing better parenting skills and stronger relationships. I will describe some of these programmes in a moment.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_197"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="100309129000003"></a>Family support had been included as a distinct building block in the consultation document <I>Ending Child Poverty:</I><I></I><I>Making it Happen</I>. It stated that the Government are committed to,</p>
<ul><a name="100309129000094"></a>"supporting parents to undertake their role as well as possible, whether they are living together or apart, by reducing the pressure on families and strengthening their capabilities, and ensuring children can stay safe and supported within their families".</ul>
<p><a name="100309129000085"></a>However, family support was not included in the Bill as we considered that it was implicitly covered by health, education, childcare and social services; and by the promotion of social inclusion. Nevertheless, I am now persuaded that support for parents should be explicitly stated in the Bill, and I am delighted to move the amendment. I also reassure noble Lords that the work under way to develop the first child poverty strategy is already considering support for parental skills and engagement with families.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="100309129000004"></a>I turn first to the provision of information, advice and assistance to parents. The Government are committed to increasing the capabilities of parents and to reducing the pressures on their relationships and parenting capacities. It is crucial that parents are able to provide a caring and nurturing environment for children, to ensure their healthy physical, social and emotional development and to promote good behaviour. Current programmes, such as the Family Information Direct programme and the <I>21st Century School Parent Guarante</I><I>e</I>, aim to deliver readily available information and support to parents, to help them to improve their capabilities and to become more involved in their children's learning and development. We also make it clear that firm and effective action must be taken to challenge poor or inadequate parenting, which has serious consequences for children and communities. The <I>Families and Relationships</I> Green Paper also focuses on enabling families to help themselves through a range of support.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="100309129000005"></a>The second part of the amendment concerns the promotion of parenting skills. As I said in Committee, there is strong evidence to show that policies aimed at developing parenting skills can improve children's lives. We know that the home environment and the influence of parents are crucial factors in determining children's aspirations and outcomes. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, who said in Committee that we must treat parents as partners if we are to achieve the goals of the Bill.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="100309129000006"></a>Government amendment 15, which also relates to the strategy, requires the Secretary of State to identify groups of children that appear to be at greater risk of living in socio-economic disadvantage and to consider the likely impact of any proposed measure in the policy areas listed in Clause 8 (5) on children within these groups.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="100309129000007"></a>In Grand Committee, Peers from all parties argued that the provisions on the child poverty strategy should be amended so that the needs of the most vulnerable groups should be addressed more explicitly. Without such a measure, Peers considered, there may be a risk that the strategy would focus on those children easiest to lift out of poverty and socio-economic disadvantage, leaving the most vulnerable groups behind.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_198"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="100309129000008"></a>I reiterate that it is not the Government's intention to prioritise action on those children who are easier to lift out of poverty and ignore the needs of the most vulnerable. Our goal is to eradicate poverty for all children, and the framework established in the Bill supports that. Nevertheless, I was persuaded that an amendment which explicitly addressed the needs of vulnerable children would strengthen that framework. </p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="100309129000009"></a>The amendment would work because it requires the Secretary of State to consider which groups of children in the UK appear to be disproportionately affected by socio-economic disadvantage. I expect that these children will be identified through the analysis of <I>Households Below Average Income</I> data. Peers will recall that I explained in Committee that it is technically very difficult to state definitively in the Bill, or in regulations, which groups should be specifically considered. Indeed, a list would inevitably leave out some at-risk groups, and over time those most at risk of poverty may change and we do not want to exclude groups. The amendment avoids stating a list, thus providing greater flexibility over time to identify those groups of children as being vulnerable to poverty. It requires that policy measures across the different building blocks listed in subsection (5) are analysed in terms of their likely impact on the identified vulnerable groups.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="100309129000010"></a>The Bill requires that the strategy is revised and republished every three years until 2020. Each successive strategy will examine and evaluate the evidence of the impact previous measures have had on child poverty as this will have implications for what future action is needed. I look forward to hearing from the noble Lord, Lord Freud, on Amendment 14 which we shall of course support. I beg to move.</p>

On Amendment 15, we know that the group most at risk of socio-economic disadvantage are large families, families with a disabled child or adult, lone parent households, families with young children and some black and minority ethnic groups. This amendment should provide a mechanism to target the at-risk groups in each of the UK strategies and allow decisions to be made on the basis of whether they will help children within those groups in the long term.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="100309129000012"></a>The End Child Poverty campaign is also pleased that these amendments have been tabled, but makes the point that particular children who should be considered as disproportionately affected by socio-economic disadvantage, according to the most up-to-date evidence, should be clearly outlined in the child poverty strategies. It also wonders how the amendment will work in practice and whether the process will be set out in the strategies. I think the Minister has already answered some of the campaign's questions. Presumably the strategies will include an assessment of whether certain measures have had the predicted impact on children in the at-risk groups and what the implications are for future measures to tackle child poverty. It will be a real step forward to be able to identify which levers work best, and why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="100309129000013"></a>Amendment 14 is more problematical. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said in Grand Committee that the addition of the words "and mental" to define "health" so that it clearly included mental health was a wise precaution, but the amendment means that it would never again be safe to use the word "health" in legislation without defining it as including both physical and mental health. My noble friend Lady Walmsley commented in broadly the same way in Grand Committee. We on these Benches have highlighted mental health on all possible occasions, so we thoroughly agree with the sentiment behind the amendment. However do we really want to say that from now on "health" cannot be taken at face value to include both physical and mental health?</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="100309129000014"></a>On the same theme, on the fourth day in Committee, 27 January, the Minister spoke about the review of ways in which it might be possible to reduce the high levels of worklessness among people with a mental health condition which was published in December 2009. Is he able to say when we can expect the Government's response to be published? I think I may have jumped the gun a bit because the noble Lord has not yet spoken to his amendment but it is difficult when one amendment is sandwiched between two others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="100309129000016"></a>Amendment 14 might seem a very small point, but this is a declaratory Bill and I feel that it is important to get the message out that the Secretary of State is taking support for mental health as seriously as for physical health. Similarly, I am appreciative of Government amendment 13. Since Grand Committee I have had the opportunity to learn more about the thinking of the Government's Child Poverty Unit, and I am not now surprised that we have consensus on this issue. Labour and the Conservatives might continue to disagree on the importance of stable, two-parent households to a child's well-being, but at least we share the same concern for the relationship between the parents and the child. Explicitly allowing for attention to be given to parenting skills will be a useful addition to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="100309129000017"></a>We support Amendment 15, too, as a useful reminder for the Government to keep their focus on those children who most need support. Despite my continuing reservations about the imprecision of the term "socio-economic disadvantage"-which we have perhaps discussed enough-I appreciate the Minister's attempts to meet our concerns about the need to ensure that those groups of children particularly at risk of poverty and material deprivation are given proper attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="100309129000018"></a>By identifying and focusing on the types of household which are most at risk of suffering material deprivation, the Government will, we hope, be led to consider and address the causes, not the symptoms, of poverty. As I have repeatedly said during these debates, it is not enough to stick a plaster over the difficulties experienced

Subject to the little point about socio-economic disadvantage, from which I do not resile, the concept of both amendments seems entirely appropriate and adds enormously to this clause. It is very comforting to see the support around the House for these government amendments. The strategies are well set out. The only issue is the implementation, which we shall all watch with great interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="100309129000021"></a>I totally understand the point the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, is making that if you have the word "health" you always have to have "mental and physical". I would have said of course you do not but, as the noble Lord, Lord Freud, said, the Bill is setting out policy. The mental health of children, especially children in socio-economically disadvantaged households, as we in this House would understand it, requires careful attention. If mental health issues are not met at an early stage, identified and dealt with, those children will have a less good life-not only because they are in poor households but with the added disadvantage of unmet mental health issues. That includes problems with education, exclusion and, perhaps more importantly for the community at large, the greater likelihood of not being able to get a job and of a proportion of them-I am not saying by any means all of them-ending up in the criminal sector.</p>

<a name="100309-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="100309129000022"></a>If their problems could be met at an early stage, if their families could be helped by the provision of information, advice and assistance-which is admirable-those children would have a chance to lead a normal, sensible life with greater opportunity to be good citizens. There are children with huge mental disadvantages who need help as much as children with physical disabilities. I am delighted that that provision is to be included, because mental health is a serious issue and one that we must emphasise in this sort of Bill-but not throughout every government Bill.</p>

In brief response to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, provision will be dealt with through the strategy. The Secretary of State is required to identify measures to support those people. Of course, there is not only the strategy but the annual report that will flow from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="100309129000024"></a>On timing and our response to the mental health and employment issues, I fear that I must write to the noble Baroness; I do not have specifics to hand on that. As I said, I am happy to accept the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Freud. I share some of the reservations about specifically identifying mental health. Our starting position was that health should cover mental as well as physical health, but the consensus

The Minister argued that he could not see,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="100309129000026"></a>That, in a nutshell, is the difference between the Government and us on the amendment. A Bill aiming to achieve a particular end should ensure that it does not create obvious damage elsewhere. Furthermore, the protections should be contained in the Bill that could do the damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="100309129000027"></a>Although it is not an exact precedent, I think it is instructive to look at a similar situation in the Equality Bill. Clause 148 mentions treating some persons more favourably than others-an analogous situation to the Bill in its objective to help households with children. It then includes a protection against conduct otherwise prohibited in this Act-effectively a protection for unfavoured groups. That is exactly what I am aiming to do here and why the Bill is the appropriate place for the protection.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="100309129000028"></a>Let me summarise why this is an important issue. A statutory target will create pressure to divert resources in a particular direction: households with children. Indeed, that is the specific intention. Clearly the Government can hardly be concerned if those resources are raised out of the economy as a whole. They should, however, be concerned if those resources are derived by reducing resources available to other poor people.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="100309129000029"></a>The figures suggest that that is exactly what has been happening as a result of the child poverty target. I remind noble Lords of the figures from the House of Commons Library that I cited in Grand Committee. In 2007-08, the minimum support for a childless couple was 32 per cent below the poverty definition used in the Bill-60 per cent of the median income line. That compares with a figure of only 4 per cent for households of a lone parent with one child.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="100309129000030"></a>That has happened because, over the years, income support for children has risen much more rapidly than benefit levels for adults. That is a particularly dangerous trend because single adults and childless couples become parents, and the effects of previous poverty will tend to have pernicious, long-run effects on their children. Indeed, there is an immediate issue, which we have debated, of the deleterious effect of poor maternal nutrition on newly pregnant females who will be subsisting on income 22 per cent below the poverty line if they are reliant on benefit and it will be their first child.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="100309129000031"></a>I remind noble Lords of the conclusion drawn about the problem by the Rowntree report, in its publication, <I>Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion 2009</I>. It stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="100309129000092"></a>"The argument for the much bigger rises in child benefits acknowledges no external point of reference other than the need to progress towards the child poverty goal as 'cheaply' as possible. Given the historically unprecedented differential between child and adult benefits that now prevails, this is just no longer enough. Instead, we have to look at the system of social security benefits in the round and decide how their values should stand in relation to one another".</p>

<p><a name="100309129000032"></a>I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="100309129000033"></a><b><a name="100309-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100309129000114"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Freud, has raised a very interesting question, which goes back to a much earlier debate in Committee about what weight we put on individual members of the family in calculating overall benefit. He is absolutely right to say that younger single people-single people of working age-have, relatively speaking, a poorer level of benefit than almost anyone else.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="100309129000034"></a>Why is that? It is because the Government, from the beginning in 1997, has been concentrating on three strategies. The first was to help to lift pensioners out of poverty; and pensioners are no longer poorer than anyone else in society. The second was to tackle child poverty, especially through tax credits, which can compensate in a way that wages cannot for family size. The Government have been able to support children in poverty. The third was people with disabilities. Although that may not have gone as far as many of us would wish, none the less, the disability living allowance, introduced by a previous Government but built on by this one, together with additional disability benefits, has helped most disabled people out of poverty.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="100309129000035"></a>Across society, I think that that leaves only single people of working age who have not had a similar

It is because, if they are not disabled, there is every assumption that the best strategy to help them out of poverty is to help them into the labour market. The Government's whole strategy, from Jobcentre Plus onwards through the New Deals, and so on, has been to help those people into the labour market. The noble Lord himself said earlier that a pound earned for yourself is of far more value than a pound received from benefit. That is what the government strategy has been and I am sure it is the right one. Those who are dependent, rightly so, on the state-whether they are children, or pensioners or have disabilities-have had the upliftings of benefit. Those most able to help themselves, quite rightly, have had the support of the Government to help them to re-enter the labour market. That surely is the right strategy for the Government to employ.</p>

The amendment requires that, in preparing the UK strategy, the Secretary of State must consider the impact that any measure taken will have on "other people" in poverty.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="100309129000037"></a>We debated this amendment at Committee, as the noble Lord acknowledged. As I said then, it cannot be the remit of the child poverty strategy to consider the impact of every proposed measure on other groups that may be living in poverty. However, the Secretary of State will not be able to take policy and spending decisions on measures to prevent and tackle child poverty in isolation. Indeed, such decisions will be taken in the round and through prioritisation at key fiscal events, including the Pre-Budget and Budget Reports, and Departmental Spending Reviews. This addresses the issues and strategies that my noble friend Lady Hollis referred to.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="100309129000038"></a>In addition, the Bill already includes a better safeguard than the noble Lord proposed in his amendment. Clause 15 requires the likely impact of any measure on the economy and on taxation, public spending and public borrowing to be taken into account by the Secretary of State when preparing a UK strategy and by the commission when considering any advice to be given to the Secretary of State or the devolved Administrations. The effect is to require the commission and UK, Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers to have regard to budgetary constraints and value for money in developing and advising on strategies. This will necessarily need to balance the impact of any measures on other policy areas and priority groups. I hope the noble Lord is reassured by this.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="100309129000039"></a>However, I make no apologies that this Bill aims to tackle child poverty and focuses firmly on measures aimed directly at the child, putting their needs first. Requiring in law that the child poverty strategy must consider every impact on every "other group" would be the wrong approach and would not help us to reach our goal of ending child poverty. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, drove at those when she discussed the implications of the working of the poverty trap.

I am not quite sure I understand the distinction. For all groups, that argument basically works: if you have no money, you are incentivised to go into the labour market. That might be true-it is a question of degree and where you draw the line. We spent a lot time discussing that.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="100309129000043"></a>The issue that I am most concerned about in this area involves young people who are least supported, and particularly young girls. We go straight back to the maternal nutrition argument and the argument that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord Rea, made earlier that nutrition at the point of conception and even pre-conception matters so much for the development of the child. If we get a badly imbalanced benefits system, which is what the Rowntree Foundation is telling us we have now got, we are building problems in that area for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="100309129000044"></a>I cannot accept the Minister's assurance that the protection for this is in Clause 15. That talks about the impact on the economy as a whole, not on any poor groups within it. I do not think we have a defence for this. If we do not have a defence here we will not have a defence and the likelihood is that the trend we are already seeing, which is to get a more and more unbalanced benefits system, is likely to be locked in. With that warning, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

There are two reasons for bringing forward this further renewal order. First, we are committed to achieving our target of 30 per cent Catholic composition and, secondly, appointments from the latest campaign and outstanding appointments from earlier campaigns ought to be made on the same basis and under the same provisions.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="100309129000051"></a>As many of the noble Lords are aware, the temporary provisions have been debated extensively both here and in another place on numerous occasions. Indeed, this is the third renewal of these provisions. However, much has changed since the first renewal in 2004. At that time, some elements of Northern Ireland's community remained uncommitted, unsupportive and unco-operative with the police service. Today, the climate is noticeably different. All main parties support policing and the rule of law and we all look forward to 12 April when the final piece of the devolution jigsaw will fall into place and policing and justice transfers to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="100309129000052"></a>The Government are committed to the need for this legislation. To drive forward the vision of policing with the community, the police service must have the confidence of the community and this requires the service to be reflective of the community. As the composition has changed, confidence in the police has increased. From a baseline of 72 per cent in 2003-04, 82.2 per cent of survey respondents today feel that the PSNI treats both communities equally. These temporary provisions are one of the most significant reasons why public confidence in policing is increasing across the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="100309129000053"></a>In the 16 competitions since the PSNI formed in 2001 there have been in excess of 107,000 applications from across the community. The latest campaign was launched on 14 January 2010, less than a week after the murderous attempt on Constable Peadar Heffron. When this campaign closed on 12 February, there had been 9,008 applications. This is a clear indication that the work of a minority who are attempting to disrupt the peace process is not accepted by the majority of people in Northern Ireland, who are intent on making it work.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="100309129000054"></a>The first new recruits joined the PSNI in November 2001. They joined a service that was only 8.3 per cent Catholic. Today, thanks to the temporary recruitment provisions, the Catholic composition in the PSNI stands at 27.88 per cent, and 3,807 young men and women have been appointed to the PSNI. They have helped to bring about tremendous change to policing in Northern Ireland, making the PSNI a world-renowned police service.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="100309129000055"></a>It is clear that the temporary provisions are achieving their aim of a more representative police service within a limited timescale. I acknowledge that certain noble Lords remain opposed to these measures, but I believe that the benefits that these provisions have had on increasing Catholic composition, as well as the positive impact on increasing community confidence in policing, justify the continuation of the provisions for a final year.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="100309129000056"></a>I of course sympathise with individuals who, although qualified, have not been appointed as a direct consequence of the temporary provisions. In the first 14 competitions, there were 88,822 applications; 10,854 reached the merit pool, and 3,749 were appointed. Of the 7,105 who were not appointed, only 984 were unsuccessful because of 50:50. The rest would not have been appointed, regardless of 50:50, as they did not score highly enough in the merit pool. In other words, less than 3 per cent of all non-Catholic applications have been affected by these measures.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="100309129000057"></a>The community in Northern Ireland is becoming increasingly diverse. The PSNI has implemented a number of outreach measures that are aimed at encouraging recruits from ethnic minority backgrounds, including attendance at community events such as the Belfast Mela. There are currently 32 ethnic minority officers in the PSNI from a variety of backgrounds, including Indian, Chinese and black Caribbean. This represents 0.44 per cent of the regular officers: a figure that is comparable with the overall level of the working age ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland, which is 0.48 per cent. The proportion of females in the PSNI has also increased significantly since 2001. At the time of the Patten report, female composition stood at just 12.6 per cent. Today, it is 24.87 per cent. The gender action plan will ensure that measures are put in place to retain these female officers and monitor their progression through the ranks.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="100309129000058"></a>The increase in composition of all these under-represented groups is to be welcomed. A more representative police service will assist the PSNI to engage consistently and effectively with all sections of the community, thus helping officers to solve crimes and keep our communities safe. The renewal order

However, the Government are committed to returning to Parliament to end the provisions at whatever point in the year it is clear that we shall reach the 30 per cent target.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="100309129000059"></a>As we look forward to a new future in Northern Ireland, following the vote in the Assembly this afternoon, with all sides working together constructively, it is important that the temporary provisions are continued for a final year. This will ensure that the Government's target of 30 per cent Catholic composition is achieved and that the new Northern Ireland has a police service that works with and for the community. I beg to move.</p>

She has significantly broadened this debate, as I had hoped. This might not happen tonight, but she has opened the doors on several fronts. First, I associate myself with her comments on the anniversary of the deaths of Stephen Carroll and the two soldiers at Massereene. That was a terrible time, but sadly this is still going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="100309129000061"></a>On the vote today, my party and I are absolutely delighted that the issue of policing and justice has been brought to a conclusion, but had we not had the interference of Americans and goodness knows who else, and had the Secretary of State behaved very differently-he tried to bully us as well as everyone else-we might have had a unified vote as opposed to a divided one. That was entirely down to Mr Woodward and his attitude and behaviour to Northern Ireland. He must be the worst Secretary of State in my 11 years here with whom I have ever had to deal. In fact, I have not had to deal with him because he does not speak to me. Those are my views on where we are. As I said, I am delighted, and so is my party, that we got there and that policing and justice have been devolved. I am disappointed that the vote was not 100 per cent for devolution, but it could have been in different circumstances. That is the frustration. I like perfection and I like things to be done well. This was not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="100309129000062"></a>My party entirely agrees with the renewing of the order for one more year. I believe that the noble Baroness will reassure us when she winds up the debate that it will be renewed for one year and only one year. Where has it left us? It has achieved a great deal. The PSNI-she gave us all the figures-is a very different force from the Royal Ulster Constabulary. However, it has suffered from a significant lack of experience and ground intelligence throughout the process and there is still a serious void in detectives to investigate and keep up with the ever increasing sophistication of the terrorists who still attempt to destroy our Province.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="100309129000063"></a>The other thing that needs to be noted and that should concern us is that almost as many Roman Catholics are leaving the service as are being recruited. That, too, is a very sad reflection on where we are. One recruit said a few months ago that he did not join the PSNI to be shot at. It was reported in the press that it was not the sort of job that he had expected when he

I have some sympathy with him, although I am not sure that I have a great deal, because that has been the nature of policing in Northern Ireland ever since time was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="100309129000064"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned diversity and ethnic minorities. She is right. The number of ethnic minority members has increased and they are playing an ever increasing part in the social structure and fabric of the Province. Most contribute extremely well, because they are great entrepreneurs. A large number of them are being supportive and helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="100309129000065"></a>To sum up, we are delighted that policing and justice have been devolved. We are prepared to agree to the Government extending the provisions for one more year and we hope that that will be the end of it. We hope that the PSNI will be able to hold its recruits for a little longer, however that needs to be done-whether through pay, training, accommodation or managing the areas in which they live. A lot of these people are very brave; they live in areas in which their enemies are down the road and are increasing. Overall, I support the order.</p>

Before I debate its merits or otherwise, I pay tribute, as others have done tonight, to the PSNI and in particular to all officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. We particularly remember Constable Stephen Carroll, who was murdered by dissident republicans in Craigavon on this day in March last year. We place on record our gratitude to the officers of the PSNI, who are doing so much to move policing forward in Northern Ireland in continually difficult circumstances.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="100309129000067"></a>We remember the Patten report and its recommendation that in order to address the religious imbalances in the police in Northern Ireland,</p>
<ul><a name="100309129000096"></a>"an equal number of Protestants and Catholics should be drawn from the pool of qualified candidates ... We believe that the ratio of recruits should be kept to 50:50, at least for the ten years of the model".</ul>
<p><a name="100309129000068"></a>That was implemented in Section 46 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. It is worth remembering what the Act said on the matter:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="100309129000093"></a>"In making appointments under section 39 on any occasion, the Chief Constable shall appoint from the pool of qualified applicants formed for that purpose by virtue of section 44(5) an even number of persons of whom one half shall be persons who are treated as Roman Catholic and one half shall be persons who are not so treated".</p>

<p><a name="100309129000069"></a>I remember that section well because it was the first time that I ever spoke on Northern Ireland matters in your Lordships' House. I had come from a background of working with the police in England and Wales, as a member and, latterly, chair of a police authority. I had no idea at all of the differences that I would find in the policing of Northern Ireland. I remember the late and much missed Lord Fitt-Gerry Fitt. He told me in no uncertain terms in this Chamber that I did not have the first idea how Northern Ireland was policed. He soon put me right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="100309129000070"></a>I also remember saying at the time that such a move as was being proposed could and should last for as short a time as possible. As we have seen over the

It was important at the time-and let us not forget that-to get the SDLP to join the Policing Board, but it has also caused great concern among the Protestant community. It even led to a High Court case from a Protestant applicant who, while being included in the pool of qualified candidates, was nevertheless not picked to go forward. The High Court subsequently upheld the 50:50 recruitment policy.</p>

<a name="100309-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="100309129000071"></a>The 50:50 recruitment provisions were initially implemented for three years, from 2001 to 2004, and the provisions were renewed in 2004 and 2007 for two further three-year periods. That made a total of nine years altogether. In 2007, these Benches told the Government that we would not support a further extension of three years for this provision, but that we would support an extension of one year, bringing the total length of time during which the provisions have been in place to 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="100309129000072"></a>We all want to see adequate representation of the Catholic community in the police, but this selection cannot go on for much longer. It has transformed the number of Catholics who have entered the police service and I hope sincerely that they will continue to join it. However, they still join with some trepidation and they have had to face extraordinarily difficult and sometimes dangerous forces not faced by the range of diversity within policing in other parts of this country. Their bravery in the face of sectarian and thuggish opposition to them taking their rightful place in helping to keep the peace in Northern Ireland for the whole community has been nothing short of heroic and I commend them for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="100309129000073"></a>As we have heard, in 2001 Catholic composition within the police service was 8.3 per cent. On 1 February this year it was 27.88 per cent. That is a quite remarkable turnaround and a major achievement. However, it must not stop there. Northern Ireland is becoming more diverse and we will be watching closely to see how that diversity is mirrored in its police service. In particular, we hope that the increase in the recruitment of female officers, from 13.3 per cent in 2001 to 24.87 per cent today, will continue.</p>

Its diversity strategy, <I>Policing a Shared Future, </I>is an impressive document, which rightly recognises that, as well as sectarianism, gender and race, the police must also address dependency, political opinion, sexual orientation, domestic violence, age and disability. It is, of course, important for anyone who has suffered from a hate crime to be confident that they can report it to a police service that is committed to promoting equality and diversity.</p>

As someone who believes passionately in equality, I think that it flies in the face of all my beliefs. I am not making a sectarian point, but I believe that people should be judged on their merits, not on their religion. In this order on recruitment, 50 per cent have to be Catholic and the other 50 per cent are termed non-Catholic. How is that fair, given that Northern Ireland has a growing ethnic community and many others who have no wish to have a religious tag at all? We also read that the Government are committed to achieving a representative police force in Northern Ireland from all community backgrounds. Surely this order means that the Government are guilty of discrimination in this instance. But we are where we are and I ask the Minister to give this House an assurance that this will be the last year that this House is asked to support such a poor order. The reason why I ask for this assurance is that, back in Northern Ireland, there is already talk afloat about extending the order for a future number of years until the PSNI has a 40 per cent Catholic intake. I would like to hear the Minister's assurance on this.</p>

I have debated this issue in this House on quite a number of occasions and I think that my views are well known. I am totally opposed to this concept of discrimination. To me, this is about whether you believe in discrimination; it is about whether you believe in the idea of human rights being available to groups collectively or to people individually.

We could never have passed any piece of legislation so clearly sectarian as this order tonight. Under the Government of Ireland Act, anything that we did that was in any way sectarian was immediately null and void. In fact, the Government of Ireland Act had to be repealed in 2000 to allow this piece of legislation, and others offering discrimination, to go through. If only Members of this House realised the amount of hurt and discontent there is among the unionist and other communities in Northern Ireland about this form of discrimination.</p>

However, there has had to be discrimination for the Catholic section of the community. Does this imply that the females are cleverer than the Catholics? I am not sure exactly what it means, but it is simply unfair. Why could not the same type of procedure to encourage more females to enter the police force be applied to the Catholic community? I want to see more Roman Catholic members of the police force. A lot of my close friends are of that denomination and are members of the force. They do an extremely good job. I just do not want to see them at the cost of people from another community feeling deeply hurt that they and their sons or their daughters are unable to get into the force because of what they see as discrimination. I am talking about highly qualified members of the public and highly qualified officers from other police forces on the mainland.</p>

I want to see the devolution of policing and justice to the Stormont Assembly, but not now. It is hard to find anybody in Northern Ireland who, when you ask them how their lives have been changed through the existence over the past three years of the Northern Ireland Executive, can think of anything. The Northern Ireland Executive have not exactly been a success; they are rather dysfunctional. Therefore, it is extremely worrying that we are now in the process of devolving security and justice, one of the major aspects of government in Northern Ireland, to a dysfunctional Assembly. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, when he implied that the Secretary of State had attempted to bully members of the community in Northern Ireland into supporting police and justice coming to Northern Ireland. If anybody knows the character of the people of Northern Ireland-and the Secretary of State should-they would know that the last thing that we are going to do is give way to threats, bullying or bribery.

Therefore I have watched these developments with great interest. I must therefore place it on the record that the Royal Ulster Constabulary had a much higher percentage of Roman Catholic members than the figure quoted at the time of the changeover. At one point it reached 20 per cent, but of course the reason it fell rapidly was because of the intimidation of Roman Catholics who were trying to join the RUC, and the fact that Roman Catholics who, having joined the RUC, were then intimidated by Irish republican terrorists. So the percentage of Roman Catholics in the RUC fell. The reason the percentage fell must be made clear: it was not the result of discrimination by the Protestant majority.</p>

It is, on the bottom line, discrimination on the basis of religion; but in these circumstances it may be wise, and that is the problem we face. What is required is a police service that has the consent of the overall community, and that is the bottom line as well. But it is an exceptional measure, and that is why it must be limited in duration. We must reach a stage where people are selected for the Police Service of Northern Ireland irrespective of their religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="100309133000003"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum states that there was consultation. Funnily enough, only 21 organisations were consulted-and badly at that because it was the Government who selected which organisations should be consulted. It sounds as if they were trying to control the result of the consultation. Even having done that, of the 21 bodies consulted, only seven came out in favour of this order, seven opposed it and the other seven were neutral. I would like more information about the degree of consultation. We know that this order causes offence to the Protestant majority. Again, the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, pointed out clearly that not even 50 per cent of police service recruits can be Protestant; they have to be non-Roman Catholics. In other words, Protestants only make up 40 to 45 per cent of the successful applicants, although Protestants probably comprise around 60 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland. So one can understand the resentment at the grass roots, as we call it in Northern Ireland, and one has to be able to explain it and show that it is good for Northern Ireland over the longer term and into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="100309133000004"></a>I would like to know whether organisations that speak for the Protestant community in Northern Ireland were consulted. Was the largest Protestant church in Northern Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, which operates in Northern Ireland, consulted? Was the Anglican Church of Ireland consulted? Was the Orange Order consulted? It also speaks for a large number of Protestants. These are people who have interests in the Protestant community. Sometimes the churches have not really defended the interests of the

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="100309133000005"></a>It is said that we want to make sure that we have a police force that represents all community backgrounds. I was interested to hear that there are now 32 Chinese members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. But today more people speak Mandarin or Cantonese on a daily basis than speak Irish in Northern Ireland. It is interesting to note that spoken Chinese is now the second most used language in Northern Ireland. Many others may know how to speak Irish but they certainly do not use it on a daily basis, whereas the Chinese do because they have restaurants in nearly every town and village across Northern Ireland. We have a large Chinese community, and that is why there are, quite naturally, Chinese members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I want to see that continuing, because we have large ethnic communities in the province. We have many Polish and Lithuanian people, and they too have to be incorporated in some way into the police service so that it is representative of the entire community.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="100309133000006"></a>I was interested to note that the Leader of the House has said that the Government will return an order to Parliament, when we reach the target of 30 per cent of Catholics in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to end these provisions. But I thought that by that time the Government would have no say in the policing of Northern Ireland, and that by then it might well be a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly, after the transfer of policing and security matters to Northern Ireland. Does this assurance by the Government mean that the new system of political control of policing in Northern Ireland is equally committed to bringing a measure before the Stormont Assembly to end 50:50 recruitment if 30 per cent of the police service becomes Roman Catholic? Or is this a meaningless guarantee by the Government because by that time all these matters will have been transferred to the control of the Northern Ireland Assembly and its new Minister?</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="100309133000007"></a>The other aspect of this order is lateral entry, whereby efforts are to be made to find Roman Catholic recruits from other existing forces. Police officers must be Roman Catholic and in other forces. This means, in practice, the southern Irish police system-the Garda Siochana. I would like to know how many Roman Catholics from the Garda Siochana have now been enrolled into the police service in Northern Ireland and how many Roman Catholic members from various police forces within Great Britain have also been transferred into the police service in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="100309133000008"></a>Finally, I accept this order on the assurance that within a year or so it will cease to operate in practice. I was interested to hear it being welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition, and yet not welcomed by my noble friend and colleague Lord Laird. They belong to two political parties that are now joined together in one political system. I find it confusing that they belong to one electoral system yet take different views on things such as the renewal of this order and even the devolution of policing to Stormont in Northern Ireland.</p>

There are real issues here of equality and discrimination which are very difficult and have caused enormous problems in the history of Northern Ireland. It is a relief, at least, that what we have been asked to deal with today is simply a temporary measure lasting only one year.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="100309133000010"></a>I wish to focus on only one point. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House explained that Catholic recruitment to the police service in Northern Ireland is at just under 28 per cent at the moment. I strongly suspect that one further year will take that figure to 30 per cent. The difficulty here is that, for reasons already hinted at by the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Kilclooney, there is no iron law of history that says that it must stay at 30 per cent or indeed that it will continue to creep upwards. With the attacks on Catholic police officers, there are pressures at the moment on Catholic membership of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="100309133000011"></a>There are other considerations as well in the broader society of Northern Ireland which suggest that the figure could reach 30 per cent and drop down. I do not expect to be admired by the House for drawing attention to this difficult fact but the seriousness of the debate requires at least acknowledgement of it. Ultimately, it now appears that these issues are going to be the responsibility of the devolved ministries of Northern Ireland which will deal with the devolution of policing and justice. In one way, I am very glad that that is the case, because they are going to be extraordinarily difficult issues to deal with.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="100309133000012"></a>The noble Baroness gave a figure for those who did not get jobs in the Police Service of Northern Ireland and her suggestion was, entirely correctly, that it is a small percentage who were not appointed because of being of the "wrong" religion. None the less, this whole game is about small percentages. Getting from 28 to 30 per cent is crucial. Dropping back could also be crucial. I simply draw attention to this difficulty. I am grateful that the Government are only proposing this for one year. On a day which is positive for the history of Northern Ireland, I just draw attention to the fact that anybody close to this issue knows that, even if we reach 30 per cent, we have not entered some new nirvana. The difficulties remain and it might well be the responsibility of this House or another House to deal with what we do then. I hope I do not have to face the question if Catholic recruitment starts to slide backwards.</p>

I do not think that any of your Lordships, or any of the people to whom I have spoken in Northern Ireland about this issue, underestimate the sensitivity of what was undoubtedly a necessary recommendation. I have worked with police officers for many years. I taught them, including chief officers, for 20 years. I served as a custody visitor to Northern

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="100309133000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, is quite right. Policing can operate only with the consent of those who are policed. That consent was not there for many years. The reality, however, was not simply that the IRA prevented Catholics from joining the RUC. Patten identified that significant change was required to facilitate and encourage this "ownership" of policing across Northern Ireland. The 50:50 recruitment model which Patten identified was supposed to ensure that the proportion of Catholic officers would quadruple within 10 years, and that has not happened. Patten recommended that the provision should stay in place for 10 years. He did not recommend any more.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="100309133000015"></a>Changing the situation required action by the people and the police. It also required action by the Government in the form of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Brave things were done on all fronts, and we have heard the current figures of Catholic recruitment. But that figure of 27 per cent masks the fact that some 80 per cent of all officers above the rank of constable are still Protestant. It will be a long time before incremental change means that we have a rather more balanced police force at all ranks. However, it was noted in the 19th report of the Oversight Commissioner that all recruits are now considered fully capable and qualified to perform the duties of a police officer.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="100309133000016"></a>As we have heard and as we remember, on this day last year Constable Stephen Carroll was shot dead. Last month, a brave young police officer, Constable Peadar Heffron, was critically injured by a bomb. I pay tribute to Peadar Heffron because he took a public role as a GAA captain and, particularly, in the Irish language efforts which were being made by the police and by the Northern Ireland Policing Board. He must have known that that made him particularly vulnerable. He is a brave man.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="100309133000017"></a>This was but the last of many attacks on young Catholic officers, and the Chief Constable has said that the dissidents are trying to kill another officer. The Catholic community-the whole community-will well understand the impact that the killing of a Catholic officer will have on future recruitment. However, there are brave men and women in the Catholic community, too, and they have moved to join the police force, but it is still the case that officers have to move because of threats; and it is still the case that those Catholic officers who are now able to live, very often, in the areas from which they came-which would not traditionally have been places where Catholic officers would have been safe-are vulnerable in such areas.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="100309133000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred to the fact that the number of Catholic officers leaving is still disproportionately high. I hesitate to correct the noble Lord, but I am not sure that as many are leaving as are joining. However, the police must find out the reasons for these departures by means of exit interviews and so on.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="100309133000019"></a>The picture is not as good in police support staff as it is in police officer competitions. The number of Catholics employed as police support staff was 12 per cent at the time of Patten; it is now 17.65 per cent, still  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_216"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far too low. Part of the reason for this is that the 50:50 rules apply only to competitions where there are six or more vacancies to be filled at or about the same time.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="100309133000020"></a>I endorse the call for the retention of the 50:50 rule for another year to enable the achievement of the critical mass of 30 per cent to which Patten referred. It would still leave Catholic representation in the PSNI well below the level of Catholic representation in the community, but it will facilitate the maintenance of the critical cultural change which has enabled so many of our people to give their support to policing and to the constitutional process.</p>

I am also delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has welcomed the final piece in the devolution jigsaw, and I am grateful for that welcome. I am, of course, sad that the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Laird, spoke about my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in the way that they did. However, the positive outcome in the Northern Ireland vote today is right and proper for the people of Northern Ireland, and I am glad that we can all celebrate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="100309133000022"></a>Several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred to the numbers of Catholic men and women who are leaving the police force rather than joining it. We regret that some people are leaving the police force but 1,914 Catholics have been recruited into the PSNI and only 209 new recruits have left. So, while we regret that fact, a lot more people are joining. People have left for a variety of reasons, including the wrong career choice, differences in personal circumstances and so on, but I recognise that for some people it is extremely difficult to serve in the police force in Northern Ireland. However, the police do a splendid job and I am glad that we all recognise that.</p>

<a name="100309-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="100309133000023"></a>One interesting fact in my briefing is that in a recent poll-and I know that polls are not the flavour of the day-93 per cent of respondents from a Catholic background indicated that they would recommend policing as a career to family or friends. That is an interesting point which builds on what the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="100309133000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, quoted sections from the Patten report and reminded us of the views of the late Lord Gerry Fitt. I am well aware of the views expressed by the noble Baroness and her noble friends in 2007. She is right to say that the 50:50 provision cannot go on much longer, but it will not go on; this is the final order on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="100309133000025"></a>My noble friend Lady Blood made an important point about equality, but the point of this policy is to ensure that the police have the support of the whole community in Northern Ireland, as many noble Lords have said. While I recognise the strong views expressed by my noble friend, I think that this policy has had the outcome that all noble Lords would wish for. To all noble Lords who mentioned those applicants who have been unsuccessful because of the 50:50 policy, I understand the disappointment and frustration of those applicants, but I trust that, in the near future, everybody will be able to be appointed on merit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="100309133000026"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Loan, has huge experience in this area and she is right to say that the police can operate only with the consent of those who are policed; that is a very important point to make. She is also right that it will take time to have a balanced police force in all the ranks, to see these bright new recruits coming through into the senior ranks. We are confident that in the not-too-distant future, we will see a much more balanced police force.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="100309133000027"></a>To the noble Lord, Lord Bew, I say that we are confident that, with the high application rates seen in the past few campaigns, the composition of 30 per cent will be maintained, especially with all parties supporting policing and sitting on the Policing Board. We think that, in that way, Catholics will continue to have confidence in the system and that they will continue to apply and to join the PSNI.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="100309133000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, spoke about female representation and suggested that it increased without discrimination. As I mentioned earlier, since the introduction of 50:50, 3,807 officers have been recruited to the PSNI. This large volume of recruitment has helped female composition to increase and, of course, we celebrate that. The Patten report acknowledged that it was important for female and ethnic minority composition to increase, but he focused on the more important need to address the community imbalance.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="100309133000029"></a>I was interested to learn from the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, that more people in Northern Ireland speak Chinese day-to-day than speak Irish. We learn things every day. It is important to recognise that the PSNI has run and continues to run a programme with Belfast Metropolitan College targeting individuals whose first language is not English. The purpose of this is to enhance their ability to undertake the application process. Initiatives such as these will ensure that the representation from ethnic minorities increases. As I mentioned earlier, it is 0.44 per cent at the moment. The ethnic minority population is 0.48 per cent, so it is probably where it should be, but of course, we do not want that to be reduced in any way.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="100309133000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, also spoke of what he called the limited consultation. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 only stipulates that the Secretary of State should consult the Policing Board, but the Northern Ireland Office widened the consultation extensively. It extended the consultation to the PSNI, the political parties-the DUP, the UUP, Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party-Northern Ireland MPs, the Equality Commission, the Human Rights Commission and British Irish Rights Watch, but neither the Presbyterian Church or the Church of Ireland were consulted and nor was the Orange Order. I just put that on the record for noble Lords' information.</p>

To be fair to them and to take into account their interests, the Northern Ireland Office should not be selective, in inviting consultation with people who do not represent the Protestant community. Protestant community leaders,

I also recognise what he says about the breadth of consultation. However, I think that we in this Chamber would all recognise that despite the hurt, which is regrettable, the policy has achieved the aims that we would all wish it to have. That is to the benefit of the whole community in Northern Ireland; it gives the community more confidence in the PSNI, and that can only be good for the whole community.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="100309133000033"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether the 50:50 provisions would transfer to the Northern Ireland Assembly. They will not. That is why I am confident when I say that if we get to 30 per cent before the end of the year, the Government will return to this Parliament and end the provisions immediately. General police recruitment, though, will be a matter for the devolved Government to consider.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="100309133000035"></a>I recognise from the debate today that the policy has discriminated against a small number of non-Catholics and it has had an impact on ethnic minorities. However, the positive progress to date has been possible only because of the temporary provisions. As the noble Baroness said earlier, we require a police service that reflects, and has the confidence of, the whole community.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="100309133000036"></a>I and the Government agree that the provision should be ended as soon as possible. The time to do that is when the 30 per cent target has been achieved, and we believe that it will be reached by March 2011. If it is not reached by then, it is not reached, because this is the final order. I think we all agree, though, that all people in Northern Ireland will get behind the police service as it stands today and as it is going to be in 2011, and that they will support it as we do in this Chamber. We thank the service for the difficult work that it does.</p>

<a name="100309139000001"></a><b><a name="100309-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100309139000043"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, I touched on this issue in my earlier amendment covering non-financial targets, which I withdrew after it was not accepted by the Government. I make no apology for raising this particular aspect again in a different context.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="100309139000002"></a>This is a difficult and complicated problem. At its heart is the simple proposition that income transfers to a household in which there is an addict parent need to be carefully controlled if our purpose is to help the children. A quick glance at the numbers tells us that if we do not tackle this issue effectively, the whole Bill will become a futile exercise.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="100309139000003"></a>As I said in Committee, according to <I>Breakdown Britain</I><I>:</I></p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="100309139000037"></a>"Around 1.5 million children are growing up in substance-abusing households-over a million with parents abusing alcohol and ... 350,000 where there is drug-taking".</p>

<p><a name="100309139000034"></a>Now, 1.5 million children is not far short of the number that are targeted to be still living in poverty this year-1.7 million. I know the Government are unlikely to achieve this target. I could find no data on the overlap between children living in poverty and those whose parents are substance abusers, but the overlap must be very considerable. What is the point of making incredible endeavours and spending great sums to support poor children when many of them, maybe the majority of them, will see no benefit whatever from all that effort?</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="100309139000004"></a>In Committee, I drew noble Lords' attention to what seems to be a substantial divide between the Government and my party, on the relevance of drug addiction in particular. It is worth quoting again the key part of the evidence provided in another place by Charlotte Pickles of the Centre for Social Justice. She said that,</p>
<ul><a name="100309139000039"></a>"by skewing a policy response towards increasing benefits to pull that ... family ... over the poverty threshold, you are not improving that child's life in any way, shape or form ... I ... refute the fact that at the moment we have sufficient, or even nearly adequate, services for tackling addiction".-[<I>Official Report,</I> Commons, Child Poverty Bill Committee, 22/10/09; col. 86.]</ul>
<a name="100309-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="100309139000005"></a>In Grand Committee, some noble Lords opposed this amendment on the grounds that it could be used to cut benefit to families where there is a person dependent on drugs. There were also claims that children would have less protection if a family member was an addict. Let me make it absolutely clear that this is completely the opposite of the purpose and indeed the wording of the amendment. It imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to take the problem of children living in such households into account, in ways that noble Lords would, and indeed did, wholeheartedly support.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="100309139000006"></a>The Minister argued in his response in Committee that the words "disproportionate" or "likelihood" in my amendment were unclear legally. This baffles me entirely, coming from a Minister who is happy to take the common-sense meaning of the expression "socio-economic disadvantage". If he wants to help the children of addicted parents, I am happy to accept a redraft of the principle of the amendment in language which he would find legally acceptable.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="100309139000007"></a>I am not claiming to have a solution today, or to be imposing one with this amendment. That is not the point. I am seeking to make sure that the issue is front

I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100309139000008"></a><b><a name="100309-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100309139000044"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, I listened with interest to the way the noble Lord, Lord Freud, introduced his amendment and I am much reassured. My instinct, like that of other noble Lords, was that this was some attempt to cut benefit levels. He says that that is not the purpose of the amendment. Indeed, it is not its stated purpose if you read the wording literally. However, there are still concerns about how you approach this massive problem. The noble Lord is absolutely right to raise it and I support his attempts both here and in Grand Committee to do so.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="100309139000009"></a>All my experience-and I have some through working with the Wise Group in Glasgow-is that if you try to take on drug-addicted members of families against their wishes and against the grain of their willingness to co-operate, you run into all sorts of difficulties. Contrariwise, there are things that can be done to encourage people to consider support in a positive way. If they get to the position mentally of agreeing to accept assistance, you can make a huge difference, as long as you have the support available right there at the same time as the penny drops in the drug-addicted mind. If you get to that position, it is no use sending them off to the National Health Service, where they will wait for a year and a half to get treatment.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="100309139000010"></a>I am absolutely at one with the noble Lord if he is saying that we need to get whatever package of support is needed to somebody who is in the state of mind to say, "I am now willing to give it my best shot to get into a better place". If it is a question of people training themselves-and getting the support to train themselves-out of the difficulties that they are in with drug addiction, I am with him. However, it is very difficult for Governments to pick and choose who is in that condition and who is not. If you apply a kind of Jobcentre Plus-approach equally to everybody, you will run into all sorts of difficulties. A recalcitrant drug addict is in a place that is altogether destructive of any attempts at support. It is a very hard problem.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="100309139000011"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for tabling the amendment. I am still fearful about how it would be implemented, but the discussion should certainly continue. It is something that the Government should give further thought to during the rest of the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="100309139000012"></a><b><a name="100309-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100309139000045"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> My Lords, I must add a word here. I know something about substance misuse because I chair the National Treatment Agency for substance misuse. I have had a very useful conversation with the noble Lord, Lord Freud, about this issue.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="100309139000013"></a>There are one or two misconceptions around. First, people now do not have to wait a year and a half to get treatment-it takes about three weeks, so it has gone down considerably in the last four or five years. Secondly, the number of people in treatment for addiction has doubled in the last 10 years. We are making progress. What worries me about this amendment is the identification of people who might be using drugs or  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_221"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>alcohol. What about smoking, for example? There must be a lot of money spent on smoking, which the amendment does not cover. I understand where the noble Lord, Lord Freud, is coming from but it is difficult to identify people. We would not want to punish the children of addicts. One would want to give the parents help. There is evidence that families and parents are, in increasing numbers, coming for help through the drug treatment system.</p>

<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="100309139000014"></a><b><a name="100309-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="100309139000046"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Freud, for his amendment, and to other noble Lords who have contributed. In large measure, we are on the same page in all this. We recognise that we have a challenge and that there is a group of people who we need to support if we are going to tackle child poverty. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that we know that we can make a difference. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Massey for her updated knowledge about the increase in people who are undertaking treatment now that it takes only three weeks to access, not the 18 months that it used to a while ago.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="100309139000015"></a>The amendment would, in effect, require the Secretary of State to carry out an analysis of the likelihood of any particular member of the household spending a disproportionate amount of money on an addiction. That would be an onerous and impractical task. I will mention again that it is unclear legally what "disproportionate" or "likelihood" mean in this context. Furthermore, the overarching intention behind the amendment is not clear. The noble Lord himself said that we do not necessarily have all the solutions. I acknowledge that.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="100309139000016"></a>All the amendment requires is that the likelihood is assessed. It does not state what happens if a likelihood of disproportionate spending on an addiction is discovered. If it resulted in financial provision being withheld from that household then I would contend that this would increase the risk of poverty. However, I accept and understand the assurances from the noble Lord that this is not the intent of his approach. Clearly it is right for us to be concerned about households with high expenditure on drugs, alcohol or other addictive substances. Indeed, we know that parents' drug and alcohol use can harm children at all stages of development. That is why the Government are investing almost £80 million in 2009-10 to support families at risk through the Think Family programme. We have given parents with drug problems priority access to treatment, as well as supporting a network of family self-help groups to develop across the country.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="100309139000017"></a>The child poverty family intervention pilots are also testing the effectiveness of the family intervention pilot model with a wider range of families experiencing barriers to training and employment, including drug and alcohol misuse. While it is too early to fully evaluate the effect of these pilots, evidence from the first 699 families to complete the intervention suggests that substance misuse problems decreased from 32 per cent to 17 per cent, and alcoholism decreased from 28 per cent to 12 per cent.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_222"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100309-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="100309139000018"></a>This amendment could in fact result in there being direct financial incentive for households with a member suffering from addiction to spend more recklessly on drugs and alcohol in order to receive more financial support from the taxpayer, but I do not believe that that was the thrust that the noble Lord was following. He referred to the fact that there are 1.5 million children growing up in substance-abusing households, more than a million with parents abusing alcohol and 350,000 in households where there is drug-taking. I do not refute the figures that he cites, though I point out that dependency or abuse is not necessarily the same as addiction.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="100309139000019"></a>While the poorest local authorities tend to have the highest levels of negative health and social outcomes related to alcohol use, it is not clear that addiction to harmful substances is the main driver of poverty. Indeed, poverty and the stress it can cause are more likely to contribute to an addiction problem rather than the other way round. The root causes of poverty are more likely to be those listed in Clause 8(5). Therefore, I suggest that there is a risk here that the noble Lord is looking at the symptoms rather than the causes of poverty. I hope on reflection that he will not press the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="100309139000020"></a><b><a name="100309-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100309139000047"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords for not malignly interpreting the motives behind the amendment. That was not the case on the first occasion that the issue was discussed. This is not intended to be a penny-pinching measure; in fact, it would probably achieve the exact opposite. The figures are very interesting. The Minister said that £80 million is being spent to support families at risk of this problem. When you consider that a large proportion of the families we are concerned about might be in this category, the £80 million that we are devoting to supporting them in this way must be compared with a potential £19 billion cost of supporting families in poverty purely by income transfers-that is the IFS estimate. As noble Lords know, Frank Field from another place estimates that the cost is higher at £30 billion.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="100309139000021"></a>Putting this concern in the Bill in the shape of this amendment would start to get rationality into an analysis of where we should be spending the money. On the one hand it is suggested that we can solve the problem with £19 billion of income transfers; on the other, here is an effective set of pilots with a figure of £80 million. That is nothing against £19 billion. You start to get better decisions if you look at these things in that context. We argue that addiction is an enormous problem when you see the relevant figures.</p>

<a name="100309-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="100309139000022"></a>I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, for the fascinating information about the treatment processes in this country. She asked whether we should include smoking. I thought very hard about including smoking in the addictions. I did not do so for two reasons. First, I think that to do so would be too emotive. Secondly, alcohol and other drugs have a dual effect: a financial effect and a directly deleterious effect within a family in terms of the parents' likely relationship with the children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="100309139000023"></a>As always, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, for his thoughtful and often inspired views in this area. He said that this is a very difficult issue. I

This is one of the major social problems in this country. That is why it is valuable to put a forcing mechanism in a Bill such as this so that we put effort and diligence into trying to solve it. The cost arguments only stand if the problem is a small, marginal one. If it is of central importance-that is what I am arguing-the fact that it is difficult and expensive to tackle does not really stand. We should spend that money and make those efforts if this is the central part-or one of the central parts-of the problem. This is an important issue and I am sure we will come back to it in many ways and guises in the years to come. I wanted to air it fully.</p>

This figure of £19 billion was an IFS suggestion of the cost if these issues were dealt with by income transfers. It did not recommend that as the route forward and neither do the Government. That needs to be done on a more sustainable basis, including the sorts of programmes that are tackling the challenges that the noble Lord rightly raised. He has made a forced comparison on that.

The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, who is not in his place, in particular argued powerfully that the Bill must treat parents as partners and that their views will be vital in the development of successful and effective child poverty strategies. We listened with interest to the debate and I am happy to propose these government amendments in response.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100309-0014.htm"/>


<a name="100309-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="100309139000028"></a>These amendments will require consultation on the UK, devolved, and local child poverty strategies to take place directly with parents, as well as with the organisations working with or representing parents. This requirement directly mirrors the requirement to consult children and organisations representing children. By directly consulting parents, children and those organisations working with both groups, we are confident that the most informed and effective child poverty strategies will be developed.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="100309139000029"></a>Government Amendments 39, 40, 45 and 46 extend the definition of "parent" in the Bill from just those who have parental responsibility for the child, as defined by the Children Act 1989, to cover also those who do not have parental responsibility but are caring for children who reside with them. In Committee, noble Lords from all parties spoke about the needs of family and friends/carers, and why it is important to ensure that they are adequately provided for in the Bill. Following that debate, my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton met my noble friend Lady Massey and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, as well as representatives from the Family Rights Group and Grandparents Plus. They discussed the range of activity being undertaken better to identify how this group could be supported, linked to the <I>Families and Relationships</I> Green Paper. These amendments follow on from that discussion.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="100309139000030"></a>The previous definition of "parent" in the Bill went further than just natural or birth parents and included any individual who has parental responsibility for a child under the Children Act 1989. This includes step-parents and persons with a legal order conferring parental responsibility, such as a residence order, a special guardianship order or an adoption order. Following the meeting with the noble Baronesses, we decided to extend the definition to include those who do not have parental responsibility but who care for a child full-time. The definition used here is similar to that in Section 576 of the Education Act 1996.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="100309139000031"></a>The amendment will ensure that in preparing a UK child poverty strategy, the Secretary of State must consider measures aimed at family and friends/carers. This applies in respect of financial support, the promotion and facilitation of employment, the development of skills and the provision of advice, information and assistance. The intention is that these individuals should benefit from measures in the strategy in the same way as natural parents or others with parental responsibility for a child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="100309139000032"></a>I hope that the House will appreciate that our intention in moving the amendment is to recognise more explicitly in the Bill the needs of family and friends/carers, and to ensure that the UK strategy takes this group into account when considering measures to alleviate child poverty.</p>

I thank all those who fought for recognition of the status of family and friends carers, many of whom are in your Lordships' House today. It has been most encouraging that the support has been cross-party. On occasion, it has been very moving. I also thank the organisations that have been determined to continue supporting the issue: the Family Rights Group, Grandparents Plus and the Kinship Care Alliance.

There are two main points from this group of amendments. The first is to include parents in consultation, rather than just children and organisations. That is an important move forward and it is hugely to the credit of the Government and those in the Box that they recognised this and put it right. The second, which is infinitely more important, is the widening of the definition of "parents", not only for consultation-they also play a part in that-but in every other way. People in this country sometimes completely unexpectedly find themselves caring for a child. It may be a grandmother, aunt, uncle or godmother. Godmothers in particular suddenly find that there is no one else to care for the child. They take over the care, sometimes having to lose their jobs or to take less well paid work, as well as incurring the considerable added expense of growing children.</p>

At that stage the child, now

She will care for that child out of love for her goddaughter and because of the tremendous needs of the mother, who cannot cope. The grandmother is thrilled, as she could not do it herself. The godmother will not, in fact, be in this group but she is an example of people who are in the group under this Bill, who have been in real difficulties and whom I hope the strategy will pick up and help in every way.</p>

Like everyone else, I am particularly pleased to see Amendment 45, although I am not sure that it is necessary, as the terminology already covers it. In practice, however, too many bodies and organisations misunderstand the term "parent", taking it to mean biological parent, so that other groups get excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="100309141000007"></a>The recurring problem in dealing with this is getting the stats. We wander between figures of 200,000 and 300,000. We really do not know how many people, for how long, with what number of children and at what cost are caring for these children. Could I push my noble friend a step further, given that the commission will now have a wider concept of parenthood? This is probably too late now for the census, but it may not be too late for the Family Expenditure Survey or the General Household Survey. Could my noble friend use his best endeavours to assess the number of people who are producing kinship care, grandparent care, family care or indeed the extraordinary example of care provided by the godparent mentioned by the noble and learned Baroness? This will mean that we know where we stand in policy terms. One of the first things that we could do is to make sure that the commission, in going through its research, includes this group specifically in order to find out the numbers. Without the numbers, there is very little that we can do in policy development.</p>

My colleagues have far more experience in this area than I have, so I will not go further along those lines. However, may I take this opportunity to ask the Minister for reassurance on the voice of professionals? I commend the Government for their efforts in recent years to ensure that the voice of the child is heard much more clearly than it has been in the past. In this Chamber particularly, one recognises the strength of experience and it has been very gratifying to hear about the need to listen more carefully to parents. However, I have been concerned that the voices of professionals should also be heard-I particularly mean social workers close to front-line practice. They should be one of the most powerful advocates for families in poverty-especially those social workers who still carry a case load and are close to that experience. Although I welcome the movement that the Government have made in the past two or three years to try to ensure that the voice of the

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="100309141000009"></a>Policy in this area will be tremendously improved if there are mechanisms and means to include front-line practitioners-especially social workers, but also head teachers and teachers, people who are still working directly with families. If we talk broadly about organisations, that may mean the people who lead those organisations, who may not have had recent experience of working directly with families. The practice that some Ministers have had of having a group of professionals as a sounding board whom they meet periodically to sound out their policies is a good approach. I would appreciate reassurance from the Minister about that.</p>

A lot has been said on that point, especially eloquently by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, so I shall be extremely brief.

It is unfortunate, however, that we have not made a similar amount of headway on the first five clauses of this Bill and that four crude, largely financial, targets remain as the only mechanism of assessing the success of any Government.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="100309141000015"></a>The Government consider that the differences between the four targets-which should, we hope, ensure that all households are counted where a child is at risk of suffering from low income-is sufficient to give a full picture of the situation. I am afraid I do not agree. Although the targets may cover a broad enough group, they do not distinguish between the distinct types of household within that group. By ensuring that the numbers of households falling into each band are reported on, any appreciation of the Government's success or failure can be informed by knowing where progress has been made.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_229"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="100309141000016"></a>I appreciate that there are significant difficulties with reporting on households falling under 40 per cent of the median, as we have discussed, given that the IFS stated that children in these families are frequently better off in material terms than in households that are nominally richer. That surely makes it a very useful statistic. If the government strategy is proving extremely effective at addressing poverty in the 50 per cent and 60 per cent bands but is having absolutely no impact on those reporting, possibly incorrectly, almost no income, such information is useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="100309141000017"></a>Whatever the Government say about the flaws of our additional non-financial measures for the vulnerable, the fact remains that these four targets are very blunt measures.

In an earlier amendment-I am not sure if it was moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, or the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood-the noble Lord, Lord Freud, like me, made a distinction between information and targets. The information he seeks for those, not just below 60 per cent but below 50 per cent, is indeed already well publicised in <I>H</I><I>ouseholds </I><I>Below Average I</I><I>ncome</I>. For example, page 40 gives the percentage below 50 per cent of the whole population; page 72 the percentage for children. On the 2007-08 figures, this is 12 per cent compared with 23 per cent below the 60 per cent line. That information, therefore, is already there and well known. We raised a similar issue when we were debating whether it was before or after housing costs. It is essentially the same issue.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="100309141000019"></a>We have the information there. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Freud, that the figures for below 40 per cent are entirely suspect. People may be in the black economy or the cash economy, they may be self-employed, they may be shopkeepers or living off lodgers, and that income is not necessarily always declared. We do not know. He is, however right to say that the standard of living reported does not reflect the income as reported. The numbers are in any case very small. It is very hard to pick that up unless one does some sort of focus group or qualitative survey of those you can pick out.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="100309141000020"></a>For the rest, however, we have the figures for those below 60 per cent median income and those below 50 per cent; we already have the information. I do not see what is added by building it into the vocabulary of targets. It is perfectly reasonable to ask the commission to see whether those below 50 per cent median income are distinctive from those below 60 per cent and whether there is any particular driver there that Government have a lever on that can help. That is perfectly reasonable. I am puzzled, however if the information is in the public domain already, why the noble Lord thinks this amendment is necessary.</p>

Let me categorically assure him that this is not what we propose. This would be an entirely self-defeating approach, as it would be impossible to meet the targets this way, and we would be in breach of the duty to ensure as far as possible that children in the UK do not experience socio-economic disadvantage. It would also be morally wrong to ignore the needs of the most vulnerable children. Indeed, I have just moved a government amendment that requires specific consideration of the most vulnerable groups in the child poverty strategy. This is intended to ensure that the strategy does not focus only on children whom it is easiest to lift above the poverty line, leaving behind particularly vulnerable children who will be harder to help. I hope the noble Lord is convinced of our sincerity on that matter.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="100309141000023"></a>It is worth outlining once again the many issues that arise from the data on those with the very lowest incomes, such as those below 40 per cent median income. They are acknowledged to have a higher degree of uncertainty and error. Some types of households with very low income that were recorded on the survey include the following issues. First, very fragmented incomes are under-recorded. Secondly, some households will have transitional periods of low income when they are between possibly well paid jobs at the precise time of the survey interview, or they are self-employed and their incomes can vary greatly from year to year. Thirdly, some households may draw on savings to cope with a longer period of minimal income. Finally, some households genuinely have to cope on very low incomes, and may get into debt to maintain levels of expenditure.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="100309141000024"></a>Unusual households in which incomes are not a good measure of material living standards make up a much lower proportion of households below 50 per cent or 60 per cent of median income than in households below 40 per cent, and are therefore particularly unreliable as a measure of poverty. My noble friend Lady Hollis acknowledged that, and the noble Lord, Lord Freud, rightly focused on that in quite a lot of our Committee deliberations. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, to which he referred, has confirmed this, pointing to the fact that many of those with incomes below 40 per cent of median income are not those with the highest levels of deprivation. This is why households with incomes below 50 per cent and 60 per cent, including households below average income, are used in measures of poverty. This is in line with international best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="100309143000001"></a>The HBAI publication, to which my noble friend Lady Hollis referred, contains statistics on the number, proportion and characteristics of children in households with incomes below 50, 60 and 70 per cent of median income before and after housing costs, as well as in low income and material deprivation. It is published annually, so the 50, 60 and 70 per cent information is available. To be fair to the noble Lord, his amendment would not have required the 40 per cent to be a target; it related simply to the information that would flow from Clause 9. Perhaps he will correct me if I am wrong on that point. The 40 per cent figure simply does not flow from the data at the moment because of

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="100309143000002"></a>The noble Lord's amendment would apply only to statements that are required under the final annual report on the target year and not to the reports that precede it. If his intention is that all annual reports that are required under the Bill contain information on these poverty thresholds, the amendment would simply not cover that.</p>

<a name="100309-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="100309143000003"></a>In summary, the targets already present a range of different measures of poverty, and as such ensure that we do not focus just on getting families over the line. There are problems associated with the measurement of the very lowest incomes, and I urge the noble Lord not to press his amendment to a vote.</p>

Frankly, my concern has been much reduced since the passing of Amendment 15, with its requirement to worry about the most vulnerable children.

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="100309143000005"></a>The amendment was driven by the sense of many commentators that there had been a lot of effort on nudging people just over a particular line.

I am afraid that after reflecting on the Minister's response to this amendment in Grand Committee, I am not convinced by his arguments that requiring local authorities to set out co-operation arrangements with each and every partner authority will lead to best practice and a fully engaged focus on child poverty throughout the country. I agree with him that the partner authorities are all likely to be critical for the successful implementation of a child poverty strategy but, as the Bill makes clear, the child poverty strategy will form only one part of the local authority's priorities, and indeed only one part of its sustainable community strategy. Given the overlap between child poverty and community issues, I feel that requiring arrangements between partner authorities on child poverty alone risks duplicating and complicating existing arrangements for co-operation where the relationship is already effective and will do no more than produce paper where authorities are not fully engaged with this strategy. I beg to move.</p>

They relate to Clause 20, which sets a duty on local authorities to make arrangements to promote co-operation between the authority, its partner authorities as set out in Clause 19, and other persons or bodies as the local authority sees fit. We recognise that local authorities and their partners  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_233"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are best placed to support their communities, to reach out to families and individuals and to tailor services to their needs. The Bill therefore requires local authorities and delivery partners to work together to tackle child poverty and set out the contributions that they will make in their local areas.</p>

<a name="100309-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="100309143000010"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Freud, voiced his concern that this duty will impose inflexible requirements on local authorities, and indeed he has reiterated that he wants local authorities to be given the freedom to co-operate with whomever they so wish. While I appreciate the need for flexibility to suit local needs, this amendment will raise questions as to who should be involved and will therefore weaken the local authorities' ability to involve all the necessary partners. Only by requiring local authorities to make arrangements to promote co-operation between the authority and each of its named partner authorities can we be confident that the full range of individuals, organisations and bodies which can make a real and lasting difference to the lives of children in the UK are fully engaged in that task. In fact, the consultation on the Bill illustrated that local partners thought that tackling child poverty must be a shared responsibility among all key partners; it should not be optional.</p>

<a name="100309-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="100309143000011"></a>The noble Lord has also expressed his concern that the duty to promote co-operation will duplicate existing legislation that requires consultation between organisations working with vulnerable children. This is not the case. The consultation made it clear that the arrangements in Part 2 should be delivered through existing structures. It is not a question of new arrangements and having to duplicate existing arrangements. The Bill reflects this and the list of partners set out in Clause 19 is, in fact, based on the existing local strategic partnerships. These organisations are in place and we do not need to create them again for the purposes of this Bill. Many local authorities and their partners already work together to ensure a comprehensive approach to tackling child poverty. The requirement to promote co-operation will help embed their good work. However, progress varies across the country and best practice is not universally shared. This requirement, therefore, gives those who could do more the stimulus to do so.</p>

<a name="100309-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="100309143000012"></a>Amendments 41 and 42 weaken the duty to co-operate, essentially giving local authorities a choice as to which partners they choose to co-operate with. By failing to collaborate with all those listed in Clause 19, there is a risk that the impact they can have on child poverty will be reduced. I hope the noble Lord will accept my reassurances on this point, and that he will feel able to accept the provision as it stands in the Bill and withdraw his amendment.</p>

It seems odd to require co-operation from above and outside, and surely the freedom of a local authority to select its own relevant partner authorities would be likely to generate a far more enthusiastic and effective response

We have already discussed in detail the draft overarching energy NPS, which will be the primary document for energy development consents, and in two days' time we will be debating the draft non-nuclear NPSs.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000005"></a>Let me draw the attention of noble Lords to the fact that the House retains the right to adopt a resolution in respect of a specific national policy statement if it so wishes. My noble friend the Leader of the House has indicated that in the event of a Motion for resolution being tabled, the usual channels would undertake to provide time for a debate in the Chamber.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000006"></a>This afternoon we focus our attention on the draft nuclear national policy statement. We heard in the previous debate that the national policy statements are a key part of the planning reforms introduced in the Planning Act 2008. They are the essential policy statements against which the Infrastructure Planning Commission will determine applications for development consents by those wishing to build major energy infrastructure. They also set out the Government's policy on the need for new energy infrastructure. However, they do not in general set out any new policy. This is also the case for the draft nuclear policy statements.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000007"></a>We are not here today to debate the need for nuclear energy, as that is decided. The Government concluded in the 2008 nuclear power White Paper that nuclear has a role to play in the future energy mix alongside renewables and clean coal. We also said that it is in the public interest to allow energy companies to  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fund, develop and build new nuclear power stations and that government will take active steps to make the conditions right for investment and to enable new nuclear to come online as soon as possible. Action taken by the Government so far has resulted in real interest in new nuclear in the UK, with energy companies announcing plans to build around 16 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000008"></a>The delivery of the nuclear NPS is a key part of these actions, and we are here today to consider whether the draft nuclear NPS, alongside the five other energy NPSs, is fit for purpose, and how it might be further improved. As I said two weeks ago, the nuclear NPS is not the same as the other technology-specific NPSs. In the draft nuclear NPS, 10 sites have been identified which the Government have considered potentially suitable for new nuclear power stations. They were identified after the Government undertook a strategic siting assessment to establish which sites are potentially suitable for the deployment of new nuclear power stations by the end of 2025. We consider that all these sites are needed to contribute towards the carbon reduction objectives set out in the low-carbon transition plan. That is not to say, however, that all sites listed will have a power station built on them immediately. Ten sites are listed to ensure that sufficient sites are available, even if a number of sites are not developed or fail to secure development consent.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000009"></a>In our first sitting, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, urged the Government to reconsider the suitability of Dungeness. I have no doubt that we shall come to consider that question further in this sitting. However, at this point I should say that the reason we did not consider Dungeness to be potentially suitable is that development would result in adverse impacts, which could not be avoided or mitigated, on the integrity of a European special area of conservation. The Government also commissioned a study to identify whether there might be alternative sites to those nominated. Three sites were identified as worthy of further consideration. However, having considered them further, the Government do not consider them credible candidates for deployment by 2025.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000010"></a>In the long term, meeting the objectives in our low-carbon transition plan will be a significant challenge. The overarching energy NPS sets out that the lead scenarios estimate that demand for electricity up to 2025 will remain at around 60 gigawatts. Our present generation capacity is 80 gigawatts, which provides a buffer to meet demand when, for example, a generating station is offline for maintenance. However, there will be a loss of capacity over the next decade, as around 12 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity closes by 2015 in response to more stringent emission standards set by the large combustion plant directive and around 10 gigawatts of nuclear capacity reaches the end of its life. We also anticipate that some gas-fired generating stations built before 2002 will close in response to the industrial emissions directive, and that capacity must also be replaced.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000011"></a>Leading up to 2025, there is therefore a significant need for new major energy infrastructure, including net additional electricity generation. We estimate that around 30 per cent of electricity generation should be  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC47"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from renewable sources, mainly wind, by 2020. Wind, as some noble Lords who are here today often remind me, is intermittent, as other renewable energy sources are, so there must be sufficient alternative generation capacity to meet demand when the wind is not blowing. Fossil fuels provide a flexible capacity but have high emissions. The NPSs therefore set out how the IPC should implement our policy, set out in the framework for coal, which requires all new fossil fuel generating stations to be carbon-capture ready and all new coal-fired generating stations to have carbon capture and storage on at least 300 megawatts net generating capacity. The Government are also providing funding for four CCS demonstration plants, although this does not preclude developers bringing forward more proposals for coal-fired generating stations with CCS if they consider it a commercial proposition.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000012"></a>Alongside these technologies, the Government believe that new nuclear power should in principle be free to contribute as much as possible towards meeting the 25 gigawatts of new non-renewable capacity. The Government expect that, under this approach, a significant proportion of the 25 gigawatts will in practice be filled by nuclear power. The explanation of the need and urgency for new nuclear power stations is an important part of the draft nuclear national policy statement, and that will be central to the Infrastructure Planning Commission's decision-making.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000013"></a>The overarching national policy statement makes it clear that the IPC will need to balance the need for new nuclear power stations against their potential impacts. The draft nuclear NPS will guide the Infrastructure Planning Commission on how to assess potential impacts of new nuclear power stations, such as on local infrastructure and through visual effects. Where relevant, it suggests measures that the Infrastructure Planning Commission might expect the developer to take or to have taken to reduce impacts.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000014"></a>The draft nuclear NPS also explains the Government's assessment of arrangements for waste. In the 2008 nuclear White Paper, we said that before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, the Government will need to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist, or will exist, to manage and dispose of the waste that they will produce. Having considered this issue in the NPS, we are satisfied that effective arrangements will exist to manage and dispose of the waste that will be produced from the new nuclear power stations. These include safe and secure interim storage of radioactive waste onsite, followed by long-term disposal in a geological disposal facility. Having made good progress in recent years, the Government are now running a staged process to identify a suitable location for a future geological disposal facility. We have already received formal expressions of interest from three local authorities about potential involvement in a geological disposal facility siting process.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000015"></a>Alongside the draft nuclear NPS are two environmental reports-an appraisal of sustainability and a habitats regulations assessment. They support the draft nuclear NPS and the Government's assessment of sites. The appraisal of sustainability is required by the Planning Act and helps to ensure that national policy statements and the Government's assessment of sites take account  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of environmental, social and economic considerations, and contribute to sustainable development. The habitats regulations assessment assesses whether the nuclear NPS is likely to have an adverse impact on particular habitats which are protected under European law. When the habitats regulations assessment concludes that there are adverse impacts, the NPS cannot be approved unless the Government think that there is an imperative reason of overriding public interest to do so.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000016"></a>We have just completed a comprehensive consultation exercise, inviting detailed responses from local communities which might be affected by the potential new nuclear power stations. I believe that the consultation was thorough and effective. I have been enormously impressed by the quality of contributions and the large numbers of people who have attended. We have seen more than 3,000 people attend our national and local events; there were some 21,000 visitors to the NPS consultation website and more than 3,000 responses to the consultation. Of these, more than 2,000 responded to one or more questions on the nuclear NPS. Many important issues have been raised that we will consider carefully and reflect appropriately in the final NPS.</p>

<p><a name="10030975000017"></a>We will of course consider carefully the report by the Select Committee in the other place, which is expected by the end of March, and the issues raised by your Lordships. At the end of these sittings, the Grand Committee will report to the House. This is not the last opportunity for people to have their say. Developers must consult communities before submitting an application to the IPC, and people will also have the chance to input at application stage. However, this consultation has provided people with a chance to shape the guidance which the IPC will use to inform its decisions.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10030975000018"></a>Like the other energy NPSs, the nuclear NPS is critical in bringing forward nuclear infrastructure developments and ensuring that the right framework is used in the consideration of development consents. We strongly believe that the nuclear NPS is fit for purpose. I welcome today's debate and look forward to responding to the points raised by noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="10030987000001"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10030987000048"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the Minister for his careful introduction. It will not altogether surprise him if I return to some of the points that he has made, particularly on the Government's refusal to countenance Dungeness as a site for future nuclear build. I shall also want to talk, not today but on Thursday, about carbon capture readiness.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000002"></a>I start my speech with a compliment. The nuclear NPS is perhaps the clearest statement of the Government's civil nuclear policy that they have made since they first embarked on it in 2006. The Minister referred to the 2008 White Paper, but there were intimations well before that. After that, the compliments must end. Ministers cannot escape responsibility for the fact that the years of delay before 2006, which was the reversal of policy, means that there is now, as we have been warned by Ofgem, a serious risk of interruptions of the supply of electricity to consumers later this decade. It was only last month that Ofgem gave that warning.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000003"></a>From 1997 onwards, this Government's policy was based on the foolish fantasy that renewable energy-in practice, mostly wind power-was somehow going to keep the lights on. Indeed, former Ministers at the DTI and Defra gave every appearance of believing, no doubt with complete sincerity, that they were presiding over the run-down and eventual disappearance of civil nuclear power in this country. One has only to look at the history to see what happened. They were content to see British Energy virtually go to the wall, to the point where, in order to keep operating, it had to be rescued by the Treasury. That led to the almost inevitable takeover which happened when it was taken over by EDF. The Government's flagship legislation during this period had nothing whatever to say about new nuclear build. They were concerned only with winding down and decommissioning existing plants and facilities.</p>

<p><a name="10030987000004"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10030987000049"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> Could the noble Lord perhaps refresh our memories by telling us what references to nuclear power there were in the Conservative manifesto of 1997? It is my understanding that the Conservative Opposition, as they then became, had long previously abandoned nuclear power as far as further construction of power stations was concerned.</p>

<p><a name="10030987000005"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10030987000050"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I think that the noble Lord has it entirely wrong. There was of course argument, and I took part in it with some of the shadow Ministers at the other end, but David Cameron made it perfectly clear in a speech to the CBI early on that the Opposition would support new nuclear build.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000006"></a>This Government sold Westinghouse, the only British-owned company that could actually build a new nuclear power station. It was a company with an international reputation, but they sold it to the Japanese. Even the members appointed by Michael Meacher to the committee set up to advise the Government on nuclear waste-I noticed what the Minister said about that-were mostly so anti-nuclear that they were not even prepared to consider the question of handling the waste from new nuclear build. It was not until the membership was substantially changed, as a result of recommendations of the Select Committee on Science and Technology in this House, that the Government began to make progress.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000007"></a>We are now faced with the problem of having to catch up after those wasted years. We need to build a new nuclear supply chain. I declare an immediate interest as a president of the Energy Industries Council, which is striving to do exactly that. We need to train a new generation of skilled manpower. I declare another interest as the honorary president of the National Skills Academy for Nuclear. We need to start the long process of assessing the latest reactor designs for safety and integrity, and we have to invent new procedures and processes to allow investors to identify and get the consents for the sites to be able to start work. It is a truly dismal story, and I hope that Ministers now recognise how much they will be blamed if indeed the lights go out.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000008"></a>However, we are where we are, and we have to do our best with what is before us. I therefore turn to EN-6. As was foreseen at the time of the Planning Bill, and as the Minister said, this is the only national policy statement to deal with the spatial element of  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the industry. The Government have determined where the new plants are to be built and also where they are not to be built. As I think I said during the passage of the Planning Bill, that seems very sensible. However, I have a number of points to make.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000009"></a>First, much is made, and it has been repeated again today, of the need to get 25 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity up and running by 2025. In my view that is a highly ambitious target, and it is most unlikely to be realised.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000010"></a>I have been provided with a chart which has a number of figures based on information drawn from the National Grid Transmission Entry Capacity Register. It is a very important document because it shows where sites will be linked to the grid. It has four columns. It gives a first-connection date for the sites. Some of those are as early as 2016-interestingly, it includes Dungeness-but others go much later, into the 2020s. Then there is what it calls a "first capacity", which is in megawatts, and that comes to a possible total of 13.5 gigawatts. The maximum capacity by 2025 is shown in the next column, and would go up to 25.5 gigawatts. Then there is the best guess of the actual build by 2025, and there the figure is 10.2 gigawatts. There is a massive difference, of course, between the first, second and last figures, and one might ask why that is. Why are we not going to reach the 25-gigawatt figure?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000011"></a>There are, in fact, three reasons. Even where building can start before 2025-and so far only one company, EDF Energy, has given notice to the IPC about one site, Hinkley Point, and that is under the Planning Act procedure-the rate of build is likely to be phased considerably. Early on, there was some thought that a company such as EDF or Horizon Nuclear Power, the partnership between E.ON and RWE, would be able to build several stations at the same time. They have now made it clear that that will be very difficult. For example, EDF may start at Hinkley Point. Its next station will be at Sizewell, but that is not likely to start for several years after work has commenced at Hinkley Point. Therefore, the completion will be later. It is the same with Oldbury and Wylfa. At one point, there was some suggestion that they might be built together, but in fact that is not so. I have seen minutes from the companies saying that, although they might start the second one before the first one is completed, they are going to be substantially staggered. At one of the sites, Sellafield, it is perfectly clear that only half the capacity will be built by 2025. That is the first reason.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000012"></a>The second reason is that some sites might not be developed at all. It would not surprise me if the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, has something to say about that in a few minutes. The examples are Braystones and Kirksanton in Cumbria. I have two pieces of evidence for saying that. First, it is being recommended to Cumbria County Council that it should not support these two sites. I have here a paper prepared for the council's cabinet only in February. The NIWG committee-the Nuclear Issues Working Group-also recommended that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030987000040"></a>"Cabinet be minded not to support Kirksanton and Braystones because it was not convinced at either site that the benefits of development would outweigh the costs".</ul>



<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10030987000034"></a>Bearing in mind that these are greenfield sites involving villages which have not had nuclear facilities before, that is not altogether surprising. Therefore, those two are unlikely to be built.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000013"></a>Furthermore, it has emerged that RWE, which had originally had applications agreed for these two sites, has now withdrawn them. Therefore, that grid connection is not by any means certain. <I>Nucleonics Week</I> states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10030987000039"></a>"RWE npower said in a statement that it could renew the grid connection applications at a future date. But it said that since it was not possible to commit to specific plans for the sites at this time, it had chosen 'not to maintain the current grid connection agreements'".</p>

<p><a name="10030987000035"></a>So the company involved and the local authority are saying that those two sites are not in their immediate programme. That is the second reason.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000014"></a>The third reason is that two sites have yet to have any developer committed to build on them at all; namely, Heysham and Hartlepool. The maps that one has seen show, as yet, no interest in either of those. I draw two conclusions from this. The original 10 sites of which the Minister spoke a few moments ago are likely now to be down to six by 2025, and some of those six will not be completed by then. So the outcomes are bound to run a long way behind the Government's estimates of built capacity by 2025.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000015"></a>My other point was made by the Minister, and we must bear it in mind. There is always the possibility that the IPC might reject one or more of the sites which it will be considering. This leads me to a conclusion that has been reached by a number of other people, which has also been put to DECC and was certainly voiced to the DECC Select Committee at the other end-some of us sat through some hours of evidence-giving. My conclusion is that the Government have been very premature in rejecting Dungeness. I will return to that in a moment.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000016"></a>In the mean time, I have a number of questions which I hope the Minister will be able to answer. If it becomes clear that the 10 so-called approved sites turn out to be insufficient to support the proposed expansion of nuclear capacity, what will be the procedure? Here one has to turn to the consultation paper to which I referred in our debate on 23 February. Not only was Dungeness rejected; so too were three other sites which the noble Lord has mentioned today-Druridge Bay on the coast of Northumberland, Kingsnorth in east Kent and Owston Ferry in the Yorkshire and Humberside region. As the noble Lord reminded us today, the central reason for the rejection of those last three sites was that they would not be credible by 2025. However, we are to have a road map to take us to 2050. What is the procedure for this?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000017"></a>One also needs to bear in mind the very important-I thought it was excellent-report prepared by the Minister's predecessor, Malcolm Wicks, Minister for Energy, who was appointed by the Prime Minister as a special representative on energy security. Last August he produced a report which had a lot of sensible things to say, one of which concerned the future of nuclear energy. Paragraph 6.12 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030987000041"></a>"our demand for electricity in 2050 could be 50 per cent higher than it is today ... it is therefore important that it relies on large scale, low carbon and proven technologies to meet a proportion of this increased demand. As nuclear meets these criteria it is well  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placed to play a key role in our future energy mix. I believe that the level of ambition should be much higher in the longer term than currently projected. To enhance energy security and reduce our reliance on imports, a range between, say, 35-40 per cent of electricity from nuclear could be a sensible aspiration, beyond 2030".</ul>
<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000018"></a>He is not going up to 2050, only to 2030. He has been supported by a number of very influential bodies, including the CBI, which is calling for an increased nuclear build. Inevitably, however, this is bound to increase the need for more sites. What is to be the procedure? How is that to be run? Would it not be sensible to have something in this NPS, EN-6, to indicate how that will be done? In the mean time, as I understand it, if someone puts in an application for a nuclear station on a site which is not listed, that does not go to the IPC but is handled by the department. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to confirm that.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000019"></a>One then comes back to the question of Dungeness. In the circumstances, it is rather surprising that that was the preliminary decision. The industry has been almost unanimously dismayed that the site has been rejected. The Select Committee heard that from its witnesses, and the Minister told the committee on 23 February that he did not have a closed mind. I and the Committee were pleased to hear that.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000020"></a>Perhaps I may end my speech-I do not wish to go on for too long-by saying why I think that Dungeness should be included. First, one comes back to the concept of need. Much emphasis is laid upon this in all the national policy statements. Dungeness could have connection to the grid by 2016. It could therefore be one of the earliest to come on-stream. It could have a full capacity of 1,650 megawatts, and it could be producing electricity certainly by 2019. Given Ministers' recognition of the need,</p>
<ul><a name="10030987000042"></a>"to maximise the contribution of nuclear as soon as possible",</ul>
<p><a name="10030987000036"></a>as part of the action to be taken against climate change, it is premature to rule out Dungeness at this early stage.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100309-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000021"></a>Secondly, Dungeness has almost the total support of the local community. Shepway District Council is making it very clear-including, no doubt, to the department-that it supports a new nuclear station at Dungeness. Thirdly, there is a growing awareness that there is a shortage of generation in the south-east. This was one of the arguments put forward at the original Sizewell inquiry-that there needed to be more generation in that part of the country. This demand/supply gap in the south-east will worsen if Dungeness is ruled out. It has an existing grid connection, and it is interesting that an analysis showed that the prices paid by bidding companies for other sites were very sensitive to the availability of a grid connection. The European Union Competition Directorate required EDF to sell off either Heysham or Dungeness. Clearly it regarded Dungeness as viable for the first wave of new nuclear developments.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000022"></a>I come to the point that the Minister briefly made. The rejection by DECC is based primarily on the EU habitats directive. However, nuclear development would take up only 91 hectares of a much bigger site of special scientific interest. The Minister did not mention, either today or in the documents, that that 91 hectares represents only 1 per cent of that site. It is a tiny  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proportion. The new development would help to protect the SSSI against coastal erosion. Indeed, it could become a security buffer that protects the valuable shingle habitat which is likely to be destroyed much earlier if the nuclear station is not built.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000023"></a>In any event, as the Minister has reminded us, the habitat can be overridden on grounds of IROPI-imperative reasons of overriding public interest. It seems to have been assumed that that would inevitably have to be related in some way to the habitat impact, but nowhere is it said. If we are looking to fight climate change and reduce carbon by building nuclear power stations as quickly as possible, is that not an imperative reason of overriding interest? For all these reasons, it should be open to a developer to apply to the IPC, which should then examine all the arguments for and against, perhaps more carefully than has been done by the department, which is spelled out in the NPSs. As I indicated on 23 February, I intend to table a resolution to this effect when this part of the NPS scrutiny process is completed.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000024"></a>I apologise for the length of my speech and look forward to hearing the rest of the debate. I certainly look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>
<h5><a name="10030987000046"></a>4.05 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10030987000025"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10030987000051"></a>Lord Chorley:</b> My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. I find that my theme today very much follows his line of thought in some parts of his authoritative contribution.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000026"></a>When we discussed the overall issue of energy policy two weeks ago, I said that I have no hang-ups on nuclear energy as a major source of our electricity supply, provided it is economic. The French have been pretty successful with nuclear and there is no reason why we should not have a healthy proportion of electricity supplied from it. The important thing is to get on and do it. All that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said reinforced that, and it remains my position.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000027"></a>The document that we are discussing today is straightforward. Ten potential sites are suggested, and that, I note in parentheses, is surprising. Are there really only 10 sites in the whole country? The noble Lord spoke about Dungeness with great authority. Surely it should be included as another site. Of the 10, seven seem straightforward. My concerns are with the remaining three: Braystones, Sellafield and Kirksanton. They are clustered close together on the Cumbrian coast, sandwiched between the Irish Sea and the Lake District National Park. I emphasise that it is a national park. I shall take them together.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000028"></a>My first question is whether it is really the case that, in the whole of England, almost one-third of the potential sites that the Government can identify are clustered together in a remote and sensitive corner of England. At this stage I must declare an interest as a vice-president of the Friends of the Lake District. I was going to say that it is a pity that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, cannot be with us today, but he is here in his place. He is the distinguished president of the friends. I very much welcomed his contribution on nuclear when he spoke in this Room two weeks ago. I hope that he will speak today in the gap, if we have such a thing. It remains to be seen.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000029"></a>Although each of the three sites is discussed separately-that is a matter of course-one might have thought that the cumulative effect of having three sites in connection with the national park should have warranted some discussion, certainly rather more discussion than the brief reference to them at paragraph 5.7.124, which deals with Braystones. The effects were dismissed two paragraphs later as not being,</p>
<ul><a name="10030987000043"></a>"sufficient in themselves to justify excluding Braystones or the other West Cumbrian sites".</ul>
<p><a name="10030987000037"></a>That is extraordinary.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000030"></a>One might also think that there should have been discussion of the sea defence works that might be required-how unsightly those would be-and any other structures and their visual effect. We do not know how big each station will be or how many reactors each will have. Large-scale maps are provided, but there is no single map showing how the stations relate to each other or-and this is of great importance-how they relate to the topography and the national park boundary. For example, it would appear that Kirksanton station is only a few hundred yards from the park boundary and, moreover, that it is in a particularly sensitive part of the park, with its tremendous views from Black Combe summit across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man and, on a good day, to the mountains of Mourne. Black Combe, the mountain, is immediately above the power station. Paragraph 5.11.82 of the NPS says that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030987000044"></a>"the site offers local opportunities for screening through the use of landscaping, vegetation and tree planting".</ul>
<p><a name="10030987000038"></a>One wonders whether either the nominator of the site or the author of the report appreciates that you cannot conceal a site with plantation of trees when you are looking down on it from the summit of Black Combe or the surrounding fell-side. One wonders whether they have actually been there.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000031"></a>I am bound to say that I found the discussion of amenity, cultural heritage and the landscape-value aspects of the three sites as superficial, to put it politely. It is appalling. In the case of Kirksanton, the conclusion that the site is acceptable and passes the tests can scarcely be concluded, even from the superficial analysis in the report. At a public inquiry, the lawyers would have had a field day.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10030987000032"></a>Then again, while the need for grid connection for each of these stations is recognised, there is no indication of what route or routes it would take. Again, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, raised some serious questions about grid connections.</p>

<p><a name="10030987000033"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10030987000052"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b> My Lords, there is a Division in the House. The Committee will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>

Would it cross the Duddon estuary? We do not know, because there does not seem to be any grid connection. Would it be underground? We simply do not know.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000002"></a>I could go on. These are all issues that would have been explored thoroughly at a public inquiry. Notwithstanding this PPS, major issues of detail will eventually have to be gone into if any of these three sites is to go ahead. Perhaps I may suggest to the Minister, or more realistically to his staff, that they should look at the inspector's report on the Whinash wind farm public inquiry which took place a few years ago-that wind farm is on the other side of the Lake District. The inspector gave a brilliant analysis of the visual intrusion of large structures on the edge of a national park. At any rate, the IPC will be familiar with this.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000003"></a>My final point, which I want to stress, is that we cannot deal with these stations separately. What matters is the cumulative effect of these huge structures. For me, it is immaterial whether they are nuclear; what matters is their size and their close proximity to our finest national park. However, I am not clear about how this will be assessed by the IPC-perhaps the Minister can explain-and how, in due course, the public can have their say on the cumulative aspect of what is proposed in this PPS.</p>

When I was a Member of another place, there were two nuclear power stations in my constituency, Berkeley and Oldbury. I lived between the two and I was a supporter of them then, and I still am. I therefore welcome the fact that, after wasting a decade-as my noble friend Lord Jenkin said so powerfully-the Government are now considering all this and are to take it forward. My noble friend spoke about the whole area, but I want to concentrate on one detail.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000005"></a>I recognise that the planning process for such large facilities was in need of improvement. Objectors should be able to have their say, but it is not in the national interest that they and their lawyers should be able to spin things out for many years. So I accept the framework of what we are talking about. However, I also think that when autocratic powers are in place, it is essential that, in the opinion of the citizens, they are used with due care, as anything else would be a failure of democracy.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000006"></a>That is why I am sad that this document is flawed in at least one important respect, the respect that I know best: the proposals about Oldbury-on-Severn or, more accurately, next door in Shepperdine. The present Magnox station was opened in 1967 with an enthusiastic speech in favour of nuclear power from the then Minister, Tony Benn. I recommend the speech to anyone who wants to make a good speech in favour of nuclear power. Some excellent points were made in it. That power station will not be generating for much longer, yet the local people have accepted it for many years. Successive managers and their teams have worked very hard to cultivate good local relations. Many visitors-and every local organisation for 30 miles around that has outings-have been shown over the

They have come away reassured about its safety and impressed with the fact that it very cheaply produces large quantities of electricity, enough electricity to power the whole City of Bristol one and a half times over.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000007"></a>At first sight, it is therefore rather surprising that every local council and many other bodies are firmly opposed to the ideas expressed in the document about building a replacement station in the area. Despite the local jobs that that would save or create, they are opposed, and so am I. We are opposed not to a replacement of Oldbury power station but to the specific proposals in this strategy document. The most important reason concerns the proposed cooling arrangements.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000008"></a>The present station was built at Oldbury because it could be cooled by the water from the Severn, on whose banks it stands. The same was of course true of Berkeley-the first commercial nuclear power station in the world-upstream, and of Hinkley Point, downstream where the Severn has widened out into an estuary. At Oldbury, the river is about two miles wide with an enormous tidal range at that point. However, the new proposals reject the idea of using the river water for cooling. Some may think, as I do, that as the available river cooling water was the point of choosing the Oldbury site in the first place, that would rule out using the site for the new station. Yet it apparently does not. The idea in this document is instead to build cooling towers, as if it were an inland power station instead of being adjacent to tidal water, and that is the key reason why local representatives and people are against it.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000009"></a>It is proposed to have up to four cooling towers, which will be up to 200 metres high with plumes rising well above that. Big Ben's Clock Tower is 96 metres to the top of its golden finial; the cooling towers would be more than twice that height. Big Ben, of course, also comes to an elegant point, whereas the towers would be vastly bulky at the top. There would be no golden decoration there. Can you imagine what that will do to the views over this splendid estuary from miles away, including from both the Cotswold and Wye Valley areas of outstanding natural beauty? The cooling towers will not only dominate a vast area of estuarial beauty but stick up above the surrounding hills. They will actually be seen for 30 miles.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000010"></a>The overall document, EN-1, worries about the high visibility of development on undeveloped coast and talks of minimising the harm done to highly valued landscape by landscaping schemes. This document says that that site is,</p>
<ul><a name="100309112000028"></a>"suitable ... because ... the nature ... and scale",</ul>
<p><a name="100309112000024"></a>of the effects of landscaping are "uncertain", yet there is no way that 200-metre cooling towers could be mitigated by, for instance, planting trees. The largest tree in the world, a Californian redwood, is 115 metres high-just over half the height of the proposed cooling towers-and has only reached that height after 1,000 years or more.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000011"></a>I realise that some may, by this stage, be thinking that this is all pure nimbyism. In my case, that charge fails on a technicality as we now live some way away, in Bath. In any case, that is to misunderstand the specific objections. My objection is not to a new power station  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at Oldbury but to cooling towers which would be a monstrous and unnecessary intrusion. Oldbury is, incidentally, the only site mentioned in the document where it is proposed to have any cooling towers. It is primarily those which have converted supporters of nuclear power into dedicated opponents.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000012"></a>There are other objections on which I shall not expand: the risk of flooding and the effect on the very special habitats there. These considerations are raised in the document as things that still need to be dealt with. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="100309112000029"></a>"it may be possible to avoid or mitigate impacts"-</ul>
<p><a name="100309112000025"></a>for instance, on designated sites of biodiversity. There is also some discussion about the effect of all this on the possible schemes to harness the huge Severn tides which are also being considered. Depending on the outcome of those considerations, that may well, in any case, destroy the habitats, so we will probably not have to worry about the birds or fish by then. It might also make more river water available for cooling, although I doubt it.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000013"></a>I have a wider concern about all this. Draconian power-which is what these new strategic planning arrangements are-must be used with sensitivity if it is to be acceptable in a free society. I believe that the Government, in their new-found concern about coming energy shortages and in their rush to correct their error of ignoring nuclear power for a decade or so, have cut corners and abandoned logic. Oldbury, which is currently a well accepted nuclear station, is closing, but they said that we can build a replacement there. When they then found out that they could not use the river water for cooling, someone, who was probably sitting on a sofa at the time, said, "Well, cool it some other way". In any case, I do not think that the matter was given enough thought. I think that that destroys the case for the site, and it certainly destroys popular acceptance of it. When you convert friends of nuclear power into enemies on this scale, it is time to think again about this aspect of the document.</p>

The new power station is supposed to be about four times the size of the existing one. The existing one has a tidal lagoon, which was built when the station was constructed in order for sufficient water to be available when the tide was out. There was difficulty with it silting up, but that was got over at an early stage. However, that is where my noble friend will find the discussion.</p>

<p><a name="100309112000016"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100309112000038"></a>Lord Broers:</b> My Lords, I wish to talk about three topics: the legacy of radioactive waste, the timescale for building our new nuclear power stations, and the possibilities of re-establishing the UK industrial base in nuclear technology. Before doing so, however, and following the precedent set by the noble Lord, Lord  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Jenkin, I should like to start with a compliment and say how it pleases me that we are at least getting on with the planning of new nuclear capacity. I was clearing out my office over the recent Recess and found a copy of an interview that I gave to the <I>Times</I> in 2003 when I was president of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In the interview, I strongly advocated the adoption of nuclear power. What response there was from the Government at the time was negative, which was quite depressing. It is a great relief now that minds have been changed and that we are at least getting on with the planning process.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000017"></a>Returning to my three topics, first, I wish to confirm that we are dealing competently with the legacy waste that sits, for example, in the concrete tanks, B30 and B38, at Sellafield. Paragraph 3.8.12 of EN-6 tells us that the NDA estimates that a UK facility for geological disposal could be operational in 2040. Indeed, the Minister and the chairman of CoRWM confirmed this on 9 February while giving evidence to the Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into this matter. This is the fifth inquiry that we have conducted and I happen to be chairing it.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000018"></a>The same paragraph points out that it will be only intermediate level waste that can be stored in 2040. We will have to wait until 2075 before the disposal of high level and spent fuel waste will be possible, and 2130 before the storage of legacy waste is complete and we can begin to store new-build waste. These are long timescales, even by the standards of this House, and it would seem to me far longer than the water tanks in Sellafield can possibly survive. I am assured by engineering colleagues that these water tanks are regularly inspected and declared to be safe, but to a layman they appear to be seeping and in need of repair. Without knowing more about the final geological storage, however, it is not possible to plan efficiently for the progressive storage of this waste. It is clearly inefficient and expensive to have repeatedly to restore the material in a format that is compatible with the next stage of storage, all the time being ignorant of the final format. In other words, we really have to get on with the task of deciding on the whole sequence of storage, including the final stage of geological storage.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000019"></a>At present, progress is painfully slow. Extracting the waste from the tanks is very expensive and, presumably because of budget cuts, the NDA appears to be proceeding at reduced pace until better times return. Can the Minister tell us where we are in implementing safe intermediate storage of our legacy waste? Is any of this waste stored in a dangerous manner, and how long will it be before we know that our legacy waste is to be stored in a manner that will be satisfactory for at least the next 65 years, in other words until geological storage is available?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000020"></a>My second point relates to the timescale on which our new power stations are to be built. Paragraph 2.5.6 states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309112000027"></a>"France has already demonstrated that it is technically feasible to build nuclear power stations at a rate that would be needed in the UK if new nuclear power stations were to be constructed on all 10 sites"-</p>

<p><a name="100309112000026"></a>although perhaps there are only six to be built, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, suggests-</p>
<ul><a name="100309112000030"></a>"listed in this NPS by 2025".</ul>



<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC59"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000021"></a>Paragraph 2.5.6 goes on to encourage the IPC to grant consent to sites at a rate consistent with this timetable. I find this encouraging and very much hope that it can be achieved, but I point out that this is not the most aggressive target that one can imagine. The average time that the Chinese have taken to build their last 10 reactors has been 6.3 years, and some of their new stations, such as the one at Ningde, which was started in February 2008, are scheduled to be completed in 2012-a build time of some four years. I am not suggesting that it will be possible for us to match the Chinese in the speed with which we can grant assent to sites, although it is clear that our slowness disadvantages us internationally. Will the Minister reassure us that those planning our build programmes have assessed how the Chinese achieved these short construction times and that we will be able to match them when we finally come to break ground and start to construct our own nuclear power station?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000022"></a>My third topic concerns the need for us to rebuild our strength in the nuclear industry. It is 15 years since Sizewell B was completed. Since then, the activities of our companies that have remained active in the nuclear industry have been concerned only with the disposal of radioactive waste and the servicing of our naval nuclear propulsion plants. Little remains in civil nuclear engineering and what remained at the beginning of 2006, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned, was virtually eliminated by the untimely sale of BNFL-owned Westinghouse to Toshiba, as part of what appeared to be a general government policy to approve the sale of any available assets in an attempt to contain the ballooning current account deficit, not to mention the public debt. We now need to recover from the underinvestment in civil nuclear engineering and rebuild at least the supply chains that will support the reactor vendors in building our new nuclear power stations.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100309112000023"></a>There have been some positive actions, such as the setting up of the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre in Sheffield, taking advantage of the strong manufacturing expertise already established in Sheffield by the University of Sheffield and Boeing at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre. This is the ideal location for this work, but, regrettably, the research funds for nuclear energy are small. There is the risk that, as with the National Nuclear Laboratory at Sellafield, little use may be made of the new facility. It may be too late to enter the competition to build reactors, but it is still within our grasp to re-establish our strength in the supply chain industries. If they are to succeed, we will need to provide for them a strong research base. Will the Minister reassure us that the Government are doing all they can to support our research and industrial development efforts in nuclear technology, so that we can re-establish the UK's indigenous capability to support the building of our new plants? This will not only bring employment to the UK but ensure that we can deliver our nuclear programme on time and to budget.</p>

I start, however, on a personal note: if someone had said 15 years ago that I would be standing up to commend the Government on adopting a policy of developing more nuclear power, I would have questioned their sanity. I welcome the policy statement. Perhaps it would be useful briefly to touch on why.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000002"></a>My concerns before I became the regulator for nuclear waste and the authority for flood and coastal erosion were about safety and environmental issues. We have made such huge progress in both the management of nuclear waste and understanding of environmental impact and flood and coastal processes that I believe that the further development of nuclear power is to be commended in the context of climate change. It should be seen not as a permanent solution but as a bridging technology, because the impact of nuclear power is still huge in terms of cost and waste management. Moreover, the risk of safety going awry will always be there. If we can see the policy statement as a way of gaining additional generating capacity in a reasonably short time while we develop a richer, carbon-reducing energy mix for the future, we should press on.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000003"></a>I have become much keener on nuclear power as a result of some of the other propositions being made for carbon-reducing energy generation technologies, particularly the Severn barrage, but I propose to keep my powder dry on that until Thursday's debate, when your Lordships will no doubt hear far more about it.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000004"></a>My support for the nuclear policy statement has three provisos. The first is the waste issue. The noble Lord, Lord Broers, hit the nail on the head when he said that the pace of development of a long-term deep depository is glacially slow. We need the Government to assure the House that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will make ongoing and credible progress in the development of a geological disposal facility for higher-activity solid radioactive waste, both for the legacy waste-I share the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Broers, about some of the issues at Sellafield-and for waste from the new-build programme.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000005"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100309142000207"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. I find myself in a very similar position to hers: I have accepted that we have no alternative but to move to another phase of nuclear energy. However, the noble Baroness said that she was greatly persuaded in coming to that conclusion by the huge strides that we have made in the management of waste. Does she not agree that there is still a very big question as to whether we should start on the next generation of stations before we have started to manage the waste? However convincing the arguments, they are all theoretical; we have not yet made the decisions on how it will be done.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000006"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100309142000208"></a>Baroness Young of Old Scone:</b> With the indulgence of the Committee, perhaps I may address that point. We have made considerable progress on how we handle new waste. The stuff that is up at Sellafield and some of the other legacy waste is a completely different kettle of fish. No matter what we do about a new-build nuclear programme, that problem has still to be addressed and solved. Careful planning of the new nuclear programme may include the disposal of waste material  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before sites are even constructed and some faster progress on the deep depository. However, I believe that, if we wait for solutions to all those issues to be put into practice and implemented, it would probably be a very long time before we start the new nuclear programme. Therefore, although it is not ideal, the alternatives-be they barrages across every estuary in the nation, over-reliance on carbon capture and storage, which is as yet unproven, or our continuing to pump carbon into the atmosphere-are equally unpalatable. So the position I have taken is that we have to pitch somewhere if we are going to make progress. I have come to the conclusion that carefully managed new nuclear build and carefully planned waste disposal is probably one of the least hazardous ways forward.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000007"></a>My second point is about sites. I very much welcome that the NPS is spatially explicit. But there needs to be a proviso about all sites because all the nominated sites are close to internationally protected nature conservation areas. Many face significant challenge in respect of the way in which the coastline is changing and eroding. There needs to be a full and detailed environmental impact assessment and a appropriate assessment under the habitats regulations not just at the NPS stage, but at the individual project stage.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000008"></a>The environmental assessments in the nuclear NPS are much more robust than in some of the other policy statements, but I would urge the Government to be clear that we cannot regard the habitats regulation assessment in the NPS as sufficient. I also urge the Minister to clarify that the findings of that process; namely, that there would be adverse impacts on wildlife sites, that there were in some cases no feasible alternative solutions and that therefore imperative reasons of overriding public interest would have to be invoked apply, so far, only to the NPS, and to assure the House that both the NPS in its final form and the habitats regulations assessment when finally published will have an explicit statement that the findings simply apply to the national policy statement and will have to be re-examined on individual applications site by site.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000009"></a>I am sure that the Committee is expecting me to raise my third issue, which is the uniting principle between the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and myself-Dungeness. I very much welcome Dungeness being dropped from the list on the basis that it is either extremely difficult or impossible to mitigate or compensate for the environmental impacts on that highly distinctive, highly special, rare and internationally important shingle habitat. I should like the indulgence of the Committee for a few minutes and would like to transport noble Lords there. Indeed, I urge you all to go to Dungeness, probably not quite at this time of the year. It is a bit chilly right now, but in a month's time, one will find a hugely distinctive, slightly weird, beautiful shingle landscape. It is internationally important for its nature conservation interests.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000010"></a>Those noble Lords who are more interested in the arts than the environment are no doubt aware that Derek Jarman published a wonderful book about the very special garden he created in the shingle environment. It is absolutely beautiful and I urge noble Lords to see the garden and to read the book. An example of its weirdness is: were you to put your finger in a pool in  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the shingle banks at Dungeness on the site of special scientific interest and linger for a while, you would probably find that you are in close fleshy personal communication with the medicinal leech. It is one of the few sites where medicinal leeches still thrive in this country. It is a wonderful sight for some rare shingle plant and animal species which occur nowhere else in this country. It is very distinctive.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000011"></a>I encourage all noble Lords to go to Dungeness to see how special it is. Those of you who are not taken by the wildlife interests, or by the visual and spiritual interests, might be more convinced by the fact that this site is also on a very fast-eroding coast, which is sustained now only by the fact that lorries go to one side of the nuclear power station almost daily to pick up huge quantities of gravel and shingle, in order to ferry it round to the other side of the nuclear power station so that the sea can carry it round to the first side. There is a constant need to keep replenishing the shingle, otherwise the nuclear power station will come under severe threat from a very strong coastal current on that part of the coast. It is simply not sustainable for the future. In my view, that is probably one of the strongest arguments for not having a further power station on the Dungeness site.</p>

I do not think that building another power station and putting a whacking big concrete sea defence around it is sustainable. It may stop the shingle from disappearing for a few years, but the reality is that the erosion around these coastal defences is so massive that, if you are not careful, you will end up with a nuclear power station virtually on an island. That is also unsustainable. The expert assessment of the coastal erosion processes at Dungeness is that it is too risky to sustain. I now give way to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000016"></a>The current operator at Dungeness, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, has put forward lots of arguments as to why it is sensible to have a replacement power station there, mainly on the basis that it is not confident that other sites will come forward. That issue is central to the national planning policy statement, and I believe that the Government need to be more

It is already connected to the National Grid, but that does not necessarily mean that there ought to be a power station there. Of course, local people are far more familiar with having a power station on their doorstep and, therefore, are less sensitive. I believe that the environmental and coastal erosion arguments are more powerful.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, argued equally tellingly and vehemently about the rich inheritance-in character and scenically-of the Cumbrian coast and the national park. Does the noble Baroness not agree that it is essential that we do not get into a ding-dong about this bit of scenic inheritance or that bit of environmental inheritance but that we need a strong, powerful injunction from the Government that, in all that is done, environmental considerations in all their forms must be given priority in finding the right solutions?</p>

I am sure that he is absolutely right, but the joy of this policy statement is that it takes a very balanced approach. It says that we should be clear that we need to develop nuclear power and that there will be some areas where compensation is required but some places where development should not happen. Although I would love to take the stance that the environment must be pre-eminent, I think that in reality there will be some give-and-take on some of the sites where it is possible to get adequate mitigation and compensation but that that will not be possible on other sites. That is why a site-level environmental impact assessment and a habitat regulations assessment are important.</p>

I was surprised that all the enthusiasts for nuclear power in this Room were so gloomy about the prospects and so critical about what was going to happen.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000023"></a>Perhaps I should start by declaring an interest. I am the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, which is the trade association for the industry. It is a paid position. I have been a long-term advocate of nuclear power and so I am very pleased and proud to be able to hold that post.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000024"></a>As I have been a long-term supporter of nuclear power, this document bred in me a sense of impatience, because I felt that it should have come out earlier. Having said that, once it was published, I could see why it took a long time to produce. We should bear in mind the problems that we have had over nuclear power during the past 20 years. I want to get this point on the record because people on the other side of this Room seem to be suffering from selective amnesia. As I recall, Sizewell B was completed in about 1995, but we have yet to see Sizewell C. That was more than a gleam in the eyes of Tory Ministers; it was a commitment that was quietly dropped, in exactly the same way as consideration of sites for waste disposal was dropped when it appeared that there were too many of them in Tory seats. Let us get the record straight on this. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that that is not rubbish, because it is clear that he has conveniently chosen to forget. As I recall, on the whole question of siting nuclear waste facilities, only one Member of Parliament, Tam Dalyell, was actually prepared to volunteer his constituency-and that was long before the days of voluntarism. It was only when he got back to West Lothian that another West Lothian question was asked. Tam found that it was not the answer he was looking for. His view was shared by many Old Etonians on both sides of the House in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000025"></a>My point is that this document is important because it deals with the implications of the Planning Act and tries to ensure that they are properly understood. The length of time that it took to produce the document reflects not only its rigour but the fact that the resources available to DECC to undertake the work which it is now responsible for should, frankly, be enhanced. It would have been good to have had this document before the summer, but we know the strains that are imposed, and are continuing to be imposed, on that department. As a fledgling department, it does not have the breadth and depth of staff necessary to do the job. That does not imply any disrespect to those currently in employment there; there just needs to be many more of them to get on with the job at the rate at which it needs to be done.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000026"></a>All parties are responsible for the delays which have taken place. I was the Labour Party's shadow Energy Minister in the early 1990s. It was explained to me by Tony Cooper, the then general secretary of the power station managers' union, that a sizeable number of nuclear power stations were to be closed in the middle of what is now this decade and that something would have to be done to fill the gap. In those days we were faced with a choice. We had plenty of gas, but it would be dangerous to become over-dependent on it. Coal production was closing down at a considerable rate for  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reasons into which we need not go. The point that I wish to get across is that it has been self-evident that the opportunities offered by renewables and by coppice burning, which was to be one of the cornerstones of Liberal energy policy in days gone by, would produce nothing as great as that required to deal with the emerging gap in energy generation.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000027"></a>Given that we are faced with the rush for generation capability, we need to ensure that the planning process, which is one of the historical obstacles to rapid development of major projects-not just for energy, but a variety of purposes-is dealt with effectively and rigorously. The planning process has been characterised as an adventure playground for vexatious litigants and their filibustering legal advisers. That should not mean that if we are to change the process it should be any less rigorous, but it certainly could be quicker. We should be able to have not only due process but proper consideration of the objections. We have heard already today some of the points which could well emerge in the process as the IPC undertakes its work.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000028"></a>When one reads at least the first four parts of the document, one cannot but be impressed by the comprehensive character of the considerations that the Infrastructure Planning Commission will have to take into account. Northern Ireland is discounted. Scotland merits a mention in respect of the reserved character of energy in the devolution settlement. Whether our energy needs will require the continued contribution from the sites at Hunterston and Torness does not concern us today, but the relatively longer life of the Torness site could well enable it to be used for future reactor construction. It is interesting that those who call for the inclusion of Hunterston reflect concerns about the socio-economic aspects of the case. We know that nuclear power stations offer well paid, high-quality employment for people who become assets to the community. The emergence of talented, capable families does a great deal to enhance education and the social and cultural life of the area. In many instances, although Hunterston or Torness are not particularly isolated, some of these communities are fairly isolated and the injection of a rich group of well qualified people-I mean rich in talent-is of great significance. I well understand why a number of people want power stations retained on particular sites. Speaking as a Scot, I think that the prospect of well paid employment in Scotland is more than a passing consideration.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000029"></a>I shall dwell on Scotland for a moment. Nuclear power has had great significance in the past 50 or 60 years of its industrial and economic history and has made a major contribution to our industrial life. That can be seen in research and engineering and in the quality of a number of big firms; for example, the Weir Group, Doosan Babcock or Rolls-Royce in its varying forms. A number of household names in engineering are rooted in the Scottish power generation experience.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000030"></a>It is paradoxical that the only distinctive things that an openly opportunistic crowd like the Nats have are their commitment to a separate Scottish state and their antagonism to all things nuclear. It is one of the considerations that are turning the Scottish electorate away from them. They have experienced a minority

I hope that this Scottish dimension to the problem will be resolved in the forthcoming general election and, beyond that, at the election for the Scottish Parliament, when I think they will be tossed out and wiser counsels will prevail about whether there should be continuing generation at nuclear power stations in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000031"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="100309142000218"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> I offer my entire support to what the noble Lord has said so far about the place of nuclear power in Scotland, particularly its beneficent impact on remote rural communities, such as Caithness and north Sutherland. Would he accept that it is unfortunate, though understandable, that the considerations that are deployed in the paper under discussion are treated only as matters to be noticed and that Scotland is not covered by the considerations in this report? He is entirely right that this document might provide a relevant consideration in planning in Scotland, but there is a great gap now, and it needs to be filled.</p>

Many of us who are both Scottish and British in our political interests know that there are times when you can have a fight and times when you do not need to have one. At the moment, in Scotland, we do not really need to fight. The nonsense that the nationalists tend to speak about generating capability and the wishful thinking relating to renewables is such that they are being found out on every day that passes because all influential Scottish public opinion formers are coming down in support of the nuclear case. There is compelling evidence from communities of the specialist character of the Dounreay facility, of which I know the noble Lord has been such a defender over the years.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000033"></a>There will be debates within the IPC process. It is clear that the IPC has a long and intimidating checklist against which the planning applications will have to be assessed. The detail is sufficiently comprehensive and explicit to enable anyone wishing to frustrate the process to seek judicial review. IPC members have made it clear to me in conversations and at meetings that they have been appointed as much for their experience and expertise as their independent minds. These are significant individuals. The chair has a distinguished career in public service-the kind of person who will not be messed about by civil servants and the like, but who will lead teams of well qualified and experienced individuals to look at these issues on their merits. If they do not, and as I said earlier, the weapon of judicial review will delay and frustrate in the way that planning processes in the past have done. I am confident that this process will not only accelerate but assist consideration of the projects. I have flogged this horse previously, but I say to those Members opposite who have ill-disguised opposition to many of the processes of the IPC, not least in the absence of any ministerial involvement, that the supposed independent, cool, political, accountable voice that is heard following a planning inquiry is very often vacillating, delaying and, as Mrs Thatcher would have said, "frit" because of the electoral consequences of unpopular decisions

I can see the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, perhaps rising to my bait, but, before he does so, I would say that he was distinguished by his support for the process as a former Planning Minister and his general backing for the Bill in the past. Whether he has moved I am not sure, but if he wants to ask me a question, I am happy to take it.</p>

This business of issuing election manifestos wrapped in a piece of green paper does not give them any status. I am aware that quite a polite but, at the end of day, rather rude letter was sent by a junior opposition spokesperson in another place to the appointees on the day on which they took on their jobs, telling them, "Be ready for your P45, lads, because this job isn't going to last". The noble Lord may with his characteristic courtesy be trying to build some bridges to the IPC. But there is a feeling abroad that there could be delay, new legislation and worrying circumstances for potential investors. One difficulty that we must recognise is that, at the moment, there is not just political uncertainty but uncertainty whether this planning process will be quicker. If it is, we will see an acceleration in the programme.</p>

In my capacity as the chair of the Nuclear Industry Association, I can tell them that we have held seminars across the country for interested firms that want to be part of the nuclear supply chain. We are finding that people with skill and engineering capability, who have been engaged in other areas of activity such as the defence industries and hi-tech engineering for the construction of hydrocarbon plants and the like, are saying, "There is not that much

There is a fantastic degree of optimism within British engineering at the moment, which I am sorry that the noble Lord has not been exposed to.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000042"></a>Equally, I simply make the point that, with regard to British engineering capability, there have been British companies in China, Korea and Japan, such as AMEC, Balfour Beatty, Rolls-Royce, Doosan Babcock and Westinghouse, which, although it is now foreign-owned, still has 3,000 employees in Britain-it is not as if the whole thing was sold lock, stock and barrel and everybody went away. There are centres of excellence in the United Kingdom which foreign companies could not move and will not move, especially now that we have the prospect of what could be called the nuclear renaissance. But if we are to get that, we must ensure that one of the first obstacles, the planning process, is dealt with openly, transparently and fairly. This document lends itself to that and will assist in it, and it will enable us to move towards 25 megawatts by 2025. I agree that it is very optimistic, but it can be achieved-if only because we are talking about at least 3 gigawatts on most of the major sites over the period.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000043"></a>I disagree with the point made about the length of time that some of the reactors are taking to be built in China. The number of months is going down; there are some instances of 38 months. I am not saying that that is what we would want, but 44 to 48 months would seem at this stage, for the starting-off, a reasonable assumption to make. The more we build, the better we get at it and the shorter the times we will be able to move towards. I am not as pessimistic as some of my colleagues, but equally I am not adopting some kind of Voltairean view that all is for the best in all possible worlds. A lot is still to be done, but we have made a good first start with this document, and I commend it.</p>

What I was trying to say was that we have a strong possibility of recovering our nuclear base. I was trying to ask the Minister to reassure us that the Government were going to support them in doing that. I am very pleased to hear that the noble Lord thinks that we could build plants in even less than 48 months; I look forward to that. I should like him to realise that I am not pessimistic about this-I am optimistic-but the Government will have to do all that they can to help, especially to provide a strong research base.</p>

It is my understanding that tenders are being prepared for the initial civil engineering work. We have to define what we mean by the length of the construction period. If you are dealing with a greenfield site, there is obviously that much more to do. But, in a number of UK sites, specialised civil engineering work can start long before the planning process and it would not in any way prejudice the outcome of that. That is why when we talk about the 44-month and 48-month periods, we could be referring to the reactor construction rather than a lot of the earth-moving and initial improvement work.</p>

It began right back, I suppose, in the late 1940s when we were building our own nuclear weapons. As I have always understood it, the big problem with dealing with nuclear waste is the legacy waste from the military programmes. That is where the bulk of the waste disposal problem lies. I got involved in this indirectly from local government in the 1980s through Nirex, which at one stage produced a list of something like 30 potential sites all over the country in which to dispose of nuclear waste. If a lesson is to be learnt from this, it is that a bit of humility would be a good thing. If I wanted to quote a case of really appallingly bad public administration over the years from the United Kingdom, this would be the issue that I would pick. It really does appal me.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000047"></a>The other thing that needs to be said is that over the past 40 years, it has been possible to get away with it, but things have now changed and it has been apparent that they have been changing for quite a long time. The change has been the coming coincidence, which was entirely predictable, of the rundown of our existing nuclear power generation capacity and the growing realisation of the need to tackle the problem that is inducing climate change. That coincidence is very much a coincidence of the past decade.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000048"></a>I feel sorry for the Government, who were elected in good faith on a very poor policy with regard to nuclear power, but I congratulate them on changing their mind. I hope that the Minister will forgive me for saying that I feel, as I said at the last meeting, that my back is firmly pressed against the wall today. We need decisions because we need to get action and we need to get on with it. The only reason that I tolerate it is because I know that the Minister's back is equally firmly pressed against the wall. He, too, sees the need for action, which is what we are facing.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000049"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the issue of environmental impacts. I accept that this will always be a very touchy subject. In relation to Dungeness, if one were to look at maps of the southern coast of this country century by century, one would find the alignment of that coast dramatically different today from 200, 300 or 400 years ago. One of the penalties of living on an island is that its shape changes, particularly when the coast is of an alluvial compound. There is some hope. I had to deal with a problem in the county of Essex where the sea wall was increasingly unprotected because the sand had completely washed away. Not surprisingly, the people who lived behind that wall were very worried. If you stood on the sea wall in a gale, you would feel it jumping as the waves hit it. That is how bad it was. There was a solution, although the county council had to approve it-that was my involvement. It was quite expensive, but the ratepayers paid for putting two T-shaped groynes half a mile out to sea and about three-quarters of a mile to a mile apart. Two years later, when I returned, the locals were complaining because the sand was blowing over the top of the sea wall. You just cannot win, but there are things that can be done.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000050"></a>I do not like having my back against the wall. I note what the Minister said about the possibility of a debate on this matter in the Chamber if we feel that there are sufficient grounds for amending these reports. However, I would prefer this to be dealt with in a different way. The Planning Bill provided for the revision of national policy statements, and it would be more sensible if, at this stage, the Minister were to agree to approve these policies today, recognise their flaws and initiate an immediate review of everything in these statements. I shall turn to some other aspects that we need to think about in a moment. On Thursday, other aspects will be raised which we shall need to consider. I suggest that it is probably not possible to find solutions in the next few weeks to the concerns that we, as a Committee, have raised. Even if we take the matter into the summer, time will probably be too limited for serious and proper consideration of how we are to take this forward. It would be better to approve these statements, acknowledging the flaws in them.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000051"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100309142000229"></a>Lord Woolmer of Leeds:</b> Can the noble Lord confirm whether the position of his party on the future of this process is that amendments to the national policy statements will, in future, be subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament? If that were the case, would that mean that, if the Government of the day wished to add another specific location for a nuclear power station, that would become the subject of a political debate in both Houses of Parliament? In other words, will it become a political football?</p>

<p><a name="100309142000052"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100309142000230"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, the world of politics is the world of administration of society, and whatever we do will become political. However, if there is a change of Government after the election, at the moment, the policy is to keep the process, but it is possible to keep the process and amend, to a degree, the machinery. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Jenkin for doing his homework on this. The chairman of the IPC has said that what we are suggesting will work. Perhaps we can put that to bed. If we wanted to make the national policy statements subject to parliamentary approval, which at present they are not, legislation would be required. We have to face that. As always, the existing legislation stands and that is what we are dealing with today. What the future holds is very unpredictable at present. Like every other Member, I have to accept that, even though we have at least moderate confidence about our presence in this palace after the election.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000053"></a>I want to raise two other issues. My noble friend Lord Cope in a way raised the issue of waste heat from power stations. The problem applies to nuclear power stations just as it does to every other form of generation. We will not have an energy-efficient generating industry until we find a solution to this difficulty. It is a fact, whether we like it or not, that discharging warm water, even if you pour it from a deep pipe three miles out to sea, is a pollutant that changes the environment not only where it is released but downstream. We are extremely fortunate in this country that we have very good sea circulation around our islands that disperses this problem to a considerable degree. However, it would be better to find a use for that heat and keep it ashore. There are real difficulties with that.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000054"></a>Siting power stations on the coastline is very good for a host of reasons, but it makes the problem of waste heat more difficult to resolve, because you cannot easily use it for community heating, which was one of the roles that used to be fulfilled by the old Battersea power station. We forget that. It is a huge free energy source available for this country if someone could find a use for it. There is of course another problem. Any use that we find for it must be able to survive-if I may put it that way-during downtime in the power station when it closes down for maintenance, whether planned or emergency. The difficulty with the possible horticulture solution is the need for a backup heating system to enable the power station to shut down. There is therefore an argument for having at least two active reactors in each power station, whereby one at a time could be shut down. Even that would be difficult if the user were paying a business to supply the waste heat from both reactors. We need to recognise that there are real problems with this. Until we solve them, we will have an inefficient energy industry. That gives me no satisfaction, so we must find an answer.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000055"></a>There is nothing else that I want to raise, except to say that these documents must be approved. The Independent Planning Commission is ready to receive planning applications or, as I understand it, will be ready from around the end of this month. The brutal reality is that no one who wants to put in a planning application knows how to design that application until we have approved these documents. That is why all our backs are against the wall. I plead that we approve the documents now or, rather, at the end of the process, although the Minister should accept that they are flawed and that a proper review should be undertaken. I do not think that the suggestion that we debate them on the Floor of the House will take the matter forward one step.</p>
<h5><a name="100309142000199"></a>5.33 pm</h5>

<p><a name="100309142000056"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100309142000231"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> My Lords, I begin by welcoming back the prodigal daughter-the noble Baroness, Lady Young-to the nuclear fold. I have had long battles with her in the past. Noble Lords will remember something called Lappel Bank, about which she raised exactly the issue as to whether one very small part of a designated area could be transferred to productive economic use. I think that we need a sense of proportion in these things. I also do not quite understand the logic regarding Dungeness. If that power station is closed in due course and there is no replacement, who will then be there to shift the shingle around? So this site may be lost anyway.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000057"></a>I have three issues to raise in this debate. The first is process. Government documents project that by 2025, we will need 60 gigawatts of new generating capacity to cope with retirements and growth. This is a huge challenge when one remembers that the total generating capacity is about 120 gigawatts. According to the documents, only about 8 gigawatts of that additional capacity is under construction at present, so we have a large and urgent problem. The planning system must take some of the blame, though the lack of vision and courage shown, particularly in the energy White Paper of 2003, has also contributed.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000058"></a>I have always strongly supported the procedures in the recent Planning Act, of which this debate is a part. It is essential for projects such as those which we are considering to have a stage in which the Government express a view, after proper consultation, on whether a particular development is in the national interest and whether the sites envisaged for it are considered suitable. One cannot treat a nuclear reactor as though it was just the latest addition to Tesco's estate of superstores. The Government's proposals envisage that, if approved, the development will go on to be considered by the IPC.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000059"></a>I am unclear about what precisely the Opposition have envisaged, if they were elected, to deal with this problem. My concern is that if the intention is to throw the proposals back into a local planning debate, that would be a recipe for giving local people a veto on issues that have national implications. In practice, what will happen is that if a local inquiry opposed a development, the matter would be referred on appeal to the Secretary of State. The latter cannot simply overrule but has, in effect, to rerun the whole process to justify his decisions. So the years tick by, uncertainty grows, and costs mount.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000060"></a>One of the benefits of our being interrupted by a Division is that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has been able to draw my attention to something that I had not noticed before in the guidance note on their new policies. The aim is to retain the fast-track content of the Planning Bill procedures and to refer matters to a major infrastructure unit. The documents then states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000179"></a>"The Secretary of State will then be required to make a final decision on the application within a specified time limit on the basis of the material presented".</p>

<p><a name="100309142000165"></a>What assurance do we have that that discipline will be sustained? If it is not, we will not be much better off than we are now.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000061"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100309142000232"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I had exactly the same question. The answer I have been given is that the law will be changed and the Secretary of State will have three months after getting the recommendation from the major projects unit of the inspectorate. That will be statutory.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000062"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="100309142000233"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> I thank the noble Lord for that clarification. We will obviously need to look, if it ever comes about, at the small print.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000063"></a>The second issue is how decisions are taken on the mix of technologies to fill this 60-gigawatt gap. I have serious concerns here. On page 271, the national policy statement on nuclear power, which we are debating, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000180"></a>"The modelling also suggests of the 60GW, about 35GW would8 need to be renewables".</p>

<p><a name="100309142000166"></a>The Minister used the phrase "we estimate that". This is nothing whatever to do with modelling but arises from the decision taken by the former Prime Minister, in the face of strong advice from officials to the contrary, to sign up to the EU's targets for renewables. That is what is driving this. However, the rational, efficient way to decide on the share of different technologies is to line up all the options, whether classified as renewables or not, and then to create a merit order, taking those that score best first. The ranking could be a score card of cost per tonne of CO2 avoided, its contribution to strategic security of supply, and issues such as constancy versus intermittency. Is that what we are likely to get  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the prior carve-out of 35 gigawatts from renewables? Far from it. My rough calculations indicate a serious problem.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000064"></a>In January, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Crown Estate announced proposals for licensing what was described as 32 or 33 gigawatts of stored capacity of offshore wind. A cost figure of £75 billion was issued for this, but with wind the output is likely to be about 30 per cent of potential. In short, we would be paying £75 billion to secure 10 gigawatts of output, and intermittent output at that-that is, £7.5 billion per gigawatts. To achieve the same 10 gigawatts through nuclear power, you have to build something with about 11 gigawatts of capacity. My research indicates that a modern reactor of 1.6 gigawatts might cost £5 billion, which means that we would need about six or seven reactors, which might cost about £35 billion, compared with £75 billion-that is, about half the cost of offshore wind. That is on average. The divergence is even greater if one compares the cost of peak output, since wind cannot be relied on to produce when demand is highest, whereas with nuclear power, barring accidents and emergencies, by and large the maintenance is scheduled in the summer months, meaning that it can produce more than the average in the winter months.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000065"></a>I am also trying to establish whether there is an inverse correlation. Are wind speeds lower in colder weather? The data for the past three months, when analysed, may tell a very interesting story. A logical approach-not one pandering to green politics-would start with the most cost-effective technologies, of which nuclear power would be one, and then expand to the point where other technologies overtake them. Experience from France indicates that the optimum share of the 60 gigawatts would not be 25 out of 60 but probably 60 or 70 per cent of it.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000066"></a>But it gets worse. My evidence for this is a remarkable article by George Monbiot in the <I>Guardian</I> on 2 March. Saint George is the patron saint of the green movement, and I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, probably has a Saint George icon on his wall at home. If not, then I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, will. George Monbiot writes about the recently announced feed-in tariffs to encourage dispersed generation by micro wind and solar PV, technologies that he describes as "comically inefficient". Micro wind would earn 34 pence per kilowatt hour and solar panels 41 pence. That electricity is then sold to you and me at about 11 pence. He estimates-I do not know quite where he gets the figures from-that the scheme could cost £8.6 billion and by 2030 might save 20 million tonnes of CO2, at a cost of £430 per tonne of CO2 saved. He then quotes a McKinsey table of cost comparisons in which, for £3 invested in geothermal energy, you would save 1 tonne of CO2, while for £8 nuclear energy you would save 1 tonne and for insulating commercial buildings you do not pay £8 but save £60. The argument concludes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000181"></a>"So who is opposing this lunacy? Good question. The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace have lined up to denounce the government for not being generous enough".</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000067"></a>The real scandal here brings me to my third point, which is a constitutional one. It is clear that the promotion of renewables, particularly those of  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>microgeneration, will cost many billions of pounds, most of which will be paid by adding a surcharge to household and company bills. Much of the burden will fall on families of modest means, and the benefit will go to the better off. There is not much scope for installing wind turbines and solar panels on the tower blocks in which many of our poorest families live. A big house with a big roof and big grounds-dare I say it, even an estate-would of course be ideal. Worse still, not a penny of this money will feature in any Chancellor's budget, and none of it will be recorded in the Government's financial accounts. None of the subsidies will be voted on by Parliament in estimates and none of the receipts will be voted on in a Finance Bill. It will all be done by netting off electricity bills. That offends every canon in the role of Parliament in approving tax and spending.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000068"></a>My conclusion is that we must urgently press on with the renaissance of the nuclear sector. Therefore, I support this national policy statement, but, as I have indicated, I would go even further. A major report is needed on the way in which renewables, no matter how inefficient or costly, are given first dibs. We should give notice to the EU that we wish to renegotiate the renewables framework and replace it with a low-carbon framework. Finally, we need a new mechanism of transparency and accountability for the many billions of pounds that we have spent on encouraging renewables.</p>

Nothing illustrates that more decisively than President Obama, through the use of his presidential power to offer loan guarantees, giving the green light, two weeks ago, to the construction in the United States of the first nuclear power station there for 30 years. However, the western world is waking up late. There are apparently 56 reactors now under construction around the world, the majority in Asia. It is a tragedy that, when the West discovered what the Government here describes on page 12 of the NPS as,</p>
<ul><a name="100309142000190"></a>"the urgent need to decarbonise the economy",</ul>
<p><a name="100309142000167"></a>it did not take the opportunity to go for nuclear power. Instead it defined renewable energy to exclude nuclear energy and went down the fairytale route of wind power, a blind alley down which it continues today to pour scarce resources.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000073"></a>The advantages of nuclear power are well set out on pages 10 and 11 of the NPS, starting with the comprehensive and vibrant sentence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000182"></a>"Nuclear power is low-carbon, economic, dependable, safe, and capable of increasing diversity of energy supply and reducing our dependence on any one technology or country for our energy or fuel supplies".</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="100309142000168"></a>Nuclear power is the real thing. It confronts and answers the need for a constant, abundant and cheap source of electricity, unlike wind power which is irregular, scarce in the sense that it consumes huge resources to provide very little, and produces electricity at up to three times the cost of nuclear power. Wind power also occupies much more land space, provides far less permanent employment-let alone qualified permanent employment, to which the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan, referred-and its turbines have a half or a third of the life of nuclear power stations.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000074"></a>Nuclear power requires little addition to the grid as new stations are to be sited, for the most part, close to the present ones, and there will be no need to extend the grid substantially, whereas wind farms are to be sited far away from where the electricity they generate is required, to the great detriment of the landscape and of household bills, because enormous extra grid lines have to be built. The crucial difference-one not mentioned in the NPS and one which derives from all these comparative disadvantages-is that wind power requires subsidies of over £1 billion per annum today, paid for by the consumer, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, emphasised, and nuclear power requires none. If I understand it correctly, the substantial costs of decommissioning nuclear power stations are provided for by the generating companies with a 4 per cent charge added to electricity bills. I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that taxpayers have not paid in the past, are not paying today and are not being asked to pay in the future for the decommissioning costs of nuclear power stations.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000075"></a>The tragedy is that over the past 10 years we have lost our leading role in nuclear energy. Our new stations will have to be built by foreign consortia; we will have to wait in the international queue for their attention; and, in any case, we cannot expect production from new stations for up to 10 years. Meanwhile, as stated in the NPS at paragraph 2.2.1, up to 22 gigawatts of existing coal and nuclear power stations are due to be phased out. A ban has also been placed by the Government on any new coal power stations without carbon capture and storage-a completely unproven technology on the scale required.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000076"></a>As the contribution from wind power has to be ignored when calculating the generating capacity required to meet peak demand due to its unreliability, the result is a rapid increase in our dependence on gas. It is gas-fired power stations that are above all being built today. At the same time, our own gas fields are depleting rapidly so that by 2020, it has been calculated, we will be 70 per cent dependent on imported gas, yet our own gas storage has not kept pace with this development. We can store only some 4 per cent of our annual requirements compared with France's 24 per cent and 19 per cent in the case of Germany. Therefore, a very worrying 10 years, at least, stretch ahead.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000077"></a>In fact, there are two worries. The first is black-outs. This concern seems to be shared by Ofgem. Last month, Alistair Buchanan, the chief executive, was quoted as saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000183"></a>"It is the scale of collapse in energy supply from 2013 up until 2017 that is profound and worrying".</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="100309142000169"></a>It was he also, I think, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000184"></a>"In 2017 we get to the really sweaty-palm moment in terms of ... shortages".</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100309-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000078"></a>The second worry is the soaring price of electricity. Every new green measure seems to bring with it an additional charge to electricity consumers. I have seen one estimate that the funding of the £200 billion investment needed to reach the Government's targets would produce an increase in electricity bills of 100 per cent-in other words, a repeat of what we have seen since 2003.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000079"></a>The first very obvious result of this increase in electricity bills is a relentless rise in the number of those in fuel poverty-to over 4 million today, despite the Government's target to have it abolished by this year. However, apart from the effect on households, the less easily discernible but equally if not more dangerous effect is that on industry's costs. That was the subject of a Question at Question Time today. The result is simply bound to be an exodus of some firms and plants to places where they can continue to operate competitively, and the bankruptcy of others. As this will mean job losses, is this wise at a time of recession?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000080"></a>There is the usual section in the NPS devoted to climate change, where confident but, in my view, entirely unjustified assertions about the changing climate are made. I had something to say about this in our previous debate which I shall not repeat. However, I notice that on page 27, at paragraph 4.1.7, the IPC is warned to take account of the risk of tsunamis. Can the Minister perhaps say how the IPC is expected to do this? Will it be required to fly in experts from the United Nations or perhaps from Japan? And if it is told by experts, as it is bound to be, that there is some risk of tsunamis, what is it expected to do about it? Does it require the power station to be moved uphill? On page 19, the NPS warns us to expect,</p>
<ul><a name="100309142000191"></a>"increased ... intense rainfall events".</ul>
<p><a name="100309142000170"></a>What is the IPC expected to do about them ?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000081"></a>No doubt these warnings derive from the Met Office, which is one of the four official sources for the weather data relied on by the IPCC. The Met Office does not appear to have had an entirely happy time recently. On 5 January, I expressed surprise in the House that it had not abandoned seasonal forecasts since they had been proving so unsuccessful. The Met Office has now obliged. Last week, the <I>Times</I> announced that,</p>
<ul><a name="100309142000192"></a>"the Met Office is to abandon the seasonal forecasts that have brought it so much recent humiliation".</ul>
<p><a name="100309142000171"></a>One might have thought that if the Met Office were going to abandon forecasts for a few months ahead, it would at the same time abandon forecasting the climate 100 years ahead. No such luck, I am afraid. On the same day, the head of climate monitoring at the Met Office chose to confirm with all the authority of his office that our climate was changing rapidly-in all regions of the planet, he said-and he and his group stated that there was a 95 per cent chance that human activity was to blame. I should like to ask the Minister: when saying that it is retiring from making seasonal forecasts, is the Met Office withdrawing the forecasts that it has already made? In November, it went public with the prediction that 2010 would be one of the hottest years on record. Has that now been withdrawn

In fact, it is to a large extent made up of global warming missionaries, as can be appreciated by a glance at the latest issue of its magazine <I>Barometer</I>, whose zeal to demonstrate the result to which they are committed colours their forecasts, I suspect.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000082"></a>I find the Government's expectation that energy consumption in this country will not rise over the next 15 years, as the Minister repeated this afternoon, extremely difficult to share, given the expected large increase in population and past trends, unless of course a severe increase in electricity prices brings about another recession and a collapse in demand. That is hardly something to be wished for. But if that does not happen and consumption starts to rise again, as it always has done in the past, then the supply projected by the Government will not be sufficient. That is before one begins to consider the needs of electric cars, the sales of which the Government are also keen to promote with subsidies, without any evident concern for what this might do to electricity demand.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000083"></a>Governments once used to talk about the need for joined-up government. There is very little of that on show today in the field of energy, albeit that this particular NPS reveals the Government to have taken a most important, if tragically belated, step towards securing our future energy needs.</p>
<h5><a name="100309142000201"></a>5.57 pm</h5>

<p><a name="100309142000084"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100309142000238"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, first, I apologise for not being here for all the debate-I had to present a report to the EU Committee at four o'clock.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000085"></a>Perhaps I may start with a personal observation. The noble Lord, Lord Reay, spent quite some time rubbishing the Met Office. It is now based in Exeter and is an important part of the economy. It is a major centre of British and global expertise in a number of areas. It is highly respected. It certainly went too far in its seasonal weather forecasts, which were wrong, but it does not deserve its description in the noble Lord's speech. I would strongly defend that body.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000086"></a>During the previous NPS debate, I had to say, as a Liberal Democrat, that as we did not really believe in the IPC, to a degree I had a rather different view. As regards this debate, as Liberal Democrats do not believe in nuclear power, I suppose that I am doubly irrelevant. I can see the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, pointing to the empty chair that had been occupied by my noble friend Lord Maclennan. I agree that some Members on the Liberal Democrat Benches are in favour of nuclear power and it would be wrong to suggest otherwise.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000087"></a>We see a future that is built around renewables and carbon capture and storage, with a particular emphasis on energy efficiency. After researching and considering the subject of this debate, we do not have any real problem with it. First, there is the example of recent nuclear developments in Finland. The issue is similar to that of nuclear fusion, about which it is always said that it will be the technology of 50 years' time-it is always 50 years' time. It always seems to be the case that the nuclear power station in Finland will be completed in four years' time. At the moment it is 75 per cent ahead of its budget.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000088"></a>When the nuclear industry has been relatively successful in this country, there has been no real competition in the market. We had the Central Electricity Generating Board. Costs could be put out in an average fashion and consumers accepted them, because that was how it worked. We no longer have that lack of a market, and I welcome it; we have competition in the energy fields. However, there is a situation that I regret. The carbon price is some €12, whereas, if nuclear power is to make its way in any sense commercially, it probably needs to be around €50. Then there is international competition. Not only do we have difficulty around skills but it will be difficult to attract capital in capital formation or equity. Then there is the amount of debt that is needed and the raw materials required, too. The United States example has been mentioned, but the only way in which that programme is moving forward is by loan guarantee. Originally, the project there was expected to have some 50 per cent loans against 50 per cent equity; it will now be pretty well 100 per cent or at least 80 per cent loans. So there is a public guarantee and subsidy for the large majority of those construction costs. In a way, therefore, as a Liberal Democrat perhaps I need not be concerned-except to say that we put the emphasis and energies in the wrong places. However, as the Minister said, we are not here to debate that at the moment; we are here to look at this statement.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000089"></a>I found a number of interesting things. One was in the language on page 6, in the whole framework of what we are doing here. The last bullet point on the page says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000185"></a>"The IPC should start its examination of development consent applications for new nuclear power stations on the basis that need has been demonstrated and should give this need, and the benefits of meeting it, substantial weight in determining the applications".</p>

<p><a name="100309142000172"></a>I take that as a positive point, in that it should do that but it does not have to. That may rather broaden the scope of the IPC beyond what I expected.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000090"></a>I also took on board the point about tsunamis, although that may be something that we need not worry about too much. We also need not worry about nuclear power stations generating under 15 megawatts. On the Tamar, we have the old decommissioned nuclear reactors of submarines; perhaps we could use those for that. But that is clearly not very relevant to this.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000091"></a>There is one thing that has come to me through this that I genuinely cannot understand. What is the point of the IPC in this area and this document? What does it actually do? It is clear that the IPC is not just spatial, when other such bodies are not; it is site-specific. We do not have an IPC that looks at potential sites and decides which can be nuclear facilities; that is already done. Indeed, the document excludes the IPC from specifically looking at applications for sites beyond these 10. As the Minister said, the Government have already considered a further three and have decided that those should not be considered at present. It is not the role of the IPC to look at where nuclear sites should be, and it is not the role of this document to do that either. That is very much the role of the Government and the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000092"></a>I asked the same question of the Minister on the previous occasion. When and under what circumstances is the IPC able to say no? I see no circumstances under  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which there can be any answer but yes. The applicant comes through the door of the commission and says, "I have a nuclear application". The question is "Where?". The applicant mentions one of the 10 sites, and that is it. I do not understand what else can be said except that there are a couple of other things that the commission can look at. On page 18 is the heading, "Consideration of good design", so the IPC can say whether the nuclear power station should be art deco, neo-Georgian or perhaps classical. That is great. However, I do not see why the local authority could not do that. It would not get in the way of the strategic planning for the country. It could also look at a number of "siting criteria"-the phrase used on page 26-and move the deckchairs a little in terms of where the facilities are and how they are laid out. I see no reason why, even given the reason why we have these planning commissions, a local authority should not be able to do that. So why this document and this commission around nuclear? As far as I can see, everything has already been decided. It is in the power of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000093"></a>The other issue of particular concern is nuclear waste. The document is very honest and illuminating about it. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000186"></a>"The Government has therefore not set a fixed delivery timetable",</p>

<p><a name="100309142000173"></a>for nuclear waste. We know why. It is because they cannot get agreement on it and cannot deliver a strategy or a location for nuclear waste. The document goes on,</p>
<ul><a name="100309142000193"></a>"but in planning the implementation of the national policy of geological disposal, the NDA has assessed that a UK facility could be operational for the disposal of legacy ILW by about 2040".</ul>
<p><a name="100309142000174"></a>I suppose that is a start-it is 30 years ahead-but it goes on,</p>
<ul><a name="100309142000194"></a>"with legacy HLW/spent fuel emplacement beginning around 2075".</ul>
<p><a name="100309142000175"></a>That is 65 years ahead of where we are at present, but the document then goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000187"></a>"Disposal of legacy waste is estimated to be completed by around 2130".</p>

<p><a name="100309142000176"></a>We are looking 120 years ahead in this document. Many of us who went through the Climate Change Bill were rather concerned-although we thought it right to do so-about looking at targets for 2050, when I will be 98, but here we go to 2130. Finally, the document states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000188"></a>"It is possible to envisage a scenario in which onsite interim storage might be required for around 160 years".</p>

<p><a name="100309142000177"></a>I find that very concerning.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000094"></a>We have here something that pretends to be a national planning statement about nuclear power but is actually about power generation. That is absolutely accurate: it is the <I>Draft National Policy Statement for Nuclear Power Generation</I>. What it shows, admits and opens out completely is an utter inability to complete the supply chain in terms of where the waste from generation will be dealt with. That is a great concern.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000095"></a>I do not understand where this gets us. I welcome the spatial element of the report, which the other reports do not have-I find that strange-but it goes from nothing to micro: the appendices to the report show where the boundaries will be.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000096"></a>Finally, the document is site-specific. We have only 10 sites in total. Another three were rejected, and it is unlikely that others will come up in a short time. Given the limited ownership of these sites and the limited ability to finance nuclear power, what will happen if these companies are unable to develop the sites themselves but wish to sit on them for appreciation? Will we be held to ransom because we have only 10 sites that are controlled by even fewer corporate organisations?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000099"></a>This has been a very interesting debate, as was the previous debate. Much has been said in the consideration of the draft policy statement. Rather than repeat the issues which have been explored around the Room, I shall keep my remarks brief. I thank my noble friends Lord Jenkin, Lord Cope, Lord Dixon-Smith and even Lord Reay. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Broers, in particular, for sharing his concerns on the legacy issues and the continuing need for a strong research base-well, I would say that; I have already declared my interest. I even enjoyed the spirited defence by the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, of his party's dithering. I hope that he will not beat me up for the few words that I shall now say.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000100"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith about the time that it has taken the Government to get to this stage. At every stage of the process, we have had to push to take the necessary decisions and implement the necessary legislative framework. The draft statement is an important step along the way, but it is late in the day and is certainly not sufficient, given the position in which we will find ourselves when the current generation of nuclear power stations come to the end of their lives.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000101"></a>The Government's indecision on nuclear power will have huge consequences. Last year, figures were released showing that the Government were predicting power cuts from 2017, starting with a shortfall of 3,000 megawatt hours a year and rising to 7,000 megawatt hours by 2025. We seem to be back in the 1970s. We have an enormous government deficit, public sector strikes and, now, government-sanctioned power cuts. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether this assessment still stands. Are the Government still expecting power cuts between 2017 and 2025?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000102"></a>The draft statement makes a nod towards the need for early deployment of new power stations. How many of the 10 sites might end up being developed under this fast-track process? Will any of the next-generation power stations be completed before the lights start to go out? I join my noble friend Lord Jenkin in asking whether the Government are confident that 10 sites will be developed by 2025. What contingency plans have they put in place if there are further delays or obstacles in the application or building process?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000103"></a>One source of delay that can be identified in advance is the possibility of court action taken by those who oppose nuclear build in its entirety against a planning decision to green-light an application. The Government's  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>refusal to take responsibility for any major planning decision will only play into the hands of those seeking to delay any building until it is considered too expensive to continue. The chair of the Law Society's Planning and Environmental Law Committee, Mr David Brock QC, said in an evidence session in another place:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100309142000189"></a>"I would have thought it almost inevitable that somebody would have a go using judicial review ... It seems to me that if we are trying to get the policy in place in a short timeframe that is something that must be addressed and considered".</p>

<p><a name="100309142000104"></a>I urge the Government to accept the Conservative policy of ensuring parliamentary approval for national policy statements to remove the risk of vastly increased costs and timelines from such court cases.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000105"></a>Challenges against the necessary planning decisions, whether through the courts or the IPC's decision-making process, can be reduced by making a clear statement early on about just what is expected from those making an application. The costs and safety issues of decommissioning and waste management are of course critical, as is the impact on the local and wider environment. Will the Minister guarantee that applications will be assessed rigorously to ensure that all costs will be met by the commercial partner and not the taxpayer?</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000106"></a>Opposition to development can also be countered by genuine engagement with local concerns and sensitivities. Indeed, given the high level of local popularity that existing power stations tend to enjoy, any sudden surge in opposition should be looked at very closely to see what has gone wrong with the consultation process.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000107"></a>As energy and environmental concerns have grown over the past 15 years, we have consistently said that nuclear could have a place in the mix of energy supplies, as long as it is economically viable and does not require subsidy. The Government have taken a long time to get to the same position. It appears that they are still struggling to make the necessary commitments to future steps. With such short-sighted thinking, it is no surprise that the future of our energy sector is looking still so shaky. I hope very much that the continuing opposition to any sort of nuclear generation from the official view of the Benches to my left will not cause Labour's commitment to nuclear power to wobble any more. Any further delay, I believe, would be disastrous to the energy security of our country.</p>

Like the first, it has been extremely interesting and we have covered a lot of ground. It is a great pleasure for me to respond to the many points that have been made. My noble friend Lord O'Neill has taken me to task both here and in meetings that I have attended in the NIA, to which I pay tribute, on the speed with which we produce the national policy statements.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000109"></a>My noble friend is right. I would have liked to have produced them earlier and for us to have got through the process of parliamentary scrutiny, consultation and designation before the election, which would have provided greater certainty. But we have not done that. As my noble friend also suggested, that is because this work has required very careful analysis and production. It has been more important to get the thing as right as we can, rather than be overhasty and then run into severe problems.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000110"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, mentioned judicial review issues. I am sure it is entirely possible that some aspect of the new planning system might be taken for judicial review, which confirms the point that we really have to get this right. The scrutiny that the national policy statements undergo is an important part of ensuring that we consider all the issues and get this as right as we can.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000111"></a>It is inevitable that we come back to the principles of this new planning system and it is entirely right that we should continue to debate it. But the fact is that Parliament has now decided very clearly that the role of Ministers should be to set policy. That policy should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It would be then for the IPC, as an independent body, to make independent consent decisions. If one were to depart from that, the waters would be muddied in quite a difficult way. That is why we have never thought that it would be appropriate for Parliament to approve the national policy statements, because in the end that should be a ministerial decision. Nor do we think that it should be for Ministers to make the individual planning consent. Over the years, we have seen-this is not a political point, but just the subject of experience-that Ministers have sometimes found it very difficult to make those kinds of decisions. That is why I believe we have got this structure right.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000112"></a>I really must respond to the criticism made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, regarding the Government's progress in coming forward with policy in relation to nuclear energy. I have always been a strong supporter of nuclear energy and, like my noble friend Lord O'Neill, I wish that we could have made more progress. However, very careful attention has been needed to build the consensus required to enable us to have confidence in new nuclear. My noble friend thought that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was suffering from some form of amnesia. In view of the lively contributions that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has made to our debates over the years, I do not think that, but I have endless quotations here from statements made by the Official Opposition over the years expressing doubts about nuclear power and describing it as a last option. I do not think that it will do now to portray the party opposite as having a consistent policy of supporting nuclear over the years. That simply is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000113"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100309142000241"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Does the quotation which he has about nuclear being a last option include the honourable gentleman in another place withdrawing that remark?</p>

However, the important point that I want to make to the noble Lord is that the party opposite has not had a consistent approach in supporting new nuclear power.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000115"></a>The position now is that we have the national policy statement, and it is clear that the Government believe that nuclear power has a very important role to play in tackling the challenges that we face. It is low-carbon, secure and reliable, and we believe it to be cost-effective.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000116"></a>Two issues have been put forward by noble Lords. First, it is said that we face severe energy issues over the next 10 years and, secondly, there is a criticism that we are putting too much emphasis on renewable energy. I shall respond, first, to the noble Lord, Lord Reay, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, about the so-called question of the lights going out. Of course, I read the reports produced by Ofgem with interest. Ofgem is an economic regulator; it is not charged with energy policy. Sometimes I think that Ofgem needs to reflect on what it is there to do, rather than produce rather speculative reports from time to time. It is the Government's responsibility to establish policy in relation to energy and it is our job to ensure that there is security of supply. We will do that. Plenty of energy generation is due to go out of commission over the next 10 or 15 years but, even taking on board the impact of the emission standards legislation from Europe and the natural decommissioning of many of our nuclear power stations, the fact is that over 20 gigawatts of energy supply have just been constructed, are in construction or have received all planning consents, and more gigawatts are coming along in the pipeline.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000117"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Reay, raised the question of UKCS. I know that we disagree about the amount of gas that will be required in 2020, and it is really a question of the calculation made about reduced demand, but our best estimate is that in 2020 UKCS could still provide about 50 per cent of our gas requirement. We have seen a big increase in our import capacity. There are many storage projects in the pipeline. When people talk about blackouts in 2017, they sometimes refer to an appendix in a document produced by my department. That appendix refers to outages which happen at the moment-short-term, temporary outages. That is very different from suggesting that suddenly our whole energy supply will collapse at some time in the next decade. That is simply not going to happen.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000118"></a>As regards the mix, the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, made an interesting, almost Treasury-style, analysis on the question of where we should be putting our money in terms of energy supply. I understand what he is saying. I would say to him, first, that we should not put all our eggs in one basket. Diversity of supply is important for energy security. Secondly, renewables should play an important role in the future. We have an incredible resource, particularly in onshore and offshore wind, and in tidal energy. I take the point about cost, but, first, I would refer the noble Lord to his noble friend Lord Stern's overriding analysis that it is better that we get on with moving towards a low-carbon economy now, rather than wait for years and then have to pay much more. Secondly, we expect the cost of renewables to reduce over the years, which is why the renewables obligation certificate system is predicated in the way that it is.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000119"></a>I hardly ever agree with George Monbiot and I do not agree with him about FITs. It is Parliament which was insistent that we develop feed-in tariffs. I well recall the debates that I came into at a very late stage in relation to feed-in tariffs and the renewable heat incentive. There was a very strong consensus in both Houses that we should go down this route. It was  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pointed out by one noble Lord in the debate that we were criticised because we are projecting that only 2 per cent of our electricity needs will come from feed-in tariffs in 2020. However, they have an important role to play.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000120"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100309142000243"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> Before my noble friend leaves that point, will he explain how feed-in tariffs will help the poorest people in our community? My understanding is that feed-in tariffs will be subsidised by everyone who consumes electricity. Therefore, the most vulnerable will be making, as usual, a disproportionate contribution to that form of subsidy. Would it not be better to lay greater emphasis on social tariffs in a way which we are not doing nearly enough at the moment?</p>

If it were the case that the sole beneficiaries of feed-in tariffs and the renewable heat incentive were well-off people, that would not be right and I would not support it. We do bear that point in mind. I have to say that we are very supportive of schemes that are being developed whereby, for instance, social landlords in a position to get the benefit of the feed-in tariff are thus able to invest in microgeneration, and the tenants receive the benefit of lower bills as a result. I very much understand my noble friend's point and I refer him to the Energy Bill, now in our House, in which we introduce mandatory social tariffs, which is a very good start. My noble friend is right on the substantive point that we need to be careful to ensure that our interventions do not cause problems for the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000124"></a>It has taken me some time to get to the issue of the 10 sites. The whole basis of this matter is that, in principle, we believe that new nuclear power should be free to contribute as much as possible to meeting the needs for 25 gigawatts of new capacity. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, started this debate about whether 10 sites are enough. He raised a number of factors which he thought might make it very difficult to reach 25 gigawatts, particularly in the timescale of 2025. Of course, there are uncertainties. There is no certainty that development consent on all sites listed in the NPS will be granted. I return to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that it is wrong for him to assume that the IPC will automatically give consent to each application simply because a site is listed as potentially suitable in the national policy statement. For that reason we felt it necessary to include all 10 sites to ensure that sufficient sites are available for development. It is not possible to predict whether there will be one or more reactors on each of the 10 sites.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000125"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100309142000247"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I do not normally interrupt the Minister but I genuinely do not understand the basis on which the IPC can say no. There is an absolute presumption, in the way in which the report is written, that these sites are suitable for nuclear power. It is  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>much stronger than the usual planning regime-I think they are called PPSs. On what basis, which would not immediately be appealed against in some way, can they say no?</p>

<p><a name="100309142000126"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100309142000248"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> The national policy statement clearly sets out the need, as the Government see it and as is their duty. The IPC is required to make decisions in line with national policy statements, unless it is in breach of a statutory duty or it is unlawful and so on. It also has to have regard to other documents, such as any local impact reports submitted by any relevant local authority, any regulatory matters which will affect the development, or any other matters which it is thought are important and relevant to that decision. Then it has to weigh up carefully the information provided in the application and in other material which is presented during its examinations to ensure that any identified adverse effects, including longer-term impacts and any cumulative impacts from the application, are taken into account and mitigated. If the IPC is satisfied that the adverse impacts identified outweigh the benefit of the proposed development consent, consent should be refused. It is quite clear that the integrity of the whole system must rest on the ability of the IPC to refuse consent if the adverse impacts outweigh the benefits. That is where the 10 sites come in. Quite clearly, it could refuse applications.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000127"></a>The other issue on the 10 sites is that we do not know whether one reactor or more might be applied for or given consent. As a general guide, a single reactor at each of the 10 sites will result in 12 to 17 gigawatts of nuclear capacity, depending on the reactor technology chosen. We did not consider it appropriate to include more than 10 sites in the NPS at this stage when the need is balanced against the potential harm to Natura 2000 sites. The number of sites would not necessarily be a barrier to the number of power stations because, as I have said, you could put two or more stations on most of the sites listed. I suspect that the real barrier is access to finance and the willingness of companies to make multi-billion pound investments.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000128"></a>I turn again to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, who asked whether we would be held to ransom by companies which hold sites but will not develop them. We certainly do not intend to be held to ransom. I make it clear that these have to be commercially viable projects, because they will not be subsidised by the taxpayer. Clearly, as we debated last time and as was debated in the Select Committee in the other place, it is for the Government to ensure-we are working on energy market assessments at the moment-that the conditions are right in which companies would wish to take those developments forward. That is very much the role of the Government, but it does not put us in a position where we could be held to ransom, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, suggested.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000129"></a>Carbon price, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Reay, is an issue, given the low price of carbon. Of course, the tightening of the cap from 2013 onwards will have a positive impact. But we have always said that we will keep the price under review and that we would be prepared to look at options for dealing with this issue. As part of the work that we are undertaking  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC86"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the energy market assessment, we are looking at that matter. We hope that the initial outcome of the EMA will be produced around the time of the Budget, whenever that may be.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000130"></a>What happens if the 10 sites prove not to be enough? Should the need arise, the Government could and would issue a second call for nominations for credible sites. That option is certainly open to us. If a site not listed is applied for by a developer, the IPC will exam the application and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State.</p>

I shall come on deal with specific sites-particularly Cumbria, Dungeness and Oldbury-but I want, first, to respond to my noble friend Lord O'Neill about the situation in Scotland and to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, who is not alone in the Liberal Democrat Party in supporting nuclear power. In the happy event that the SNP loses control, decision-making for nuclear power stations in Scotland will remain devolved. The IPC's remit is limited to England and Wales. However, I agree with my noble friend: when one looks at the history of fantastic skills, it just seems a tragedy that we are in this position in Scotland at the moment, and we must surely hope that good sense will prevail in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000134"></a>I turn to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, in relation to Cumbria. Essentially, he raised a number of concerns about the greenfield site and about the cumulative impact of three sites in Cumbria. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, reported that he thought that the county council was being recommended not to support that. I make it clear that the question here is: how is the cumulative impact of three sites in one county taken into account? I should point out that the draft NPS has identified potential cumulative impacts-for example, on biodiversity and visual and landscape impacts-as well as, on the plus side, opportunities for employment and supporting industries. The assessment found that there was scope for mitigation of some of these adverse impacts but that in some cases full mitigation was unlikely. However, at this early stage in the planning process, it is very difficult to pre-empt which of the sites might come through, when that might happen and, indeed, whether all of them will achieve planning consent. Therefore,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the NPS we have not ruled out sites on the basis of cumulative effects. We have highlighted the effects for the careful consideration of the IPC.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000135"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="100309142000252"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I am very grateful to my noble friend for giving way. He makes the point that you must weigh the economic and employment prospects against the scenic and landscape character arguments. Do the Government also take seriously the fact that, although we are talking about local employment, we are talking also about a national park, which is there for the enjoyment of the whole nation, where those from appalling urban city centres, and so on, can come and regenerate their lives?</p>

<p><a name="100309142000136"></a><b><a name="100309-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="100309142000253"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> Yes, my Lords. The overarching NPS states that,</p>
<ul><a name="100309142000195"></a>"the IPC should consider how the accumulation of effects might affect the environment, economy or community as a whole, even though they may be acceptable when considered on an individual basis with mitigation measures in place".</ul>
<p><a name="100309142000178"></a>In addition, the nuclear NPS specifically asks the IPC to consider cumulative effects, including the impact on the Lake District National Park. The IPC is well able to come to a proper judgment on those matters.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000137"></a>On transmission and RWE, I can tell the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Chorley, that we will explore with the national grid whether that decision affects the deployability of the sites by 2025 and whether they should remain on the list. Until we have explored with the grid, it is not clear that a lapsed agreement would impact. The real issue for us is to establish whether the agreement could be resurrected without a significant problem. I cannot say any more about it, except to reassure noble Lords that we are very alert to the position here.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, says that it is premature to reject Dungeness as a site, and the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is supportive of the position. We excluded Dungeness because the Government did not believe that a new nuclear power station could be built there without causing adverse impacts on the integrity of the Dungeness special area of conservation or that any impacts could be avoided or mitigated. Additionally, the imperative reasons of overriding public interest did not extend to Dungeness due to the alternatives available.</p>

Dungeness is the only nominated site that overlaps with a European site to such an extent that avoidance of adverse effects is not possible and mitigation of the effects of direct land take is also not considered possible. However, as I said to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, two weeks ago, I do not have a closed mind. We will, of course, consider representations made during the consultation, but the Government reached their current view after the most careful assessment and having taken advice from our statutory advisers and environmental consultants. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young, pointed out, Dungeness, as a special area of conservation, is the most important shingle site in the UK and Europe and one of the largest shingle expanses in the world. I have consulted my officials, who have yet to discover the spiritual nature of the shingle, but we are ever hopeful that, in the true pathway of the department, we might get there.</p>

The advice that I have received is that it could possibly stabilise the shingle, but the unique feature of the shingle is that it is constantly moving, which is why there are unique ecosystems growing on it. If you stabilise it, you will not get the same ecosystems. I suspect that we will debate this again in future. It has to be carefully looked at.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000147"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, and my noble friend Lord Judd asked whether, notwithstanding the assessment that has taken place on individual sites within the NPS, the IPC will undertake site-by-site consideration of these matters. The habitats assessment has been made at the NPS level but, as with the overriding judgment, it will need to be done by a developer when an application is brought forward. We will make that explicit when we revise the national policy statement.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000148"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, who is a strong supporter of the nuclear policy in general, expressed concerns about the cooling towers in the development at Oldbury. The existing Magnox station is direct-cooled. It passes water from the Severn directly through its condensers and back into the river. The new station may have more than eight times the electrical capacity of the current station. If it were direct-cooled, it would need to extract from and discharge into the river in the order of eight times the quantity of water. The fear is that the warm water discharge would impose an unacceptable heat load on the river and the estuary.  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is why an indirect cooling system would be required. The sustainability appraisal recognises that, given the height of the reactor buildings and the assumed highest cooling towers, methods of mitigation are limited and that all visual effects will be mitigated fully. If an application came forward, the IPC would have to consider the issue using the guidance on visual impact in the overarching NPS. The IPC would have to judge whether the visual effects on sensitive receptors, such as local residents and visitors to the area, outweigh the benefits of the project. It is also worth bearing in mind that before the IPC will formally accept an application, the developer will have to have gone through extensive local consultation.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000149"></a>I understand that one of the developers, Horizon Nuclear Power, has stated publicly that it is looking at all cooling tower options, which may include cooling towers shorter than 70 metres, such as hybrid cell towers, and it will consult on the feasible options as part of its pre-application consultation. I take the point that the noble Lord raised, and I hope that he will accept that, as with the other site, this is not a done deal and that there are specific reasons why cooling towers have been proposed. This will all have to be considered if the NPS is adopted with the sites currently in it. Those matters will have to be gone into very carefully by the developer with the local community before the formal application can be accepted by the IPC.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000150"></a>Very interesting points about nuclear waste were raised by the noble Lords, Lord Broers, Lord Teverson and Lord Dixon-Smith, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. I want to reassure noble Lords that the issue of waste is important and is taken very seriously. That is why our policy is that before consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, we need to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist, or will exist, to manage and dispose of the waste that they will produce. We have grasped the nettle of dealing with the UK's nuclear legacy waste. We are committed to doing that in a cost-effective and competent way. We have set up the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. It is responsible for decommissioning and clear-up. It is also the first UK organisation to have a complete overview of all types of civil nuclear radioactive waste, which leads to the setting of effective waste-management strategies.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000151"></a>Sellafield is a large complex and nuclear/chemical facility. It has supported the UK nuclear power programme since the 1940s. I agree that the decommissioning of Sellafield is a huge challenge. I chair the Sellafield Remediation Forum, which is a regular meeting of all those concerned to make sure that progress is being made and the issue is now being tackled in a much more coherent way. The forum is making good headway and I can assure noble Lords that the Government are committed to a safe and secure environmental decommissioning of the site. Although one can never be complacent or underestimate the challenges at Sellafield, there are real signs of progress.</p>

I was going to come on to that issue, but shall deal with it now. The fact is that taxpayers are having to put a lot of money into the decommissioning legacy. We have learnt the lessons of that, so that when it comes to new nuclear development we are absolutely clear that the cost of decommissioning must be met by the developers. We have established the financial framework, and we are still engaged in consultation and argument about the exact way that the contribution will be made, but we are clear that that cost must fall to the developer. We are setting up mechanisms that will avoid the issue of the taxpayers' contribution to legacy waste.</p>

<p><a name="100309142000154"></a>We have made progress on the long-term management of highly radioactive waste. Some noble Lords were worried about the timescale. The exact timing of the process for siting a geological disposal facility is, in part, driven by discussions with local communities and a willingness to move forward at each stage of the process. This is a siting process based on volunteerism, partnership and experience in the UK and overseas, which suggests that such an approach is the most likely way to succeed in siting a facility.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000155"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is worried about the dates. The NDA's planning assumptions are that the first waste emplacement will be in a geological disposal facility by 2040, with legacy high-level waste spent fuel emplacement beginning around 2075 and disposal of legacy waste estimated to be completed by about 2130. These dates are caveated to recognise that the early pace is guided by the volunteer communities involved in the process and are governed by the years of cooling required for the waste material. I have picked up from the DECC Select Committee and your Lordships' committee, which is investigating the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, that there is a desire for firmer time guides in relation to this issue. We will of course consider that very carefully when we respond to the parliamentary process. However, I am convinced that the approach that we set out-interim and very secure storage on-site and then geological disposal-is the right way forward. There seems to be an emerging international consensus in this area, but we will of course pay very close attention to this as we go forward.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000156"></a>I should like to turn to a number of other issues. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, raised Finland. Yes, lessons are to be learnt from that. We believe that the key lesson we have learnt is that it is much better to do a lot of the regulatory work at the design stage, rather than wait until a facility is half way to being built and then discover that there are problems. The generic design assessment, which is being taken forward by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is a way of dealing with that. The process is going well. I believe that it is on time. I hope that it will ensure that we do not have the kind of problems to which the noble Lord referred.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000157"></a>I should also say that I hope very soon to lay the legislative reform order that will lead to the reform of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and set it up as a separate body with, none the less, close links to the Health and Safety Executive.

If we can energise institutions and tempt young people into the sector, we can give them the skills that they need for the fantastic careers ahead of them. We have launched the National Skills Academy for Nuclear and so far have invested £3 million in it. It is led by employers from across the nuclear sector. I hear very good things about it and the work that it is doing. We will shortly release a new report that looks at the specific skills and capability needs behind nuclear new build in the UK.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000159"></a>I very much agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Broers, about research and university support. We are supporting nuclear skills development with the involvement of universities. In January 2009, we established Nuclear FIRST at the University of Manchester to provide a national training centre for doctoral scientists and engineers in nuclear fission science and technology. We have also established the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, which will be owned and run by the University of Sheffield. The University of Manchester is part of the management consortium that is running the National Nuclear Laboratory, which will be a world class nuclear science and technology laboratory.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000160"></a>On nuclear research, EPSRC spending on nuclear research has increased substantially over the past few years. Its programme, Keeping the Nuclear Option Open, has been provided with £6 million over four years. I very much take the point made by the noble Lord, and I will certainly take the opportunity to discuss with the relevant bodies the need to make sure that we step up our game in relation to research.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000161"></a>On the supply chain, my noble friend Lord O'Neill and the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Broers, made the point that we have to develop a UK supply chain. The global nuclear renaissance provides a multibillion pound opportunity for industries involved in the supply of goods and services. There is no reason whatever why this country cannot create a globally competitive UK nuclear supply chain. Last summer, I attended a conference organised by EDF. More than 300 British companies were invited to get really involved and to become part of a strong, vibrant UK supply chain. The Government are looking at ways to ensure that business in the UK is able to make the most of the opportunities available.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000162"></a>We should remember that we can argue about at what point this Government made the decision in relation to new nuclear, but globally we are well ahead of many countries. There is a great opportunity if we can move ahead as quickly as possible, but not just in terms of the investment that will take place in the UK. I am convinced that we can also become a centre of excellence that we can export to other countries. Of course, we should not forget that we are not starting from scratch. We are building on an industry that may have considered that it was moving towards a decommissioning mode; none the less, it is a very good foundation and it is vital that we do not lose that possibility.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000163"></a>I return to the question of timing raised by the noble Lord, Lord Broers. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, is always chiding me about progress and timetables. Can we learn from the Chinese? I suspect that we can learn some things, but I doubt whether planning consent is an issue that the Chinese Government have to worry about too much. We need a robust planning system. As my noble friend Lord O'Neill said, we need a system where people feel that they can put their point across. We do not need a Sizewell B public inquiry where hundreds of days are spent arguing about whether to have nuclear excluding proper discussion of the local impact of a nuclear power station. Essentially, that is what the new planning arrangements will give us.</p>

<a name="100309-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100309142000164"></a>I am confident that we are on time. If we look at the progress being made in the industry with the establishment of the IPC and the work that has been undertaken by the nuclear inspectorate and in relation to the national policy statements, I am confident that we are still on time. I am confident that the Government will do everything that we can to support the development of the new nuclear industry. We will have to consider very carefully the comments that we have received and the parliamentary scrutiny of the national policy statements but, having done that, we can then move towards designation or adoption of the national policy statements. I believe that we are very much in business and that we have been given a second chance concerning nuclear. The first time around, for many reasons, this country did not take advantage of the opportunity in the way that it might have done, as it was at an early stage of peaceful civil nuclear development. We have been given another opportunity and there is huge potential for this country in terms of energy security and also in terms of investment in jobs and exports. It is very important that we take advantage of that.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10030970000004"></a>I wish to inform the House that my department is extending our PFI contract with Paradigm, a wholly owned subsidiary of EADS, to enable the communications satellite, Skynet 5D, to be completed and launched. The Skynet 5 constellation provides the communication capability vital to the success of our military operations. Skynet 5D is partially built and was originally designated as a back-up option should any Skynet 5 satellite fail to perform as required. Recent work has demonstrated that the current capability of the Skynet 5 constellation (Skynet 5A, B and C) will be exceeded by around the middle of this decade. Skynet 5D will be launched in 2013 to meet an anticipated increase in demand for communications bandwidth between 2015 and 2020.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10030970000005"></a>The deal with Paradigm will increase the value of the PFI contract by over £400 million to about £3.5 billion. As well as securing essential military capability, it will also directly create around 100 new jobs, mainly at EADS Astrium/Paradigm sites in Portsmouth and Stevenage and sustain a large number at both sites and also in Corsham, Wiltshire.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10030970000008"></a>It is my aim to modernise the local bus service regulatory framework and improve the passenger bus experience for everyone. As a result of discussions with stakeholders following the coming into force of the Local Transport Act regulations and guidance, and after careful consideration, the Department for Transport now seeks views on a small number of changes to secondary legislation. These changes would improve the provision of reliable and up-to-date information, reduce administrative costs for local authorities and bidders for service contracts, increase the scope for securing a better deal on fares for passengers and ensure stricter compliance with the code of conduct for drivers and passengers. This includes, as part of the Government's commitment to improving personal

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10030970000011"></a>Together with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary (Alan Johnson) I am today consulting on whether current legislation relating to dangerous dogs adequately protects the public and encourages responsible dog ownership. The aim is to review current legislation better to protect the public; help enforcers tackle those who abuse the law; and stop the abuse suffered by dogs that end up in the wrong hands. The consultation will run until 1 June, and during the consultation period, I will meet a wide variety of stakeholders to discuss their views. The consultation looks at:</p>
extending dangerous dogs law to cover all places including private property;giving police and councils more powers to tackle the problem of dangerous dogs by the introduction of dog control notices;either getting rid of exemption rules that allow some people to keep banned types of dogs or if exemptions are to remain ensuring that the system works more effectively;what to do about the list of banned breeds;introduction of compulsory microchipping for dogs so that dog owners can be more easily traced; and,introduction of compulsory third party insurance so that victims of dog attacks are financially recompensed.

This proposed directive has been developed by the Commission with the assistance of member states, including the UK, and industry. The proposed directive also takes the opportunity to provide greater clarity on the responsibilities of users, including owners, importers and manufacturers, and so should improve compliance and enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10030970000016"></a>There will be a progress report on the proposal for a directive on aviation security charges. The UK will as ever work towards achieving a fair and proportionate outcome that balances the interests of passengers and airports.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10030970000017"></a>The council will be asked to reach a general approach on a regulation on investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation. The UK supports this measure in principle, as improved assistance and co-operation in the investigation of accidents and incidents would facilitate improved understanding of the causes of such events and lead to improved safety in aviation across Europe. My officials have been negotiating to secure amendments to the proposed regulation which better align it with UK interests. Good progress has been made on those areas of concern to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10030970000025"></a>I am also today publishing as final policy planning policy statement 25 supplement: <I>Development and Coastal Change</I>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="10030970000026"></a>I am placing copies of these two consultations, both of which close on 1 June, and the final policy on development and coastal change, along with an accompanying summary of consultation responses to that policy, in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10030970000027"></a>Moving towards a low-carbon economy requires a revolution in the way we design, heat and power our buildings. Planning must respond to this challenge, and help make low-carbon lifestyles the norm. Whatever is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future, past emissions mean that some climate change is already inevitable. As well as planning for a low-carbon future we must therefore also plan for a future with a changing climate-and do this in a way that protects our natural and cultural heritage.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10030970000029"></a>The draft planning policy statement: <I>Planning for a Low-Carbon Future in a Changing Climate</I> updates and brings together in one place existing planning policy on climate change and renewable energy. When finalised, this streamlined policy will be central to our national series of planning policy statements, and operate alongside the new suite of national policy statements for energy infrastructure. It will provide the overarching framework for our planning policies on climate change, both on measures to reduce carbon and to adapt to a changing climate.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="10030970000030"></a>We already have planning policy on climate change (published in 2007) and renewable energy (2004). This consultation brings together this policy into a single document and reflects the ambition to tackle climate change set out in the <I>Low Carbon Transition Plan</I>. This Government's determination to transform how we use energy was underlined when we published on 2 March 2010 <I>Warm Homes, Greener Homes</I> (<a href="http://www">www</a>. decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/consumers/saving_energy/hem/hem.aspx). This strategy sets out the key role of local government and planning in driving the development of renewable heat networks.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="10030970000031"></a>Moving to a low-carbon economy will now be central to planning strategies and decisions on planning applications. Planning decisions will help business and communities build a low-carbon future, not stand in their way. In building this low-carbon future, we remain committed to protecting our valued natural and historic environments. We are making no change to established green belt policy. We need to plan for unprecedented changes but we do not expect local communities to acquiesce to proposals with unacceptable impacts.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="10030970000032"></a>To help introduce and operate this new planning policy, I am making available a package worth £9.75 million to develop the new skills and improve capacity across the range of local authority responsibilities needed to tackle climate change. This will help strengthen the skills and knowledge needed by planners, including in planning for increased renewable energy supply and encouraging local communities to take positive action on climate change.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="10030970000034"></a>The new draft planning policy statement <I>Planning for a Natural and Healthy Environment</I> streamlines and consolidates existing planning policy on biodiversity, geological conservation, landscape, agricultural land quality, heritage and undeveloped coasts, open space, and land and facilities for sport and recreation. This provides a clearer and more strategic national policy framework for the protection and enhancement of the natural environment, and the provision of sufficient areas of open space, and land and facilities for sport and recreation to meet the needs of communities. In doing so, the policy statement demonstrates our commitment to the natural environment has not changed.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10030970000035"></a>In bringing together policies on the natural environment and open spaces, I am also meeting the commitment made in <I>World Class Places</I> to publish planning policy to deliver green infrastructure. Green infrastructure can provide a wide range of environmental benefits in both rural and urban areas including flood water storage, sustainable drainage, urban cooling and local access to shady outdoor space. It also provides habitats for wildlife, and through the creation and enhancement of "green corridors", should aid the natural migration of more species responding to the changing climate.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="10030970000037"></a>The supplement to planning policy statement 25 <I>Development and Coastal Change</I> provides planning policy to help communities manage and adapt to coastal change. Positive planning has an important role in helping communities to manage risk and adapt to an ever changing coastline.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="10030970000038"></a>To complement the strong planning policy to manage coastal flooding in planning policy statement 25 (PPS25), the new planning policy extends the PPS25 strategic risk-based approach to manage future physical changes to the coastline. This will help communities to adapt over time to changing coastlines. This will also prevent new development from being put at risk by avoiding inappropriate development in areas that are vulnerable to coastal change and directing development away from these areas. It provides a flexible planning approach so that appropriate development that would support the economic and social viability of a community is able to go ahead, but will be safe.</p>

I will today lay before the House the regulations necessary to bring these new fees into force.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="10030970000041"></a><b><a name="100309-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="10030970000057"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="10030970000042"></a>The Welsh Language Act 1993 requires that in the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in Wales, English and Welsh are to be treated on the basis of equality, so far as is appropriate in the circumstances and reasonably practicable. Participants in criminal and civil trials in Wales have the right to use the Welsh language in court.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="10030970000043"></a>There is, however, no provision for ensuring that juries in Wales must be comprised of members who are bilingual in both Welsh and English. The reason for this is that juries must, by law, be selected at random from the whole community.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="10030970000044"></a>A consultation exercise on "The Use of Bilingual (English and Welsh-speaking) Juries in Certain Criminal Trials in Wales" was conducted between December 2005 and March 2006.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="10030970000045"></a>The consultation paper invited comments on the desirability of selecting juries in certain criminal trials in Wales, all of whose members would be bilingual in Welsh and English. A bilingual jury would be selected where, for example, it was likely that much of the evidence at the trial would be given in Welsh.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="10030970000046"></a>The consultation paper made it clear that the Government had not decided whether bilingual juries were desirable in principle, and would not consider this further until after the consultation period was over.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="10030970000047"></a>The subject is not straightforward because it is one of those which comes down to a choice between two good and desirable things-in this instance, the principle of random selection in the jury system and greater use of the Welsh language in court.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="10030970000048"></a>On this occasion the Government have decided not to proceed with bilingual juries, primarily because the balance of argument lies with their negative impact on the principle of random selection of juries from the community as a whole, and hence on social inclusion and justice.</p>

<a name="100309-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="10030970000049"></a>I am placing a copy of the full government response to the consultation in the Library of both Houses.</p>

Unfortunately, at a time of high operational commitment, breaches of harmony guidelines do occur, but initiatives and regulators are used to help ameliorate the situation. These include flexible appointing between ranks, mobilisation of Reservists, financial retention and re-engagement incentives, contractorisation and reviewing the numbers of posts required for each operation on a regular basis. In addition, longer-term initiatives are used to promote increases in training, recruitment and retention.</p>

In addition, three Royal Navy pilots are currently deployed with the US Marine Corps flying the US version of the Harrier. Of the 146 pilots, 65 are currently qualified to fly Harriers but this number could be increased through refresher training. Of the pilots currently qualified, 34 are qualified for night flying, 47 are qualified to take off and land on an aircraft carrier and 11 are qualified to take off and land on an aircraft carrier at night. The numbers of pilots in these categories are increasing as Joint Harrier Force regenerates its wider capability following its return from deployment in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_639"></a><a name="100309120000650"></a>Following a fact-finding mission to Cuba in 2009, Human Rights Watch reported concerns about prison conditions including: overcrowded cells; unhygienic and insufficient food and water; inadequate medical treatment; and cases of solitary confinement, harassment and beatings. The report additionally highlighted the lack of an effective complaint mechanism to address concerns. Our embassy in Havana maintains contacts with various unofficial groups in Cuba that focus on prison conditions as well as the families of political prisoners whose complaints reflect the concerns of Human Rights Watch. Such reports certainly give us cause for concern as to the possibility that prisoners in Cuba may be being subjected to mistreatment.</p>

The Cuban Government ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1995 and in January 2009 invited the UN Special Rapporteur for Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to visit Cuba. The visit has not yet taken place. We hope that the special rapporteur's visit will be arranged soon and that he will be granted sufficient access to places of detention to be able to conduct a proper assessment of the situation. We will take careful note of his findings.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_654"></a><a name="100309120000668"></a>The available evidence suggests that fuel-poor households typically have higher energy requirements due to the type of homes in which they reside (ie they tend to be less energy efficient) and due to particular characteristics of their lives (eg elderly consumers who are more likely to heat their home for longer each day). This suggests that a rising block tariff would make it more expensive for many fuel-poor households to heat their homes to an acceptable standard and may, therefore, make it more difficult to remove these households from fuel poverty.</p>

In 2009-10 the cost of this service to participating NHS primary care trusts and GP practices has been approximately £27 per patient, which includes the pack, training for health professionals and a telephone alert call when weather and virus conditions combine to put the health of people with COPD at risk.</p>

<a name="100309w0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_660"></a><a name="100309120000685"></a>There are currently 22,000 patients registered to receive telephone alerts through the Healthy Outlook service out of a total of 1 million people on the UK COPD register. In a recent independent survey of over 3,000 users of the service, 79 per cent of respondents confirmed that they had received an information pack and 99 per cent said that they had found it easy to understand. This survey also showed that 85 per cent of patients using the service understood their condition better, 54 per cent were seeking a repeat prescription, 42 per cent were reporting their symptoms earlier and 43 per cent were taking more exercise. Other research has shown a UK average 20 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for COPD and a reduction in excess winter deaths in the West Midlands.</p>
