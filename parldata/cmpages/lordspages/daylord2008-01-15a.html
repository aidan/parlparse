Following the Select Committee hearings in 2006, it was decided that there would be a review of the guidance. The Government Historic Estates Unit is undertaking consultation on that review. The objective of the review is precisely to strengthen current guidance, because we all recognise that more could be done to ensure that those buildings are properly protected. It is perhaps worth adding that the record is improving. Certainly since 1999, the at-risk register, if you like, has decreased by about 17 or 18 per cent in the number of buildings considered to be at risk. So we are making progress and the disposals programme is now much stronger.</p>

Have the Government at any time during the past eight years followed that advice in any detail? Why is there nothing in the heritage White Paper?</p>

Just as I was explaining just a moment or two ago, the number of buildings on the at-risk register has significantly reduced by about 192 since 1999. Recently, in the report commissioned from Green Balance, the National Trust stated that there has been:</p>
<ul><a name="08011599000238">&#147;considerable improvement in recent years in the attention paid by Government Departments to the DCHS guidance from 1999. There are many examples of successful disposals of heritage assets ... where the heritage interest has been secured&#148;.</ul>

I refer specifically to Shackleton Hall, the former Co-op headquarters building in Colne in Lancashire, but there are many others throughout the country. The answer seems to be for the local authority to serve a listed-building repairs notice requiring the building to be brought back into at least a reasonable condition. The problem is that the owners can then serve a notice on the local authority requiring the local authority to purchase the property but the local authority does not have the resources to purchase it and do the necessary work. Would it not be a good idea if English Partnerships and such bodies regarded such locally important buildings as a high priority?</p>

I have already indicated the areas that we will look at first, but we will come back at the end of that process to some of the more general important issues that noble Lords are raising.</p>

I confirm that the Law Commission described the current law governing homicide as &#147;a rickety structure&#148; and made it clear that some of the rules have remained unaltered since the 17th century. That is why we take the matter seriously. The fact that we are taking this incremental approach does not undermine the importance of the overall thrust of the Law Commission report or the fact that the Government are very much prepared to engage with noble Lords in discussing the wider implications.</p>

On the original Question, which was about the timing, does the Minister not accept that it is now 14 months since we had this report, during which time the Government have only partially responded by offering consultation on one small aspect of it? Do they not think that they could proceed with slightly greater speed and produce consultation on more aspects of the original report?</p>

The commission proposed to address this by widening the provocation defence to include cases where the defendant killed in response to a fear of serious violence.

However, questions were raised in the Committee stage of this House on whether the term &#147;inter-species embryos&#148; was the appropriate umbrella term for those part human, part animal embryos covered by the Bill.</p>

That does not however cover the transgenic mice that are subject to Home Office regulation. It was suggested that an alternative term to &#147;inter-species embryo&#148; could be helpfully employed to make it clear that the Bill is not intended to apply to the whole spectrum of human, animal experimentation but only to those embryos that are predominantly human, resulting from modified human embryos or are the result of mixing human and animal gametes.</p>

It was felt that the word &#147;human&#148; should be used to indicate that these entities are at the human end of the spectrum of this research. The term &#147;mixed&#148; was considered, but concerns were raised that such a term could be taken as referring only to those embryos that are a mixture of cells, such as chimera embryos, where the term also needed to include those embryos in which all the cells contain human and animal material but are genetically identical.</p>

Whereas there is no legal problem per se, we agree on the further consideration that this could be clarified by a simple amendment. We have therefore tabled amendments to reorder new Section 4A(1)(a) for clarification. It is now clear that a human admixed embryo is a non-human embryo as far as the Bill is concerned, and is separately listed. The change removes any potential overlap, and so any confusion.

For instance, on the issue of full hybrids&#151;raised by my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries at earlier stages of the Bill&#151;if an admixed embryo is 50 per cent human and 50 per cent animal, how can we truly describe that as &#147;admixed&#148;?

So here we are with a rabbit pulled out of the hat&#151;or at least I think it is a rabbit because it may now be something altogether different, perhaps an admixed hybrid. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, is making a genuine attempt to address the issue, but we have here 100 amendments tabled at this stage in order to insert the phrase all the way through the Bill. Surely the Procedure Committee would have something to say if any noble Lord from the Back Benches were to produce on Report a tranche of amendments that fundamentally altered the understanding some of us had of the Bill.

I hope that we can have some further clarity in this afternoon&#146;s discussion.</p>

Like other noble Lords, I have had a large number of letters expressing concern about the Bill and I do not think that replacing the phrase &#147;inter-species embryo&#148; with &#147;human admixed embryo&#148; clarifies the situation. I had not followed the detail of our debates closely enough to realise that the phrase &#147;human admixed embryo&#148; does not mean what I first took it to mean. The Bill has &#147;Human&#148; and &#147;Embryology&#148; in its title, so when I first read the phrase I assumed that it referred to a human egg that had been admixed with some animal cell input. As I read the Bill, it appears from Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 that the definition of the phrase &#147;human admixed embryo&#148;, for the purposes of this Bill, will be a mixed animal and human cytoplasmic one or no more than a pure hybrid 50:50 animal-human one, starting from an animal egg. That suggests to me that the resulting embryo cannot be more than half-human, although I admit that I may not fully understand the science.</p>

It could mean, to the uninitiated, that a human embryo has had another species&#146; material added to it. Did the Government intend that? It may be that the Minister can clarify the reasons for his amendments&#151;and I listened most closely to what he said&#151;but I wonder whether we have yet arrived at the right definition for this problem.</p>

The stress in this new definition is, however, all on the human end.</p>

We have already crossed swords once in this debate and no doubt we shall do so again. However, the idea of the spectrum is not quite as simple even as it sounds. I say that because if you take the average mammalian embryo&#151;the human embryo, for example&#151;only a very small proportion of its cells end up being the foetus.</p>

<a name="80115-0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="08011599000096">It is thought that in the human embryo, around 10 per cent of the cells will become the inner cell mass that eventually leads to the person, if it is allowed to develop. The rest is, essentially, the part of the foetus that we throw away at birth, or incinerate or dispose of in some way&#151;the placenta or membranes. Whether you use the word &#147;admixture&#148;, &#147;hybrid&#148; or whatever, there is a problem here with the definition of spectrum. The Government have tried very hard to find a sensible solution to this and I certainly support this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="08011599000097">Secondly, I have a further concern in that, as I understand it, letters have been sent to Members of the House which seem scurrilously misleading. I have not received one myself so I may be wrong but this was reported to me. There seems to be a notion that such hybrids, such mixtured embryos, might be allowed to develop into an animal human being. That is a complete misconception, if I may use a pun for which I apologise. I did not mean to use it. That is untrue. It is very doubtful whether such organisms would be viable for more than a few days under any circumstances. In any case they would probably not be viable for longer than the length of time that the Act covers. As this is done for experimental purposes, we are really looking only at the first 14 days. In practice, we are looking only at the first six or seven days because that is as long as you can practically do the research and derive stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="08011599000098">My third point is about stem cells. I mentioned this point in Committee and I believe that it is very important. The best way of defining the potentiality of a stem cell to develop into different tissues is to inject it into the embryo of an immune deficient animal, usually an immune deficient mouse, which cannot reject those cells as a result of its immune system. Pretty well all the experiments that have been done which have defined stem cells and their potentiality have eventually ended up with that experiment because that is the defining moment of finding whether you have a cell which is truly capable of development. If the mouse is allowed to develop, the following happens. When the mouse baby is humanely killed, one can see in which tissues the cells that have been transferred into the embryo still exist. Normally you would expect to see them in

That does not alter the quality of the mouse but you have demonstrated that the stem cells you have produced are genuinely pluripotent; that is, capable of developing into a wide range of tissues.</p>

<a name="80115-0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="08011599000099">To my mind it is essential that we protect this research. So far as I am aware, there is no other test of pluripotentiality. Part of this research would not even be covered by this Bill. For example, if I derived a stem cell from the bone marrow of a human adult, I could legitimately inject such a cell into the mouse to define whether it was pluripotent. The paradox is that if it were an embryonic cell I could not do that because of this Bill. That seems foolish, if I may say so, and counterproductive to the human value of such research. Nobody in the scientific field in biology doubts that adult or embryonic stem cells&#151;I know that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and I disagree about this&#151;are of huge value to human medicine, but we need to prove that they are capable of developing into different tissues without causing a cancer, and that requires that animal experiment.</p>

There was much discussion and debate in Committee, and prior to that when we had the stem cell debate, about what we are trying to do here. It is important to understand what we are trying to do and why the human admixed embryo definition might be more appropriate. As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, said, the spectrum covers truly cytoplasmic interspecies embryos, where the component that comes from the animal egg is the cytoplasm in the egg of that animal from which the nucleus, and therefore the majority of the animal DNA, is removed.</p>

The law currently allows one to take a somatic cell, a skin cell, from a person suffering from a disease&#151;for example, motor neurone disease&#151;and insert the nucleus from that cell into a human egg from which the nucleus is removed and to produce an embryo from which to harvest stem cells that will carry the genes of that disease to be able to understand the progression of the disease and develop drugs to treat it. That is the main reason for doing this research. It is to help humanity&#151;it is not to endanger humanity in any way.</p>

If you take a dead cow&#146;s egg and remove the nucleus, and take a somatic cell nucleus from a the skin of a person who is suffering from a debilitating, progressive and lethal disease, to produce a stem cell line, that stem cell line carries the gene of that disease. That will enable you to do the research necessary to cure that disease. Depending at what stage you harvest those stem cells, that stem cell line comprises 99.5 per cent human cells. It carries only 0.5 per cent or less of animal material and none of it is animal DNA. There is no intention to implant that in any human being or in any animal. It will be used for basic research, to find cures for diseases. Therefore, the term &#147;human admixed embryo&#148; is correct, because the embryo is at the human end&#151;it is 99.9 per cent human.</p>

I still do not understand what it means. Does it, for instance, cover an embryo that is 51 per cent human and 49 per cent animal? Or is it only an apt description of an embryo that is 80 per cent human and 20 per cent animal? I simply do not understand.</p>

I think that the Minister raised this, and the Government proposed the term &#147;admixed embryo&#148;, in a brave attempt to produce a more acceptable term than &#147;interspecies embryo&#148;, which frightened many of the public into believing that if this Bill became an Act, it could ultimately result in the development and formation of monsters, or animal-human hybrids. That was never the intention, because these &#147;admixed embryos&#148; are viable, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, made clear, only for three or four days at most and could never under any circumstances develop into actual animals or human beings. The Bill makes it clear that such structures could never be implanted into the egg of a female human being or indeed into an animal.</p>

<a name="80115-0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="08011599000106">Having said that, let me stress the crucial point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, about the importance of stem cell research. Many people are saying that stem cell research has not as yet resulted in any improvement in human disease. There is in fact some evidence to suggest that stem cells have been able to ameliorate certain cardiac conditions and considerable evidence is now emerging&#151;I speak as a patron of the Spinal Injuries Association&#151;that crucially important work is going on that shows a very real prospect that stem cells may help to move towards repairing spinal cord damage in the paraplegic person.

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="08011599000107">One other point is very important. Stem cells derived from adult tissue such as bone marrow, stem cells derived from the umbilical cord and stem cells derived from other tissues may in fact be invaluable for the treatment of disease. The problem is that the cells, when injected into another individual, produce an  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1190"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column 1190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>immune response. If that treatment is to work, they require the suppression of the immune response of the individual in just the same way as suppression of the immune response is required in renal transplantation, heart transplantation and others. The great virtue of what has been called the interspecies embryo, to which my noble friend Lord Patel referred, or as the Government now wish to call it, the admixed embryo, is that if you take a skin cell from a human being suffering from one of these devastating diseases and, if it were available, take a donor female ovum&#151;which is very rare and difficult to obtain&#151;and take out the nucleus of the donor ovum and transplant into it the nucleus from the skin cell of the individual with the disease, you can then create from that structure a series of stem cells that are immunologically compatible with the host from whom that skin cell has been removed. That is a major development of great importance.</p>

<a name="80115-0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="08011599000108">The reason for using the admixed embryo is to take the animal egg, remove the nucleus, put in the skin cell from the human subject&#151;the same technique that was used by Ian Wilmut in creating Dolly the sheep&#151;and to create from that a generation of stem cells that are 99.95 per cent human. The animal component is simply the capsule in which that nucleus has been implanted. That is a very minor component, so it is properly called a human admixed embryo. That technique has enormous prospect for the amelioration of human health and, if the Bill goes ahead&#151;as I very much hope that it will&#151;it will be of great importance to the future of many people with inherited diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer&#146;s and other conditions that could be greatly helped by the derivation of those cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="08011599000109">Ian Wilmut said that he was not going to go on with this technique of cloning because of another technique that is being developed; but that other technique, which is being carried out in the United States, requires the use of an oncogene, which is a cancer-producing gene. I know that that is now being modified, but the problem is that stem cells derived in that way, which Ian Wilmut says is worthy of further exploration, are liable to produce malignant growths. That is one of the problems. The so-called interspecies embryo, or, as the Government now prefer to call it, the admixed embryo, is capable of producing generations of stem cells that are compatible with the individual and which do not produce an immune response, which is of enormous value in the treatment of disease.</p>

The problem is that the Bill necessarily contains a large number of expressions, not just this one, that are unfamiliar to people who are not familiar with the science.

Unless it is clarified in an acceptable way, it may cause great damage to relationships between science and the general public. I believe that it is already doing that; the social contract between society and science can easily be damaged. I think that it was as long ago as 1904 that HG Wells, in his novel <I>The Food of the Gods</I>, referred to an iron curtain&#151;incidentally, I think that that was the first use of the phrase&#151;coming down between the scientist and what he termed the outside world. We must not have an iron curtain and it is extremely important that explanations are clear. If the average Peer in the street cannot understand exactly what is going on, what chance has the average person in the street? Clarification of meaning is vital.</p>

I hope that he will take it in good faith that I am speaking honestly when I say that these embryos, if derived, will be subject to the law as it already exists; that they could not survive beyond 14 days under the law and, in practice, will not survive beyond seven days; that they cannot be transferred to a uterus either of a human female or an animal female; and that there can be no possibility whatever of viability. That seems to me to be a very important point. There seems to be a mythology going around that in some way the scientists want to create monsters. I think that we do engage with society.

As a point of record, spinning might be a technology used in the creation of an embryo in a laboratory, but it was certainly not used in the creation of the term &#147;admixed embryo&#148;. That term was the result of the deliberations that we had in Committee, and I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and others in the House who put in a significant amount of time with the Government and with the scientific community, including the Academy of Medical Sciences, in coming up with a better description than &#147;interspecies embryo&#148;, as debated by your Lordships in Committee.</p>

This relates to the Government&#146;s attempt to clarify what we mean by the human end of admixed embryos. A broad spectrum of entities can be created in research, as we are fully aware, that contain both human and animal components. However, the ability objectively to separate the structural and functional components of the created embryos, as described by my noble friend Lord Winston, is an impossible task. We must remember that not all DNA is functional; in fact, a large proportion of human and animal genome,

But when the Minister talks about one end or the other of the spectrum, I find myself at a loss. If he says that certain matters relate only to human admixes at the human end of the spectrum, he must be able to define that in some way. I accept entirely what the noble Lords, Lord Winston, Lord Patel and others, say: part of the DNA is not functional. Of course I understand that, but it does not get away from the fact that the Minister has identified two things: the animal admix and the human admix. He has introduced the concept that they are not entirely separate but they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.

To ensure that admixed embryos proposed to be created by novel techniques not captured by the definitions in paragraphs (a) to (d) of new Section 4A(5) can be regulated in the future, the Bill contains two regulation-making powers so that secondary legislation can bring any such embryos under regulation. The first power, inserted by new Section 4A(5)(e) of the 1990 Act as inserted by Clause 4, allows secondary legislation to add new types of entities to Section 4A(5) and thereby bring them within the regulation. The second power, inserted by new Section 4A(7), permits secondary legislation to alter the existing definitions or to repeal those definitions. These amendments relate to the second power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08011599000141">The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended changes to the Bill concerning the second of those regulation-making powers. It raised specific concerns that the power was too wide and should be more limited. Having accepted that recommendation, we are proposing to remove the regulation-making power contained in new Section 4A(7) and to introduce a new power under what will be new Section 4A(13)(a). This power will be limited so that it can be exercised only to amend and not to repeal the current definitions of human admixed embryos in paragraphs (a) to (d) of new Section 4A(5) as inserted by Clause 4. We have also introduced a condition that the power can be exercised only in the light of scientific developments. This mirrors the limits on a similar power already in the Bill in relation to alteration of the definition of human embryo in new Section 1(6) as inserted by Clause 1.

The regulation-making power under new Section 1(7) to amend those definitions following changes to Section 1 is also removed. This could cause problems. If, for example, the meaning of &#147;gamete&#148; for the purpose of Section 4A(5) was amended, it might not be possible for the equivalent amendment to Section 4A(1) to be made in relation to prohibitions.

It means that an adult man who has had mumps orchitis, for example, and is infertile as a consequence will be able to have sperm created from his own body, from his own stem cells, to produce his very own child.

If it specifically ruled out the use of human embryology, as he has done in his speech, then I do not think there could be any difference between us and should not be. Even if the Government are unable to give it the green light today, I hope that they will give it further consideration and that maybe at later stages&#151;because this Bill will go on to another place&#151;we can find absolute agreement on it.</p>

I am sure the noble Lord has had his attention drawn, as I have, to the slightly disturbing report published today by the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Radiologists and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists about there being no national policy or funding for techniques for people who have, as a result of cancer treatments, successfully survived but become infertile. I am sure that many of us know that many young people have survived into adulthood precisely because of the advances in cancer treatments, particularly for paediatric leukaemia and so forth, but then face an infertile adulthood. These techniques, as I understand it, would be very helpful to them. I believe that around 11,000 patients between 15 and 40 years of age are diagnosed at this stage every year. This group could be helped by this technique, and the Minister should be aware of that when considering whether to accept the amendment.</p>

This, after all, is adult stem cell technology, and progress has been made in animal models and in laboratory studies of human cells in generating gamete precursor cells from bone marrow cells. Many leading research groups in the UK are now working in this field, not least those at Newcastle University to which my noble friend Lord Patel referred. One intention behind the work is to look at the possibility of attempting to restore fertility in young men who have undergone chemotherapy, but many other potential developments are arising out of this work.</p>

<a name="80115-0004.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="08011599000165">The Bill in effect places a ban, which it would require a whole new Bill to overturn, on ever using such gametes to treat patients. Amendment No. 4 proposes a regulation-making power, which is reassuring, through the affirmative procedure, to permit the HFEA to consider applications to apply this new technology to treat infertility if it is satisfied that it is safe enough, if there is sufficient evidence of effectiveness, subject to the usual provisions of carefully designed ethically approved clinical trials, and following any public consultation that may be necessary. It is also open to the Government to carry out a consultation prior to promulgating any regulations. This is a very important amendment, which I warmly support.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Patel, mentioned the importance of this for male infertility, and the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, mentioned female infertility in certain cases. However, we live in a changing society in which more and more women are taking education, gaining skills and leaving child-bearing rather late. There is now a huge section of women in their late 30s and early 40s&#151;these are not old patients or people who would be regarded in any way as undesirable mothers, no matter what kind of spin one places on that&#151;whose ovaries have run out of eggs. The prospect of making an artificial egg in due course from a stem cell would help a vast number of women and would be a great cause of happiness in our society. Therefore anything that we can do to alleviate the situation and promote that research is to be welcomed. I really value the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who has shown his humanity this afternoon. I think that many people will have found his interjection on this point extremely welcome.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Patel, has made a powerful case and I support him. I do, however, have a technical question about the approvals process. If the amendment were accepted, will the Minister confirm that it would cover research only? If there were any question of the technique being applied to treat an individual patient, which regulatory body would license it? Would it be the HFEA, or would it be the MHRA, bearing in mind that we would suppose by that stage that the technique had been developed to a sufficient stage to enable it to be applied in the field? In other words, would regulations passed under the Bill as amended enable patients to be treated?</p>

New Section 3ZA defines permitted embryos and gametes. With respect to gametes, this means that only an egg produced or extracted from a woman&#146;s ovary or sperm produced or extracted from a man&#146;s testes can be used in treatment. I would like to make it clear that nothing in the Bill prevents the creation or use of other types of gamete for the purpose of research. Natural gametes, matured or grown in vitro, can still be used in treatment, due to the nature of the definition of gametes found in the Bill.</p>

Amendment No. 5 introduces a regulation-making power that will allow the definitions of permitted eggs and sperm to be expanded to include eggs and sperm that have been developed from one or more cells of a woman or man as part of a prohibited process to treat infertility. These gametes are often referred to as artificial gametes and, on our current understanding of the science, would be gametes derived from somatic cells&#151;that is, not naturally derived from the germ cells residing in the testes or ovaries, but derived from cells in, for example, the skin or blood.</p>

I realise that the scope of this amendment is not as wide as the one moved in Committee and that many concerns have been removed. However, issues of discrimination have to be considered, including, for example, whether it may be possible for same-sex couples to use this technology to create children using their combined genetic material and whether it would be proportionate to prevent them benefiting from this treatment in the future.</p>

I echo that remark because it is an extraordinary privilege to hear some of the contributions that have been made from learned Members of your Lordships&#146; House and to understand the technologies that are moving at such a galloping pace.

I think that we should make every possible progress to alleviate sickness. It is always a privilege to hear my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant speaking about these things. There is no disagreement between us about the importance of doing all that we can to remedy disease. However, we always have to weigh in the balance the nature of what we are doing to achieve that.

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="08011599000184">It is perhaps worth mentioning to your Lordships, as I did at earlier stages, that taken together the embryos that we have created since 1990&#151;primarily for IVF cycles, but also those that we have created for experimental purposes&#151;now number some 2.2 million. I do not think that it is unreasonable in debates of this kind for any Member of your Lordships&#146; House to ask how many more we need, where this science is going and what has been achieved so far. I just register the point again, as I did at an earlier stage, that so far all the scientific developments in terms of existing therapies have been achieved through adult stem cells&#151;nearly 80 worldwide, with some 350 clinical trials under way using stem cells. There is not a single therapy, as my noble friend Lord Walton confirmed, anywhere in the world&#151;maybe there will be, but there is not now&#151;that uses embryonic stem cells. One of the reasons for that is often rejection. The beauty of adult stem cells is that they are taken from the patient themselves; that is why many hold that they will be the cells used in therapies in future rather than for experimental purposes, which is what the Bill permits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="08011599000185">The Bill is therefore utterly wrong to allow licences to be granted to create true hybrids. I come back to the point that I made in my earlier intervention: we can call them &#147;human admixed embryos&#148;, but a true hybrid can be 50 per cent human and 50 per cent animal as well as other kinds of human interspecies embryo. My noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries made that point earlier in his interesting comment about the difference between cytoplasmic and true hybrids in relation to these definitions.</p>

That is more likely to come from groundbreaking work from men such as Professor Shinya Yamanaka at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University, whose breakthroughs in this area have developed even while the proceedings on this Bill have been taking place. In an interview in <I>New Scientist</I> on 15 December, he described how reprogrammed adult skin cells have been turned into cells akin to human embryonic stem cells. <I>New Scientist </I>said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011599000234">&#147;the method, which involves inserting genetic material that makes the cells&#146; development run backwards, opens the door to stem cells specific to patients, which could be used to repair damaged organs or fight diseases such as Parkinson&#146;s and diabetes&#151;crucially, all without the need to destroy human embryos&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011599000190">That extraordinary development illustrates why, whatever the result of the vote today, the argument has been lost for investing more public money and primary legislation in such redundant techniques as making cloned interspecies embryos to try to investigate and treat disease.

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="08011599000197">Let me come to a conclusion. As Parliament is dazzled with misleading claims about therapies and cures, there have been none anywhere in the world. We have stubbornly refused to celebrate the life-giving qualities of adult stem cells, which are already being used and which pose none of the ethical dilemmas that this kind of legislation holds for so many of us. Instead of concentrating our efforts on their development and application through things such as the routine collection of cord blood cells, we are instead being invited to cross the Rubicon. If we permit the creation of these predominantly human interspecies embryos and full hybrids, we will be crossing an important ethical line&#151;crossing human and animal. But for what? For the sake of a technology that we know will not be the future.</p>

True hybrids are the most perplexing, the most disturbing and the most extreme examples of human interspecies embryo. They are not a potential source of stem cells of obvious clinical benefit. They have no suggested clinical benefit whatsoever. A line needs to be drawn somewhere and it should be drawn to prohibit the creation of these new types of human interspecies embryo that have been proposed in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

He does not feel that there is a need for so-called interspecies or human admixed embryos.

They want a cell that is able in its totality to behave like a human embryonic stem cell. What have we got? We have the most fantastic research that has been announced in the past six to eight weeks where it has been possible to take a human adult somatic cell and reprogramme it to a cell that looks and seems initially to behave like an embryonic stem cell.</p>

Furthermore, none of this work would have been possible if we had not allowed the initial research on such stem cells.

It is sometimes difficult to assess those registers, because if you look at them just putting &#147;stem cell&#148; produces several types. None the less, I accept that adult stem cells have produced therapies. The problem is that those cells do not have the capacity to differentiate into all the cell types. Adult stem cells are not stable and, often, the treatment is for a particular patient and cannot be expanded to the large majority of patients. Those cells are not useful for developing certain therapies, particularly for degenerative diseases.</p>

For instance, the so-called Edmonton protocol uses islets from two or three cadaveric donors for each diabetic patient treated. That would be possible for many more patients using embryonic stem cells.

The first person to get the lines from Jamie Thompson in Wisconsin&#151;the researcher mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Alton&#151;who identified and developed the induced pluripotent cells in humans was Peter Andrews at Sheffield University; most of the labs did not have access to human embryonic stem cell lines until 2003.

We can do the research without using fresh human eggs by taking fresh animal eggs; for instance, from dead cows. The stem cell lines created will be 99.5 per cent human and, more importantly, will carry the genes of the relevant disease such as motor neurone disease, Parkinson&#146;s disease, diabetes, muscular dystrophy and so on, that we wish to study to discover why some cells that eventually become damaged brain cells or produce muscular dystrophy behave differently. Are they programmed to do so from very early on? If so, can we manipulate them so that that programming is removed? You do not get a disease unless you have a disease specific gene. Normally, most disease genes are multifactorial. When a gene is switched on, mostly to express protein, you get a disease.

The vote was also carried in another place by about a two-thirds majority. It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, says, that embryonic stem cell research has not produced much clinical benefit. It has produced scientific benefit, unquestionably, and I do not think he disputes that. Although we think of science progressing very rapidly, in fact science does not progress very rapidly&#151;it takes a while. It took about two years for the HFEA to grant any research licences, because it was so cautious. So in practice, in this country, the research has been relatively short-lived. It would be utterly wrong for this House, after such deliberation&#151;which was so welcome to so many people, and so widely praised, not only in this country, but all over the world&#151;suddenly to turn around and nip this work in the bud, just at the time when we are beginning to develop the tools to see what we can do with embryonic stem cell research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="08011599000214">I do not want to go through the arguments of five years ago, but the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has produced a bit of a blunderbuss attack. There are undoubted problems with adult stem cells that are widely accepted in the scientific community. Firstly, they come from an ageing person. Therefore, they are likely to be different in the way they propagate, and also in whether they are capable of continuing to live after transplantation. Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, they may be subject to producing cancers. I do not want to exaggerate this, but the transplanting of any stem cell, either embryonic or adult, could theoretically produce a cancer. It is essential for scientists to look at this&#151;one reason for doing embryology research is to see whether these cancers can be prevented.</p>

<a name="80115-0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="08011599000215">There is also the question of transplantation. What is rather forgotten in this debate is that stem cells are very slow to divide in culture. Therefore, if you are an adult with a medical condition, and stem cells are taken from you, because they will be immune compatible, grown and then transplanted back into you, your degenerative process may be so advanced that your stem cells cannot catch up and you die before the stem cell transplantation can help you. That is why we need pools of stem cells and one reason why embryologically derived stem cells may be so valuable in future.</p>

I do not think that this is relevant to this debate. Any further manipulation of these cells reduces their viability, whether they are embryonic or adult stem cells&#151;that remains a significant problem. One thing that we have to consider carefully is that transplanting adult stem cells is different from transplanting embryological stem cells. If I am an adult patient and I receive my own stem cells that have been grown, those stem cells will be programmed with potentially the same genetic defects that I already have, and which caused my disease in the first place. The brilliant advantage of an embryonic transplant is that you would be using a fresh pool of genes which would not be prone to that defect; that is one of the promises of such transplants.</p>

But 95 per cent of the biological community, with all honesty, firmly believes that embryonic stem cells are an important area of research. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has difficulties with in vitro fertilisation, but at a time when so many human embryos are literally discarded after in vitro fertilisation because they cannot be transferred back to the patient, not to use those embryos seems to me to be an ethical problem for us. In my view it must be ethically far superior to use that material which would be discarded to produce stem cells, rather than simply discarding it.</p>

The argument that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, put forward, if one hears and considers it carefully, was based much more on expectations and hopes of what might come from embryonic stem cell research than on actual evidence of clear therapies that have emerged, the most recent example of which is sickle cell anaemia and adult stem cell research.</p>

Professor Yamanaka told us a few weeks ago that he had managed to exclude genes carrying the possibility of cancerous developments from his own attempts to reprogram adult stem cells. He announced the results of that experiment a few weeks ago. However, I rather got the impression that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, nevertheless felt that still to be a real and serious factor. Does that mean that we have not yet had enough experiments to make it clear that the danger of cancer-carrying reprogrammed cells can be excluded, or does it mean that the noble Lord does not particularly believe that the experiment was valid and justified?</p>

In a situation where adult stem cells are largely though not totally replicable for embryonic stem cells&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Winston, referred to embryonic stem cell research as a form of reference or a golden standard&#151;should we take the view that if, as has happened in the past few months, more research in the field more frequently indicates that adult stem cell research is a fully adequate and non-dangerous alternative to embryonic stem cell research, then the Government should honour their own commitment? That commitment was made both in another place and in this place by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for whom we all have great respect. In the <I>Official Report</I> for 22 January he said:</p>
<ul><a name="080115120000179">&#147;the 1990 Act already provides the answer to the question of what happens if and when research into adult cells overtakes research using embryos&#148;.</ul>

I have a very strong sense that, as my Harvard colleague indicated, there is a prejudice in favour of embryonic stem cell research and that that prejudice must be questioned.

That seemed to be the point that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, was making. Perhaps he somehow hid that thrust within the many other interesting things that he had to say, and which drew from the noble Lords, Lord Patel and Lord Winston, the hugely instructive material that they produced. However, it seemed to me that neither of the two noble Lords addressed the ethical admissibility of interspecies embryos. Although they made a case for the need for the work that they and many others are doing, they did not address that question.

It is a fundamentally important line on which I had understood the 1990 legislation was predicated. However great the advantages of crossing that line, we human beings have mostly judged&#151;both out of the major religious traditions and for other reasons, too&#151;that a unique status and respect must be afforded to the human being, the human embryo and human reproductive material.

These embryos can therefore produce an enormously valuable source of stem cells which would be immunologically compatible with the individual from whom that somatic cell was removed.

This is a field in which the United Kingdom, for a variety of reasons, is in some respects leading the world. There are other parts of the world, particularly the United States, where, through private funds and not government funding, some research of this importance is continuing. There is no doubt that adult stem cells have a value and can be used for potential treatment of disease. This relates equally to umbilical cord cells, which are significantly less mature. However, as most scientific experts will say, those cells are much more difficult to program and manipulate in order to produce kidney cells, brain cells, nerve cells, heart cells, muscle cells and the other kinds of cells that are ultimately needed for the treatment of human disease. On the other hand, embryonic cells have a much greater pluripotential and can readily be manipulated to produce that kind of tissue.</p>

However, some of the attitudes of those writing in the medical and scientific press criticising the use of embryonic cells for research have been conditioned very much by religious beliefs. Many centuries ago in the Roman Catholic Church, St Thomas Aquinas, that great theologian, averred that life did not begin until the foetus was capable of independent existence outside the womb, but a pope in the middle of the 19th century laid down the edict that life began the moment the sperm entered the egg.

The legislation requires this. My noble and professional friends have explained extremely clearly how these embryos are to be used: purely for research purposes to increase our knowledge of all aspects of human development. Application of this knowledge may be useful later on for therapeutic purposes, but this research is not, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, put it, &#147;a scientific sideshow&#148;, a &#147;blind alley&#148; or a technology which will not have a viable future.

The right reverend Prelate will have seen the discussion in Committee about the extent to which animal embryos mixed with human DNA are used. They have been used for a long time already, so that boundary, if treated generally, has already been crossed. The material in that area, if regulated at all, is regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. There is a question about whether embryos in that area are regulated at all because the Act refers to the embryo of an animal, but if an embryo has human material mixed with it, it may no longer be the embryo of that animal. If that is the case, it is not regulated as an embryo, although there is regulation if it were to be implanted in an animal. So that boundary was passed a long time ago and is why using the phrase &#147;interspecies embryo&#148; in the Bill was very easy to understand, except that it does not properly reflect what is being regulated as the Bill says that if you start with the human embryo and puts animal DNA in it, within limits, you should treat it with the same respect as you accord to a human embryo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="080115120000026">In 1990, there was a considerable debate about whether human embryos should be used for research at all. The Government of that day gave a free vote on that matter to everyone who took their Whip. There was a free vote about it in this House. The House decided by quite a substantial majority to allow research on human embryos under specific conditions, including one that looks quite like what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, quoted from the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, speaking at that time, I think, for the Government as Minister for health. That clause is in the 1990 Act, and it is reproduced to a considerable extent in the present Bill.</p>

The idea of the Bill is to take this extension of the human embryo and treat it for practical purposes of regulation in the same way as an ordinary human embryo would be treated with those additional restrictions.

Once we get into the business of creating entities which are halfway, or somewhere along that spectrum, between animal and human, we have a deep ethical dilemma. Arguments for the different treatment of humans and animals begin to be undermined and I find that a worrying feature. I am also worried about the attitude of the scientific community which, while it is always willing to accept that there should be limits placed on it on ethical grounds, always seems to assume that the limits should be somewhere just beyond what is scientifically possible and what it wants to do and those limits keep moving.</p>

It is very difficult to decide where we should go from where we are, but I would much rather go in the direction which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, wants to go in than that which we are told the scientific community wants to go in.

It cannot be said that scientists are always thinking that what can be done should be done or is permissible. I vividly remember, after the publication of the report on embryology and fertilisation, taking part in a television programme with Bob Edwards, who was partly responsible for the first IVF birth, where he said, &#147;What I would really like to do is to keep an embryo alive in the laboratory for more than 14 days but I am a law-abiding man.&#148; I nearly killed him for saying that because we were facing a very hostile audience at the time and I had envisaged saying that nobody would want to keep an embryo longer than 14 days. But he said he did want to and he could not. There may have been many other scientists who would have liked to conduct research on embryos older than 14 days, but as far as I know nobody has.

Lots of things are invisible. Good and evil are invisible to the eye. It is only when the outward manifestations are reached that we see that something has happened that should not have happened. So I am very relieved that no one has tried to put forward the housemaid&#146;s baby argument again that this was just a little admixture, not a large one. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester was right in saying that this is where the line should be drawn. In response to an earlier debate, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said that he felt people might look back to some of our debates and say they were old-fashioned and ancient history.

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="080115120000046">I know that my noble friend, who presented the case very cogently in Committee, is concerned that there is fashion in science research and that it may be that embryonic stem cell research, as opposed to adult stem cell research, continues to be in fashion. I reiterate that we on these Benches agree with her that when government come to take funding decisions about research, they should continue to ensure that there is adequate funding for all forms of research. That funding may have to take into account the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten, that commercial resources may go to particular types of funding rather than to others and that government may have to balance that out, but it is important that we should say in this House not only that these different types of research

Therefore, for those reasons, we on the Front Bench in this debate do not support my noble friend, although we do understand the important basis of her argument.</p>

As science has moved forward since then, our understanding of embryo development and embryonic stem cell research has increased significantly. However, new challenges have arisen as our understanding of stem cells has increased. It is now clearer than ever that the challenges facing embryo researchers are more complex than at first perceived, but we are also more confident than ever that at the end of this research there will be new treatments for serious diseases and medical conditions.</p>

<a name="80115-0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="080115120000048">The research community and medical charities have in the past 12 months made a considerable effort to cite the need for human admixed embryo research. The shortage of human eggs in particular for use in refining the process of embryonic stem cells has led to calls for the ability to use animal eggs, which are available, as most of us know, in much greater numbers, to create human admixed embryos. This was further reinforced today by a publication from the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research Council, the Royal Society and the Wellcome Trust, and supported by the Association of Medical Research Charities. In Annexe A, they eloquently highlight the role of different sources of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, foetal stem cells and adult stem cells.</p>

<a name="80115-0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="080115120000049">I also remind the House that the granting of peer review funding for stem cell research is equal if you look at embryonic stem cell research versus adult stem cell research. That is extremely important. Peer review funding in this area is highly competitive. There is a strong cohort out there, an international scientific community, which truly believes that there is a tremendous and rich future for research into embryonic stem cells. The joint pre-legislative scrutiny looked at this with the Science and Technology Select Committee of the other place, and both have held inquiries into the ethical and scientific considerations regarding human admixed embryo research. Both have recommended that this research be permitted under the regulation of the HFEA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="080115120000050">The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, also raised a very important issue about the unnatural nature of research in this area. I agree that there is an unnatural process here. However, we need to remind ourselves that many scientific discoveries are unnatural. That does not necessarily mean that they are bad. A true example, as highlighted by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, is IVF. There is nothing natural about IVF, but it has saved many lives.</p>

I was trying to get at limiting scientific discovery in relation to the unnaturalness of the process. I agree that there are ethical issues about this. As far as they are regulated, as highlighted in the Bill, I feel that we should be supporting this. Within the context of the regulatory framework that we have put in, I remind the House that there is an absolute time limit of 14 days and an absolute prohibition about the implantation of a human admixed embryo in a woman or any animal. Such research will, as I said, be permissible only with a licence from the HFEA and only in circumstances where the HFEA deems the research necessary for one of the statutory processes. In taking such decisions, the HFEA will be required to take into account all other available avenues of research that may achieve the same end. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is impossible in another place&#151;I served there for 18 years&#151;to have debates of this kind, and regardless of our differences, we have been able to explore and to give justice to something that people would expect us to have an intelligent and informed debate on and to be willing to vote on.</p>

I know that that is an old-fashioned view that does not commend itself to everyone, but, without the value of Thomas Aquinas, to whom my noble friend referred, the 38 Anglican, Catholic, Reformed and Orthodox theologians who submitted evidence to the retrospective Select Committee that we established in your Lordships&#146; House in 2002 also argued the point about the sanctity of human life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="080115120000055">It was Lord Rawlinson of Ewell, who contributed to the debate here in 1990, who said at the time that it must be 14 days after something. That is the fundamental question&#151;the metaphysical and theological point to which the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, referred&#151;that divides us. Many of us are of the view that this is human life and that therefore we should not do these things to it. However, that is not the amendment before the House today. The amendment before the House today deals specifically with a prohibition on the creation of animal-human hybrids&#151;or human admixed embryos, as we are now going to call them. The noble Lord, Lord Rea, said in his intervention that this legislation requires it to be destroyed. He had put his finger on it. &#147;It&#148; must be something and it is going to be destroyed at 14 days. What is it that we are destroying, 14 days after something? We must at least ask ourselves that question.</p>

Is this another line that we should be crossing? That is the question we need to ask. We have come a long way from the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, which said that we should show respect to the human embryo and accord it human status. I recall the noble Baroness saying to us a couple of years ago that she wished she had not used those words in her report, because when you are flushing something away down a drain, it is hard to accord respect or status. I am not misquoting the noble Baroness; she said that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="080115120000057">That is where we are now. The issue is whether we take that argument further. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, talked about the importance of understanding science. I agree with him. We must comprehend the science, but we do not always have to follow it. I despair when I hear Ministers saying, in order to defend their points, that we have to follow the science. We do not always have to follow the science. We need to inform ourselves, even if we are mere laymen without the expertise that some of those who come to our debates bring.</p>

Here I want to say something to those who have implied that it is not, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, did earlier when he said that 95 per cent of the scientific community was united. I think he was talking more generally about embryonic stem cells, but I want to get back to the amendment for a moment and remind the House of what was said by those scientists who came to the Joint Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, among others, were members of that committee. Dr Lovell-Badge said:</p>

The proposal in this amendment very straightforwardly says that a licence should not be granted by the HFEA except where it is clear that there is no alternative to embryonic cell research. The amendment would not rule out embryonic cell research. It accepts that for some purposes embryonic cell research may be absolutely essential, but it proposes a definite requirement in the award of any licence that there has to be peer review and research evidence to show that embryonic stem cell research is necessary. In other words, we would give a preference to adult stem cell research over embryonic stem cell research and that preference would clearly be built into the licensing process.</p>

<a name="80115-0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="080115120000069">The reason for that is clear. When the 2001 regulations were debated in this House, a view was taken that adult stem cell research would probably not be a very exciting or creative line of research and that therefore embryonic stem cell research was bound to be the central theme behind the processes of stem cell research in general. My view, which is shared by many, is that you have to make out the strong case for embryonic cell research because of the ethical objections to it. That means that licences should be tightened up and should be awarded for embryonic cell research only where no other form of cell research can be shown to be effective. This would require two changes in HFEA licensing: first, evidence to show the efficacy of such research and that it was needed; secondly and crucially, evidence to show that it was the one way forward. We believe that embryonic cell research should be left to where it is the absolutely required factor where other forms of research would be likely to be unsuccessful.</p>

<a name="80115-0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="080115120000070">In his response to my speech on the earlier amendment, the Minister was kind enough to say that there had been or was now an almost equivalent expenditure under the HFEA between adult stem cell research and other forms of cell research, particularly embryonic cell research. He is absolutely correct in what he says. Yet it is also true that in the six years since 2001, when the House passed the regulations, there has been a steep increase in expenditure on adult stem cell research, which was not true at the beginning of that process when little money was found for it because the scientific community had little faith in it.</p>

<a name="80115-0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="080115120000071">We have put forward this proposal not to completely rule out embryonic cell research but to indicate that it should always be, as it were, the residuary factor: the requirement must be very clear. One reason for this was exemplified by the remarks about the shortage of human eggs, which was one of the reasons why we argued for a&#151;I am sorry that I keep using the old phraseology&#151;mixed-species form of embryo. Such research is necessary because, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, said, there is a great shortage of human eggs. Yet you would not require so many human eggs if you relied much more on adult stem cell research than on embryonic stem cell research, because most such research that could be done in either way would be primarily done by adult stem cell research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="080115120000072">That is the reason for Amendment No. 9, which would tighten up the licensing system of the HFEA, indicating that, although the licensing system does not rule out embryonic stem cell research, such research is the lesser preference. The first preference should be adult stem cell research. This would balance a situation in which, until recent years, adult stem cell research has tended to be somewhat disregarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="080115120000073">I should perhaps say &#147;human admixed embryos&#148; and apologise for having used the old terminology. I am referring throughout to human admixed embryos, the term that the House has passed and which it is a requirement for me to respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="080115120000074">There is now extremely exciting evidence of the remarkable achievements in adult stem cell research. It is growing in all directions. It is probably growing in other countries even more than here. It is a way forward that leaves out some of the great drawbacks of embryonic cell research, not just the ethical issues but also issues of supply and immunity. I will not detain the House long, because we had this debate earlier, but in moving this amendment I also stress the need to build in this element of preference.</p>

<a name="80115-0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="080115120000075">Finally, I must apologise to the House. I rose to the challenge when the noble Lords, Lord Winston and Lord Patel, spoke because they addressed the alternatives of adult stem cell research and embryonic cell research. I was so carried away by the desire to put the other side of the case that I made that case largely on the last amendment and I should have made it on this one. I was not unique in that, because the noble Lords, Lord Winston and Lord Patel, made the same point, but I ask people in deciding how to deal with this amendment to recall the debate on the last amendment, too. I beg to move.</p>

I refer to the notion of trying to do animal research before human research. The poor scientist is in rather a difficult position. Often he is told by the animal rights people that animal research bears no relationship to human research and therefore we should concentrate on human research. Now we are being told that we must use animal research first. The fact is that research

On mammalian embryology, the reason why I have to say that this amendment is not reasonable, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Neill, is that there are many situations that are specific to the species with which you are concerned. In this case, for example, specific aspects of human embryos are different from those of all other animals.</p>

<a name="80115-0009.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="080115120000087">For example, let us consider the culture media. In some species, the use of glucose is not particularly deleterious, but for others the use of glucose in the medium turns out to be completely poisonous and will destroy the embryo within two days of fertilisation. Certain embryos require particular growth factors while others do not. That is why the species that you are dealing with is so important. In the human, we have a particular issue when we are looking at individual genes that we might want to identify in the embryo and, more important, the string on which the genes are arrayed: the chromosomes. Human chromosomes are unique to humans. If we wanted to image a chromosome in the embryo, we would have to go to the human embryo because no other animal species would give us that information.</p>

<a name="80115-0009.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="080115120000088">There is also a difference, as I mentioned before, in the proportion of cells: the inner cell mass that will become the true embryo and the outer cell mass that will become the placenta. Perhaps the nearest model to the human is the primate, and a higher monkey at that&#151;a menstruating monkey. That represents even more of a problem, because even monkeys do not fully represent the human and the notion of doing this kind of work in monkeys would, practically speaking, prevent the research from going on. It would be hideously expensive, terribly complex, and in some ways I doubt the ethics of subjecting sapient primates to research that can be done, quite justifiably, on discarded human embryos.</p>

That blastocyst is no different in embryo status from an embryo derived from human beings.

The noble Lord, Lord Patel, pointed out that when one looks at the pattern of grants given by the HFEA since 1990, decisions in the earlier stages largely&#151;indeed, almost entirely&#151;favoured embryonic stem cell research over other research. It is now true that, largely on the basis of its results, adult stem cell research has become much more substantial and accounts for nearly half the financing made available.

The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, made the same point. It is a way of saying to the public that we take their concerns seriously, that the HFEA takes them seriously and that those concerns will be taken into account by a House of Lords that reflects, to some extent, public concerns. At the moment, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, the public have very little awareness of the criteria that the HFEA employs. It works largely in private. It is not widely understood what concerns people have, and how far those concerns are reflected. Therefore I propose not to ask for the opinion of the House now, because I take very seriously the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. I will go back and look at sub-paragraph (b). I will see whether it should be redrafted in the way that he suggests.

The percentage was added in ink, which suggested it was a slight afterthought, and the scientists who gave evidence found it impossible to understand, because the percentage depends on what you are measuring and the effect depends on more than mere proportion. The Joint Committee was anxious to produce a definition that would clarify the issue and also tie the whole paragraph together.

There is an element of regulation there, but there is no actual regulation of a non-animal embryo in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, so far as I can see in my study of it. That is not an essential point. The essential point about the amendment is that it clarifies what we mean and what the Government mean by &#147;human admixed embryo&#148;. It is therefore an element in clarification of the scope of the Bill as a whole and replaces the inaccurate description that was in the Bill originally and which has now been replaced by the Government in this House.

I would not attempt to try to make it clear in legal terms what the noble and learned Lord has in his usual way made absolutely clear. The amendment captures the important factor in such a decision as to whether an embryo will need to be accorded the same status as a human embryo or should be treated as an animal embryo.</p>

As the noble and learned Lord said, the use of &#147;predominate&#148; moves away from simplistic counting of the proportion of DNA and allows a more qualitative assessment to be made. It refers to the whole period of use, not in the expectation that this could be checked constantly but in recognition of the fact that the relative amount of DNA may alter with time when animal and human materials combine. That must be considered in any new construct.</p>

He did so in the Joint Committee, he did so in the Committee of this House and he has done so again tonight. The question of how you can wrap up a definition in a way that includes everything that you want to include but excludes the things that you do not want to include has proved very difficult. My noble and learned friend drew on the word &#147;predominate&#148;, which apparently emerged from scientific discussion of how to do this. My difficulty comes after reading the evidence that we heard in the Joint Committee from Dr Robin Lovell-Badge. He made the point:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"><a name="080115120000178">&#147;It is very hard to come up with any strict definition saying this is 50 per cent human and 50 per cent animal, therefore it falls into this category rather than this one, because things change as well. You may start with an embryo which is 20 per cent human and end up with something which is 60 per cent human or vice versa&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115120000161">Because the licence has to come at the beginning of the process, before the research is done, how do you decide whether you are going to be dealing with an entity that requires a licence? It may be only 20 per cent human, but by the time you are finished it may end up being 70 per cent or 80 per cent human. I am not sure that we have solved that problem, but I warmly congratulate my noble and learned friend on what is obviously an extremely brave try.</p>

<p><a name="st_137">
<a name="080115120000143"><b><a name="80115-0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="080115120000607">Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, first, I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, for his tremendous interest in this area and for his intellectual rigour in identifying a proper definition. However, the amendment seeks to replace the regulatory-making power under proposed new Section 4A(5)(e) of the 1990 Act as inserted by Clause 4, which would permit regulations to extend the list of interspecies embryos and replace it with a provision aiming to capture all forms of embryos that are predominantly human in their genetic make-up.</p>

<a name="80115-0010.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="080115120000144">As we have heard, there is always a difficulty in adopting a broad definition that leaves scope for interpretation, particularly in cases such as this one. The Government, working with professional bodies such as the academy, the Royal Society, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, endeavoured to put together a catch-all definition that would ensure that, should a new form of human admixed embryo come to light, there would be the scope for it to come within HFEA regulation.</p>

<a name="80115-0010.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="080115137000002">However, a definition attempting to cover different entities such as chimera, hybrids and transgenic embryos, where such a definition is easily interpretable by scientists in the HFEA and which is also practically sound, has proven elusive. The Bill therefore includes a regulation-making power to extend the list of human admixed embryo at proposed new Section 4A(5)(e). The amendments introduce a more limited provision to ensure that any embryo will be regulated if it contains both animal and human DNA and throughout the period of its keeping and use of the animal DNA does not predominate. The practical application of this definition may leave both the regulator and scientist in difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="080115137000003">The definition seeks to ensure clarity, but we do not believe that it achieves it. For example, if on any day of its gestation the embryo is considered to be more human than animal in terms of predominance of DNA, it falls under the regulatory remit of the authority; but would it not fall under its remit beforehand? Does this mean that the scientists can culture it before that point without a licence or would they need one because it would break through the 50 per cent barrier on a different day or if a scientist destroyed it at 10 days, when at the 11th day, it would, if it had been kept, become predominantly human?</p>

<a name="80115-0010.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="080115137000004">The definition also refers to the predominance of DNA, including nuclear and mitochondria. In some cases, the predominance of DNA would shift throughout the keeping of an embryo. When assessing an embryo on day 13 that contains hundreds of cells&#151;some of which may be human, some animal, some hidden and some even hybrid&#151;it would be difficult for the researcher to make a sensible estimation of the proportion of DNA which is human and the proportion which is animal. Let us not forget that the functionality of that small content also might be different. Does this researcher have to estimate the number of mitochondria found in each cell and how this affects the balance? Does the researcher count the number of genes or the physical quantity of DNA? We also know that not all DNA is functional. In fact, large portions of human and animal genomes, according to our current understanding, have no functional role in the development. However, as we all know, our understanding in this area is far from complete.</p>

<a name="80115-0010.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="080115137000005">For these reasons, I believe that, although I share with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, the wish for a straightforward definition without the need for regulation-making powers, the task is not possible without adversely affecting the scientist or the HFEA or, in some cases, both.</p>

<a name="80115-0010.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="080115137000006">New Section 4A(5)(a) to (d) captures all the entities that we currently predominate the human end and are deserving of regulation by the authority set up to license human embryo research. We believe that at this time, the list is robust. However, should new technologies come to light, we have the power to bring them within legislation through the regulatory-making power in new Section 4A(5)(e), following appropriate debate in Parliament.</p>

<a name="80115-0010.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="080115137000007">I reassure noble Lords that the process of taking a hypothesis to a laboratory takes time, research ethics approval and funding. The HFEA and the Government will continue to monitor developments in this area of science. I am sure that, if needed, regulations would be in place well before the researcher had the appropriate clearance to begin work. I invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

One is related to licence to create storage and to use embryos for therapeutic purposes and the other is that of related regulations. I have left aside what I was going to say, because the letter that was circulated, addressed to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, from the Association of Medical Research Charities, covering the Genetic Interest Group, Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society and Progress Educational Trust, puts it in simple terms that can be clearly understood. The association supports this amendment and says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"><a name="080115137000123">&#147;Many avenues of research which target the conditions supported by the signatories of this letter hold significant potential. For some of these conditions, there is currently no cure or effective long-term treatment available to patients. On-going research projects are therefore the subject of much hope for patients with these conditions, who have the opportunity to be treated with specific cell types (such as skin or nerve cells) that have been derived from embryonic stem cells. These will replace the cells that are not functioning correctly, or which have died, and ultimately may provide a cure for the illness. It is vital that this research continues at the exciting pace that it currently shows.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"><a name="080115137000124">&#147;The HFE Bill, as it stands, has no provision for the granting of licences for the creation, storage and use of embryos in order to provide treatments derived from embryonic stem cells. Like the1990 Act, the Bill only provides for the creation, storage and use of embryos for research purposes. Therapies derived from embryonic stem cells that will require such licences for their creation will hopefully be with us soon; an estimate of five years for some treatments is not overly optimistic. Indeed, a California company, Geron, is in dialogue with the US Food and Drug Administration to initiate a clinical trial with human embryonic stem cells in 2008 for acute spinal cord damage. A number of UK, US, European and Asian academic research groups and companies are testing human embryonic stem cell populations in animal models of Parkinson&#146;s disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, retinal disorders, and many other serious human conditions, with the goal of translating this important research to the clinic as quickly as possible. It would be very unfortunate if the application of these therapies has to be delayed due to the passage of further legislation&#148;.</p>

The worst case scenario, of course, is the development of a save, viable treatment that is then forced to languish unused for years whilst new legislation is drafted and debated, and the HFEA develops a new system to grant licences. This would seem to be a perverse undermining of the core objective of putting this legislation on the statute book in the first place.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"><a name="080115137000125">&#147;The use of embryos for such therapies was clearly envisaged by Parliament in 2001 when both MPs and peers voted overwhelmingly to allow therapeutic cloning research to take place as that was part of the justification for extending the research purposes to include developing treatments of serious disease. It is also reflected in the terms of the EU Human Tissues and Cells Directive and the EU Advanced Therapies Medicinal Products Regulation, both of which explicitly cover the use of stem cell therapies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="080115137000028">On the regulations, which are rather complex, I have some comments about the context in which the amendment is tabled. The amendment would permit embryos to be created, stored and used for purposes of therapy rather than just, as at present, for infertility treatment and research. There has been extensive debate and consideration of how best to regulate the use of stem cell therapies and that is reflected in the existing body of law and policy. An additional category of licences for therapies should not be seen as a step into the unknown, but an amendment to bring the legislation into line with the wider context of regulation in this area.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="080115137000029">There is already a considerable body of regulation relating to cell-based therapies in the UK, with which we would have to comply in order to take a cell-based therapy from the laboratory to clinical practice. The research licence granted by the HFEA represents only an early step in an ongoing process, which is now dominated by the regulation of advanced therapies, including stem cell therapies. However, HFEA licensing is an important initial stage, not least because good manufacturing practice facilities&#146; requirements will track back to ensure that the correct regulatory requirements have been met at each stage. I shall demonstrate that with an example.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="080115137000030">If the HFEA had granted a licence for research purposes to carry out research on an embryonic stem cell line that was created, and that line was subsequently taken for treatment purposes, it will help us to go for an initial clinical-phase trial, which will be carried out in animals. If it progresses to being used for therapy in humans, it will require the approval of the MHRA, and it will have to comply with the Human Tissue Act and the European Union directive. I could go into a lot of detail about that. In effect, it would not be recognised by those directives and a new line would have to be created under GMP facilities, which would have to be tested again in a first-phase trial in animals before it could go to clinical trials. That process in itself might take up to two years, so that much time will be lost as regards trials for human therapy if we do not allow the creation of embryos and storage for therapy purposes.</p>

We also have a stem cell bank, with an investment of nearly &#163;3 million a year, to maintain stem cell lines in appropriate condition, not only for research, but to characterise them, to improve them, to make them the best available lines in the world and to make those lines available for therapy. To this day we have no line that can be used for therapy in a bank which has 48 lines. Others in the world have lines that are usable for therapy; some of them are commercial and they will charge a lot of money. If it were permissible under the regulatory authority, our scientists are considering forming a consortium, and those lines would be available for both research and treatment subsequently. It is not necessary that they lie dormant until a therapy is found&#151;they could be used for research.

The major reason for my support is that embryo research has huge potential for the treatment of diseases. I know that there are many other reasons for doing this work, but for me the idea that we could crack diseases such as Parkinson&#146;s, diabetes, stroke and some cancers is just so attractive that we must do anything possible to encourage this research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="080115137000034">Looking to the future, I believe that the possibilities are exciting. This Bill is mainly concerned with research and not treatment, except infertility treatment, which, of course, is of great benefit to the individual but not usually to society as a whole. As we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Patel, much regulation relating to cell-based therapies already applies to the UK. I have discovered that there are many European Union directives: the European Union directive on human tissue and cells, the European Union directive on clinical trials, and many more. The UK Human Tissue Act 2001 and even the OECD regulations apply to cell-based therapies in the UK. A long time has to elapse and many hurdles have to be jumped before a cell-based therapy can be taken from the laboratory into clinical practice.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="080115137000035">That is one side of the coin. The other is that licences granted by the HFEA are only a very early step in research towards treatment. They extend only to cover the creation, storage and use of embryos for research and the treatment of infertility&#151;nothing else. However, if a cell line was developed under licence that was found to be useful for treating, say, diabetes, replacing the pancreatic eyelet cells with functional ones that produce insulin&#151;just imagine that&#151;and it is feasible, researchers under current law would have to go back to square one and create another cell line to

You could not carry on with a cell line that you had already created. Valuable time&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, two years or more&#151;would probably be lost before clinical trials on humans were permitted.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="080115137000036">We are suggesting in this amendment that we provide a missing link in the legislation to allow treatment to be developed and, if it proves successful, to move forward into the final stages of approval, ending in clinical application. As the noble Lord said, surely the use of embryos for therapies was part of the reason why, in 2001, both Houses voted to allow therapeutic cloning research to take place. We must include in this Bill permission for research towards treatments using embryo cell technology.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="080115137000037">There is a lot of support among the general public for embryo research if it will lead ultimately to cures for terrible and common diseases with which every family is familiar. It would be tragic if this new legislation did not recognise this and did not allow the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to grant licences or research into treatment on the same cell lines developed for research purposes.</p>

I was heavily involved in the discussions on the original Bill in 1989 and 1990. At that time, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill was directed towards establishing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, deciding on mechanisms that could be used to improve the treatment of human infertility and moving towards mechanisms that could prevent the birth of children suffering from serious genetic disease. No clause in that Bill made it possible to use embryonic cells. The experiments were licensed for up to 14 days after fertilisation, but no clause in the Bill allowed any derivative cells produced from such experiments to be used for the treatment of disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="080115137000039">However, in 2001, we debated the regulations to allow therapeutic cloning. I had every belief that, when those regulations were passed by a very large majority, they would enable stem cells derived from embryonic research to be used for the treatment of human disease. I was surprised to find that that was not the case and that, although research leading to therapeutic development was allowed under the Act and the regulations, the use of stored embryos and the stem cells derived from them for treatment of human disease was not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="080115137000040">As my noble friend Lord Patel and the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, have said, once you derive cells for treatment, a whole series of regulatory mechanisms has to be examined: the European regulations, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency regulations and others. The amendment is crucial to make certain that cells derived from stored embryos can be used for treatment, subject always to the regulations that follow. I am surprised after the 2001 vote on therapeutic cloning that this is not possible under the existing Act. It is therefore important that the amendment should be included in the Bill.</p>

It would be a valuable addition to the Bill. It would be rather ironic, given the accusations that embryonic stem cell research has not benefited anybody so far, to find it impossible for it to benefit anybody in the United Kingdom, so I certainly support the amendment. I am in rather a peculiar position. If the BBC will allow me to say this, I am planning to film a patient going overseas to get stem cell therapy of one kind. It would seem to me far better if patients could get stem cell therapy, or any kind of therapy, done under properly controlled and regulated procedures in this country after proper manufacturing practice, which is expensive, has been implemented.</p>

I would like to explain to the House that good manufacturing practice is not good in the sense of being the baseline; it is actually the gold standard. It is extremely difficult to reach that standard. We have made an important investment in it. These cell lines are very fragile. This is not something that can be done anywhere. It is already carefully controlled, but there is a deficit at the moment, which would be rectified by this amendment.</p>

However, I need to ask the same question that I asked during the debate on Amendment No. 4. If treatments are developed of the kind referred to by the noble Lord, which we all hope may emerge from the research, would it potentially be for the HFEA to license those treatments or would it be for the MHRA? If it is the MHRA, is it for this Bill to deal with the matter? I hope that the Minister will cover that point when she replies. If we are, through this amendment, changing the remit of the HFEA, we need to know that we are doing that, and we need to decide, and appreciate, how this impacts on the role and work of other regulators.</p>

It is my understanding that the licensing of any therapy would have to be done by the MHRA, working in consultation with the Human Tissue Authority and the HFEA. Those bodies have already foreseen the possibility that they will have to do just that. They have begun to work&#151;I am not sure how far they have got&#151;on an agreed process by which approval would be gained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="080115137000045">The noble Lord, Lord Patel, and I tabled this amendment because, although the upstream work&#151;the licensing of research&#151;is well and truly covered by the matters being discussed under this Bill and the downstream work that needs to be in place to bring about the licensing of any therapy is in place, the middle part is missing. That has to start in this Bill, because it involves the licensing of a piece of research on a stem cell line for both research and therapy. We are in effect putting into place a missing middle link in a process and that missing link has to originate, as I understand it, in this Bill. Perhaps the noble Baroness could comment on that in her reply.</p>

That is a laudable aim and one that the Government, of course, share. The debate is largely one of ways and means rather than of principle. These amendments would extend the remit of the HFEA to enable it to license the creation, keeping and use of embryos for non-reproductive, therapeutic purposes&#151;for example, the creation of embryonic stem cells for implantation into a person to treat a disease or a medical condition, as we have heard this evening.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="080115137000047">Much of the support for embryo research is in part due to the potential for such research to develop therapies for currently incurable conditions. Our decision not to make provision in the Bill for the creation of human embryos for the purpose of therapy was made not because we did not want to support potentially revolutionary therapeutic interventions such as embryonic stem cell-based therapies. I hear the evidence in relation to the timing cited by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and others. The Government are&#151;perhaps were&#151;of the opinion that this technology is not yet ready for use in the treatment of patients, although the potential is huge and is rightly being explored with vigour.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="080115137000048">It is not possible to know at this time the answer to questions such as how many embryos would be needed to provide an effective treatment, or how many conditions such a treatment could cover. In the Government&#146;s view, it is also not possible to fully understand at this time the scope of the treatment for which these therapies could be used. These debates would be better placed once all the facts are available; Parliament would then be able to frame the rules and regulations. This is not just about switching licences for therapy. Many noble Lords, including the noble Earl, Lord Howe, have raised the important question of regulation. The regulation of the creation of therapeutic interventions would, of course, go wider than the HFEA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="080115137000049">I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for her explanation. I am sure that it is absolutely correct. I cannot confirm it officially, but I will come back to noble Lords. The safety of treatments would need to be examined and the techniques by which they were created would need considerable oversight. Without having a full policy on when and how licences for therapy should be granted, it would not be possible to anticipate all the changes that would be needed to make the 1990 Act ready to enable proper regulation and licensing. This means that a regulation-making power would also be needed to make changes to the Act at the appropriate time. Such a regulation-making power would need to be very broad, enabling changes to HFEA licensing procedures, licence conditions, storage and consent.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="080115137000050">It is absolutely right that research into treatment should continue. The 1990 Act does, and will continue to, permit the creation of embryos for research. This means that embryos can be created for pre-clinical research trials and beyond, as long as the creation is still for research purposes. The Government believe that we would perhaps be better placed to consider informed and appropriate new primary legislation to

I have listened carefully to all the arguments put this evening and would not want to mislead noble Lords into thinking that we could bring back our own amendment at Third Reading. We could not. This is an important and wide subject. While we are grateful for the amendment as tabled, it would need considerable work. However, I am sure that my colleague the Minister responsible in another place would be prepared to look at it again and that she would return to the issue in the other place. I hope that, with that, the noble Lord is willing to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="080115137000052">Let me answer one or two points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe&#151;I cannot answer them fully, because of time. It is important to understand that the use of ES cells in patients will be regulated by the MHRA, not the HFEA. However, all the cell lines currently made in this country are made from embryos licensed to be used only for research, not for therapy purposes. There might therefore be difficulty in using these cell lines for therapy purposes. The EU directive requires that the EU ask whether the cell lines were created in an environment of which it would approve: the GMP facilities. Hence the need to allow under licence the creation of embryos for storage and the creation of lines at GMP facilities so that we are ready to have them.</p>

<a name="80115-0011.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="080115137000053">On the number of lines required, that might again be a decision that the regulators, such as the MHRA and the EU directive, must make on the basis of a therapy. But it could be that we require only one stem cell line. Embryonic stem cell lines, when kept under proper conditions, are immortal. You can produce vats of cell lines from one stem cell line. It is not rocket science to know how many lines. The maximum that we require for our population might be 15, even for some kind of tissue-matching purposes; that would depend on the immunogenicity, but I would not go there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="080115137000061">The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have had a rather tortuous journey in the timing of this debate on the reform of the European wine regime. It is perhaps appropriate that we address the issue of wine reform during the dinner hour. I am not quite sure of the relationship between wine and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, but I am sure we could find one if we look hard enough.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="080115137000062">To get down to business, the present wine regime is one of the few remaining unreformed elements of the common agricultural policy. It portrays all the worst elements of the CAP in its first incarnation. It is based on a combination of production subsidies and production controls: a failed answer to the problem of European agriculture. Our conclusion is that, as it stands, the wine regime is bad for consumers, bad for entrepreneurial producers and bad for the European taxpayer. We adopt a position that there is a need for urgent and fundamental reform, a position supported by the Commission and Her Majesty&#146;s Government. It is bad for consumers because it encourages the production of types and a quality of wine that, quite frankly, the consumer does not wish to drink.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="080115137000063">Throughout the EU as a whole, wine consumption is declining. Ironically, it is only in the more northern countries, traditionally non-wine-producing member states, that consumption is increasing. In those countries, however, the consumer is choosing to drink more and more non-EU wine from new world countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="080115137000064">The effect of this switch to new world wine is that the European Union is on the cusp of becoming a net importer of wine, something which is difficult to comprehend. How has this state of affairs come about? Brutally, it has come about because new world producers produce what the consumer wants and is prepared to pay for. They have developed a method of marketing their wine which is consumer driven. It is reasonably priced, and particularly strong in the important market segment of the medium price range: &#163;5 to &#163;10 per bottle. It is of reasonable good quality and presented in way easy for the consumer to understand, concentrating on grape variety, country of production and year of vintage, rather than the intricacies of chateau and terroir which characterise so much EU wine and are frankly often impenetrable to the consumer buying the bottle from the supermarket on the way home. Above all, new world wine has the consistency and predictability of taste that the consumer demands. However, that very predictability has been almost sneered at and regarded with contempt by too many voices in the European wine industry. The European

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="080115137000065">The wine regime is bad for consumers, but it is also bad for the taxpayer&#151;a figure we found strangely absent from the concerns of those, especially in the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament, who were intent on preserving the main features of a fundamentally failed system: the status quo. The wine regime costs the European taxpayer &#8364;1.3 billion a year, about two-thirds of which is paid out in support of distillation which is, in essence, a production subsidy. It is not only expensive but, more importantly, it insulates the producer from the reality of the market and leads in some areas to the ludicrous practice of producing wine not for the market but for taxpayer-funded industrial distillation. Distillation subsidies and their abolition are at the heart of the problem facing the EU wine industry.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="080115137000066">The existing wine regime is not only bad for the consumer and the taxpayer, it is bad for the innovative, market-oriented producer. Rather than supporting the promotion of the product, the labelling constraints faced by European producers too often act as a block between the producer and the consumer. Above all, potential new entrepreneurial, market-oriented producers are frozen out by the application of planting rights, which means that potential new entrants are denied entry to the market and existing, often inefficient, growers are protected. The argument in favour of planting rights is that while surplus production exists and people are being paid to leave the industry, it does not make sense to allow newcomers to enter the market. We take a fundamentally different view. We argue that, as long as distillation subsidies are removed, new entrants, whose success or failure will be completely dependent upon their success in the marketplace, should be welcomed and, indeed, are necessary if the EU wine industry is to turn itself around and flourish. We take the view that the present wine regime is totally misguided, unsustainable and in need of fundamental reform. Happily, this view is very largely shared by the European Commission, and I now want to turn to its original proposals. I am sure the Minister will update us with the outcome of the latest Agricultural Council meeting.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="080115137000067">The most important of the Commission&#146;s proposals is the ending of all distillation subsidies. That is not only central: it is vital if the European wine industry is to stand a chance of getting closer to its market and its consumers. Another proposal concerns planting rights, which were originally due to expire in 2010. The Commission&#146;s original proposal was to extend them to 2013, and I understand that as a result of the understandable compromise reached at the Agricultural Council meeting, they are being extended to 2015. We have reservations about that. We think that encouraging new entrants is an essential way forward for the European wine industry, and we regret that it has been necessary to make that compromise, although we understand the political reality and necessity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="080115137000068">There are a number of other matters, such as labelling, where progress is being made, but perhaps not quite fast enough. I cannot for the life of me understand

However, I want to refer to an element of the Commission&#146;s original proposals that was totally perverse: the proposal for a ban on the use of sugar for enrichment, together with the requirement to replace it with grape must. The effect of that would simply be to increase costs for producers in more northerly countries. When the European industry is facing significant external competition, what is the justification for increasing production costs? There is none. On other matters, we are prepared to support the implementation of schemes to allow producers to leave the industry&#151;the so-called grubbing up proposals. We accept national envelopes because we recognise the need for some degree of flexibility, but we think that there ought to be absolute scrutiny to ensure that national envelopes do not become a backdoor means of giving production support.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="080115137000069">Overall, the outcome has been enormously beneficial. The key objectives of the Commission&#146;s proposals have been secured. The Government have secured their objectives as well. I shall briefly indicate that our reservations are concerned with the failure to abolish planting rights until 2015, and we are concerned about national envelopes, particularly green harvesting, which we see as a means of maintaining production support and which ought to be looked at very carefully.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="080115137000070">Finally, I turn to marketing. Marketing is the key to getting close to the consumer. In many of our discussions in Europe, marketing was reduced to advertising. Marketing is about much more than advertising; it is making sure that you are listening to the consumer, reacting to him and producing what he wants. It is no good telling him that European wine is the best in the world if he actually prefers to drink something else. It boils down to something as simple as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="080115137000074">What is the result of that market fixing? The result is a bill of &#8364;1.25 billion per annum, half of the production of which is distilled, which effectively means removing it from the market. Commissioner Fischer Boel herself, in the preface to the report on change in the regime, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"><a name="080115137000126">&#147;The European Union has a budget to help our wine producers. But we spend far too much of it on simply disposing of surplus wine for which there is no market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115137000112">We also have a loss of market share across the Continent. I was amazed to hear that there are 2.5 million wine holdings throughout Europe, the majority of which&#151;not all, in France, they are better off, but in the other nations&#151;are still effectively in rural poverty, despite that &#8364;1.25 billion.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="080115137000075">The wine regime missed or bypassed the 2003 CAP reform, and I am delighted that we in Europe are now taking this forward and not waiting for the health check, let alone for 2013. What I am not personally comfortable with about the committee's recommendations is national envelopes. As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, himself said, there is so much room for abuse and backdoor subsidisation in that area.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="080115137000076">It is expected that about 200,000 hectares will be grubbed up. That is a huge land mass. When we think that agricultural growing prices are at their highest worldwide for some time, I should have thought that natural market forces would make the subsidising of grubbing-up less necessary. I also note that the committee report, although it supports it in the short-term, is concerned about a neutral budget. Yes, there needs to be transition in the fiscal regime, but to come up with a neutral budget after such a large and radical reform is not adequate. I very much support the ending of the market support regime by ending distillation and the fact that we should be able to expand and have new vineyards, but we cannot support grubbing-up and have new vineyards at the same time.</p>

The wine producers here are still expanding. We should always remember that some of our wines are becoming very competitive. It also means that wine production can continue without the threat of a planting ban and that producers have the flexibility to make a marketable product and have the option, as I understand it, under the agreement, of using some sugar at a level that will make it marketable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="080115137000081">Our report is based on the European Union as a whole. The main focus throughout has been on the question of the national envelopes, but it is their size and content that will be the issue. I am personally concerned about the national envelopes&#151;although the principle is good&#151;because of how they may be used. That can be done only by reducing the amount of funding from rural development schemes. I hope that the Minister can assure us that that will not be at the expense of rural development generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="080115137000082">As we understand it, member states will also be free to disperse funds through those national envelopes by means of a decoupled single farm payment of the supporting programmes to remove surplus production nationally.

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="080115137000083">As I see it, our mission to France to witness the industry in Languedoc and Bordeaux revealed three features that perhaps impede competitiveness. It is fragmented; it is producer-dominated; and 71 per cent of the vineyards consist of about 5 hectares. They are competing with wines that are produced on holdings of 50 hectares plus. It is seen very much as a cultural craft, not so much as a commercial operation. Growers see the need for change themselves. It was the first time ever in my history that I heard a Frenchman say that he did not want subsidies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="080115137000084">We have accepted the general situation in our report: there should be a voluntary and subsidised grubbing-up programme. As the chairman knew that I was a bit of a dirt farmer, it was always my question to ask those giving evidence about grubbing-up. That is a matter of concern to us all. As the chairman said, the cost of that regime is &#8364;1.3 million a year, which is part of the overall expenditure of the common agricultural policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="080115137000085">To achieve a reduction in spending in the short term will be more complex than I had perhaps appreciated when we started the study, but if it is not grasped, and if the regime improves itself, I fear that production will suffer very much at the expense of greater imports from around the world.

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="080115137000087">The sad thing is that out there is a potentially great EU wine industry. The even sadder thing is that many of the wine growers whom we met recognise that if they were allowed the freedom that they craved, they could succeed in the world marketplace. But the politicians say, &#147;Why change?&#148;. Why make it easier for the young, new viticulturalists to come in and undercut those who are doing so well from the current system?</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="080115137000088">Only vines, they say, can provide such a high number of jobs. There seems to be no concept of the economic opportunities of the non-land based rural economy. Yet, at the same time, we learned that of the 26,000 wine growers in Languedoc-Rousillon, less than half of them are full-time estates. The majority are run as a hobby by local families, shopkeepers and businessmen who keep their small family holding going as part of their family heritage&#151;frankly, without much interest in the quality of their produce. So there clearly is an alternative rural economy.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="080115137000089">The saddest example of the dependency culture espoused by the politicians is in their attitude to new plantings. The argument goes thus: how can you allow new plantings to happen when at the same time you are paying others to leave the industry and grubbing-up their vineyards? The point here is that that argument holds good only if growers had equal business and marketing skills, produced the same quality of grapes at the same cost, and grew vines on equally ideal terrain.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="080115137000090">What the politicians cannot understand is that in a proper marketplace not controlled by politicians, new business men and women are always coming in with new ideas and better skills to undercut and outsell the old guard. Change is a constant factor in any industry and even more so in the wine industry where fashions in taste are so fickle. We should help the old guard to retire gracefully by grubbing-up our vineyards but we should also allow others to expand their production if they want to, provided there is no safety net for them, no crisis distillation if they fail to sell that wine. Sadly, it seems to me that the Commission has not quite achieved all that it wanted in this respect, owing to some of the freedoms to be allowed by the national envelopes.</p>

<p><a name="080115137000113">as the Minister put it in his reply to our report&#151;and perhaps help the older generation to retire from the business altogether. The two policies can work together to reduce the land under vines where the only market has been for low-quality wine or even producing wine for distillation itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="080115137000095">These two measures are structural and essential if the EU wine industry is to make any progress in dealing with the biggest problem that it faces: market share. It is evident from the amount of penetration into the marketplace by wines from the New World that, in the EU, marketing and listening to the consumer have been neglected. But there is a wasted opportunity with other parts of the Commission&#146;s proposals which, frankly, have not faced up to the challenge posed by competition. I shall mention two: the planting ban which is being discussed, to be extended from 2010 to 2013 or, now, even 2015; and the labelling rules.</p>

Are you living in the real world?&#148;. And yet that is the proposal facing EU wine growers. By the way, as my noble friend Lord Plumb said, it is excellent news for English wine growers that there has been agreement not to introduce a planting ban where none existed as at 31 December 2007. The planting ban, to my mind, is industrial suicide and should be scrapped tomorrow.</p>

<a name="80115-0012.htm_para34">
<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="080115137000097">The system of wine labelling in Europe is designed to protect the producer rather than to be of interest to the consumer. I was taken aback by the statistic that some 70 per cent or thereabouts of wine is bought from supermarkets and probably 85 per cent of the purchasers know little and care less about protected geographical indications or protected designations of origin. Wine makers should be free to describe their wines as they wish. More and more wines, especially those from the New World, have back labels which give much greater information about the variety of grape or the blend of grapes and whether the wine is suitable as an aperitif, for drinking with fish or meat, or just as a light wine for picnics and so forth. That should be the way forward.</p>

It is a missed opportunity and I hope that those reading this report will reach the final conclusion of the committee at paragraph 84. If EU wine producers are to have a brighter future, they must look to the marketplace and make the industry competitive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="080115137000101">When we started this enquiry it was a revelation to me that EU taxpayers subsidised the wine sector to the tune of nearly &#163;1 billion a year.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"><a name="080115137000127">&#147;The current regime perversely protects inefficient and poor quality producers and prevents those with a strong market demand for their wine from expanding&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115137000102">While it might be considered glib to talk of a wine lake, the truth is that excess production has been distilled or stored on site for many years.

First, as we have heard, the agreement transfers much of the current subsidy into national envelopes, with the intention that the funds can be used over a transitional period to help growers move away from surplus production and adapt to new market conditions. However, this will be achieved only if member states have an appetite for major reform. Crucially, they need to insist that producers become more responsive to consumer preferences and trends. It may be quaint to have production methods handed down through generations, but if consumers no longer want to buy the end product, it deserves to be in a museum, not a market.</p>

They have tapped effortlessly into the middle-price sector where all the major expansion is occurring. This evidence from the new world contrasts painfully with some of the EU producer attitudes in which the consumer seems to be blamed for not recognising the superiority of their product. Breaking this cycle and delivering the

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="080115137000105">Secondly, the proposals for wine labelling fall short of the reforms recommended in our report. We heard considerable evidence that consumers were confused by the 10,000 or so geographical indicators currently used to define quality wine. Although the proposals allow more flexibility in labelling, maintaining that link between quality and geography is still lost on most consumers. I agree with many of my colleagues here today who have a preference for a new labelling regime under which producers are required to list the additives, grape variety and country of origin, and then have the freedom to market their products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="080115137000106">Finally, the irony of the whole issue is that the EU still produces the best wine in the world.

This, of course, is what caused the infamous wine lake. This planting ban has long been seen as the greatest challenge to the continued development of the wine industry in the UK. The industry has been growing steadily over a sustained period. If the ban was still applicable, we would very shortly exceed the 25,000 hectolitre de minimis limit permitted under it. When that limit was met, no new commercial vines could have been planted in the UK. In conclusion, the regime would have led to a six-year planting ban and a considerable increase in bureaucracy and red tape. It would have been a tragedy to put such a lid on the industry just as it was gaining a significant foothold in the market, especially when the diversification of produce is key to modern agricultural development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="080115137000110">When the United Kingdom Vineyards Association came before your Lordships&#146; committee to give evidence last February, removing the planting restrictions was at the very top of its agenda. Its position was fully supported by our committee, and I believe it also received significant cross-party support in another place. I send the United Kingdom Vineyards Association my fulsome congratulations, and wish it and its members every success. Particular progress has been made in the sparkling wine sector in this country. Some parts of southern England, as we learnt, where the subsoil is chalk and limestone, have almost identical geological properties to the Champagne region of France. The possibilities are considerable. However, although we might quite justly relish the success story of English and Welsh wine, we must not allow this small triumph to obscure the wider issues that the committee has been looking at. We are in agreement that there must be increasing opportunity for genuine market forces to operate within the EU wine sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="080115137000111">It is hard to see how a sustainable balance can be achieved across the Union unless we allow the focus of the industry to be squarely on the consumer, which means marketing in response to demand. The success of the new world bears testament to this. New world producers offer consumers what they want: wine that is reasonably priced, well labelled, approachable and consistent in terms of both flavour and supply. As such, their growing dominance in the market seems inexorable. Perhaps what gives me the greatest cause for hope in this context is the wine industry in this country, which is growing steadily, totally unsubsidised, and is now free from the bureaucracy that threatened to stifle it. I believe that it will stand the test of time, for this is indeed a worthy model, supported by a fine committee report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="0801164000003">This is an excellent report, and we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. Many tributes have been paid to him. As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said, the report has travelled well, perhaps better than anybody could have reasonably expected. It is also a report, essentially, about the Commission initiative. Many people in the debate have recognised the significance of the Commission proposal. My noble friend Lord Teverson referred to it as a large and radical reform; the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, referred to it as a profound reform. At the centre of its effectiveness is the ending of distillation compensation. That is, indeed, radical. We are also reminded, however, that we have to continue with all this. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, made the point that there was more to be done, and member states must retain their appetite for this reform. We will hear from the Minister in a moment about what finally occurred on 19 December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="0801164000004">There is a lot to applaud in this. I want to make just two points. It is a rapidly changing scene. Looked at from the perspective of the English and Welsh wine industry, there is a lot going on. Great successes have been achieved. We need to be rightly ambitious about our own wine industry. Despite all the detriments of climate change, in this particular regard it may be working for us somewhat. The French are now eyeing large estates in Kent because the soil is the same and the climate is now arguably becoming better than it is in Champagne for the production of champagne. Who knows? We may be the most enthusiastic supporters of appellation contr&#244;l&#233;e 15 years from now. Richard the Lionheart might approve of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="0801164000005">I have one reservation about the report. I have to say this: we must be careful about the labelling regime. Of course, the label at the rear of the bottle on New World wines, describing what you should drink it with and so on, is attractive. That is very useful, but our experience of labelling in so many areas of retail is that it is easy to dumb down but hard to recover. There is, as far as wines are concerned, a real and important relationship between geography and quality. We should not just set that aside. It is foolish to underestimate the intelligence of consumers. I say that with some passion. We are, after all, asking consumers, including supermarket consumers, to be more and more intelligent and literate when reading labels on many sorts of things. I think the reforms that are being proposed by the Commission and the suggestions on labelling are very good, but there is at the heart of the labelling regime an insistence on the relationship between quality and geography&#151;and even terroir&#151;and we should set that aside with great care. It would be easy, in a burst of enthusiasm, to make a mistake in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="0801164000006">Overall, we are looking at a surprisingly brave commitment to reform by the European Commission, which, if it succeeds, will place the European wine industry, which still makes the best wines in the world, in a much more competitive position in the decades ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="0801164000008">I wish to pick up on one or two of the recommendations made in the report. The important reforms are indeed welcome, as has been reflected tonight. I strongly support the ending of all subsidies for wine distillation. It seems wrong that subsidies are paid to producers of inferior wine who are unable to sell their product in an open market. The committee recognised that, without the removal of the subsidies, other proposed measures would not be able to deliver the efficiency gains that are necessary to set the industry on its feet again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="0801164000012">All speakers tonight have reflected our welcome for the fact that the proposed ban on new plantings will not apply to UK producers. The Government have recognised in the report that much needed restructuring cannot take place unless uncompetitive producers are helped to leave the industry with dignity. Should the UK climate continue to warm, it is clearly in the interests of UK wine producers to be allowed freedom to grow their businesses. I look forward to the contribution of my noble friend Lord Moynihan on that. Have the Government made further representations to the EU on the issues of labelling and, particularly, the freedom of new producers to come in to the industry?</p>

I look forward to having a glass of wine later, and I welcome this report as very timely.

I had the privilege of appearing before the committee, which gave me the advantage that I was able to create, as I had to do, the time to visit at least one premier vineyard in this country that has won gold medals in Paris for its bubbly wine down in Kent.

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="0801164000017">First, it is clear that Europe had lost its way. It is still the case, judging by the documents produced by the Commission, that Europe is a world leader in wine. It is the biggest producer of wine, the biggest consumer, the biggest exporter and the top import market. That sounds like a paradox, but that is the case as far as Europe is concerned. In the past 20 years, the overall trend has been towards a reduction in the area under vines, with a 10 per cent drop. This is a massively contradictory development. The EU has seen a limited but steady reduction in area while its main competitors have witnessed stunning growth in their production capacity, with increases of 21 per cent in the United States, 33 per cent in South Africa, 52 per cent in Chile, 178 per cent in Australia and 360 per cent in New Zealand.

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="0801164000019">The agriculture council finally reached agreement on a new wine regime on 19 December. I say &#147;finally&#148; because the agreement was the culmination of almost two years&#146; work. It started in February 2006 with the Commission&#146;s wine seminar, which prepared the way for the proposals in July of last year. I know that your Lordships&#146; report was widely read and absorbed across Europe and was recognised as providing a valuable contribution to the debate by acting as an informed counterweight to some of the sensationalist reporting of the Commission&#146;s proposals elsewhere. The Government are very satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation, and so is the trade. I am grateful for the work of my officials, particularly Robert Manning, who has been praised by the trade for the effort he put into this. We were able to secure a number of changes in the Commission&#146;s original proposal. There was a trade-off, and I will give an example in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, in a moment.</p>

<a name="80115-0013.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="0801164000020">On planting rights, for example, the Commission listened to our concerns about the potentially damaging impact that its proposals to extend the planting rights would have had on the continued growth on the very small&#151;about a 1,000th of Europe&#151;but dynamic wine-production centre in the United Kingdom. The final agreement provides that planting restrictions will not be introduced in future in small wine-producing areas. If you were not covered at the end of December, you are not going to be covered. It is a free-for-all for planting in the UK, and that is fine. It is a significant change. I also pay tribute to two United Kingdom Members of the European Parliament, Brian Simpson and Neil Parish, for their assistance in securing this change. They made a magnificent effort, and there was excellent co-operation between Whitehall and Members of the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80115-0013.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="0801164000021">Similarly, on enrichment, two important changes to the Commission&#146;s proposals were secured in the final compromise. First, producers will be able to continue to use sugar to enrich their wine, instead of being forced to use grape must exclusively, as originally proposed. That means a large financial saving. They do not have to use sugar, but they can continue to use it. I might add that that is a normal process. It has gone on for hundreds of years with northern European producers. Southern European producers actually use acid because there is too much sugar in their wines. It needs to be palatable and drinkable, and this is part of the accepted process. Secondly, an acceptable compromise was reached on the maximum level of enrichment that is possible in northern member states. Both changes are important to the UK production sector, as our wine makers continue to have flexibility to enrich their wines to make a marketable and award-winning product.</p>

That will lead to an improvement in the market focus of the sector, which has been lacking up to now. Furthermore, in the immediate period, the schemes have to be funded from within the national programmes, meaning that the producer member states will need to decide to what extent they wish to allocate resources to measures such as these, as opposed to the other more worthwhile measures in the programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="0801164000023">I should perhaps say at this point that the content and size of the national envelopes proved to be the most difficult element of the reform. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, I say that, in order to fund the increased national envelopes, the original transfer of funding has been reduced to maintain budget neutrality. However, the list of eligible measures in the national envelope has been expanded to include, for example, investments in wine-processing facilities. That was a necessary trade-off to achieve the final agreement. We do not say that everything is perfect, but the final agreement is excellent news for the United Kingdom. We will take a little more time, but there had to be a compromise agreement.</p>

<a name="80115-0014.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="0801164000024">It is worth pointing out that two important changes were secured. First, it will no longer be mandatory for export marketing schemes to be funded as part of a member state&#146;s national programme. Secondly, member states will be able to decide to disburse national envelope allocations via the single payment scheme. We would have preferred a reduced level of funding of the national envelopes and the immediate abolition of market support instruments. However, we accepted the compromise in the context of an otherwise acceptable package of reforms. In any case, we could not have changed the vote. It met our criterion that the reform should not result in an increase in the recent level of expenditure on wine; it will see the phasing-out of market support measures and secures a satisfactory outcome for the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80115-0014.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="0801164000025">In the short time available I would also like to mention the other main elements of the agreement aimed at improving the competitiveness of the sector and improving consumer focus. The fact that the new grubbing-up scheme will last three years rather than five years will enable a quicker transition to the new market reality. There is also the extension of the single payment scheme to vineyards, including the creation of new entitlements for areas that are grubbed up under the scheme, and increased flexibility on the range of optional information that wine producers can put on labels, such as the grape variety and the vintage without a geographical indication. I have not talked to the French, but somehow I cannot see them wanting to change their labels. However, there is an incentive for them to do so. There is to be a simplified process for the adoption of wine-making practices laid down at international level by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine and an improved wine quality scheme that links directly with that for other products.</p>

We are already producing tea in Cornwall, and major new products will come as a result of climate change. The fact is that our wine production sector can now continue to expand without the threat of planting restrictions, which were without question a major threat. Our producers will also be able to enrich their wines to produce a marketable product.</p>

At the very least we should have a realistic analysis of what is involved. We have a duty to explore the reality rather than the hype of creating tissue matching babies. It is not a simple procedure and it gives no guarantee of a cure.</p>

If the saviour sibling procedure promulgated in this Bill is accepted, is it right for a fertile woman to be subjected to infertility treatment carrying risks, bearing in mind her responsibility to her family, including at least one existing child?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="0801164000048">When trying to produce a matching baby, multiple IVF cycles, increasing the health risks to the mother, would almost certainly be needed in order to create a large number of embryos, thereby maximising the chances of a tissue match. Of course, any non-matching or surplus embryos are destroyed. The testing process to identify a tissue match depends on removing one or two cells from the developing embryo around the eight cell stage&#151;an invasive procedure which of itself may diminish the survival rate of the embryo in question. In addition, the longer term consequences of the technology involved&#151;pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or PGD&#151;are unknown. Children created in this way have yet to reach reproductive age. The tests that are undertaken to search for a tissue match are not being done for the benefit of that particular embryo. His or her interests are subservient to those of the sick family member.</p>

Some people question both from a physiological and a philosophical perspective whether an embryo which has a quarter of its cells removed remains the same

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="0801164000050">We have a duty to address the probability of success. How likely is it that a tissue-matching embryo will be created? Answer: there is no guarantee of success. It will never be easy and, whatever the outcome, it will take at least a year before any tissue becomes available. If PGD is performed simply to identify matching tissue, the chance of success is estimated at one in four; but this figure decreases considerably when further tests are performed to select out embryos carrying genetic diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="0801164000051">In data on embryo biopsy across Europe collected for the European Society for Reproduction and Embryology, published in January 2005, it is recorded that of 14,500 fertilised embryos, there were only 298 pregnancies showing a positive heartbeat. These data relate to PGD to identify genetic disease and do not include added testing for compatible tissue typing, which is what the Bill proposes. As far as I can establish, no other national Parliament in the world has legislated to allow saviour siblings. Perhaps the Minister could advise us on that point.</p>

I welcome the move by the Government in seeking to restrict the practice in this respect, but it does not assuage my concerns about the fundamental ethical principle at stake here, and neither does Amendment No. 30, in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. Moreover, the government amendment is not sufficient in its own terms. By using the word &#147;whole&#148;, it does not preclude part of an organ.

First, there is the question of potential harms to the parties involved, most obviously the harm inflicted by the destruction of unsuitable embryos. Secondly, at the very centre of our ethical thought&#151;both religious and secular, deriving from philosophy as well as tradition&#151;lies the principle that one may not degrade an individual human life by treating it as an instrument for the benefit of others rather than as something to be regarded and respected in its own right. If we deviate from that principle, we have no fixed grounds on which to stand in resistance to other claims to create and manipulate human life for various beneficial ends. Instead, we will be pulled by the demands of the day, and I have no intention of speculating how horrible that could be.</p>

That all other embryos are rejected is confirmation of that fact. The designed child, for the duration of its life, will be witness to the intention of the designers and will always be vulnerable, both physically and psychologically, to further demands on its body. To manufacture a person in this way is to offend against the respect that is due to the integrity of that person, no matter how compelling the goal of trying to cure. I am therefore convinced that the right decision has to be total opposition to the deliberate creation of children as tissue donors for others. I urge noble Lords to support the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="0801164000061">I remind the House that in November, in answer to a question from me, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"><a name="0801164000070">&#147;The Bill does not limit which tissue can be used in the treatment of a sibling ... and the Human Tissue Authority must approve any transplants involving organs from living donors and for children who are too young to give consent&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/07; col. 869.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801164000064">That answer gave me cause for concern, and that is why I tabled amendments in Committee.</p>

<a name="80115-0014.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="0801164000062">In a letter on 8 January, the noble Lord said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"><a name="0801164000071">&#147;Concerns have been raised that these decisions could envisage organs being taken for transplant. The Government accepts that this would not be a desirable state of affairs ... The proposed change&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0801164000066">As far as it goes, what the letter says sounds reasonable enough and seems to be an attempt to meet some of the points that have previously been made. However, as the noble Baroness said, the difficulty is that once we tissue-type in the first place we set these wheels in motion. When you tissue-type to test for umbilical cord or bone marrow, you have the genetic footprint of that child and then organs could be used after birth, even though this Bill does not set out to permit that.</p>

<a name="80115-0014.htm_para32">
<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="0801164000063">My other concern is that in Amendment No. 31 we are being invited to include the words &#147;other tissue&#148; in the Bill. I hope that when the Minister replies to this debate about prohibition he will say something about what &#147;other tissue&#148; means, because that will influence how we vote later. Doctors have put it to me that it could mean taking part of a liver&#151;not a whole liver&#151;or a lobe from a lung, which could be used and identified as &#147;other tissue&#148;. Because it might be regenerative, it might qualify under &#147;other tissue&#148;. Obviously, that has considerable implications for the child from whom those tissues have been taken. Morbidity, even mortality, rates can be high. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, has done us a service by reminding us that there are profound questions here in allowing the principle to proceed at all.</p>

I ask the House to put itself in the place of the saviour sibling, who is torn between fear, guilt and love. How might the development of their life be disrupted? Tragically, the sick child might often die anyway. How would the saviour feel when the older brother or sister died? Guilt if they did not give the required part organs and, if they did give them, guilt and despair that their part organs were not good enough or given in time. What if the saviour had a major complication following the transplant or had their life disrupted by being taken out of circulation to recover at a crucial stage in their life, such as final exams? What, in a small percentage of cases, if they died? How would the family feel in those circumstances? These are not unreasonable questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="0801169000004">The Government might object that it would be up to the Human Tissue Authority to decide whether to allow the transplant. However, if this legislation is passed, the Human Tissue Authority will have seen the signal from Parliament that it is perfectly all right to create a child as an organ donor and therefore will be under strong pressure to agree. There is also the test of best interest that the HTA has to use. However, this includes psychological, emotional and social best interests, as well as medical ones. Imagine that the saviour created as an organ donor is now utterly devoted to his older brother and does not want him to die. It could be argued that it would be much better for his psychological, emotional and social health to part with this or that part organ rather than to see his brother die. However, he should not have been deliberately put in that position in the first place. That is at the heart of the argument laid before us by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain.</p>

<a name="80115-0015.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="0801169000005">In her response in Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, indicated that this would be acceptable if a child could have their life expectancy extended by one, two or 10 years. Perhaps she would like to reconsider that in the light of the examples given about the kind of part organs that might be used in treatments for conditions such as cystic fibrosis. The Government have also repeatedly quoted the HFEA&#146;s seventh code of practice, which is concerned with the initial tissue typing. That is irrelevant if one considers the example of Dr Simon Fishel, the IVF expert, who told us that he is looking forward to creating kidney donors. I cited that example in Committee not because he is someone who has just got a view on this but because he is an HFEA peer reviewer, an external examiner and an inspector. Clearly, therefore, we would be imprudent simply to rely on the HFEA to stop embryos being tissue typed to create organ or part-organ donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="0801169000006">We need cures for diseases of the sort that I have mentioned, but deliberately creating saviour siblings as organ or part-organ donors is not the answer. Furthermore, parents should not be put in the position of being able to make such a dreadful decision in such vulnerable circumstances. The Government have repeatedly cited the Human Tissue Act, passing the buck to the Human Tissue Authority and implying that it would be the same for any child after birth. However, let us be clear about this. It is not a comparable situation. Normal children are not deliberately created to be organ or part-organ donors for their older brother or sister.</p>

<a name="80115-0015.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="0801169000007">It is an absolute sham to claim that a saviour sibling would be created for only umbilical cord blood and possibly bone marrow&#151;and even for part organs. After birth, the child could be used for whole organs, as it would be immune-matched for the existing sick child. There would be diseases that could be helped partially by these other tissues but which might eventually require a whole organ. This might be known by the parents and the IVF clinician, but in their desperation to cure the sick child they might overlook the profound implications that that could have on the saviour sibling.</p>

One is that once an embryo is immune-matched to the existing child, it is known to be immune-matched&#151;period. The other fatal flaw is the ability of the Human Tissue Authority to grant permission after the child&#146;s birth for any of a variety of whole organs to be taken from it and transplanted. Three words out of the 44,363 words in the Bill&#151;&#147;or other tissue&#148;&#151;could consign a child to being created deliberately as an organ donor. The Government are suggesting one word&#151;&#147;whole&#148;&#151;but that could consign a child to being deliberately created from the outset as a part-organ donor and to being available after birth as a whole-organ donor.

That will lead on to the acceptance of the purchase of organs, which already happens all over the world, for the purpose of curing oneself or one&#146;s family. The devil take the hindmost when it comes to the child who becomes the unwilling donor of an organ, which is already to be seen all over Asia and Africa, with people buying up organs.</p>

He or she will certainly not be able to make that decision in an independent way&#151;in a selfish way, if you like&#151;because of the nature of the pressures. I simply ask the House to consider for one moment what would be made in the<I> Sun, </I>the<I> Daily Express</I>, or the<I> Daily Mail</I> of a case where it looked as if a child could be saved by the birth of a tissue-similar brother or sister.

That is to diminish the nature and the purpose of the second child by essentially producing it and creating it for this purpose. That is the objection. Incidentally, the objection is not about whether the tissue comes from an embryo or a more fully developed child. The issue is that the child is being treated as an instrument for the purposes of the parents and the other child and is not being treated for itself. If a child was a perfect tissue match, I appreciate that it would be a matter for the parents and, if the child was old enough, for the child itself to decide on what was to be done.

The child&#146;s own rights would have to be respected. That is to do with recognising human rights. I suppose that one could add that up in practical terms by saying that, if the donation in no way affected the younger child&#146;s prospects of survival, of living a full life and of having the normal prospects that a child has, the objection would be far less strong than if there was some question of, as in the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, part of a liver or something of that kind being attributed, or one kidney out of two. Then you begin to raise questions about the survival value of that child and it becomes a different story&#151;a story about the rights of that child.</p>

I add in parentheses that, a few years later, the HFEA refused permission to the Whitaker family in slightly different circumstances. Again, that was roundly condemned by the media, this time for being hard-hearted; in other words, one cannot win. When the HFEA gave permission to the Hashmis, it followed about a year of the most extensive internal ethical debate and some public consultation.

Children came along and people had them for whatever reason they thought fit. I might even suggest that some titled families had children so that they could inherit the title. Others might have had more children so that they could till the earth, or whatever the situation might be. The motives were not questioned and to do so is very new.</p>

The Hashmis might have carried on having children naturally, which is possibly a worse ethical situation and certainly more of a stress on the family than having PGD. In the event, there is only a one in 16 chance of finding an embryo that is free of the inherited disease and is a tissue match. Sadly, the Hashmis have not yet succeeded, as far as I know, whereas the Whitakers went to America and did succeed. Their children are healthy, as is the original saviour sibling, Molly Nash.</p>

When I taught family law a few years ago, permission could be given only by a High Court judge. I was surprised to hear that the Human Tissue Authority can give permission. It is, in a way, parti pris&#151;geared up to human tissue donation. I would feel content if any donation other than the umbilical cord blood had to be sanctioned, as was the case in the past, by a family court judge. Those judges have had much experience in this for many years. That would provide satisfaction for those who feel concerned about it.

Any of us who are parents, or who long to be parents, go on from there for all sorts of reasons&#151;but this is another kind of reason, one that has a commodifying aspect and makes an instrument of a child.

I could see the noble Lord, Lord Patten, shaking his head, thinking that it might have been me, but it was not. It was actually a bishop with a much more traditional reputation than I have. However, I was chair of the ethics and law committee when this once again came before it. I supported it because I believe that when parents have children they have a mixture of motives. They are not having another child simply in order to aid a sick sibling; they will want another child anyway.

We discussed in Committee whether we could amend the Human Tissue Act. I took that issue to the Clerk of the Parliaments and specifically drew his attention to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, in Committee.

What I miss from the amendments&#151;perhaps I should have taken more trouble over this&#151;is that my noble friend on the Front Bench, Lord Howe, suggested that the test of what organs could be used in those circumstances should be confined to regenerative organs. I am not sure that we have that proposal before us in any form at the moment. That is an attractive suggestion.

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="0801169000039">I feel I ought to put in an interjection simply because my lab pioneered this technology. I am really sorry that I was not in my place when the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, spoke but I imagine that she will find me a surprising supporter of some of the things that she has been saying. One of my concerns is something that has been in the news very recently. When you biopsy an embryo, you effectively take away one or at most two cells containing one or two molecules of DNA. What you are effectively doing is something which has been in the courts recently in Northern Ireland and is currently under scrutiny in the courts generally in the British&#151;a form of low copy number DNA. Essentially, you are trying to establish the genetics of an embryo based on the tiniest possible amount of tissue in very controlled circumstances, unlike in criminal circumstances or where the courts are looking at age DNA, but none the less subject to all sorts of problems regarding the gene amplification and the risk of contamination of that DNA.</p>

<a name="80115-0016.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="0801169000040">At present, that technology is by no means entirely safe. There are risks of making a wrong diagnosis&#151;thinking that you have a particular tissue type when you have not, or getting a gene defect right when you have not. The history of PGD shows that from time to time mistakes have been made and an embryo affected by a disease for which there has been screening has been transferred to the uterus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="0801169000041">Here we have a particular case in point. Most of these cases will be in families where there is a gene defect already and therefore the scientists involved will not just be screening for one specific gene but for the gene which causes the defect and the series of genes which make up the tissue type of that embryo. Therefore, there is a very real risk of not making a correct diagnosis. I listened very carefully to the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, who says that the chances of getting it right are about one in 16. I am not sure what the mathematics are, but I imagine that the chances of getting it right every time are really quite low and even if it is correct, you still have the recognition that if that child grows up, its stem cells will be capable of being taken up by that embryo.</p>

In general I am not a great believer in the slippery slope, but even if we do establish a child who is compatible with its elder sibling and free of the gene defect, the problem is that if the initial stem cell transplant does not work, there is then the increasing pressure to consider what you might do next as the child grows up.</p>

Lessons over the years have rather indicated that I am occasionally, if not frequently, wrong. It is a very happy picture, but simply not true that every mother loves every child. If the first child has become ill and, solely in order to help that sick child, the mother has had another child, which she hopes will be able to make the first child better, I am bound to say that I cannot go along with the happy notion that all of a sudden, although the child had been created to serve that purpose for a loved first child, all of that would be put at nought because the mother loved the second child as well. It would put the mother in a terrible dilemma. I am impressed, indeed, by what my noble friend said initially in introducing this amendment. I have the greatest concern about this and I would support her all the way, although I wish that what has just been said was always true.</p>

I am slightly prompted by what the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge said, which was that if a mother has a saviour sibling, who has given some part of its body for the child that is ill, the mother will love that child just as much as the sick child. That may be so, but I wonder what the child will feel if it thinks that it has been brought into the world solely in order to provide a donor for a brother or sister.</p>

This is a very complicated subject, but you do not necessarily have to be a butcher to smell when the meat is bad. I find it very difficult to think, if I have understood correctly, that this Bill permits people to have babies for the sole purpose of providing organs for another sick child. It seems to me that this is taking science too far. In many respects it might be described and considered as grotesque. That is why I would vote for the amendment.</p>

That is something that I would strongly support. Indeed, I would support a prohibition on the transplantation of part organs. There is a case, which we must at least consider carefully, that umbilical cord blood produced by a sibling&#151;or indeed bone marrow, which is much less invasive&#151;might cure a child suffering from a major, devastating genetic disease. For that reason, I would be a little uncomfortable if the Bill were to rule out that possibility, subject always to the kind of legal considerations and approval by a judge to which the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has referred. I would be very uncomfortable if we ruled out that possibility altogether.</p>

This would mean that, prior to any transplant taking place, the Human Tissue Authority would have to consider the individual circumstances. Where children are involved, the panel making the decisions should consist of no fewer than three members of the Human Tissue Authority. The code of practice of the Human Tissue Authority advises that before the removal of a solid organ from a child, whether competent or not, it is good practice for court approval to be obtained.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000013">In his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, the Economic Secretary claimed that youth services have been underfunded for years. I do not have the knowledge to pass an opinion on whether there is adequate funding for youth services. That decision should rightfully be made by the appropriate Minister with all the information and resources at his disposal. What should be explored is how the Minister reconciles the Government&#146;s previous statements that they fully concur with our concerns about additionality with instructions in the Bill to direct money to youth.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080115130000014">It seems very much as though the Government have identified an area in which they have failed and are now mustering resources from everywhere they can think of&#151;even those that should not rightfully be theirs to direct. Can the Minister explain exactly how dormant account money will be spent differently from money spent by the Department for Children, Schools and Families? What sort of projects does he envisage being paid for by Her Majesty&#146;s Government, and what will be paid for by the nominally independent Big Lottery Fund?</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080115130000015">Any breach of the additionality principle will no doubt extend to the matter of financial education. How does the Minister intend that dormant account money will be spent so that it does not duplicate the attempts of other departments? The difficulties in this area that the Bill will create have already been noted by the Treasury Select Committee. In paragraph 71 of the 11th report of the 2006-07 Session, it points out the contrast between the Government&#146;s intention to make the scheme voluntary so that there is no compulsion on the banks and building societies to join and the Government&#146;s refusal to consult on where the money should go.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080115130000016">It will be extremely difficult for the disbursement of this money to be directed by a Secretary of State without breaching additionality. It will be impossible for a Minister, with the power to direct taxpayers&#146; money through his department, to be, or be seen to be, objective when asked to choose between spending which eats into his budget and money which comes from an outside source.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080115130000017">That is precisely why non-taxpayers&#146; money should be allocated by an independent body. Only an independent body can take a properly objective view on what is suitable for this non-taxpayer money to be spent on. This was, after all, the original motivation for setting up the lottery distributors. As a result, I have turned to the lottery distributors for the drafting of this amendment. The wording is taken from the definition of &#147;additionality&#148; that the Big Lottery Fund uses to report on its distribution of lottery funding and the three criteria against which its grants are assessed to ensure that it does not breach additionality.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080115130000018">Of course, the definition has been somewhat amended. Amazingly, the Big Lottery Fund maintains that it is not breaching additionality to spend money to add value to a government project. As that has resulted in it distributing more than &#163;1 billion since 2004 to statutory bodies such as local councils, schools and

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080115130000019">Just in case the Minister seeks to argue that such spending was not on core government projects, let me give examples of some of those grants. In October, Lancashire County Council received &#163;1.4 million to fund a three-year advice, training, information and support service for carers. I am not commenting that this service should not be offered to carers, who no doubt would gain an enormous amount from it, but there is no doubt that such a service, provided by a government body in line with this Government&#146;s stated objectives to improve support for carers, should be funded by government, and not by lottery fund, money.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080115130000020">In 2006, another grant from the Big Lottery Fund supplied the Danish energy company, Elsam, with &#163;50 million to subsidise the construction of a wind farm. How can the Minister justify the spending of this type of money on projects which are so clearly tied to Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s targets on renewal energy, targets that the Government are struggling to meet? The inappropriateness of this grant is made even worse by Elsam&#146;s statement that it would have gone ahead anyway, even without the grant.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080115130000021">The definition has therefore been strengthened and I should like to hear from the Minister why such a safeguard as this amendment represents would be inappropriate in primary legislation. Do the Government think that a definition such as this would open the Big Lottery Fund to litigation from rejected applicants? If so, is there any evidence? The Big Lottery Fund has been using a stated definition of &#147;additionality&#148; for some time and has not suffered from litigation of which I am aware. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response on these points. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000022"><b><a name="80115-gc0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="080115130000352">Lord Newby:</b> We support the thinking behind this amendment. Whether it is as straightforward to introduce into legislation as the noble Lord says, we will wait to hear fro the Minister&#146;s response. In our view, such an amendment has merit because there is widespread cynicism about the Government&#146;s motives in respect of this money and widespread cynicism about the way in which the Government have appeared at times to use lottery money for their own purposes rather than as additional expenditure. At all stages so far, when the Minister has described the purposes of the expenditure to be incurred under this Bill, he has been at pains to spell out that it will be additional. Of course, if a social investment bank is established, almost by definition that is additional because it is not being undertaken at the moment and there is no suggestion that if the money does not come from this source, it will come from another source from government.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080115130000023">However, on the other two heads of expenditure, the Government are already spending a great deal of money on youth policies and on financial inclusion. In theory, it would be possible for the Government to allocate money from this fund that they would otherwise have taken from general expenditure. It is sensible to

At the very least, I hope that the Minister can give us a categorical assurance that any funds raised and spent via this route will be additional to planned or potential government spending.</p>

I have a lot of sympathy with the amendment and I wish to see some of the things looked for in the amendment happen. If we look through the Government&#146;s end of the telescope, it is very difficult, and, of course, it is the same telescope and is looked at through the same end by the Big Lottery Fund. In its annual report, under &#147;Policy Directions&#148;, it says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080115130000320">&#147;The Big Lottery Fund is a non-departmental public body and therefore operates under Policy Directions issued by its sponsor department, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The Policy Directions set out the principles with which the Big Lottery Fund must comply&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115130000312">A house divided against itself shall surely fall. There we are: the Big Lottery Fund is a part of government and it must comply.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080115130000025">Let us then look from the other end of the telescope. When will the public judge that something done is additional? That is a key consideration and the matter of perception which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised. The public will use phrases such as, &#147;That would never have happened if it had been left to the local authority&#148;, or &#147;The Treasury would never have supported that&#148;. The Treasury supports the transfer of lottery funds to the Olympics. In contrast, the public might judge that one would have expected such and such a playground to be funded from public taxation rather than from lottery funds.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080115130000026">The judgments reached depend on two principal factors. The first is how independent is the funding body concerned; the second is how that body will present its own case for saying that what it is doing is additional. I again refer the Committee to the publications of the Big Lottery Fund, which do not set out to say, &#147;Here we are. We are genuinely independent, and we have made this decision which we are pretty sure the DCMS would not have liked, but nevertheless we have made it, and that shows how independent we are&#148;. There is no sense of a dialogue and a debate. It seems seamlessly to be agreed between the two that what is being done is being done in the right way.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080115130000027">It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, for Big to argue its own additionality. After all, Big must comply, and it is a public body that is subject to policy directions and the discussions behind them. In some number of years&#146; time, we shall no doubt be able to read the minutes of those meetings.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080115130000028">As the centralising influence of government has steadily reduced the independence of public bodies, so it has become more important to look for a private- sector solution, and nowhere more so than in the third sector&#151;or as I would still prefer to call it, the charitable sector. National charitable distributors such as the Wellcome Trust, the Esm&#233;e Fairbairn

If we want additionality, we need the private sector, and we need competition for the available dormant funds. Government need to be as little involved as possible, and the public given the chance to identify additionality. Within the centrally controlled public sector, additionality is most probably unlikely to be achieved and quite likely to be an objective which it is not worth pursuing.</p>

The money we are talking about in the Bill is not government money in any sense. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the argument that it should be administered by a body which is clearly associated with the Government. I was not fully aware that, as my noble friend said in moving the amendment, the Big Lottery Fund says that increasing the effectiveness of government expenditure is legitimate. The right thing to do in the Bill is to have the proceeds apportioned by a body that is clearly independent and cannot be open to suspicion that it is being used to cover expenditure that would otherwise be covered by the Government. The objectives of the Bill are entirely admirable, but the more one goes into the detail, the more one becomes worried that the way they are put forward in the legislation is not ideal. I hope the Minister will understand our concerns on this point and agree that an amendment that provided for the scheme to be administered in an impartial way would be preferable if the scheme as a whole is to get general approval.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000030"><b><a name="80115-gc0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="080115130000355">Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken in this most interesting debate. The issue of additionality, as noble Lords indicated, obtains across lottery funds as well. We had one of these debates in extenso with regard to the Big Lottery Fund at the time.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080115130000031">I shall go through the basics of this issue. First, Big has to be separately accountable for this money. It is not government money, as the noble Lord rightly says, but it is not lottery money either. The money actually belongs to those people who can claim it back, and if they cannot claim it back, it is in a fund for defined purposes. It is therefore important that people are assured that the money is spent properly.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="080115130000032">I am at one with all the noble Lords who have argued the case for additionality. I can guarantee separateness with regard to the accounts and I can guarantee accountability by the openness of what Big does. I can also assert that Big is not an arm of government; it is a distributor of the lottery. I understand the criticisms of the way it undertakes its most enormous task&#151;and it is fairly extensive&#151;but the Government have never claimed, sought to assert or taken any action to suggest that Big is their agent in getting expenditure through. If someone comes along with an individual case in which they say, &#147;This is money we are due to receive from the Government, properly allocated, but we have this concept of how that money  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC466"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC466</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can be used to extend what the Government have sought with their expenditure, which is inadequate, and we think that in fact it will improve the delivery of what the Government sought&#148;, that is a case of additionality. After all, individual local people have made that case, not the Government. That is not the Government sequestering any resources in order to supplement what they deliver, but local people making an application.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="080115130000033">That is a point that has been missing from all representations. Bids to this fund will be made by the communities arguing on their own behalf. They will have to make the case that it is additional because distribution cannot take place on the basis that this fund has anything to do with being an arm of government. It clearly is not, and the Government are emphatic, with regard to the Bill, that they would not countenance such an interpretation.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080115130000034">There is the question of whether there may be some services that the Government provide that other people then make a submission for. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, referred to Lancashire County Council, which is indeed a statutory body. It carries out a great deal that the Government impose upon it. It also has areas of great discretion where it carries out its own priorities. It is absolutely clear that the Government do not provide universal support for carers&#151;in fact, Members of the Opposition have been a little prone to pointing that out to us in recent times. If Lancashire identified something in its community as a proper use of lottery money and put its case to the Big Lottery Fund, which agreed that it was additional because there was no question of it being funded by the Government for the foreseeable future, the noble Lord, Lord Howard, would not have a case that this was somehow by definition an illustration of the Big Lottery Fund acting as an agent of government. I emphasise again that we are not talking about lottery funds here but a separate fund, separately accountable, which Big Lottery Fund has to operate entirely separate from its normal operations. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is right: he has considerable expertise in this area and has sustained this argument over a number of Bills on a number of occasions. He is right in saying that it is forlorn to think that one can get a definition of additionality that will stand up in law and be the absolute sure rock on which Big distributed resources under this fund.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080115130000035">The noble Lord&#146;s amendment has flaws in it. We recognised the representations that came from the opposition parties several years ago, thick and fast, with regard to the lottery. Our own Members, too, in this place and another place, were very keen that if we could get the concept of additionality in a Bill, it would ease any problems and criticisms. We maintain that it is not possible to do that&#151;and the noble Viscount identified the difficulties. However, we do subscribe to the idea that the fund must be separate and accountable. Within that framework the Government see Big responding to demands from communities.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para24">
<p><a name="080115130000036">I emphasise again that the initiative is not going to come from government, which has no right to act by regarding Big, either in its lottery operation or even in  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC467"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC467</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>extenso with regard to this fund, as an agent of government expenditure. It is not. That is why I was emphatic in our last sitting in identifying that the resources that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister identified to be devoted towards the youth service were in the Comprehensive Spending Review for each of the next three years. What will happen with regard to youth services is that local communities will see ways in which they do not have a hope of their project being funded by government and they are able to establish to the fund that they want resources for an additional amenity. I am sure that noble Lords&#151;particularly noble Lords who have been in the other place&#151;who have been involved with communities, were fertile in identifying where there were government gaps in their communities. They often start to raise significant money to fill those gaps&#151;and increasingly, in recent years, they have looked for other resources to give them a hand. Here we are saying that when people come forward with a wish for youth services to be enhanced in their area, this fund can properly be applied to. However, if the application is merely a substitute for what the Government are about to fund, or should fund, the application will not be sustained&#151;because that is not the criteria on which the body will work.</p>
<h5><a name="080115130000338">4 pm</h5>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080115130000037">There is an obvious difficulty in that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, who has extensive experience of the third sector, will not accept that governments cannot, on all occasions, necessarily follow the best sentiments expressed when legislation is going through Parliament. Governments are bound by the law, and here the law is quite clear on how the legislation is meant to work. If it is thought that it may be difficult for others to keep these resources accountable, I would point out that local communities cannot reach those judgments, but parliamentarians can because of accountability. And there are other actors on this stage, too. The banks and building societies are carrying out this work voluntarily, and for defined good purposes, and they are acting within the requirement that the objective should not be to supplant what the Government ought otherwise to be obliged to do themselves.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para26">
<p><a name="080115130000038">Therefore, the anxieties expressed today are not justified. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said about Big being suspect. It would be surprising if there were not criticism of an organisation that was so extensive and responsible for so many funds. But that does not gainsay the fact that, on the whole, lottery distribution in this country has met public expectations and requirements. It has never been contended that Big is merely an agency of government to plug the gaps. It does not act that way, and in any case it is responsive to proposals put forward. It will certainly be so with regard to this fund.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="080115130000039">I recognise the pressure that doubts on the opposition side generate, but I shall resist that. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, will recognise that I am doing him a favour. If he does not recognise the force of this position, the great danger is that on Report we shall attempt a definition of &#147;additionality&#148; for the fourth or fifth time in legislation, and it will be as fruitless as on all previous occasions.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000044">On the other point, the Government, in reaching this judgment, canvassed other possibilities. The noble Lord would struggled to identify a body that has the range of operations throughout the United Kingdom which Big represents and that is engaged in an exercise not wholly dissimilar to that which it is expected to carry out for the fund. That is why the choice of Big was obtained.</p>

In fact, in the previous Committee I argued against Big being given a monopoly, which is the basis of my argument. If you take what essentially has been private money and put a large proportion of it in a position where it can be distributed for good causes, it is a mistake to give it all&#151;in the Big scheme as opposed to the small scheme, the alternative scheme&#151;to a monopoly distributor.</p>

But I think that I am right in saying that it assesses its grants of any size in only two offices, one in Birmingham and one in Newcastle. It does not have a whole range of regional offices to assess grant applications. They are centralised on the two big ones. There is a very strong case&#151;I hope that the Minister will deal with it at some stage&#151;for widening the ability of the Secretary of State to select distributors so that no one gets a monopoly. There might be half a dozen distributors. In that way, there would be much more diversity; accountability would be better because the public would be able to look and see who they thought was doing the best job. Competition is quite a good thing for us to espouse. I thought that it was, generally speaking, a consensus within the leading parties that competition was a good thing.</p>

The briefing that the Big Lottery Fund provided before Second Reading was very clear on the amount of experience, infrastructure and expertise that it has in these matters. It proudly displays the fact that it has well established offices in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as having four national committees which it considers appropriate for handling dormant account money. It has an established distribution infrastructure throughout the UK and is familiar with groups in each of the sectors to which the Government intend the money to be directed. That makes it correct in promising economies of scale when it takes over the distribution of dormant account money. It would seem to require almost no addition to the existing structure for this money to be channelled quickly and appropriately to the ultimate beneficiaries, yet the Bill appears to expect a rather different scenario.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000055">Clause 25 allows the Big Lottery Fund to defray any amount of money that it sees as necessary for operational costs&#151;not only its own operational costs but also those of the devolved Executives.

This ignorance about how much money will be diverted to administration rather than to those in need extends beyond the Bill to the Government, who appear only to have looked at costs of the reclaim fund. A final impact assessment estimates a possible one-off &#163;25,000 for authorisation costs for the reclaim fund, plus subsequent fees and levies to the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The assessment did not, however, give any indication of what costs will be justified for the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000056">As a result, a suggested limit on how much the Big Lottery Fund can spend on administration has been suggested. The current administrative spending of the Big Lottery Fund appears high, at 12 per cent of the money allocated in grants, although I understand that that is a peak and that, spread over a longer period, the percentage would drop. As a result, a figure of 5 per cent has been drafted to take advantage of the existing set-up and the promised economies of scale.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080115130000057">The amendments would also remove the power given to the Big Lottery Fund by the Bill to establish more committees. The Big Lottery Fund has already stated in its brief that it has the structure to handle these funds. If this is so, what need can there be for more committees? It will be interesting to hear from the Minister how much Her Majesty&#146;s Government think the Big Lottery Fund will need to spend on itself before being able to spend the money on young people, and why he seems to disbelieve the Big Lottery Fund when it assures him that it has all the committees and infrastructure necessary to handle the responsibilities that it would acquire under the Bill.

I am one of those who believe in letting many flowers grow. If we take the view that the Big Lottery Fund will disperse the money, the idea of it having a separate committee appeals greatly to me. There may be circumstances where someone applies to the Big Lottery Fund and fails, but then applies to the fund about which we are speaking and succeeds, or vice versa&#151;I hope that that may be the case. If there is a separate committee, with separate ways of thinking about things and giving different opportunities, that may be a good way of going forward.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000059">I turn to the costs of giving money away. I declared an interest earlier as a trustee of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. I think that we are in the area of 12 per cent in terms of expenditure on administration and everything else. If one spends 12 per cent in giving away 88 per cent well and doing a proper and thorough job of it, it is far better than giving away 100 per cent and being clueless about it. I would not be precise about the figures. For example, if one makes a grant, one has to assess it properly. In addition, one has to look afterwards at whether any success has followed the grant, which is important and always costs money. From what I have heard so far&#151;I may be persuaded otherwise later&#151;I do not support that which is being put forward.</p>

The measurement that should be expected of the distributor is that it is a proven, accountable and efficient operation. Big has been going for only three years and has had its role transformed in the past 18 months or so. It takes time for a body to bed down.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080115130000061">Big has been enjoined to bear down on costs. We are all united in the fact that we want the maximum resources available to the fund to be distributed and not spent on administration. Across its present activities, Big spends about 10 per cent of its income on operating costs. That is not a bad operating figure compared with other funding organisations, although no other body has a similar range. Big has had a difficult two years in bearing down upon costs. That is an important consideration for all of us. Five per cent on expenses, which is the burden of Amendment No. 103, is an arbitrary concept. I do not often ask the noble Lord to add to his contributions, which are always strongly expressed, but perhaps in his summing up he could demonstrate to us another nationwide distributing organisation of the same complexity as Big which would accept a cost limit of 5 per cent, which is what he suggests here.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080115130000062">It will, of course, depend on the resources that come in. Obviously operating costs will decline the more resources come in. I therefore resist the concept of an arbitrary costs limit on expenses.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000063">Let me reassure the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, that Big organises its work through committees. It could not possibly operate its present range of activities on a single board system. It operates committees for its work and it is inherent in the Bill that this is a separate funding operation which will need a separate distribution process. I give way to the noble Lord.</p>

I am trying to think of a private organisation that accepts a straightforward limitation on its administration costs. In fact, if one thinks about it, the more such an organisation gets into difficulty, potentially the more the administration costs will rise. However, under the concept envisaged in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, it will be stuck with fixed costs, however successful or unsuccessful it is.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080115130000066">It is important to bear down on administration costs. There is not the slightest doubt that the costs of the Big Lottery Fund, and indeed all lottery distribution, are borne down on because it is money that is to be

I re-emphasise that it is not government money. Lottery money belongs to those who have contributed to the lottery because they want to win a prize, but they also want to contribute to an organisation that supports good causes. Therefore, of course we want to bear down on costs, but an arbitrary fixed limit, as envisaged in these amendments, scarcely stands up to examination.</p>

It distributes about &#163;50 million a year, which is a not inconsiderable sum. I refer to the Gatsby Trust&#151;a charity in which the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, has a direct interest. I have not looked at the accounts for quite a while and so do not want to be held either to the figure of &#163;50 million a year or to the distribution costs, which I think are 4.3 per cent. A little consultation with the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, might be helpful in thinking about how to take what at the beginning is a relatively modest amount of money each year and distribute it nationally in the most efficient and effective way.</p>

I should welcome the opportunity to discuss that success with him and assure noble Lords that I will do so. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, indicated that this charity is involved in &#163;50 million but he will recognise that that falls considerably short of the resources that we are anticipating will be distributed from this fund. I shall need to look at that charity, but there is a difference between a fund where it is entirely open to the public&#146;s right to present schemes to it and a charity where the public will be much more concerned about the specific objectives. People will be a good deal less knowledgeable about charitable operations in this country than they will be about this significant fund.</p>

Before I respond to the Minister&#151;because I would not want to be ungracious and not respond&#151;I point out that there is something called economy of scale, which means the bigger the institution the greater the benefit to the smaller overhead. In that context, Big should be allowed about 2 per cent because it will give away so much more than the Gatsby Trust. Comment has been made on my 5 per cent being too stringent a limit, but if you already have a structure as Big is claiming, just because you have greater turnover going through that structure does not mean that you have to increase the overheads. No company in the private sector, if it had a larger turnover, would allow the administration to increase exponentially, because if it did it would go bankrupt. When a structure already exists, more money should flow through to the beneficiaries when more money comes in. You do not have to do a great deal more, in that case, to accommodate a much larger sum going through your organisation. That is a very simple point, which should work in almost any

Very helpfully, it concludes that the total amount distributed must add up to 100 per cent, for which we are extremely grateful to the drafters of the legislation.

We will use the population-share formula as the means by which the money is distributed. As I have indicated, it will be for those who seek access to these resources to make their case to Big, but in the framework under which charities and the lottery fund operate, if a well-defined claim is made for effective use of the money in a deprived community, it may have a marginally greater success than claims from other areas where there are more support services and the strength of their claims is, therefore, not as great. That issue will be decided by the committees of Big which make such decisions. Fairness should be underwritten in the Bill and that is the basis on which we propose to operate the scheme.</p>

Not only that, but currently relative poverty, we are told, has been rising over the past two or three years and, as far as the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is concerned, this will also change over time in particular areas of the country.

What I sought to emphasise was that the accountability of the operation and the scrutiny of what is going on will be reflected in the scrutiny of big accounts, because it is there that this fund will be subject to analysis. The Secretary of State, if necessary, acts as a result of this analysis&#151;and as far as the Secretary of State is concerned the broad principle is of population distribution and, with regard to the devolved Administrations, the Barnett formula. I do not think that I can go much further on that.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000100">As for the points made by noble Lord, Lord Shutt, decisions may have to reflect the increasing success of the scheme in addressing itself to certain problem areas. It may be that an area was able to put up a very effective case and that the concept of a social investor in those terms particularly benefits that area and reaps the rewards. It may be that the judgment on whether any further application put forward is that it is too supplementary to that to justify merit. On the other hand, the case may still obtain and, despite the success of the previous time, people may be able to show that they can build on that effectively to the considerable advantage of their communities. The overall position is that the impact is measured on communities and its success is measured by the accounts and report for which Big will be responsible. The difficulty that I have in responding to noble Lords more precisely is that devolution gives a certain amount of freedom to Scotland, Wales and England to exercise discretion on expenditure in their areas. I cannot go much further than that.</p>

The logical thing is to put that in the Bill instead of having the repetitious wording that does not tell you anything. The Government could have a provision in the Bill saying that the money will be apportioned between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland based on population&#151;end of story, that is all that there is to it. Perhaps they would like to think about that.</p>

Paragraph 13 of that memorandum states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080115130000325">&#147;It is envisaged that the functions of the Secretary of State set out in this Bill will be exercised by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115130000313">It is not normal to specify to which Secretary of State a Bill refers, not only because it is generally obvious which department will handle the provisions, but because a Secretary of State&#146;s duties and job title can, and often do, change over time. However, we are in Grand Committee and this is a probing amendment.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080115130000111">We appear to be debating a Treasury Bill extracting money from the financial sector, spending it through an independent body under the control of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and giving power to the Secretary of State in charge of the Department for Children, Schools and Families. This is a very muddled way in which to proceed. Of course, it is quite correct that this is a Treasury Bill; the collection of dormant account assets has been a sensitive issue ever since it was first mooted, and highlighted by the number and precision of the amendments my noble friend Lady Noakes and other noble Lords have moved.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080115130000112">The Government appear to agree on this point, since they have taken care to keep the schemes voluntary, consulted widely on the collection and have made every attempt to reassure people that there is no danger of account holders losing their money. The inappropriateness of these matters being handled by anyone other than the Chancellor has clearly been noted in Clause 3, where subsection (4) specifies &#147;the Treasury&#148; rather than the Secretary of State, as the order-making body.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080115130000113">This unprecedented care&#151;I always believed that it was not accepted practice to specify departmental names in primary legislation&#151;is clearly not taken in Part 2. There we see several powers being given to the Secretary of State relating to the Big Lottery Fund, as well as the power to identify a different body to the Big Lottery Fund as the most appropriate distributor. As stated before, these powers are remarkably similar to those given to the Secretary of State in the National Lottery Act 2006. The Secretary of State empowered by that Bill was the Secretary of State in the DCMS. Do the Government envisage the Big Lottery Fund not only reporting to two different departments but being directed from two different sources on matters regarding its employment of staff, how it should keep its accounts, and how the grants that they decide upon should be paid to the recipient?</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080115130000114">The Big Lottery Fund has made much of its existing infrastructure and claims that it already has the necessary structures and procedures in place to handle the dormant account money. The Government&#146;s intentions, expressed to the Treasury Select Committee, to place all of these matters under the control of the Department for Children,  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC480"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC480</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Schools and Families would suggest that that existing infrastructure will be duplicated. Will the Big Lottery Fund have to set up parallel institutions and procedures to handle this money because of the possibility, indeed likelihood, of differing instructions from the Government on these matters? Will the Big Lottery Fund need to produce two reports, and in them explain how successfully it has operated against two different sets of expectations? Will it hire two different staffs with two different sets of accounting practices, and so on? Essentially, this money will not be handled by the same organisation that handles 50 per cent of the lottery distribution fund but will be an entirely parallel organisation. Does the Minister really consider this a satisfactory state of affairs? Why have the Government even mentioned the lottery fund at all? Why have they not just established another completely separate organisation, accountable to the Department for Children, Schools and Families to distribute this money?</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080115130000115">I notice that this confusion also applies to the devolved Administrations. The Government appear to intend Ed Balls to be the appropriate person to consult the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel and the Welsh and Scottish Ministers, even if they choose not to spend their percentage of the funds on young people's services. Can the Minister confirm whether this is correct? What if a devolved Administration choose to spend the money in a completely different way? What will then be the case?</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para14">

There is an additional reason in that the objects of expenditure set out in relation to England at least cover the interests of three different Cabinet Ministers, which is why we have three different objects in the Bill. We start off with youth clubs and youth affairs, which we know is a cause very dear to the heart of the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. We move on to financial provision, which we know is a cause very dear to the heart of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his predecessor. We then move on to the social investment wholesaler, which we know is a cause very dear to the heart of the Secretary of State at the Cabinet Office. We therefore have three strands of expenditure being advocated by three different Cabinet Ministers. Therefore, which Secretary of State is in charge of the whole process matters in terms not just of the issues mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, but also of the priorities for expenditure under the scheme. I will therefore be doubly interested in the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

He has been keen enough to read the minutes of the Treasury Select Committee. I shall explain to this Committee our position.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080115130000119">The main priority for distribution of funds in England will be youth services. It is the Government&#146;s intention, therefore, that the Department for Children, Schools and Families takes the lead&#151;I choose those words carefully&#151;in issuing directions to Big as the relevant policy department. Big will be accountable ultimately to that Secretary of State for spending unclaimed assets. That will also ensure consistency with the 10-year youth strategy which the DCSF will be responsible for delivering. However, both noble Lords who have spoken in this debate have said that there are other interests within government, as set out in Clause 17. Our spending priorities for unclaimed assets of youth services, financial capability and inclusion, and social investment cut across the policy areas of a number of departments. There is nothing incredibly surprising about that. What is important is that government establish who takes the lead and establish, as they will, a working party of civil servants from across the relevant departments. In other words, a cross-cutting approach to the development of spending directions, which represents the interests of key departments, will inform the decision-making of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080115130000120">Without being bound by it, I say that the departments that clearly have an interest in the priorities identified for distribution of funds include the DCSF, the Cabinet Office as far as it deals with the Office of the Third Sector, the DCLG, the DCMS and the Treasury&#151;the noble Lord was spot on when he named them. It is intended that a working group of officials from those departments will be convened to develop draft spending directions to Big, including the split of assets between priorities, but someone has to make the final decision and that will be the Secretary of State as mentioned.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080115130000121">The working group will be able to make firm recommendations only once it is clear how much will be available, although it could do some scenario planning based on certain thresholds. We would expect the terms of reference for that important working group to be confirmed early next year.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080115130000122">Of course, the DCMS will have responsibility for ensuring that Big is a fit-for-purpose organisation for distributing lottery money, with the appropriate operating systems in place. We believe that the DCSF will be able to place considerable reliance on that. And of course it will be for each department to satisfy for itself that Big is distributing the funds for which it is responsible in accordance with its direction and, in so doing, is meeting its objectives.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000123">The answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question about Northern Ireland is yes. The Secretary of State will take the lead and have the final say on that matter. I thought that the mood of the Committee was that it was very important that the lottery fund and unclaimed assets fund were dealt with separately by the Big Lottery Fund.

<a name="80115-gc0003.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080115130000131">In respect of the division between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, this fund should be prioritised to those who need it most. In Amendment No. 84, we have used the phrase &#147;where need is greatest&#148;; we used the phrase &#147;poverty&#148; in an earlier amendment, but the intention is the same. The reason for wishing to have this in the Bill is that it is sometimes the case that the people who are the best at putting in submissions for funds are not those who need the funds most. We have seen with a number of sporting bodies, not least with lottery distribution, that the more affluent areas were quickest off the mark in putting in the bids. I once looked at the distribution of money for tennis, and it was remarkable that many leafy suburbs had been successful in getting funding but that few inner cities had been successful. The Bill&#146;s purpose should surely be that funds are concentrated in the areas that need it most; my fear is that unless we make that explicit in the Bill that will not necessarily happen&#151;hence Amendment No. 84.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000132">With Amendment No. 85, we seek to ensure that money is spent most effectively. Here we are saying that a decision on how expenditure is made should include a consideration of both existing local provision and local need. Again, I am sure that it is the Government&#146;s intention that that should be the principle that guides expenditure, but it is by no means clear that it will naturally flow. Therefore, it is a sensible refinement of the existing rather open conditions of the Bill that it would help to ensure that all the money distributed is distributed as effectively as possible.

<p><a name="080115130000141">The noble Lord said: I want three words to be added to the clause, a simple task: &#147;and the community&#148; at line 9 of page 9, so that it reads &#147;young people and the community&#148;. To backtrack a little, the Labour manifesto on this issue referred to channelling the funds back into the community. The word &#147;community&#148; in those terms means all 55 million or so of us. Then we got the Bill, the Long Title of which talks about &#147;social or environmental purposes&#148;, which is referred to in Clause 15. Clause 17 starts to define what happens in England. I do not, for example, see the word &#147;environmental&#148; anywhere in Clause 17(1)(a), (b) or (c), but on the other hand it may well be that in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland the environment is the issue they want to get hold of.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000142">Let us come, then, to England. I spoke days ago about other opportunities, and I still want to return to that, but substantial money from these sources being used for young people is difficult to gainsay. I am happy that that is a major feature.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080115130000143">Let us look at the wording. Clause 17(1) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080115130000328">&#147;A distribution of dormant account money for meeting English expenditure must be&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115130000314">I emphasise the &#147;must&#148;. It then goes on to talk about young people, financial deprivation and the social investment wholesaler. My concern at this point is to add the words &#147;and the community&#148;. We are looking at facilities for young people, but young people are in schools, apprenticeships, colleges or whatever. I am not certain of the precise definition of &#147;young people&#148;. Compared with the bulk of noble Lords, there are a lot of people in this land who could be described as &#147;young people&#148;, but does the definition stop at 18, 21 or 25? I do not know.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080115130000144">Some of that money will be for capital expenditure. There is something wrong if facilities are being made available&#151;if, say, one is building a youth centre&#151;but they exclude other people. It may well be that a youth centre cannot function before 6 pm most days of the week, so if there are other places where other activities ought to be able to take place, whether in rural or urban areas, multiuse is therefore surely right and proper. That is why we should include the words &#147;and the community&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000145">When I was a member of a local education authority we had a youth and community committee because we had youth and community centres. There is a danger of being too prescriptive about &#147;youth&#148; here. When you bear in mind &#147;must&#148; prior to that, surely it is right to be just that little bit more flexible in the use of these resources. I beg to move.</p>

After all, it is one of the three central objectives in the Bill. I reiterate that the Government have clearly set out three priorities for the use of dormant account money in England with a clear focus on services for young people, but is that to be interpreted as exclusive? I hope not, because I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Shutt.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080115130000147">I reassure the Committee that the wording in the same subsection which refers to expenditure on or connected to facilities and services for young people is intended to give some flexibility&#151;the very flexibility that I think the noble Lord is seeking. In some cases, it would be absurd&#151;and a community would think it absurd&#151;if resources which had been won through a bid to the fund primarily to create youth services had, by necessity, to be exclusively for youth services when others could also benefit.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080115130000148">Therefore, we have set out three clear priorities for the broad areas of expenditure but we want exactly the same flexibility identified by the noble Lord. We do not think that the amendment is necessary because there is flexibility in the Bill to take account of the exact points that he made. The problem is that the more specific we are in the Bill, the more prescriptive the directions and the more narrow and rigid the scheme becomes. Therefore, I entirely share the noble Lord&#146;s objective, but we think that it is already covered in the Bill and that the amendment is not necessary.</p>

I want to put a stop to that before it starts. It may well be that if the Minister&#146;s words are as far as we can get, they will have to be stuck on the desk of everyone who looks at these funds in due course. However, in my view, this is a very important matter and we will reflect on whether to have another go at it on another occasion. For the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The word &#147;wholesaler&#148; is inappropriate in the context in which it is used. The <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> defines a wholesaler as the seller of goods in large quantities to be retailed by others.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080115130000155">The word &#147;investment&#148; also has a clear meaning in the dictionary as the action or process of investing or a thing worth buying because it may be profitable or useful in the future. Subsection (2) of Clause 17 defines what is meant by &#147;social investment wholesaler&#148; but that definition has no sense of buying and selling and no sense at all of buying something that might be profitable or useful. Rather, it gives the definition of a body which exists to assist or enable other bodies to give financial or other support to third sector organisations. Put simply, this wholesaler is there to give money away. We should not allow the Government to violate the English language by using &#147;wholesaler&#148; and &#147;investment&#148;, which have precise meanings, in order to convey wholly different meanings. I hope the Minister will explain to the Committee why the Government have chosen to abuse the English language in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080115130000156">My noble friend Lord Hamilton of Epsom has other amendments in this group which are infinitely more sensible than the formulation in the Bill. I shall leave it to him to speak to his amendments, which we generally support. Before I do so, I have another reason for tabling the removal of the paragraph which applies equally to my noble friend&#146;s amendments. The Bill has job creation and bureaucracy as one of its by-products. Jobs and procedures cost money, and that reduces the amount of money available to flow through to enrich the social and environmental life of the country.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080115130000157">First, the money flows into a reclaim fund, so there will be jobs and procedures to absorb some money there. Before the money reaches the Big Lottery Fund, the Secretary of State can put his hand in the till and take some expenses out to cover his involvement, and so, too, can the devolved Administrations. I shall bring forward amendments on this topic later. The money then gets to the Big Lottery Fund, which we know will have jobs, procedures, committees and costs galore, as my noble friend Lord Howard of Rising pointed out in debates earlier today. Lastly, if the money is going to support social investment, it has to flow through one or more so-called social investment wholesalers, which will be staffed up to operate whatever bureaucratic procedures they devise. It is difficult to see how a more inefficient, wasteful and bureaucratic scheme could have been developed. Each layer will subtract from the underlying aims of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080115130000158">If the Government wish to distribute money for social investment purposes, they could completely by-pass the Big Lottery Fund and send the money straight from the reclaim fund to a social investment bank, to use the better terminology in my noble friend&#146;s amendments. This would also avoid the problem which appears to emerge from the Bill that only English money will flow into the social investment bank, though doubtless the intention is that it would be available to

<p><a name="080115130000161">On Thursday, the Minister said that these resources, referring to the residual assets from these accounts, represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity which we need to make the most of.

<p><a name="080115130000162">One of the great failures of government&#151;I do not blame this Government but successive Governments; it is not a party point&#151;has been not to address the problems of social deprivation. Many of our inner cities are a disgrace to a civilised society. In some of them we see a third generation of unemployed people, rampant drug addiction and many people making money through trafficking drugs. They are the scenes of crime committed by the people who live in these desperately deprived areas. But these people are also victims of crime to a great extent; and they have problems with debt, gambling and homelessness. It is a very sobering statistic that in some of the worst areas of Glasgow, life expectation for males is only 57.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080115130000163">What has the reaction of the Government been? It has been purely to treat this as a financial problem; that is, if you give people enough money to live off, surely they do not have any problems. The problems that these people suffer from are much more complex. The only people really addressing them today are the charities, the faith communities and social enterprises. There is no silver bullet to all these problems, and I do not think that anyone would pretend that there is. There is no big one-off solution. We need to encourage these small and beautiful remedies being produced by these organisations and we must build on the small and diverse third sector. I know that my noble friend Lord Eccles does not like the phrase &#147;third sector&#148;, but I believe that that is the only thing in these terms which works.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080115130000164">Last Thursday, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, mentioned the British Bankers&#146; Association report which said that the funds available were likely to be about &#163;250 million to &#163;350 million. All Members received that circular from the BBA. We must remember that those sums apply to just the banks. I gather that the building societies also think that they will be able to produce something like &#163;150 million, so de minimus we are looking at around &#163;400 million.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC488"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="080115130000165">When you think of these associations representing the banks and the building societies, it would not be very intelligent of them to raise expectations too high. Let us face it, if the banks eventually came up with &#163;200 million, they quite rightly would be seriously condemned. However, if, instead of the estimate of &#163;250 million to &#163;350 million, they came up with &#163;400 million, everyone would look at them in a very generous light. We have to take those figures as being very conservative, and it would be quite wrong of the people concerned not to give a conservative figure. Perhaps we are not talking of as little as &#163;400 million, we may be talking about as much as &#163;500 million.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080115130000166">We now have to look at why we need a social investment bank. I have identified three basic reasons for this: the first is discipline; the second is sustainability; and the third is added value. On discipline, as a generalisation, social enterprises tend to be run by people who are very long on humanity and compassion, but short on financial skills. That is not very surprising because many of them come from the public sector where the whole concept of income is applying for grants from the public sector. There are very few financial directors operating in these social enterprises.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="080115130000167">A social enterprise bank would lend money and make investments against business plans. It would require, as any venture capitalist would, budgets, cash flows, cash flow forecasts and monthly reporting of profit and loss on how the thing is doing. The whole third sector of social enterprises can benefit only from being run like businesses. A social enterprise bank would want to ensure that it received interest on its loans and got its loans and investments repaid, so that obviously it could lend that money again and the money could be circulated.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para27">
<p><a name="080115130000168">That brings me to my second point of sustainability. An investment bank working among social enterprises would recycle money from successful investments and repaid loans to new ventures. Rather than just perhaps a five-year splurge of money that would come through the Big Lottery Fund, these organisations might well still be operating in 20 or 30 years&#146; time, and we would still have an investment bank dedicated to supporting social enterprises and bringing ever-increasing quantities of inward investment to a growing social enterprise sector, which is growing in size and importance in our society today.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para28">
<p><a name="080115130000169">The third element is added value. I was tempted to use the word &#147;additionality&#148;, but that is now seen in a different context here. We must bear in mind that if we are talking about a bank, we can see the amount of investment capital in the bank being enlarged quite massively. We are talking about multiples of the money that goes in. The Charity Bank became independent in 2002. It is registered under the FSA. I do not know what credit rating it has been given, but if that credit rating is good enough, there is no reason why the Charity Bank should not lend nine times as much as its initial capital to the people it serves in the community.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para29">
<p><a name="080115130000170">Bridges Community Ventures started life with a &#163;20 million grant from the Government, which enabled it to raise a further &#163;20 million from private  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC489"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC489</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sources. Now it has proved itself to have such a track record that it has raised a further &#163;75 million to invest. One of the advantages for rich venture capitalists is community investment tax relief, which gives enormous incentives for people to support organisations such as this.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para30">
<p><a name="080115130000171">The social investment bank would be an independent investment bank. It would be able to raise bonds that would increase the funds available for social enterprises. In short, &#163;100 of dormant account money put into the Big Lottery Fund would mean &#163;95 for social enterprises&#151;that is what I have put down here, but I think that my noble friend Lord Howard of Rising would say that it would be more likely to be &#163;88 for social enterprises. That would raise all the problems discussed in Committee today on how much influence the Government would have and whether there are areas where this becomes a substitute for government expenditure.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para31">
<p><a name="080115130000172">A sum of &#163;100 put in a social enterprise bank means probably a minimum of &#163;300 for social enterprises. If the bank is run in an efficient and serious enough way, it could mean &#163;900. If we can increase the impact of the money from dormant accounts, we are talking about enormous value added, which could make a serious difference in this growing sector of social enterprises. There is a critical mass for a social investment bank, which is why I have put &#163;250 million in my amendment; that is, half of &#163;500 million, if we should be looking at that. I do not think that that is an unreasonable amount and there is no other way to get these multiples of the dormant account money which would make such an enormous difference to social enterprises. This is a unique opportunity to create something which would last, would have a massive impact and would produce much more than the original funds that come from the dormant accounts.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000173"><b><a name="80115-gc0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="080115130000401">Lord Newby:</b> These are important amendments. I completely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, about the phrase &#147;social investment wholesaler&#148;. I thought that I knew something about this sector, but I do not think that I have ever heard the phrase before. Somewhat bizarrely, the Bill obfuscates what is intended in a situation when the Government have a clear view about what they mean; that is, a social investment bank in the terms set out in Amendment No. 76. Changing imprecise, obscure language could enable, in principle, money to be spent under this heading on a whole raft of support for voluntary sector organisations, which has nothing to do with investment. The argument for changing that in the terms set out by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, is strong and unanswerable.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para32">
<p><a name="080115130000174">In a sense, my next question is even more important. Amendment No. 75 takes us back to our discussion last week on the Government&#146;s priorities. I thought that then the Minister said that the Government had not yet set their priorities between the three headings and that all was up for grabs. Earlier today, however, we were told that the top priority will be youth affairs, which is why the Secretary of State concerned is the Secretary of State  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC490"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for Children, Schools and Families. The burden of the case put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, with which I have a great deal of sympathy, is that of the three headings the one most likely to yield the most benefit for the community per pound spent is the third one for the reasons that he gave. By putting &#163;1 in the social investment bank, you very readily generate several multiples of that pound from other sources in ways which simply do not happen under the first heading. The second heading is a pure distribution of funds for another purpose.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para33">
<p><a name="080115130000175">So the principle of having a priority under this heading in order to make sure that the money generates the maximum possible return is a good one. There is also a simple logic to dormant bank accounts being used to establish a bank. It sounds and feels right and I hope that it will be established.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para34">
<p><a name="080115130000176">My other concern, which I expressed last week, is that, unlike paragraphs (a) and (b) in Clause 17, which are mandatory, paragraph (c) follows an &#147;or&#148;. This implies that the Government could decide that they were not going to have a social investment bank at all. That would be a big missed opportunity. I do not think that is what the Government mean but it is certainly what the Bill says. Amendment No. 75 would therefore reverse the &#147;or&#148; and almost make the social investment bank the first heading.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0004.htm_para35">
<p><a name="080115130000177">I am agnostic as to whether &#163;250 million is the right threshold. It is important that the social investment bank be an initial beneficiary of moneys from the scheme because the biggest bulk of money will go across to the reclaim fund in year one. Unless the social investment bank is established at that point, it is highly unlikely that there will be a big-enough flow of money to establish it. I am less clear about whether you need &#163;250 million to do it. I know that it has been argued that you need &#163;350 million to establish a social investment bank, but that is a heck of a lot of money, particularly if, as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, said, you can lever in many multiples of it in any event.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000178">Let me explain my concern with having a high threshold. Suppose that in year one, which I say is the crucial year, &#163;500 million goes into the reclaim fund. If I were sitting in the reclaim fund, I might well want to hold on to at least half of that. I would not know how much of it was going to be reclaimed and, therefore, the amount that I might have available could be a fraction less than half of the total amount that comes across. I am not sure that &#163;250 million is the right amount but the principle of the amendment is sound. I suspect that the Minister will not be able to give us an assurance that, come what may, a social investment bank, in the terms set out in Amendment No. 76, is a guaranteed outcome of the passage of the Bill.</p>

It is now more readily called the third sector in order to include the social enterprise element and the community interest companies&#151;in other words, the wider, not-for-profit sector.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="080115130000180">The Government have already made considerable efforts to address this chronic undercapitalisation through initiatives such as the Futurebuilders fund, which provides loans to enable third sector organisations to have sufficient capital to be financially viable. They can then go on to provide services for local authorities and the private sector, thereby earning money which can then be recycled for the benefit of their client groups, principally the disadvantaged people to whom the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, referred. I again declare an interest as chair of the Futurebuilders Advisory Panel. The third sector needs a boost and this is where the commission felt that investment could readily be given. There are very good examples from the United States and Ireland, where this has been done.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000181">Perhaps I may say a word about the terminology. We talked in our initial report about a &#147;social investment bank&#148;, but the idea was always that such a bank would be a wholesaler. We were worried about the wider use of the term &#147;bank&#148; lest it be seen as competing with other, more usual, types of bank, or with bodies such as Charity Bank or the Unity Trust Bank. That is where the term &#147;wholesaler&#148; came into operation because such a bank would act as a wholesaler, but there may have been some confusion there.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080115130000182">It seems to me that it was always intended that the social investment wholesaler&#151;the institution, agency or whatever we are going to call it&#151;would take into account all the things set out in Amendment No. 76. Therefore, although I have some sympathy with the points that have been made, I imagine the Minister will tell us that that is what the Government intend the wholesaler to do.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080115130000183">We are concerned here with value added, as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, mentioned, and the opportunity to make a real difference. The commission estimated that &#163;250 million would be a very good sum but that it would be willing to start with whatever was available. However, I should like to reassure the Committee in that regard because all the estimates show that, although it may start small, a lot of money will be available in this fund. I am absolutely convinced that there will be enough money not only for the much needed expenditure on youth, which we understand is the Government&#146;s priority, but also for the development of financial knowledge and expertise, which is currently so important when many people are getting into trouble with debt and so on, and the social investment bank. I have some sympathy with the amendments but I am sure that what we all want will happen anyway with the social investment wholesaler.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000184"><b><a name="80115-gc0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="080115130000403">Viscount Eccles:</b> Can the Minister say whether a study has been carried out by the department into the idea for either a bank or a wholesaler? Is there any intention to do so? No doubt he can describe it to us. In particular, have the Government received any representations from institutions that see themselves as suitable candidates for becoming a social investment wholesaler or bank?</p>

<p><a name="080115130000185"><b><a name="80115-gc0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="080115130000404">Lord Higgins:</b> Unfortunately, earlier I had to leave the Committee briefly to explain to another meeting that I was preoccupied here. I apologise if I make points that have already been made and answered. I also have a slight difficulty with the groupings. We are debating amendments to Clause 17 but I understand that Clause 17 has already been debated. I have spent something like 50 years in this place and this does not normally happen. However, perhaps I may turn to the amendment in question.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="080115130000186">As I understand it, the distribution proposals in Clause 17 have previously been agreed outside this Committee and the Government have adopted them for England, but the proposals for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are devolved. Therefore, this clause and the amendment that we are considering are concerned with the allocation and distribution of English expenditure. I managed to return to the Committee at the point where the introductory words relating to paragraph (c) were being debated. As I read it, the situation is clear. Clause 17(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080115130000330">&#147;A distribution of dormant account money for meeting English expenditure must be&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080115130000315">I repeat, &#147;must be&#148;&#151;for something which meets paragraphs (a), (b) or (c). As I understand it, no discretion whatever is given for that allocation. Effectively, under paragraphs (a) and (b), expenditure is restricted to the needs of young people. This seems to be an extraordinary determination in legislation of how the money should be spent. It does not give sufficient discretion, for example, to spend it on old people. Unless the word &#147;must&#148; is changed to &#147;may&#148;, I do not see how that can be avoided.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080115130000187">Paragraph (c) is a further proposal which, as my noble friend in moving this amendment pointed out, relates to &#147;a social investment wholesaler&#148;. That is most extraordinary gobbledygook. When we debated this earlier, there was a long discussion on charities and whether the funds might go directly to charities as a result of the Bill or as a result of the owners of the assets being found and legacies having been determined. Again, the word &#147;charities&#148; does not appear at all. Paragraphs (a) and (b) and, in particular, paragraph (c) remove any discretion for charities which do not meet these criteria to be covered. This is widening it a great deal further than I understood the case to be. I have considerable concerns about the clause as a whole.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080115130000188">I certainly agree with my noble friend in her amendment to leave out this weird proposal&#151;I think that &#147;weird&#148; is the only word for it&#151;for inventing a &#147;social investment wholesaler&#148; and then in Clause 17(2) deciding on the meaning of a &#147;social investment wholesaler&#148; and a &#147;third sector organisation&#148; and so on, rather than simply saying &#147;charitable purposes&#148;.</p>

I prefer the concept of &#147;novel&#148; with regard to the social investment institution rather than the concept of &#147;weird&#148;. I shall start by trying to establish for the noble Lord that we have made some progress on this concept, which I hope is convincing progress. Of course, much work remains to be done and there are a great number of uncertainties. The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, alluded to the most obvious one; namely, how much money is available. We have estimates that between &#163;250 million and &#163;350 million may emerge from the banks and the building societies.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000190"><b><a name="80115-gc0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="080115130000406">The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b> There is a Division in the House and the Committee will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000192"><b><a name="80115-gc0005.htm_spnew4"><a name="080115130000407">Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Oratory is difficult enough without the interruption of a Division, but I will try to recall that I was trying to spell out the limited sums that we expect to be available. I said that we expect between &#163;250 million and &#163;350 million from the banks and up to &#163;150 million from building societies, which will take time to come through. We also expect that the very significant reuniting effort that the banks and building societies are making throughout 2008&#151;to which they are committed, in order that the money should be restored to its proper owners, if it can be&#151;may have a significant effect on those figures. The reclaim fund also must make provision against future successful claims from people who seek to be reunited with their money after 15 years when the money has been transferred.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080115130000193">So we are dealing with some uncertainties in this area and the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, as the nub of his important points, asked me specifically about this, but I am afraid I have to be less than specific in my answer. I have answered one of the points that he emphasised in his amendment; we cannot specify &#163;250 million. At the moment, there is no guarantee that that figure will be available. I congratulate the noble Lord on his amendment. It is broadly on the right lines and he made strenuous efforts to deal with a complex topic. I hope that he thought it was complex, because the Government do and they consider that they have quite a lot of work to do in this area. That is why we are eager to keep the Bill as it stands, which makes proper reference to the possibility that we cannot be specific on the scheme itself.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080115130000194">I hope I have been able to explain the interesting comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, about our own social investment wholesale institutions. These have elicited considerable criticism and the Committee will expect me to respond to that in due course. We are wrestling with the same issues as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, and it is obvious that a great number of them remain to be resolved.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080115130000195">With his usual acuity, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, emphasised the &#147;or&#148;. We do not know how much money will be available to the priorities. We

We also have to respond effectively to some of the questions that have been addressed today. I hope I shall be able to demonstrate to the Committee that it is not for the want of trying because the Government have done a great deal of work in this area. At the very least I shall be able to defend our new terminology.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080115130000196">The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked whether there had been any study on this issue and whether any representations had been submitted on the role. As the Government said to the Treasury Select Committee on this, we are studying the issue carefully. We have not had many representations but work is ongoing on this matter. We are aware of the valuable work of the Commission on Unclaimed Assets, which is helping us, but I do not think there have been any specific representations along the lines the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, had hoped to identify.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080115130000197">As to the more general issues, we think this priority should remain within the Bill in addition to the primary ones for England. In her opening speech the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was emphatic that I should make clear that this is about England&#151;and it is. The devolved Administrations have some decisions to take on this matter but we intend to promote the primary priorities of England as opportunities for young people, financial capability and financial inclusion. However, we can see the potential benefit of the third concept and, if resources permit and we resolve the outstanding issues, we would in due course seek to activate it.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080115130000198">We have come to this conclusion not only through government resources but as a result of evidence that we have received from a wide-ranging review on the future role of the third sector. Some doubts were expressed as to whether charities were taking any cognisance of the Bill. Of course they are. They have a very important role to play in supporting the third sector. The wide-ranging review carried out by the Treasury and the Office of the Third Sector, as well as evidence which the Commission on Unclaimed Assets has provided, suggest that the social investment market is underdeveloped and that the Government ought to think about filling a defined gap. That is why we see the merit of this institution, which would invest in the long-term sustainability of the third sector and boost the social investment market, which has some difficulties in this respect. We would want to use a share of the unclaimed assets fund to support the creation of this body.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080115130000199">I hear what the noble Baroness says&#151;that she has never heard the word &#147;wholesale&#148; in this context. Governments are rarely accused of being innovative and novel, but here we are putting forward what we believe to be a new concept. Therefore, it is not surprising that we give it a new name. We think that it will fulfil a wholesale role, as I hope to demonstrate in a moment, so it is entirely appropriate that the concept should be included in the title.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC495"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="080115130000346">6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080115130000200">The social investment wholesaler would be a body with finance that it would deploy to strengthen and develop the capacity of specialist lenders and investors, attract new private capital and enable third sector organisations to access the finance that they need. So the wholesaler could finance the activities of those who already give financial or other support to the third sector, such as future builders and community foundations, through finance advisory work and investment management. The aim would be to address what we define as a gap in the market of our existing front-line investors and lenders. This would be a wholesale distribution of funds, which could also make the links between investment banks, charitable trusts and foundations. We have testimony to the gap that exists to the detriment of charities, foundations and the third sector, but we want to ensure that the social investment wholesaler should not be given any unfair advantage in the existing market. If I had not alluded to that point, I have not the slightest doubt that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, would have referred to it in her later speeches.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080115130000201">On the other amendments in the group, the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, attempts to set out in some detail a definition of a social investment bank and gives us the figure of &#163;250 million. As I am sure he will agree, we would be loath to put in legislation a figure that we might not be able to realise, as nothing could take off if we did not have the available assets. We considered vehicle and institution as well as bank, but we think that wholesaler most accurately reflects the problem that we are trying to address. There are already a number of financial institutions that lend or invest in the third sector at the retail level. The wholesale concept places the emphasis on the gap in the market above existing front-line investors and lenders. That is why it is a novel concept with novel terminology.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080115130000202">With respect to the detailed description of the wholesaler&#146;s activities, I have said that we have considerable work to do on this area. However, our view is that there is no need at this stage to define the precise activities of a social investment wholesaler in the Bill. If we did so, we might run into problems later as we produce solutions to the issues that we have still to confront. We are confident that the definition in the Bill is wide enough to allow for the activities that I have described. The current text already goes into greater detail on the descriptions of the youth services and financial capability inclusion&#151;and so it should, because this is a novel part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080115130000203">With regard to funding, the Government have identified since 2005 a clear and consistent set of priorities for the use of unclaimed assets in England and we remain committed to them. Given the importance that we attach to addressing those needs, it would not be appropriate to prioritise support for a social investment wholesaler ahead of investment in services for young people and financial capacity or inclusion. Hence, we have the phraseology in this clause to which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, drew our attention.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC496"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column GC496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="080115130000204">In addition, there is continuing uncertainty as to how much will be available, as I have indicated, and therefore the Government are seeking in the Bill to create a novel concept which fills a defined gap in the market. We are aware that considerable work remains to be done on how this will work and that is why we have expressed the priorities, two of which can be worked upon immediately; the third might take a little more time. Given the huge amount of work done on the other side of the Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Howard, and, no doubt, by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, I hope they will recognise that the Government&#146;s position is tenable and support it by withdrawing their amendments.</p>

As I understand it, there may be distribution not only of funds, but loans; in which case, the heading may be worth looking at, as it refers only to distribution of English expenditure. The Minister did not pick up the point that I made regarding &#147;must&#148; or &#147;may&#148;. Quite unnecessarily, this clause restricts the use of funds to a specific range of subjects, when there may be more deserving causes. As I have been the MP for Worthing, and it is said that people go there to die and forget what they came for, my priorities may not necessarily be for young people, but specifically to state that the funds must be spent on young people, when there are many other deserving causes, seems unnecessarily restrictive.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="080115130000206">Finally, in that context, the Minister may make alterations by order in relation to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is no order-making power in the clause dealing with England and that may be worthy of consideration&#151;otherwise the Government may live to regret it.</p>

However, we have consulted upon and extolled the virtues of the two priorities. He will recognise also that we are dealing with money that is certainly not the Government&#146;s, but is private. Therefore, we needed to negotiate desirable outcomes with the organisations concerned. One priority is improving financial literacy, which has a role to play.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080115130000208">There has been wide acceptance in our consultation that these are good priorities. The third will be made possible as we develop our work. Of course it is always possible to find good causes right across the board for expenditure. I would not vie with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, on his ability to produce a list of good causes, but I think that I would come a good second to him. The Government&#146;s objective is to get this scheme off the ground and be able to reassure all those participating in it that the money will be intelligently and usefully deployed. That is why the priorities have been identified.</p>

I would not like the Minister to leave the Committee with a misunderstanding as to where these objectives have come from. The Bill might refer to financial inclusion but, as far as I am aware, the British Bankers&#146; Association is completely agnostic as to how the money is to be spent. It regards Part 1 of the Bill as relating to itself and Part 2 as relating entirely to the Government, which is why this is rather more like public money than private money.</p>

We had to negotiate the first part with the bank and building societies because they are directly interested in it. It is therefore right that there should be one objective in which they also have interest. The noble Baroness said that they are totally agnostic about the whole package. They do not want to get involved in the appallingly difficult debate which might obtain if we started to discuss a range of other priorities, which the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has just invited me to do.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000211">It has long been established that the Government are greatly concerned about youth services.

We recognised that this was a challenging concept and that we had to talk outside government&#151;as we did&#151;but I am not trying to bring alongside the Government&#146;s final decision any institutions which wholeheartedly embrace the Government&#146;s objectives; that is not their role and it is not their job.

<p><a name="080115130000217">The difficulty is&#151;and I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, will give the Government credit for this&#151;that we have a problem answering questions about the first year, 2009, and even as far as 2010, but we have to make provisions in the Bill that will obtain over a decade or more, particularly when we are talking about the establishment of an institution that will need longevity in order to fulfil its remit. I am merely indicating that at this point there are strong reasons why we have identified two priorities upon which early action can be taken against an unknown sum of money, and we are making provision in the Bill for the third concept to be activated as soon as we have resolved the issues.</p>

It is worth reiterating what I said earlier: is it really likely that the British Bankers&#146; Association would produce figures for how much money the banks could produce and then radically undershoot them? That is the Minister&#146;s suggestion, that these are such appalling estimates that they might be dramatically wrong. The banks would look very foolish and come in for an awful lot of criticism if they said, &#147;Our estimate is &#163;250 million to &#163;350 million&#148;, and it came out at &#163;150 million. I do not think that is the way banks work. I think they have a good idea of how much money there is in these unclaimed funds.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000219">I understand where the Minister is coming from. He wants to give himself plenty of wiggle-room here, so he said that people may come back and claim on these accounts. Well, hold on. Fifteen years is the shortest time that these accounts have been unclaimed. Some of them go back 50 years or much further. If people have not had the opportunity to lay claim to these accounts for what may be decades, why are they suddenly going to do so because someone transfers them out of the bank to somewhere else? There may be an element of people reclaiming these accounts, but are we talking about more than 5 per cent of the total assets? I very much doubt it.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080115130000220">To come back to the question of whether the social investment wholesaler is a bank, I notice that the Minister has completely ignored my point about gearing. Gearing is what this is all about: turning &#163;100 million into a minimum of &#163;300 million&#151;possibly, over a period, into &#163;1 billion. That is the significant thing. When we talk about this wholesaler, is it going to be in a position to gear things up? The advantage of a bank is that it becomes completely independent. It ring-fences the funds so that they go in and there is no way they can come out again. The Government cannot get hold of them in any way. Once the funds have gone in, they are in the bank, and then they can be geared up and become much more. That is significant. The most important thing about the social investment bank is that it will be independent and have the capacity to turn certain sums of money into multiples of that money, which will then be available for these enterprises.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080115130000221">The noble Lord asked whether the retail banks, the big four&#151;I cannot remember how many we have got now&#151;would regard this as competition. That is a bit of a scare. I do not think the retail banks are remotely interested in getting involved in investing in social enterprises because they know that they are incredibly risky. They have not done anything about them up until now and I do not think they are going to start. So that is not a serious consideration. However, the independence of this organisation is absolutely critical.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080115130000222">Turning to the money, let us suppose the Minister is right and there is not &#163;500 million. You need a critical mass of &#163;250 million which you could phase in over three years. It does not all need to be there on day one because you can get the bank started and going with a much smaller sum, and if additional sums came in over a period that would certainly be an option. Even then, if the Minister is so worried about these figures and thinks that they are so suspect that he cannot trust them, why does he not consider giving a percentage to the social investment bank? It would be a good idea if 50 per cent of the total funds transferred over were to go into the social investment bank. If for some reason everything undershoots and the figures are not what everyone expects them to be, then clearly the agony would be shared by both the good causes that are going to benefit anyway and the social investment bank. There are ways round it. We have to adhere to the principle that we are setting up an independent organisation which can gear up on these funds and make much more out of the money that comes in.</p>

It was disappointing for many of us to have confirmation that the Government have precious little intention of setting up a social investment wholesaler or bank, whatever you like to call it, because they are going to try to splurge as much money as possible on the first two objectives specified in the clause. That is a source of great disappointment, particularly because initially there will be a backlog of money flowing out of the dormant accounts of the banks and building societies which will be much larger than that which will come at any later stage on an ongoing basis. A very good use for that would be to provide something which had sustainability, as opposed to a peak of expenditure, which cannot be sustained, for the other kinds of projects that will be financed.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000225">My noble friend&#146;s amendments are in two parts. One relates to definitions. We support the better definition that my noble friend proposes, as compared with the &#147;social investment wholesaler&#148; in the Bill with its very limited definition. The Minister claimed that this was novel and that we should congratulate the Government on being novel. In fact, the Minister tends to use novel as an excuse for remaining vague. We are trying to put some specificity around this concept and that is why we support the amendments of my noble friend Lord Hamilton.</p>

The various Executives will presumably choose to spend this money on things that come within the remit of devolved matters. That may be true but it in no way changes the current situation in which undisclosed percentages of money raised from dormant bank accounts are to be spent on undisclosed matters. Can the Minister at least let us know whether the devolved Executives are expected to explain how they will spend their money before the Secretary of State decides how much money to give them, or will it be vice versa?</p>

They attempt to inject a little more transparency into the process. The dissatisfaction that might be felt by those who felt excluded from the process has already been discussed. The amendments would merely require the devolved Executives to make public how they intend to spend the money that the Secretary of State awards to them. As already said, the Bill contains remarkably little scrutiny of how the money is to be spent, particularly by the wider public. The Government have failed to consult the public in even the most desultory way about where the money is to be spent. It would be overly optimistic to expect the devolved Executives to be more conscientious. The amendments would make sure that the public in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have at least some opportunity to comment on where the money is to go. I beg to move.</p>

It is eminently sensible that there should be some process of consultation in the devolved territories. As the Bill stands, those Administrations can determine how money will be spent across a broad definition of social and environmental matters, with no consultation whatever. At least we know broadly how the money will be spent in England, and we have been able to debate it. That is not the case with the other territories. Therefore, the amendment seems sensible.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000245">I need to impress on the Committee that the devolved Administrations have all publicly committed themselves to consultation on setting priorities for expenditure. Given the public comments made by all the devolved Administrations, and the scrutiny process that will apply, we do not feel that the amendments are necessary. If I may dare use the expression &#147;in the spirit of devolution&#148;, it is appropriate that we leave it to the relevant Administrations to determine the precise process of consultation, bearing in mind that they have all committed themselves to consultation.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000246">I was asked why the Government did not consult on spending priorities. In the 2005 Pre-Budget Report, we stated that the focus of the assets in England should be on youth services that are responsive to the needs of young people and on financial capability and inclusion, and that that represented a worthwhile and effective use of the resources available. Since then, we have held a wide-ranging review of youth services, involving extensive consultation with youth-focused third sector organisations and young people.

I can just about see that some modest expenses might be associated with giving directions to the Big Lottery Find, but I am not at all clear about other expenses that Clause 25(3) is expected to cover.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0006.htm_para43">
<p><a name="080115130000272">The Bill is drafted in terms of the Secretary of State demanding what he wants from the Big Lottery Fund. Although I am sure that it would be perfectly lawful for the fund to pay up what the Secretary of State demanded, it cannot be sound financial practice for the Secretary of State to demand sums on an unsubstantiated basis and to expect a body to pay on that basis. The fund should be in a position to check&#151;and, if appropriate, to challenge&#151;what the Secretary of State puts in his demands.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0006.htm_para44">
<p><a name="080115130000273">The Bill talks about &#147;expenses&#148;, and I hope the Minister will also clarify that term. In particular, is it expected to cover the apportioned cost of staff time spent working on the directions and other aspects of the Bill? Will it also include some calculations of overheads? I am not sure that those are expenses but they are certainly costs, and I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s views on whether they will be included. The Minister will know that if apportionments and calculations are required, there are no simple rules that apply, and hence some form of examination to establish the reasonableness of what is being demanded from the Big Lottery Fund seems to be appropriate.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0006.htm_para45">
<p><a name="080115130000274">In addition, the Bill is expressed in terms of the Secretary of State demanding not only expenses that he has incurred, but also expenses that he will incur; that is, he will be asking for funding ahead of need, which, as far as I can recall, goes against one of the fundamental principles of handling public money. Of course, this is not public money in a pure sense, but money for which there is public accountability. It must surely be the case that expenditure must be actual spending, not prospective estimates which may prove to be excessive.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000275">Accordingly, Amendment No. 97 says that the Secretary of State has to demonstrate to the fund what he has incurred&#151;not what he will incur&#151;on giving directions and on other matters under this Act. I hope that I have explained the change of emphasis in this clause that I seek to make; namely, not that the Secretary of State does not have expenses that might be taken, but, first, that he should justify them and, secondly, that we should seek clarification from the Minister in this Committee as to what the expenses might be and how they are to be calculated. I beg to move.</p>

It is clearly important&#151;here, I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness&#151;that the costs are minimal and are consistent with effective oversight and administration. We are not sure that the noble Baroness&#146;s model is any better than ours. Given that, under the Bill, the Big Lottery Fund will be accountable to the Secretary of State for the effective use and distribution of dormant account funds drawing on the advice of the devolved Administrations for their distribution outside England, it would seem anomalous for them to need to demonstrate their case to Big.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000278">In the way that these things work, it would more properly be for the accounting officer for the relevant department&#151;in this case, the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#151;to assure it that the administrative costs incurred were appropriate as part of its overall duty to make effective use of public funds, and for the accounting officers of the devolved Administrations to do the same in respect of their relevant functions. We contend that the role of the accounting officer is one of the answers to the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns that somehow the Secretary of State will demand expenses that are not valid.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="080115130000279">On the scale of costs, which I know is one of the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns, I reassure the Committee that while it is not possible to provide a figure at this stage for the likely costs that will be incurred in relation to the running of the unclaimed assets scheme, we certainly do not expect to incur significant costs in maintaining this oversight of the scheme and accountability for Big&#146;s spending.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0007.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080115130000280">For the administration of the distribution of lottery funds, as the Committee may know, the DCMS charges the National Lottery Distribution Fund approximately &#163;250,000 per year, which is less than 0.02 per cent of what is raised for good causes each year. Our estimate is that the cost in relation to overseeing the scheme we are debating in this Committee should be significantly less than that, due to it being a smaller fund.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080115130000281">With regard to spending outside England, as I have already said, the Secretary of State will draw on advice from the devolved Administrations for distribution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Although the Secretary of State will have overall oversight, it will be for those Administrations to work with Big in their own countries to ensure that spending is distributed in a manner that meets the targets intended in the direction that each Administration issues to Big and the outcome of the funding programmes that they agree with Big.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0007.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080115130000282">Therefore, I hope that, even if only to a small extent, the noble Baroness is now happier with our proposals. I repeat that it will be the duty of the accounting officer for the relevant department to ensure that there is no huge expense claim.</p>

<p><a name="080115130000293">Amendment No. 104 adds a new subsection to Clause 28, which deals with directions, and it requires directions to be laid before Parliament within seven days of their being given. The amendment does not require any parliamentary approval. Its purpose is merely to ensure that Parliament knows what instructions are being given under the authority of this legislation.</p>

As we have progressed through the Bill, we have noted a number of areas where there should be a legitimate ongoing concern with the way in which the dormant accounts scheme works. I refer not only to the way in which money is collected into it but the way in which it is processed through the reclaim fund and then how it is spent and the directions attached to each of those phases. That is why it will be important to keep Parliament aware of the way that the scheme develops.</p>

However, where I disagree with her&#151;I hope not necessitating a further day in Committee&#151;is that I think the Bill already provides adequate transparency. The most significant direction-making power is in Clause 21, whereby any directions given under the clause must be published in Big&#146;s annual report, which must be laid before Parliament and the devolved Assemblies. That is exactly the same approach that obtains with regard to the National Lottery Act 2006 and I do not think that there has been a strong argument that the lottery and its institutions of distribution have been subject to practices that have not been open to scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80115-gc0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080115130000299">This is a much smaller scheme, and a very worthy one indeed, which all the Committee support; but it is a much more minor scheme than the lottery. These provisions already work well in the lottery with regard to accountability to Parliament. Schedule 9, paragraph 3(2), requires Clause 21 directions to be published in Big&#146;s annual report. That will be the point of reference for all who are concerned about distribution of money. Because of that provision, the main direction power is open and transparent. The only other direction-making power is in Clause 5, which merely requests the reclaim fund to comply with one or more of its objects or articles of association. We do not see why we need to lay such a direction before Parliament. Where I am fully in agreement with the noble Baroness is that the operation of this fund must be transparent. That is why the provisions that obtain in the Bill are designed to meet that objective.</p>

If he does not want to bring the matter to Parliament&#151;and I know that the Government have resisted Parliament having anything to do with this scheme&#151;why can the report not at the very least be placed on the website of the relevant department the day that it is sent to Big, so that people know what is being proposed.

I cannot discover where this Bill requires its directions to be published in anyone&#146;s accounts. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, made the perfectly valid point that in any event the timing of such directions relating to Clause 21 would be inappropriately lacking in timeliness.

<p><a name="wms_st_0">
<a name="080115100000011"><b><a name="80115-wms0001.htm_spnew0"><a name="080115100000117">Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"><a name="080115100000012">I am today publishing my decisions on whether Manchester and Stansted airports should remain designated for the purposes of price control under Section 40 of the Airports Act 1986. My decisions follow advice from the independent aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), on these airports and two public consultations. My department&#146;s analysis has also been peer reviewed by Professor Martin Cave, director of the Centre for Management Under Regulation, at Warwick Business School, whose comments I am publishing alongside my decisions. My predecessor previously consulted on and announced new criteria for deciding whether or not an airport should be designated.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"><a name="080115100000013">At Manchester, having carefully considered the responses from the consultation, I have concluded that Manchester airport does not have and is not likely to acquire substantial market power. I therefore intend to de-designate Manchester airport and will introduce the necessary legislative changes.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"><a name="080115100000014">At Stansted, the decision is more finely balanced. After careful consideration, I have concluded that Stansted meets all of the criteria for designation, and should continue to be designated.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"><a name="080115100000015">The airports in the south-east are now operating at almost full capacity. This is bad for passengers in terms of delays, congestion and lack of choice, and it is also damaging to the UK&#146;s productivity and growth. This is why we support a second runway at Stansted and are consulting on adding capacity at Heathrow, while satisfying strict local environmental conditions on noise and air quality. I am therefore asking the CAA to continue to protect passengers by setting price caps at Stansted until new capacity is delivered, or until further evidence emerges from the ongoing Competition Commission review.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"><a name="080115100000016">In making my decision on Stansted, I am aware of the comments made by a number of the respondents on the costs of the current approach to price controls at Stansted. The structure of price controls is a matter for the regulator, but my decision is not intended to constrain the CAA from adopting other approaches which meet its statutory duties while avoiding some of the costs of the current system that respondents have identified.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"><a name="080115100000017">I have today published on my department&#146;s website decision letters setting out in full the rationale for my decisions, and Professor Cave&#146;s peer review comments. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"><a name="080115100000019">We previously announced on 11 October 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 42WS) the outcome, subject to consultation, of a review of the multiple injury lump-sum element of the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme. The purpose of the review was to ensure that the scheme's intent of focusing benefit on the most seriously injured was being delivered. The consultation has now concluded and I am pleased to confirm that the rule will be amended so that in future those who qualify for 100 per cent of the guaranteed income payment (GIP), who are by definition the most seriously injured, will receive 100 per cent of the surplus payable of all injuries sustained in a single incident, up to a maximum of &#163;285,000. Those who do not qualify for 100 per cent GIP payments will continue to have the current discounting rule applied to their multiple injuries. This does not affect injuries sustained in separate incidents as these are already paid at the full tariff value of the injury.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"><a name="080115100000020">The new rule applies to those whose injuries are sustained on or after the legislation comes into force. Cases whose multiple injuries were sustained between 6 April 2005 (the start of the scheme) and the date the new rule comes into force and who qualify for 100 per cent GIP will, exceptionally, have an additional benefit paid to bring them to the same level as those who have the new rule applied.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"><a name="080115100000021">The AFCS is still relatively new. While a full review of the scheme will be undertaken after five years of operation, we will continue to monitor the scheme in order to identify areas where evidence supports the need for further changes before then. The amendments to the legislation will be laid before Parliament on Wednesday 16 January to put the new rule in place on 8 February. Service personnel whose claims have already been processed and who are entitled to the additional payment will receive their extra money as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

These include tax measures against the British Council in St Petersburg and visa restrictions against British Council staff in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. Russia has further stated that it may take further action against the British Council in Moscow, including visa restrictions against UK diplomatic staff. Such threats can only make matters worse. It is not in the interests of either the UK or Russia for flourishing cultural, educational and scientific links to be held hostage to unrelated issues in this way.</p>

Consistent with its report, I propose to set the STRB a remit in the course of 2008 to enable it to ensure that the increases it has proposed for 2009 and 2010 continue to be appropriate in the light of latest recruitment and retention data and wider economic and labour market conditions. I should however make clear that it is my firm view at this stage that the increases set out in the recommendations in relation to 2009-11 are the right ones. There would need to be clear evidence of a significant and material change in these factors to justify any change to these figures.

The timescale proposed is also helpful and allows time for careful and considered study of the situation. There would be a number of issues to resolve, including in respect of the STRB's suggestion that future banding could be non-static (picking up an aspect of broader proposals in its thirteenth report part 2<sup>1</sup>). I shall take careful note of any immediate reactions expressed by consultees on these recommendations in relation to this current consultation.

I note its view that a revision is needed to the first point on the main pay scale (Ml) for teachers in inner and outer London, with consequential adjustments to points M2 and M3 on that scale. I also note its recommendations for enhancements in these same areas to the value of each of the three points on the upper pay scale.</p>

I propose to accept these recommendations. As regards the upper pay scale, I consider that it is important for the rewards attached to becoming a post-threshold teacher to be maintained year-on-year and so I propose to accept these recommendations also. DCSF will make available additional funding through a specific grant to cover the increased cost to London authorities of implementing the STRB recommendations on London pay. Our aim is that from 2011-12 this grant will be mainstreamed into the DSG.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"><a name="080115100000074">As regards the salary of excellent teachers appointed or in the staffing structure on or after September 2008, I am pleased now to be able to take forward the recommendation originally made by the STRB in its fifteenth report<sup>2</sup> that there should be pay ranges for this category of teacher from which relevant bodies select a spot salary. Providing salary ranges for excellent teachers will give schools the flexibility they need to set appropriate spot rates which take into account the job weighting of excellent teacher posts compared with other teachers in the staffing structure. Now that criteria for relevant bodies to select an appropriate spot salary from within the range have been developed<sup>3</sup>, ranges can be introduced. I welcome the general principle that the minimum of the range in September 2008 should be the current spot salary for England and Wales with a 2.45 per cent uplift. I also agree that in September 2008 the maximum of the range, and the maximum figure for inner London, should be on the basis of the original proposals of &#163;45,000 and &#163;50,000, updated (as would have been appropriate) with the application of the 2.5 per cent uplifts which were generally applicable in 2006 and 2007, plus the 2008 uplift of 2.45 per cent, leading to the figures set out in this report, which I propose to accept.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"><a name="080115100000075">I believe there is a need to reflect further on the position of teachers who have been or will be appointed to excellent teacher posts before September 2008, or where excellent teacher posts are already in the staffing structure, with published salaries. These posts are currently paid a spot salary with no discretion for variation. In view of the changes to salary arrangements for excellent teachers outlined above, my view is that rather than applying a set increase to existing posts, it may be more appropriate for schools to reassess the salaries of any such excellent teachers and determine a spot salary on the range in line with the criteria which will be generally applicable. This would also promote clarity and fairness. I should also mention that if in

<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"><a name="080115100000090">In short, the STRB has proposed a 10-point pay spine, with the points evenly spaced in percentage terms. Whenever an unqualified teacher is appointed, an individual pay range of up to five points, or a spot salary at the top point (point 10), would be selected from the spine, depending on the teacher's skills, qualifications and experience. Pay progression would be consistent with that of main scale teachers (ie on the basis of experience and satisfactory service), but on the basis of the individual range only. Spine points could be reviewed and would not be permanent. No changes are proposed to the unqualified teacher's allowance.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para19">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"><a name="080115100000091">I welcome the recommendation to align progression arrangements for unqualified teachers with those of main pay scale teachers. This would explicitly enable double points for excellence for those unqualified teachers who are placed on a range, and would remove the complete freedom which currently exists for relevant bodies to award points to unqualified teachers as and when they wish. This would be a benefit as it would enable greater clarity and fairness. I also welcome the STRB's recommendations not to alter the top and bottom values of the current scale (apart from applying the recommended uplift) and to space the points evenly, so that those progressing receive consistent pay increases.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"><a name="080115100000092">However, it must be noted that the principle of setting ranges on a spine would be quite a new&#151;and rather more complex&#151;arrangement for unqualified teachers' pay. Keeping the range of progression points to a maximum of five would in principle remove the concerns about long scales and the legal issues which could arise. I am concerned that with this arrangement there could still be scope for relevant bodies to make decisions which could negate the underlying legal purpose of the change in the arrangements, since they would be able to review these decisions when they deemed this appropriate and teachers could therefore receive more progression points than desirable. I would prefer such a situation to be avoided.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para21">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"><a name="080115100000093">I also have particular concerns about the proposal that unqualified teachers' points would no longer be permanent. This would be unlike the current situation for unqualified teachers and also unlike the position for main and upper pay scale teachers. It is of concern that unqualified teachers could be awarded points for experience, and then potentially lose them, following a review by their school or a job move. It is true that spine points for members of the leadership group and ASTs are not permanent. But that is because ranges for these teachers are entirely post-based and progression is on the basis not of experience but of performance. Spot salaries for excellent teachers, similarly, would from 2008 be subject to review, but again this would be not on the basis of experience but on job weight. I would welcome consultees' comments on this proposed change of principle for unqualified teachers, but at present this is not an approach I am minded to accept.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para22">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"><a name="080115100000094">In its report, the STRB has set out in some detail the proposals with regard to unqualified teachers put forward by the Rewards and Incentives Group<sup>4</sup>, which  


<notus-date day="15" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS137"><b>15 Jan 2008 : Column WS137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I endorsed. The RIG evidence included a proposal to shorten the pay scale to six points, which in RIG's view would be consistent in principle with employment law. I note that the STRB reports that in oral representation sessions, most other consultees agreed with RIG's proposals. I therefore invite comments from consultees on whether, having taken into account the STRB's views and recommendations, this approach might be a preferable one.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para23">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"><a name="080115100000095">I welcome the recommendation for further increases in the values of the unqualified teachers' pay spine in September 2009 and 2010. The application of this recommendation would, in due course, depend on any decisions taken following the consultation process on this report and the subsequent statutory consultation, as well as on the STRB's review.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para24">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"><a name="080115100000096">As regards the unqualified teachers' allowance, I fully endorse the view of the STRB that the allowance should not be used for recruitment and retention purposes. In addition to enhancing the statutory guidance as the STRB has recommended, it may be appropriate to look at clarifying the criteria for the award of the allowance in the <I>School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document</I> itself, in line with the sort of approach adopted in respect of Teaching and Learning Responsibility payments (which are exclusively for qualified teachers).</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para25">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"><a name="080115100000097">I agree with the STRB that the allowance should be capable of review, and consider that the ability to review (which could require appropriate safeguarding measures) would be a logical consequence of the enhanced clarity in the criteria for the award of the allowance which I believe may be necessary. I invite consultees' thoughts on all these points.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para26">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"><a name="080115100000098">I wish to highlight for consultees also the STRB's suggestion that the term &#147;unqualified teacher&#148; should cease to be used; its comments expressed in the body of its report that the term is misleading, negative and potentially demotivating; and its alternative suggestion of &#147;associate teacher&#148;. Although legally unobjectionable, as the term &#147;unqualified teacher&#148; simply means those teachers who do not have England and Wales qualified teacher status, I note the STRB's views. I am willing therefore to accept this change of term, or to consider other terms, but I should also welcome consultees' views on whether a change would on balance be beneficial and welcomed.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para27">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"><a name="080115100000099">Lastly, and on a separate point, I note that the STRB's recommendations for 2008 move us away from a system where pay points are no longer, as has traditionally been the case, divisible by three. I have no objection to this change, especially since the teachers' pay system already allows in some respects for payments to be made on another basis, but I would invite consultees' views on whether this is in any sense an issue.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"><a name="080115100000102">In December 2007 we invited local authorities developing TIF proposals to bid for a small amount of remaining funding available in the current financial year.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"><a name="080115100000103">I am today announcing funding for three areas.

This award means that these areas can continue to take forward proposals for improved public transport including local road pricing schemes.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"><a name="080115100000108">TBI are seen in both military and civilian populations, occurring when the skull and brain are exposed to acute changes in velocity such as road traffic accidents and contact sports, as well as exposure to blasts and other concussions to the head. Severe and moderate cases are generally readily identifiable to medical practitioners and will be managed by established clinical and rehabilitation programmes. The Defence Medical Services already routinely screens all personnel with multiple injuries admitted to the MoD&#146;s main rehabilitation centre at Headley Court for symptoms and signs of brain injury, and where necessary special investigations are undertaken to identify the nature and degree of any structural damage to the brain.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para35">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"><a name="080115100000109">However, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can be less easy to recognise and diagnose. It may result from relatively minor head injuries, and symptoms can be both wide-ranging and delayed in their onset, as well as being similar to those of other recognised disorders such as post-concussion syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para36">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"><a name="080115100000110">Recognising the need for further research, MoD&#146;s surgeon general initiated a project in June 2007 to investigate the historical, clinical and laboratory context of mTBI and make recommendations concerning future management, clinical care, education and research. The project team consulted widely with clinical and research experts within the military and civilian sectors both in the UK and overseas, principally the US.</p>

<a name="80115-wms0002.htm_para37">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"><a name="080115100000111">The project noted that civilian evidence suggests that 80 per cent of TBI is mild and 80 per cent of cases will be symptom free within three months of exposure. The project concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the operational capability of the UK's Armed Forces was being affected by mTBI. The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) has identified 585 cases of casualties with traumatic brain injury (whether mild, moderate or severe) out of some 36,000 total attendances for any medical condition to deployed UK operational emergency departments between early 2003 and November 2007&#151;the majority of which would be for minor ailments with no requirement for admission or, in many cases, further treatment.

Guidance has been promulgated to all defence general practitioners advising them about mTBI and the treatment options available. Education material has been developed, aimed at all personnel on deployed operations, and an assessment questionnaire is being introduced to help medical staff identify mTBI cases at the time of injury and to enhance surveillance and research.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"><a name="080115106000026">The total number of individuals arrested on enforcement visits between December 2006 and November 2007 is 10,662. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many of those arrested overstayed their temporary residence, without looking at their case files. However, a proportion of these individuals will have overstayed their leave. The monthly breakdown of this figure is attached at Annexe A. These data are based on management information and are not a national statistic. They should be treated as provisional as they are subject to change.</p>
