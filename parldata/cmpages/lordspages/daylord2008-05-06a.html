The law that has just been passed by the former Minister of the Interior, one Nicolas Sarkozy, which came into effect a year ago, has had the somewhat unusual effect of making it a crime, equal to the downloading of child pornography, to place a bet for as much as &#8364;2 with any British bookmaker. The penalty in each case is a year in prison and a &#8364;75,000 fine. Does the noble Lord consider that this is a fair and reasonable exercise in maintaining a level playing field within what he refers to as the European Community and that it is compatible with the designation he has given of a company therefore being exempt from the ban on advertising that would apply? Will he not now move to restore a level playing field by extending the ban on advertising to all bookmakers operating from France into the United Kingdom?</p>

Have not the Government been sitting on this issue, which was brought to their attention well over a year ago? It is a fundamental flaw of the Gambling Act that operators in the EU and in Gibraltar are allowed to have lower standards of age verification than those in the UK. Surely the Government do not want that to continue and so disadvantage UK operators.</p>

The noble Lord is right. Gibraltar is within the European Economic Area and therefore has the right to advertise in the United Kingdom. Our own regulations have been in place for only six months and there have been very few complaints to the Gambling Commission about any aspect of underage gambling. It is in the interests of those providing the services to obey British law, which is clear in these terms. At the moment, although we are keeping a careful eye on it, as the noble Lord enjoins us to do, we see no reason for changing our regulatory framework, which seems to be working satisfactorily.</p>

I drew his attention to the fact that standards adopted by the authorities in Gibraltar fall well short of those adopted in this country; the noble Lord, Lord James, referred to some of those in his Question. I ask my noble friend again whether he has had any discussions with Gibraltar with a view to it getting its act together and improving what it does.</p>

Its regulatory framework is not as robust as ours; I am not sure that we would expect it to be, given the limited resources of the Gibraltan state. It is also the case that the Gibraltarians will not readily take lectures from other authorities. However, we have indicated that we expect their standards to match ours in the crucial aspects, to which this Question refers, of advertising and offering accounts to people who are potentially underage. We will monitor that with the greatest care.</p>

That is what we, along with the other participants in the Oslo process, will be working to achieve in Dublin. The key task at this final meeting will be to reach agreement on the types of cluster munitions that fall into this category and which should therefore be prohibited.</p>

Given the appalling suffering of innocent civilians, which has already been inflicted by the use of these munitions irrespective of their type, and given their fundamental military unsuitability for the kinds of hostilities most prevalent in today&#146;s world, will the Minister make a further effort before the Dublin meeting to define a British negotiating position that will accept the banning of all cluster munitions with no ifs and buts?</p>

There is a debate about which munitions should or should not fall within this category. That is the purpose of Dublin: to see if this can be resolved in a way that protects those weapons that we still consider to have military utility. While the noble Lord is correct about today&#146;s asymmetrical warfare and the fact that these weapons have little purpose and can do a lot of harm when used in areas where civilians are present, we should not assume that old-fashioned warfare with tanks and other major targets is gone for ever.</p>

I have considerable sympathy with the observations made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, about that and the dangers of too many qualifications and too much hair-splitting over the definitions of different munitions.

A core group that went to Oslo has been working on this. It includes countries that are not users of these weapons together with some, such as ourselves, who use them in a very limited way. The difficulty for us is that not all NATO members are part of this process and therefore interoperability and the need to protect our ability to work with NATO partners in certain conflicts are key. NATO members have no need or reason at this time to use such weapons because of the nature of the conflicts we are involved in. We have no south Lebanon on our books at this time.</p>

However, I think that we are all aware that southern Lebanon represented a terrible, terrible situation with continuing tragic deaths of children and others. One very much hopes that the weapons type that was used in southern Lebanon will be within the boundaries of this treaty. Therefore the answer to my noble friend&#146;s question is that that variant of the M85 will not be in use in future.</p>

Is he aware of a growing feeling that we may be in danger of running a two-headed policy in Africa, part of it run with these large figures from DfID for the reduction of poverty and the other half dealing with political stability and good government? Given what we see happening around us, in Kenya and Zimbabwe&#151;disasters primarily as a result of misgovernment&#151;will he give us an assurance that it is our intention, and our policy, to run a single, balanced and coherent policy and not allow the gaining of political information and influence to wither away in reduced budgets?</p>

It will help to ensure that that does not happen, as will the vigorous attention of all your Lordships to ensuring that we have an active foreign policy for Africa and not just a development policy. I reassure him that DfID&#146;s expenditures on poverty reduction also very much cover good governance. There is full recognition that one must go hand in hand with the other. Only where there is accountable, transparent government will you see effective poverty reduction. Let me add that our foreign policy for Africa is no longer just about poor, failing states. There are some rich, quite successful states in Africa that offer us real partnership opportunities in moving ahead.</p>

Yet Kenya, for example, shows that although there is abundance of aid, the politics can be wrong and can mar much of the effect of that aid. Is my noble friend sensitive to the view that the balance between the two departments may not be quite right?</p>

Obviously diplomacy does not require the huge and heavy project expenditures that poverty reduction requires. Therefore, although these comparisons are important in ensuring that the Foreign Office is properly funded for its critical work in Africa and elsewhere, this is a comparison between apples and oranges. DfID is doing great work meeting the British goal, committed to at Gleneagles, of doubling our assistance to Africa by 2010 in a way that makes a tangible difference, such as more kids in school, better public health and better governance in Africa.</p>

Surely he is right when he says that the FCO and DfID should complement each other. However, does he share my enormous concern from my experience of visiting some of these places that enormous expertise is being lost as the FCO cuts back on staff, particularly those who have a long track record in some of these countries? Given the critical need to have expertise, particularly in developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, what is being done to ensure that people with great experience are retained?</p>

It is a talent pool that we must preserve. We are moving more diplomats from posts in places such as Europe to posts in developing countries. We are making the leadership of those missions&#151;the ambassador and high-commissioner positions&#151;more senior, relative to the old European transatlantic footprint. We are making efforts to do this, but I share the noble Baroness&#146;s concern that we do not lose the human capital of the FCO.</p>

We are pleased that we did a little better in this budget round that we had done in recent years. Although we do not have missions in 23 African states, that means that we are still just ahead of the game, with missions in the majority of African countries.

Therefore, the challenge is to have a form of taxation ensuring that the Exchequer gets a reasonable return, while at the same time not prejudicing the prospect of further exploitation of our resources in the North Sea. That has a far higher priority than fiddling around with wind farms.</p>

He is of course right that we need consistency in taxing the oil companies. The windfall profits of the oil companies in recent months are derived largely from their overseas investment. The North Sea accounts for only 10 per cent of BP&#146;s profits, so we should see the limitation of any windfall tax in that respect.</p>

Let me make it clear that any windfall tax, as far as oil companies are concerned, is nothing at all to do with their location. Shell and BP are firmly rooted in the United Kingdom.

I have been asked to do this because for 12 years during my time as leader of the Liberal Party, he was my closest, most senior and trusty adviser. We miss him very much.</p>

<a name="80506-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0805067000087"></a>He was a great servant of this House. In fact, very few people have made such a wide variety of contributions to public service: the list includes the Independent Television Commission, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the Hansard Society, Charter 88, the Green Alliance, Greenwich University, Middlesex Polytechnic, Nuffield College, Oxford and the English College in Prague. The list could go on and on. Yet his remarkable contribution to public life was married to a very successful business career. After being my adviser for 12 years, he continued in that role with my noble friend Lord Ashdown. The fact that he survived 20 years of the two of us was testimony to the sheer stamina of Richard Holme. Stamina was part of his characteristic. He used to get up very early and before he came to my office, he would have read all the newspapers. He was pretty useless after 10 pm, but first thing in the morning he was brilliant. Therefore, he was more suited to my noble friend than to me.</p>

<a name="80506-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0805067000088"></a>Lord Holme fought five elections in his attempt to enter the House of Commons, coming closest at Cheltenham. When I first met him he was fighting a by-election in East Grinstead, just immediately before I was to fight my by-election, which was why I went to help him, and we became close personal friends. What united us? It was a view which he held very strongly that there was no point in beavering away in the Liberal Party alternating between six MPs and 12 MPs, depending on whether it was a good or a bad election, but that one should gather allies and work across party on a range of issues.</p>

<a name="80506-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0805067000089"></a>That was put into effect during the Lib-Lab agreement with Mr Callaghan&#146;s Government in 1977-78 and, most notably, after the formation of the SDP, with the coming together of the two parties in the alliance. I clearly remember how that happened. Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, as they were then known, were with me and Richard Holme at the Königswinter conference just after the SDP had been launched. We had a convivial lunch out of doors and, discussing how the two parties might co-operate together, Richard was determined we go further. He seized a paper napkin and wrote down the heads of agreement, which became known as the Königswinter Compact and was, in fact, the beginning of the alliance between the SDP and the Liberals and hence of the Liberal Democrat Party as we know it today. I remember, as he put the paper napkin into his pocket, Shirley rather sweetly saying to him, &#147;Richard, does this mean I have to embrace proportional representation?&#148;. He said, &#147;Well, it is not obligatory but it would help awfully&#148;. And so she did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0805067000098"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment would remove the European Commission&#146;s right to propose EU legislation and so it goes to the heart of the project of EU integration. This right of proposal by the Commission has its origins in the big idea which gave birth to the EU and which still, in the eyes of its supporters, underpins it today. It is perhaps worth recalling what that big idea was. It was that the nation states had been responsible for the carnage of two world wars and so those nation states, with their unreliable democracies, had to be emasculated and diluted into a new form of supranational government run by a commission of wise technocrats. That is also why, once the Commission&#146;s proposals have been negotiated in COREPER&#151;the Committee of Permanent Representatives, or bureaucrats from the nation states&#151;which takes place in secret, and once the Council of Ministers has signed the proposals off and they have been rubber-stamped, where necessary, by national parliaments, the Commission becomes the executor of all EU legislation. It is supported, when necessary, by that engine of European integration, the Luxembourg Court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0805067000102"></a>Since most of our law is now made under this process, do we want to go on with it? Surely it is the very antithesis of our democracy, with the House of Commons and your Lordships&#146; House wholly excluded from the process of making the majority of our law. I imagine that I will be asked: if the Commission does not have the quasi-monopoly on proposing legislation, who should have it? My colleagues and I do not believe that that right should be vested in the European Parliament. If it is to happen at all, it should rest with the Council of Ministers. But, of course, we do not want it at all; we want out of the whole thing. Were the project to continue, that would be our recommendation.</p>

But the whole point and essence of the European Union as it has evolved is that that is not so: the driving seat is occupied by the Council of Ministers. The noble Lord briefly and rather hurriedly mentioned that there was such a thing as the Council of Ministers, but he gave us the impression that it was more or less being squeezed and abolished. But that is not so. One can speak only from one&#146;s own experience. Having been to

That was my worry, and I suspect that it is still the worry of Ministers who come and go to Brussels.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0805067000106"></a>This argument is familiar, particularly to someone who helped take the Maastricht treaty through the House of Commons. We were constantly warned by the noble Lord&#146;s predecessors, who were not equal to him in eloquence or persistence but, nevertheless, did not make a bad job of it. It was perfectly clear from everything they predicted about the treaty of Maastricht that all our laws would be made by the Commission and basic sovereign policies would be swept away, into the maw of Brussels. This was predicted during the Maastricht debates by people with great passion and conviction. I observe today that, contrary to their expectations, the Queen is still safe and happy on her throne; British taxes are put up by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the approval of the Prime Minister; British interest rates are fixed by the Bank of England; and we go to war at the behest of the Americans, and not of Brussels. This is all absolutely contrary to the predictions so confidently made by the noble Lord&#146;s predecessors. That is the situation at present, and would be the situation if the present treaty were ratified into effect. The real, basic points, which ordinary people associate with political decision-taking, would and will remain with the Council of Ministers and, above all, in most of these matters, with the British Parliament and Government.</p>

I will stick rather more closely to the amendment than he did in straying rather wider. We have always been enjoined by the noble Lords opposite to stick to the amendments. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, was not there when those strictures were first voiced. I simply underline that this is about the Commission&#146;s sole right to propose legislation. This amendment is about removing the Commission&#146;s right to do that. It seems extraordinary that both this place and another place are happy to accept that a large majority&#151;I will not put an exact percentage on it&#151;of our law is made in Brussels by the Commission. It does not come from the Council of Ministers; it does not come from Parliament; it comes from the Commission. That is the whole point of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0805067000108"></a>We have it on the authority of the German ministry of justice, which two years ago produced a report, that some 80 per cent of the legislation relating to Germany is made in Brussels and not by the German Parliament, which prompted the German ex-President, President Herzog, to ask whether Germany can still unreservedly call itself a parliamentary democracy. On that basis, we should ask ourselves the same question. Almost exactly a year ago, a legal advice firm called Sweet and Maxwell produced an interesting report, which said

One of the advisers on that paper was professor of law at the University of Cambridge, Professor Len Sealy. He pointed out that over the last 10 years there has also been a massive increase in EU law that becomes UK law without being passed by Parliament, either as a statute or a statutory instrument. In other words, Parliament simply does not see it at all.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0805067000109"></a>According to Professor Sealy, there were more than 2,000 of these regulations in 2006 alone. Their scope was quite astonishing. I rang him up because I could not believe that this was true. There were more than 2,000 pieces of legislation in one year alone that had become part of British law without Parliament ever seeing them at all. Professor Sealy confirmed that these regulations, which, I stress, are not seen at all by Parliament, cover a wide range of matters. Their scope is astonishing, ranging from cross-border insolvency to the importation of bed linen. I find that quite hard to believe.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0805067000110"></a>People in this country are aware that Parliament has less and less say in making laws, yet the people whom they elected, they elected to make our laws. They can appoint them, dismiss them and elect them&#151;but they cannot do the same for the European Commission, whose members are not elected and seem to be unsackable. So they are getting deeply resentful of a position in which a majority of our law is made not by the people whom they elected but by the European Commission.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0805067000111"></a>I have a few examples of such laws that we have had in front of us in this House and the other place, which include the end-of-life vehicles directive, the landfill directive, the drivers&#146; hours directive, the vibration directive, the fallen stock directive, the horse passports directive and the absolutely disgraceful curd cheese regulations&#151;which was opposed by our colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Benches, I seem to remember. These were all Commission initiatives that had to be put into UK law. Yes, we can amuse ourselves, as we did, by debating them; we can have Prayers against them and spend long, happy hours of sunlit afternoons talking about them and saying why we agree or not with them&#151;but, in the end, it does not really matter. They have to be put into UK law, willy-nilly, whether we want them or not. With qualified majority voting, a number of those initiatives that we did not agree with were put into British law. But Parliament is impotent to do anything at all about it; not a word, syllable or comma of any of those directives or regulations can be changed by the other place or this House.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0805067000112"></a>Are we really happy with this state of affairs? I read this morning in the papers that Members of the other place are going to get a large increase of some &#163;15,000 a year. I do not want to stray into territory into which I should not stray, but why are they getting that increase if so much of our law is made not in the other place or here but in Brussels by the unelected and unsackable European Commission, when our elected Parliament cannot change a word of it?</p>

People always wring their hands and say that they do not understand why the electorate is so uninterested in voting in British elections&#151;and it is true that the percentage of voters has gone down and down. This is just a theory, but I think that it is because people realise that Parliament has much less power and that the people whom they elect do not make most of their laws and cannot amend them as they wish. We have to take these things, swallow them now and swallow them whole. I warmly support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

The speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Willoughby de Broke, are essentially pure fiction. To pretend that the European Commission does not have regard to other bodies is utterly untrue. All sorts of representations are made to European Commissioners, when legislation is introduced, by outside bodies and the European Parliament. The Commission is ever mindful of its responsibilities towards the European Court of Justice. When I introduced legislation on transport or environment matters, I would invariably have before me Members of the European Parliament, who would make representations about the legislation. But it is not confined to that: other bodies also affect it, and they are not slow to make their representations heard. Quite apart from the fact that debates went on before the legislation took effect, to pretend that inside the European Commission everything was absolutely silent is utterly untrue. Inside the European Commission, the Commissioner responsible had to argue his case.</p>

In my day&#151;admittedly a long time ago, in 1985 to 1989&#151;the Commissioner responsible had to argue the case for the legislation before various bodies, and he was demonstrably concerned about getting the right answers. The situation which has been described today is, putting it mildly, frivolous.</p>

The process is completely outwith what Members of this House and Members of the House of Commons are used to. We were used to Cabinet Government. We have a Civil Service, the head of the Civil Service and departmental Permanent Secretaries. They propose policies to an elected Cabinet, which then decides which ones should be put before the House of Commons and eventually this House, which then have to agree to them.</p>

That really is not so. If the matters have been decided by QMV, they have become European law. That means that Parliament can discuss the matters as much as it likes and make as many amendments as it likes to the legislation that has been agreed, but it will have no effect because QMV means that European law has taken precedence over British law, and the House of Commons can do nothing about it. There is a misunderstanding of what in actual fact happens with European legislation, and it is a democratic deficit. Although the European Parliament is involved on an advisory basis, nevertheless there is this democratic deficiency.</p>

I assure the noble Lord&#151;and I invite him to come to the European Parliament and see at any time&#151;that in practice codecision means precisely that; it is codecided.

As far as this country is concerned, once the legislation has been passed in Europe our Parliament can do nothing about it because European law is superior to British law. As we have seen in a number of cases, this Parliament has been told that there is nothing you can do about it whether you like it or not. As I said, this is a matter which concerns people. Apparently even those who study the matter do not understand exactly what goes on. The discussions are in secret. It is little wonder that the public are a bit confused about what goes on.</p>

My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, who has spoken in the debate, and the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, who is in his place, had distinguished periods as commissioners in the 1970s and 1980s. The noble Lord, Lord Brittan, and my noble friend Lord Kinnock were vice-presidents of the Commission. The noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, held the crucial role of external relations commissioner. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, was for 10 years a distinguished secretary-general of the Commission. So this House speaks with a lot of expertise and knowledge on the subject.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0805067000129"></a>As regards the amendment, the Lisbon treaty contains provisions on the appointment, composition and role of the European Commission and the President of the European Commission, as well as certain provisions governing the new post of high representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Amendment No. 10A, which the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, has moved, would exclude paragraph 2 of the article from the UK&#146;s implementation of the treaty.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0805067000130"></a>Paragraph 2 sets out that the adoption of legislative acts will be based on the proposals of the Commission, except where the treaty provides otherwise. But the Commission has been part of the European institutional structure since the treaty of Rome in 1957. Frankly, Article 9D TEU draws on the existing provisions, making changes to enable the Commission to operate more effectively.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0805067000131"></a>The point is that existing treaties already provide that the right of initiative for legislative acts rests largely with the Commission, except where the treaties

There is nothing new under the sun in that concept. It has been the position under treaties that have passed through both Houses of Parliament for many years.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0805067000132"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, asks what is meant by,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000234"></a>&#147;except where the treaties provide otherwise&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000207"></a>and he asks for examples. The general rule is that the right of initiative for legislative acts rests with the Commission. The main exception is for certain JHA measures as regards the police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Other entities besides the Commission may propose non-legislative acts; for example, the ECB for monetary policy and the ECJ for court rules of procedure. I remind the Committee that as regards the CFSP, which no doubt we will be discussing this afternoon, the high representative and the member states have the right of initiative.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0805067000133"></a>Perhaps I may mention one change that is important. Under the Lisbon treaty, any proposal in the area of justice and home affairs must be made by a quarter of the member states. As the EU Select Committee of this House set out in its report, this change will help to ensure a more co-ordinated and coherent approach to legislation, planned in line with long-term EU strategies rather than being based on topical national considerations. It is noticeable that the Law Societies of England, Wales and Scotland have welcomed this change.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0805067000134"></a>Members of the Committee will also know that on 7 March this year Sub-Committee E of the House&#146;s European Committee, which deals with law and institutions, launched an inquiry into the initiation of EU legislation. I believe that evidence has already been taken from Her Majesty&#146;s Government and other interested parties and I am sure that the whole House, including the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, is looking forward to the publication of its report.</p>

<a name="80506-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0805067000135"></a>As far as the meat of this amendment is concerned, the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, in his effortless and extremely polite way, demolished completely the case put by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, ensuring that I do not have to attempt to do so myself. It is clear that the Commission has played a leading role in this field and although, as the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, made absolutely clear, all kinds of dire consequences have been threatened for years, none of them has come to pass and there is no reason to believe that they will as a result of the treaty of Lisbon. I invite the noble Lord, with respect, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It may feel like that now. However, even at the time of Maastricht it was not like that and it certainly is not like that now. Parliament&#151;the House of Commons and your Lordships&#146; House&#151;cannot propose this legislation. Of course we accept the point of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, that the Commission receives all sorts of proposals from countries and lobbyists. However, that does not alter the fact that it has a near-monopoly of proposing legislation, which is then negotiated in COREPER and passed in the Council of Ministers. Once it is through the Council of Ministers, there is nothing that the House of Commons or your Lordships&#146; House can do about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0805067000138"></a>My noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke mentioned several examples&#151;I have two that are going through now. One is the tax on the resale of art, particularly modern art, which is doing immense damage to the art market in this country. The other is the control of food supplements&#151;vitamins and health foods&#151;that the Government are also opposing in Brussels although it does not look as if they will succeed. So it is simply not fair of your Europhile Lordships to pretend that this is democracy as we have known it. We accept that the European Parliament can block legislation, but we repeat that it cannot propose it without the consent of the Commission.</p>

However, it really does not help if the Minister and other noble Lords say, &#147;There is nothing to worry about here, because this was part of the original Treaty of Rome in 1957&#148;. Indeed it was&#151;I said so myself. This has always been part of this project, but that does not mean that we have to accept it. Noble and Europhile Lords, and Europhiles generally, very often advance this point. They say, &#147;This is nothing new, so it is all right&#148;.

That is why more and more people&#151;millions of them&#151;do not like this project and want us out of it.

The concern is with the new provision that the President of the Commission&#151;not the President of the Council, which is also a new feature in its extended form&#151;should be elected by the European Parliament. The precise proposal is that the new Commission president should be nominated by the Council by qualified majority voting and then elected by a majority in the European Parliament, which brings that post and the candidature for it right to the heart of the lobbying, factions and political blocs in the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0805067000144"></a>The Government very strongly opposed that change at the time of the convention that drew up the original constitutional treaty, and the words of the proposal here are identical. The Labour Minister at the time, Peter Hain, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0805067000227"></a>&#147;Another suggestion is for the European Parliament to elect the Commission President. However, I am sceptical of that idea. My concern is that such an independent figure, who must be acceptable to the member states through the Council, will get caught up in the politics of the European Parliament&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/3/03; col. 309WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000208"></a>I could not have put it better, and it was a perfectly sensible concern. Attempts were made in the convention to delete the proposal, but I am afraid they failed. The reason Mr Hain was worried and why the Labour Government of yesterday were worried and fought not to have it in this treaty either is that they feared the outcome that the dominant EP party blocs, whatever they happened to be, would have the initiative in choosing a name, and the European Council would have to go along with that candidate. I know that our excellent European Union Select Committee report rather bravely thought that this would not stop the Council coming to its decisions, although it was very candid in adding,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000235"></a>&#147;the practical consequences of the ... provisions are as yet unclear&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000209"></a>The lack of clarity is now beginning to dissolve, and there is already a campaign website from the European Parliament to announce its preferred candidate in what it calls, &#147;the first European presidential election&#148;.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0805067000145"></a>All that will please many people who want things to go that way and who believe that Europe is moving in the right direction; a prospect that many of us are not at all sure about. This is light years away from the Monnet ideal that the Commission would be a genuinely independent college of wise men and women standing clear of national party politics and lobbies. It also shifts power away from national Ministers and national Parliaments&#151;again this may be welcome to some but not to me&#151;in which we on this side have argued again and again that the modern European Union should have its powers properly anchored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0805067000146"></a>The European Parliament does an excellent job and many of its Members work extremely hard but it really cannot be said, except by a fantasist, that moving powers to the European Parliament somehow fulfils the Laaken dream&#151;it is only an unfulfilled dream&#151;of bringing the European Union and its works closer to the people. That is why Ministers fought strenuously against the idea when it first surfaced in the rejected constitutional treaty; but here it is now in identical

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0805067000148"></a>Amendment No. 11 refers to a reduction in the number of commissioners so that there is no longer a commissioner for each member state. I understand the practicalities of the difficulty in having a large number of commissioners but there are other ways of dealing with that. For example, there are rather more Ministers than members of the Cabinet in the UK Government. Not every Minister has the same status and not every commissioner need have a front-line portfolio. The problem is that this proposal has not been thought through in terms of the impact that it will have on the linkage with member states. While a commissioner is not there to represent the member state directly, it is important symbolically for each country to see that it is involved directly in the commissioner body and has a voice within it.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0805067000149"></a>The move to break the link between commissioners and countries is part of the overall trend that says that the EU is primarily not an association of member states but a governing body that is increasingly accountable first and foremost to a European democracy, represented in the European Parliament. As noble Lords have said, a number of shifts in the treaty increase the power of the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0805067000150"></a>Amendment No. 12, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, talks to that specifically in that under this treaty the Commission will be elected by the European Parliament. If the European Union is seen as an association of member states we might think that the Commission is there to do the bidding of the member states, which have appointed it. If we see the European Union as a democracy where the primary legitimacy comes from the European Parliament, of course we shift the responsibility of the Commission to that Parliament. Paragraph 8 of the Article 9D in the Lisbon treaty states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0805067000228"></a>&#147;The Commission, as a body, shall be responsible to the European Parliament&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0805067000151"></a>To my mind, that is a significant shift in emphasis and takes us away from the notion of the European Union as an association of member states. The Government need to explain whether their intention is to sign up to that direction, or whether they will stand on the principle that has hitherto been the case of Europe as an association of nation states of which we were a member.</p>

On this occasion I refer to Amendment No. 92, tabled, yet again, by Mr William Cash and Mr John Redwood. Theirs was an umbrella amendment excluding the whole of Article 9D, and not just the relevant portions, as is proposed in the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford.

Following my noble friend&#146;s intervention, is not the concern&#151;and does he not share it&#151;that a great many of these amendments were not discussed in the House of Commons? Through the guillotine, as we used to call it&#151;now the timetable Motion, and various kinds of procedural Motion&#151;a great many crucial amendments were not examined at all. The Prime Minister urged that we look at these matters line by line, and we are trying to do so. The noble Lord&#146;s observations do not help matters at all.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0805067000158"></a>As I was going to say, the provisions of Article 9D in the treaty text set out the appointment, procedure, role and functioning of the European Commission and the European President. Although it will be for any member state not to have a commissioner, as far as I recall, the Government originally said that they now welcomed the reduction in the size of the Commission, to make it a more practical and viable body. Certainly, we on these Benches share those feelings. An unwieldy Commission, with the larger number of member states, would be a future obstacle to efficient EU delivery and risk creating non-jobs, which would perhaps encourage legislation in non-priority areas. The EU must be made more efficient and effective to carry out the relatively small number of legislative and administrative tasks that it should on behalf of all the member states, leaving the vast mass of all national legislation to those individual member states and their national parliaments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0805067000159"></a>Similarly, we would not support Amendment No. 12A of the noble Lord, Lord Howell. The appointment procedures are admittedly being reformulated and reconstructed, but there is not much change in substance from existing procedures except for the beneficial aspect of bringing the European Parliament and Commission closer together in mutual support in the co-decision context. We on these Benches therefore oppose these amendments.</p>

He put all the emphasis on the European Parliament&#146;s power of decision on the President of the Council, and moved rather rapidly over the fact that any name put to the Parliament must be proposed by the European Council. He might draw some comfort from the fact that the only other international organisation where that system is replicated is the United Nations, of which we have been a member since the outset. It provides that a secretary-general is chosen by the General Assembly, but it can only do so on the recommendation of the Security Council. No recommendation of the Security Council has not been endorsed by the General Assembly. Perhaps the noble Lord can take some comfort from that. The European Parliament has the right to reject the name put forward by the European Council, but it does not have the right to propose a name. That is clear from the text of the treaty.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0805067000163"></a>On the question of the size of the Commission, nothing has brought it into greater discredit, quite without any help of its own, than the continuing increase in the number of commissioners that has followed enlargement, to a point where there are now more commissioners than would be found in the Cabinets of any of the member states. That has occurred over time, irrespective of the fact that there is not that number of effective jobs to do. That has brought discredit as people with high-sounding titles and small responsibilities are guyed in the papers and given a rough time. It is not a sensible way to run a railroad, and everyone has recognised that for a long time. It was bad enough when there were 12 member states and 16 commissioners because there were not 16 jobs to do. Now there are 27 member states and   


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_451"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>27 commissioners&#151;quite shortly, there will be a 28th&#151;and it is not sensible to go on in that way. There are functional defects that result in a reduction in solidarity and collegiality. Departments in the Commission are split up into ever smaller units to provide jobs for individual commissioners. An illusion is put forward that each commissioner represents a country which, under his oath, he must not do. That is the job of COREPER and the Council.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0805067000164"></a>Therefore, I think this is a move in the right direction. In case people put excessive weight on commissioners representing their country of origin, has anyone complained that we no longer have a second British commissioner since the appointment of this Commission? That has not been a cause of complaint. Out in the country, people are not going around saying that the place has been going to the dogs ever since the second British commissioner was removed. What is now being proposed is a bolder step, but we must remember that every member state that ratifies this treaty is accepting that on some occasions its nationals will not be represented in the Commission. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland&#151;large member states that previously had two commissioners&#151;are accepting that from time to time they will have none. I agree that this is an important step, and I think that it will produce more care and caution with the vital interests of member states in this college that does not have representation for every member state. The present situation is that there is often a rather unhealthy tendency to leave the members who come from that member state to argue their corner, which is not what they are there for.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0805067000165"></a>Whenever the EU Select Committee of this House has looked at the system of one member per member state, whether in the Court of Auditors, which was looked at twice, or in the European Central Bank, it has come to the conclusion, which the House has accepted, that functionally the sensible solution is to have fewer than 27 or more members of these institutions. I hope we will have the courage of our convictions in this case and that the amendment will not be pressed.</p>

As the Committee heard, that paragraph will slim down the Commission so that from 1 November 2014 the number of commissioners will correspond to two-thirds of the number of member states; in other words, 18 out of the current 27. Commissioners will be selected from all member states on the basis of equal rotation, reflecting the demographic and geographical diversity of those member states. We believe that the Lisbon treaty will deliver a smaller, more efficient and more focused Commission that is better able to deliver on issues that matter to our citizens.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0805067000167"></a>The UK has long supported a smaller Commission. An unwieldy one would be an obstacle to delivery by the EU and would lose focus on those priority tasks that the Commission needs to carry out. Of course, the EU needs an effective, efficient and well-led Commission to ensure that it delivers on the policies that, as I have said, actually matter to people in Europe.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0805067000168"></a>I remind noble Lords that the report of this House&#146;s EU Select Committee concludes that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000236"></a>&#147;the reduction in the size of the college of Commissioners is an important change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000211"></a>Indeed it is. It continues,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000237"></a>&#147;and is intended to enable the Commission to function more effectively&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0805067000169"></a>A smaller Commission is, in any case, an existing obligation under the Treaty of Nice, which requires that the number of commissioners be less than the number of member states once the EU reaches 27 members. However, it is the priorities delivered by the Commission that are important and not, frankly, the nationality of the commissioner.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0805067000170"></a>The current Barroso Commission is, of course, only one-27th British, but the priorities it is delivering on issues such as climate change, better regulation, the single market and competition and the Lisbon agenda itself are largely in line with our own approach. Commissioners are to be chosen on grounds of their competence and independence and we have benefited from their independence, for example, in driving forward market liberalisation. Once member states do not have permanent commissioners, the criteria of independence will be even more important under this treaty than ever before.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0805067000171"></a>A further argument is that it is not only the commissioner jobs at the top that are important&#151;they are crucial but not the only ones of great importance. We are very well represented as a country at the highest levels of the Commission below commissioner level. If I may just remind the Committee, we have four chefs de cabinet of commissioners, three deputy chefs de cabinet of commissioners, four directors-general, three deputy directors-general and 39 other directors who are also British. There was a debate in this House not many weeks ago in which it was generally agreed that we do pretty well at the top level of Commission appointees. Therefore, we do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, who tabled Amendment No. 11.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0805067000172"></a>Let me move to Amendment No. 12, which the noble Lord largely spoke about and which would exclude from the Bill the way in which the President and members of the Commission are to be appointed. The reformulation of the procedure is part of the process of updating the Union&#146;s institutional framework. The particular aspect of the appointment procedure which has attracted attention, and did this afternoon, is that of the appointment of the President of the Commission, under which the European Council will have to take account of the political complexion of the European Parliament when nominating a new Commission President and that the Parliament will &#147;elect&#148; that person if it agrees with the nomination.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0805067000173"></a>As has been said&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, made the point just a few minutes ago&#151;the European Council proposes a candidate to the Parliament and the Parliament either elects that person or does not. If it does not, it goes back to the European Council to consider the position. At a later stage, the President-elect, if he has at that stage got the approval or the election of the Parliament, goes back with his team to the Council. We argue that what will happen is broadly similar to the existing procedure under which&#151;and I  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_453"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remind the Committee of this&#151;the European Parliament must approve the nominee for Commission President. What does that mean in practice? It means, surely, that the member states have to take account of Parliament&#146;s position in making that nomination.</p>

<a name="80506-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0805067000174"></a>The European Parliament already makes its views clear on possible candidates for the Commission President. We saw that with the process that led to the appointment of the present Commission President, Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, in 2004. The European Parliament at that time made clear its intention to ensure that the Commission President reflected the political majority in the European Parliament. The European Parliament President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, made it clear that the largest political group in the Parliament, the centre-right European People&#146;s Party, to which, at the moment at least, the party of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, belongs and which in many ways has control as it has the largest number although no overall majority&#151;I am sure that pro-Europeans like the noble Lord and others in the party will wonder why on earth the Conservative Party is thinking of leaving the European People&#146;s Party to move to the outer reaches of that Parliament&#151;could not support a candidate of another political colour. That is what happened in 2004, and what is likely to happen after the next European elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0805067000175"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, told the Select Committee when he gave evidence to its inquiry into this treaty, the provision in the treaty for the European Council to take into account the political complexion of the European Parliament when choosing the Commission President,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000238"></a>&#147;will mean ... that it would be difficult for Member States to come up with a proposed president who was known to be violently contradictory to and opposed to the weight of opinion in the European Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000212"></a>I do not think that it will make as much difference as all that.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0805067000176"></a>We welcome the formal acknowledgement of the Parliament&#146;s role in the appointment of the Commission President&#151;a role that it already exercises in practice. It underlines the democratic accountability of the person appointed, which is not an inconsiderable point in this argument. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, fairly admitted when he moved Amendment No. 12, our own European Union Select Committee made this point at chapter 4.109:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0805067000229"></a>&#147;The need for the European Council to take into account the results of the parliamentary elections is not a bar to the European Council coming to its own decision as to its preferred candidate, but the Council will continue to be unlikely to nominate a candidate who could not command the parliamentary majority necessary for election. In that sense there is no fundamental change from the current system which requires the Parliament&#146;s approval of the European Council&#146;s nominee, but the practical consequences of the Treaty provisions are&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000213"></a>as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, &#147;as yet unclear&#148;.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0805067000177"></a>We argue that this is a good move, not a bad move. It changes very little, and I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In other words, Mr Hain argued for the reverse of the procedure which the convention in the end recommended and which is in the Lisbon treaty.</p>

However, whichever way one slices it, there were considerable doubts about whether this would not mean, in Mr Hain&#146;s words, that the whole process would get caught up in European politics&#151;indeed, there were other quotations which I have had a self-denying ordinance not to mobilise for the Committee.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0805067000181"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, also tempts me to wider observations to the effect that the convention was, in many respects, a terrible trap for British Ministers into which they attempted and failed to inject their views. That gave birth to the constitution, which is largely identical to what we are dealing with now and has led to much trouble. My own view, from the start, was that the convention was a top-down arrangement from which no good would come. It was not bottom-up, democratic or anchored in the national parliaments, and it led indeed to disaster; but that is, possibly, a debate for another day.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0805067000182"></a>I listened with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, on the United Nations example. I am not all that much comforted as the modalities are so different that I am not sure the comparison stands up. Anyway, I am informed that the European Parliament has already started lobbying, with its various groups organising to work out their prepared candidate for Commission President in 2009. That does not look encouraging if we want the Commission President to stand above it all and have the complete confidence of the Council. Still, this is what will happen. It does not thrill me at all and should not thrill those who want to see the European Union move into a more modern, flexible and decentralised pattern for the future&#151;one able to meet the challenges of the modern world more efficiently than it can at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0805067000183"></a>I kept off the issue of the Commission&#146;s size, although it touches this amendment and was looked at and discussed by the Committee during the last amendment. That is because my own feeling is that one cannot really question the desirability of having a smaller Commission, but what are important here are its powers rather than its size. We could have a good, large Commission or a good, smaller one&#151;ideally

The key is always how many powers it would have, not its size.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0805067000184"></a>The Minister mentions the priorities that this Commission has delivered&#151;some good, some really very bad. We will, no doubt, come to debate later that disastrous posture in the Commission&#146;s attempt to form a common climate and energy security policy, which has led it into supporting the biofuels scandal. That is leading not merely to scandal but real suffering and harm throughout the entire world, which is a very big price to pay&#151;and underlying it is a very big policy error, magnified by the Commission&#146;s apparent support for those things.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0805067000185"></a>One is left uneasy about this matter, which seems not a step forward but one sideways or back. I repeat; it leaves one baffled as to why there has been such a substantial change of view in government circles. However, since the Minister has put the case reasonably&#151;and because this narrow point may be part of a bigger picture to which we will return&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0805067000189"></a>The noble Lord said: In view of recent developments, Amendment No. 12A is extremely important. The Committee may or may not be aware that the European Parliament recently produced a secret, or covert, report that has uncovered extensive, widespread and criminal abuse by Euro MPs of staff allowances worth almost &#163;100 million a year. European Parliament officials have tried to hush this up and Harald Rømer, the secretary-general of the European assembly, was asked, I believe, by Hans-Gert Pöttering, to take measures to ensure that there was no collateral damage from this report. A source said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0805067000231"></a>&#147;We want reform but we cannot make this report available to the public if we want people to vote in the European elections next year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000214"></a>Only Euro MPs on the Budgetary Control Committee were allowed to see the report. Even then they had to apply to enter a secret room, which was protected by biometric locks and security guards. They were not allowed to take notes or to divulge to anyone else the contents of that report. In response to criticism of this procedure, a parliamentary official said that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000239"></a>&#147;not secret. It is confidential&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0805067000190"></a>I am happy to say that Chris Davies, a British Liberal Democrat MEP, blew the gaff on all this. He  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_456"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>complained to OLAF and asked it to investigate this serious matter. He said that the findings,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000240"></a>&#147;most definitely fall within OLAF&#146;s terms of reference ... They are so serious that it should be assumed that criminal proceedings may follow&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000215"></a>That is directly relevant to Amendment No. 12A, which refers to a certificate or document stating that the European Parliament is a fit body to operate. However, it is obviously not. OLAF has now asked to see the secret report and will follow that up. I am sure that Members of the Committee on the Liberal Democrat Benches will wish to support Mr Davies, who has said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000241"></a>&#147;without transparency there was no way of checking suspicions that some members were using ... parliamentary allowances to cover their contribution&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000216"></a>to their pension funds, which he said amounted to &#147;embezzlement&#148;. That is a very serious charge, which, again, justifies requiring this certificate to be issued before giving the European Parliament any more powers.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0805067000191"></a>The Parliament voted by a very large majority against making this report public, which is absolutely disgraceful. Mr Davies went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0805067000232"></a>&#147;These votes bring discredit and dishonour upon the entire parliament. Taxpayers could be forgiven for believing there are more honest people to be found in prison than sit in the European Parliament&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000217"></a>That is a direct quotation from Mr Davies&#146;s official website, which I looked at this morning. Far from cleaning up their act, a majority of MEPs seem to think that they are allowed to put their fingers in the till and carry on enjoying the gravy train, which is outrageous. Not only is there possible, or likely, fraud going on, but the MEPs do not want even to acknowledge it. They voted to keep this report secret or confidential, whichever terminology one cares to use.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0805067000192"></a>The fact that OLAF is involved is not all that reassuring, because it itself was caught with its trousers down or its fingers in the till&#151;whichever you choose. OLAF admitted that it lied to the European Court of First Instance over allegations that it had asked the Belgian police to look at the investigative journalist Hans-Martin Tillack&#146;s file. It told the European Court of First Instance in August 2004:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="0805067000233"></a>&#147;Neither OLAF nor any other Commission staff have ever contacted juge d&#146;instruction Franzen&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000218"></a>This was to ask for Hans-Martin Tillack&#146;s file. It has now admitted that it did do that. OLAF, the organisation against fraud in the European Union, actually lied to the European Union&#146;s own Court of First Instance, so the fact that OLAF is investigating possible fraud in the European Parliament does not give me any confidence. This amendment is entirely worth pursuing. Some MEPs have shown themselves to be, to use Mr Davies&#146;s words, verging on carrying out &#147;embezzlement&#148; and therefore one has to ask whether, in the words of the amendment, there is,</p>
<ul><a name="0805067000242"></a>&#147;evidence of fraud or impropriety&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805067000219"></a>I think embezzlement is definitely fraud or impropriety. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0805067000195"></a>There is no question that it is very important to make sure that where there are concerns about personal terms and conditions and expenses arrangements for members of any parliament, but in this context the European Parliament, those are addressed. The Government expect taxpayers&#146; money to be spent correctly and support the maximum transparency on this. That does not in any way deflect from the fact that the European Parliament plays a vital role in the European Union. Its Members are directly elected and they perform an important role of scrutiny, holding the Commission to account. MEPs are effective both at raising issues of great concern&#151;for example, climate change in recent times&#151;and at scrutinising and improving legislation. The REACH chemicals regulation, key financial service dossiers and the mediation directive&#151;which I was involved in in liaison with the European Parliament and which covers mediation and civil justice issues across borders&#151;are all good recent examples of where the European Parliament has added value, scrutinised and held to account. Strengthening the Parliament&#146;s role strengthens transparency and democratic accountability.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0805067000196"></a>I listened with great care to the noble Lord and I agree that it is important to make sure that any organisation looks at what it can do to strengthen its transparency and accountability and to deal with issues, whether of perceived fraud or of propriety, for which transparency is often the answer. Noble Lords will know that the European Parliament has already strengthened requirements on MEPs to provide documentation on, for example, the use of office allowances and employing staff. Noble Lords will know also that, after the elections next year, the MEP Statute will be introduced, which will see the reform of MEPs&#146; pay to provide a standard base salary across  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_458"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Europe. It will reform the expenses and allowances system for MEPs. We in the UK have long supported the statute as a fair, transparent and substantive way forward.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0805067000197"></a>However, the amendment raises a specific question: is the European Parliament a fit organisation to have the power to censure the Commission? We support this parliamentary power. Being able to hold the Commission to account in this way is an important aspect of the Parliament&#146;s power, because it is a democratically and directly elected institution. Noble Lords know, too, that the power of censure is not new; it goes back to the treaty of Rome. They will remember, for example, the tough stance of Parliament on the perceived mismanagement of funds by the Santer Commission, which led ultimately to the resignation of the whole Commission. It marked an important step in supporting improvements in the management of EC funds and generated the political impetus that was necessary for the <I>Reforming the Commissi</I><I>on</I> White Paper in 2000.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0805067000198"></a>So the Parliament plays an important role in holding the Commission to account. Its ultimate sanction is the power of censure. It is important that the citizens who elect the European Parliament know that, ultimately, their direct representatives in Strasbourg can dismiss the Commission. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment on that basis.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08050616000002"></a>The noble Lord said: We come to a whole group of amendments which covers the positioning of common foreign security policy and the foreign policy of this country within the pattern set by the proposed treaty of Lisbon. In essence, the amendments would secure something which the Government once wanted very badly out of this and the previous constitutional treaty but which they have failed to get. Perhaps that was too ambitious and we can now help them, because the Government&#146;s aim, and the clear aim of the Bill, is to try to ring-fence foreign policy and keep it firmly under national control. That is entirely creditable and makes sense in this world where, on some issues, we need tight and intimate coalitions with certain of our neighbours, allies and friends, but where the pattern changes from time to time and, on other occasions, we need either to pursue matters ourselves or seek a new alliance or coalition. The underlying aim of the Government was creditable, but they have failed and this Bill embodies their failure.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08050616000004"></a>It is highly instructive to look back to the original convention, which drafted the constitution treaty where the words were born, and which we now have before us because they are identical. The essence of the matter was described well by Ministers then: it was to ensure that the European Union acts in all foreign policy issues on behalf of member states, and not the reverse. That is a very important qualification. They failed because they tried to delete the injunction that member states should,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000111"></a>&#147;actively and unreservedly support the Union&#146;s common foreign and security policy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000005"></a>That did not work. They tried to ensure that common foreign security policy would in no way fall, by any back door or side channel, under ECJ jurisdiction, and that with decisions under EU foreign policy there would not be grounds for appeal. They failed with that. They tried to define more clearly what common foreign security was, and what the boundaries were, with regard to which issues would be reserved for national decision and which should be within the competence of the Union, the Council of Ministers and the Foreign Affairs Council. They failed in that, too. Indeed, the noble Baroness, who circulated a very helpful letter giving her views on the role and work of the ECJ as a body, mentioned that the ECJ will,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000112"></a>&#147;police the frontiers between CFSP and non-CFSP matters&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000006"></a>A gap was opened, through which all kinds of qualifications could creep.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08050616000007"></a>Ministers tried to prevent Union delegations, as opposed to Commission delegations, always representing the Union in third countries or in international institutions or conferences. They failed in that, too. Above all, they struggled to prevent the birth of a big new European Union diplomatic corps, the so-called European External Action Service, which would be ambiguously outside national or intergovernmental control. That happened too, as we know; it is in the treaty and now being planned. According to the widely reported comments of Finland&#146;s Foreign Minister, Mr Stubb, it will make the EU,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000098"></a>&#147;one of the world&#146;s great actors&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000008"></a>and that,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000099"></a>&#147;all over the world there will be EU embassies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000009"></a>I do not think that was the intention; we will see whether that happens. Certainly, the treaty makes clear that the European Parliament, which we have discussed, should have hearings in appointing this army of ambassadors.</p>

<a name="80506-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08050616000010"></a>All this makes one query whether the Government have had the success that they claim&#151;and as the Bill tries to ensure&#151;in keeping foreign policy in national hands. It looks to me as though they have failed. Indeed, if one looks through the history of that ill-fated negotiation during the convention, which gave birth to the words we are dealing with now, it turns out to have been a rather dismal and futile negotiation. It was certainly an incompetent one, conducted by this Government, where they walked, again and again, into various traps from which they have not yet succeeded in escaping. Reading again the transcript of those negotiations and their outcome, which is in the treaty before us now, they sound as though they were being handled by a defeated nation, and as though we had to say yes to everything&#151;as though we had no locus and leverage at all. It was a sad episode. Chances were missed completely at the Hampton Court summit of the European Council afterwards. All the opportunities were there to restore the situation; none of them was taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08050616000011"></a>As for the general proposition that this has kept the CSFP out of the supranational zone, we know that in fact there are 11 areas relating to foreign policy&#151;there are many other areas as well&#151;in which the veto has been removed. They are the proposals from the EU Foreign Minister; the design of the EU diplomatic service; the setting up of an inner core in defence; arrangements for terrorism and mutual defence provisions; urgent financial aid provisions; humanitarian aid provisions; the election of the EU Foreign Minister; civil protection; terrorist financial controls; the new EU foreign policy fund, which we will debate a little later; and consular issues. There are 11, for a start. So please could we examine much more carefully the assertion, which the Bill tries and fails to underpin?</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08050616000012"></a>The truth is that Mr Stubb highlights our fundamental concerns on this matter very well. He wants a Europe with a lead role on the world stage&#151;a place in the sun, as it were&#151;and a single voice about foreign policy. That is his conviction and, from his point of view, he is perfectly entitled to hold it; but from our point of view  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_461"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the thinking is flawed. The wide range of overseas issues are such that the interests of member states vary&#151;and properly so; it would be very odd if it was otherwise. On some they come together and member states operate beside each other and, on others, they differ. It depends entirely. The idea that we can rely on our European partners always to promote our interests and maximise our contribution to world peace and stability&#151;which is potentially a very great one&#151;has been shown to be totally unsound.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08050616000013"></a>On the humanitarian side&#151;and we shall debate later overseas development aid and support&#151;once we had transferred a large part of our aid and development budget to the European institutions, the is much more toward the Francophonie. As we know, the interests of the Commonwealth, which is the potentially most powerful network in the modern world, with the rise of Asia, and one in which we have a centre, have been largely neglected in European development negotiations, while those of other countries with ex-colonial links, such as Spain, Portugal and France, seem to be in a much stronger position to develop theirs.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08050616000014"></a>The treaty calls for an,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000113"></a>&#147;ever-increasing degree of convergence of Member States' actions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000090"></a>in foreign policy. Those are the words out of the constitutional treaty&#151;in other words, out of this treaty. Our foreign policy belongs in a networked world and, with the rise of Asia, has new needs and requires new platforms. We must have the flexibility to meet these entirely new conditions, which is why Amendment No. 15A is particularly important and one to which we should at least give some support, to give us the room to manoeuvre in this new world. The idea that we should have to consult the European Union Council on virtually every move before we take it, even when our direct security interests are affected in a new and original way, is unacceptable. We will no doubt come to that in more detail during the debate.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08050616000015"></a>This is why the amendment needs to be moved. The amendments raise fundamental issues about how Europe can benefit its member states&#151;and we are part of Europe&#151;and how we can see the European region as something with which we want to be intimately concerned, as well as how, at the same time, we can have the freedom to operate in the networked world of foreign policy, which is different to the one in which the EU or the European Community before it was originally conceived. We need to raise our game, lift up our eyes to a different and modern world and develop foreign policy instruments that suit the world to come and not the world of yesterday. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08050616000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, referred to one amendment as a wrecking amendment. I thought that most of the amendments to the Bill were intended to  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_462"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be wrecking amendments. Certainly I take Amendments Nos. 113 and 165 in the group as being wrecking amendments to the treaty; that is part of the game we are all playing.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08050616000018"></a>Since I expect that our UKIP friends will quote a whole range of obscure documents which they say prove various consequences and so on, I have checked since our last Committee day one or two things that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, said. He quoted from an LSE paper. It took some time to trace it because it had only the loosest possible association with the LSE. It was actually written by two retired Israeli mathematicians, one of whom taught at King&#146;s College, London, until 20 years ago, but is loosely associated with the LSE voting power and procedures project. I will quote from it&#151;and I have discussed this with Professor Machover, one of the authors. In the first page of the paper published by a small Brussels think tank four years ago, it says that the new voting rules will be,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000114"></a>&#147;to the advantage of the four largest states&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000091"></a>and disadvantage the smaller states below that. Britain is one of the four largest states, so that does not seem to me to support the arguments made.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08050616000019"></a>I have not only read the other paper but have discussed it in e-mails with members of the research team at Sciences Po. It is true that selective statistics will take you a long way; the paper says that the speed of decision-making has increased since enlargement but the number of legislative Acts&#151;the quantity of legislation&#151;has substantially declined. You can prove or disprove a certain amount with statistics. One has to congratulate Open Europe and all those organisations with the immense care they take to trawl through all this academic work.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08050616000020"></a>Underlying differences on European co-operation on foreign policy lie behind these amendments. These Benches see closer co-operation with France and Germany as central to British foreign policy, and the European Union as the most useful framework through which to work. The Conservatives, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, have made clear, see close co-operation with China as more important to British interests, and the Commonwealth as the most useful multilateral framework. Perhaps in his wind up he will explain whether a future Conservative Government will invite China to join the Commonwealth as a basis for closer co-operation between Britain and China in Africa, on which our interests are so clearly closely aligned.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08050616000021"></a>I am puzzled by the Conservative Party&#146;s foreign policy in this respect. I recall a number of Conservative Foreign Ministers working extremely constructively for closer European co-operation in foreign policy. I refer, for example, to the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, who in the British presidency sponsored in 1990-91 a report on closer foreign policy co-operation; I also refer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, and the noble Lord, Lord Hurd. The Conservative Party at that point recognised that the intergovernmental procedures for concerting European foreign policies were very clearly in Britain's national interest. I am sorry that in opposition since 1997 the Conservatives seem to have forgotten that.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08050616000022"></a>Some of these amendments go further than that. Amendment No. 113 of the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, has echoes of the unilateralism of the Bush Administration&#151;the reputation of commitments made in the national interest by a previous Government. Those most unilateralist in the Bush Administration&#151;Vice-President Cheney and others&#151;would wish to repudiate most international obligations to which the United States has been subject, including many obligations to the United Nations, the Geneva Convention and so on. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, does not wish for a Conservative Government to go quite that far in that direction.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08050616000023"></a>Amendment No. 165 seems to me&#151;again this is a Front-Bench Conservative amendment&#151;to be a defence of absolute sovereignty. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, made clear, that involves no permanent allowances for Britain and balance of power politics&#151;we shift from one set of temporary alliances to another, as good old England did in the 18th century. That is a very long way from where we are now. Closer co-operation for all countries is what we need to manage an increasingly complex and interdependent world, networked or not. The European security strategy&#151;produced, as it happens, by a British author some years ago&#151;was a useful focus on the ground on which we can build closer European co-operation. The institution of a higher representative for common foreign and security policy has provided us, particularly in the Middle East, with the ability to have a stronger European voice on a range of multilateral matters. The European Union External Action Service will also be of interest to Britain. The <I>Daily Telegraph&#151;</I>that journal of record for Eurosceptics&#151;noted on Saturday that Britain currently has resident UK representation in 139 of the 192 member states of the United Nations; that is, 53 states in which we do not currently have resident British missions. The European Union External Action Service will be very helpful in providing some resident missions in those additional 50 states.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08050616000024"></a>The paranoia of Conservatives might be increased if I admit to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that Alex Stubb is a former student of mine&#151;and, even worse, a former student of my wife. He received his PhD from the London School of Economics. Before that he was a student in the United States. He is an extremely bright young man who has a very clear idea about how European and Atlantic co-operation work and how closer collaboration is what we all need to be moving towards. Co-operation between European states on Iran has been highly constructive. The record in the Western Balkans&#151;in very different circumstances&#151;has been good. Common actions in Africa have been effective. We need now to develop further co-operative foreign policy towards Russia and&#151;pace the noble Lord , Lord Howell&#151;towards China. It is in Britain&#146;s national interests. The Conservative Party does not seem to understand that these are in Britain&#146;s national interests, but I would suggest that the Conservative Party does not, at present, have a coherent foreign policy or a coherent European policy. We therefore resist these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08050616000026"></a>If this is going to happen, we are told that the EU missions will issue visas. Are they going to be issuing British visas? How are they going to be promoting, for instance, our trade interests, our defence interests and things like the British Council? You can be sure that if the Treasury sees any chance of closing our missions&#151;on the grounds that there are these splendid new missions&#151;it will. To some extent there will be an argument for it doing so. But foreign relations are bilateral relations between two countries. Of course we need what we are also being offered, but we do not need it instead of our existing, and very important, bilateral relations. There is a real danger in this regard. For instance, there are already around 7,000 EU people in special delegations around the world, and there will be a lot more. This will probably cost a lot of money. In a mission, are a Bulgarian, a German and a Finn really going to think, if there is a major trade opportunity, &#147;We must rush and tell the British&#148;? Are they going to be able to look after our defence interests? Are they going to be able to look after our cultural interests? It would not be reasonable to expect them to do so. I have considerable anxiety about the muddle that will result from having a situation where everybody is milling about, but nobody really knows who is responsible. I find it very difficult to imagine that we could issue British passports&#151;or visas for that matter&#151;in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08050616000027"></a>We are told at some stage&#151;I cannot remember where&#151;that the EU mission will be responsible for looking after our people if there is an emergency. I am sure that they would wish to do so, but there will be a lot of other citizens from other EU countries whom they will have to look after. They will not have the Navy or Army to do it. I can assure you&#151;as somebody who has been responsible for getting people out of difficult countries&#151;you have to have contacts with the police; you have to have contacts with the rebels or the putative rebels. I am not at all sure that an interesting, intelligent EU mission, without any real rooted relationships of that kind, would be able to do what a mission needs to do. I cannot help feeling that ordinary English people will get a bit worried if they feel that they may turn up in a country where there is no British representation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08050616000028"></a>Unfortunately, it would apparently make a lot of sense for us to close our missions and use the EU, but it would not in the end make a lot of sense: it would be a very dangerous thing to do. I cannot help feeling that the ordinary man in the street needs to understand that. That is why I feel deep concern about the prospective EU foreign service, although I am sure that its intentions are excellent. However, it is not the same as having a mission of our own that has long-standing relationships with the countries.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08050616000029"></a>I shall give a final example. Let us suppose that in Argentina we have an EU mission and we decide that we do not need a British mission&#151;we may even lead on that&#151;and that the EU as a whole decides that the right thing would be for the Falklands again to become the Malvinas. What are we going to do about that? It will be a very difficult situation. I therefore believe that we must think about the practical consequences of what are otherwise admirable ideas.</p>

It is said that before an individual dies, their whole life flashes before their eyes. I have that sense now. For 11 of the 18 years we spent in opposition, I was Front-Bench Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, and I used to parade around television and radio studios talking to diminishing audiences about the intricacies of European legislation. I therefore feel back home again in this desert of European-itis, hearing almost exactly the same arguments. They go back to 1981, when I became a junior foreign affairs spokesman under my noble friend Lord Healey. I had been sacked as a defence spokesman because the whole team was not unilateralist. I then became shadow Minister for the Navy, and was consigned to the foreign affairs team under my noble friend Lord Healey. My noble friend Lord Anderson was part of that team and we were once asked how we divided up the work. I remember saying, &#147;It&#146;s actually quite easy. Denis does everything and we do the rest&#148;. However, my noble friend Lord Healey did not do Europe, so I got it almost from the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08050616000031"></a>From the Opposition Benches, I saw through the Single European Act&#151;the biggest raft of Community legislation that these House of Parliament have ever passed. It was a most integrationist of Bills. I remember that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, voted for the Second Reading of the Single European Bill. I know that he found himself absent for subsequent stages of the Bill, but he certainly voted for it on Second Reading.</p>

I was one of the Ministers who were concerned with that Bill, as it then was, which contained perfectly clear measures limited in scope for the advantage of this country in trade policy. That was a clear, closely defined Act in which our interest was preserved. We used qualified majority voting to overcome the veto of our allies&#151;the French in particular&#151;against anything that would liberalise European trade. I would do the same again now, but I would not do it for foreign policy.</p>

The biggest extension of qualified majority voting since the treaty of Rome was established, and we saw that through. The noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, was a great proponent of the Single European Act, although she claimed afterwards that Malcolm Rifkind had confused her at the time. I thought that I was turning the same green as the Benches as we spent nearly a year dealing with the Maastricht treaty, which took us decisively into the realms of foreign policy. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, was part of the unofficial Opposition on the Government Benches at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08050616000034"></a>I have heard before all the doom-laden prophecies of what would happen and I am hearing them again today. The reality is that in this world we need more Europe, not less. We need more unified voices on the complicated issues that face us all. I refer to the non-military threats that we face&#151;we have a subsequent debate on military aspects. The list of challenges that we face includes terrorism, organised crime, economic instability, problems of migration, the effects of climate  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_466"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 466</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>change and trafficking in narcotics, people, guns and cigarettes. None of these can be tackled, handled or managed properly on a single nation basis; therefore, the collective action of the European Union&#151;the 26 nations which have voluntarily come together&#151;makes absolute common sense. These are discrete issues that affect every citizen of this country; it is right and proper that the European Union should strive for a common policy on them, articulate that policy in as many avenues as possible and then do something about it.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08050616000035"></a>Much is made of what the Lisbon treaty says about the achievement of a policy. The new, consolidated treaty says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08050616000100"></a>&#147;Within the framework of the principles and objectives of its external action, the Union shall conduct, define and implement a common foreign and security policy, based on the development of mutual political solidarity among Member States, the identification of questions of general interest and the achievement of an ever-increasing degree of convergence of Member States&#146; actions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000092"></a>In a world where we face the kind of challenges that I have outlined&#151;and that was not an exhaustive list&#151;it seems eminently sensible and in the self-interest of the people of this country that we act together when we can, and diverge on the limited occasions when we believe that it is necessary.</p>

<a name="08050616000036"></a><a name="80506-0006.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80506-0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08050616000127"></a>Lord Lamont of Lerwick:</b> I support Amendments Nos. 13A, 15A and 165. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, described these as &#147;wrecking amendments&#148;. I make it clear that I support these &#147;wrecking amendments&#148; in a spirit of inquiry. In order to get answers to questions, it is necessary to have as wide a debate as possible. May I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, that his life is not about to end? I think that he will be able to witness his party, in opposition, repeating many of these arguments again and again in future.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08050616000037"></a>Eurosceptic I might be, but I have no problem with the idea of a common foreign policy, provided that it is based on genuine, shared interest. It seems absolutely natural that people who are geographical neighbours, countries of the same land mass, are bound to develop common concerns in foreign policy and in defence. I have always felt that, within the European Union, co-operation both on foreign affairs and defence is right, provided that it does not cut across our relations with the United States which, realistically, will provide much of the defence equipment and the support we need. However, the assumption that our interests will always converge is only that&#151;an assumption. So is the wonderfully rhetorical phrase &#147;ever-increasing convergence&#148; of interests. They will not necessarily converge. For that reason, I suggest that a common foreign policy should not be a straitjacket, because there are likely to continue to be differences between us and our neighbours. That is why I support Amendment No. 15A, which concerns that part of the treaty that says we should consult before taking any action that could conflict with EU interests.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08050616000038"></a>The great hesitation that I have about an EU common foreign policy is that it seems that so often an EU foreign policy is just rhetoric; it is so often just the lowest common denominator. A very good example of that happened the other day, when the Foreign Secretary made an announcement about Kosovo in the House  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_467"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 467</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Commons, which he called an EU initiative. I have no doubt that the EU is doing certain things&#151;I know that it is&#151;in terms of offices, financial help and preparation with the relationship between Kosovo and the EU, but to call it a great initiative and advance in foreign policy, when there is a profound division within the EU about whether one should even recognise Kosovo, seems to be ignoring reality. A number of countries in the EU will not recognise Kosovo, including important countries such as Spain.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08050616000039"></a>Iraq was another example of where there was absolutely no agreement within the EU; I am told that Iraq was hardly discussed at a formal EU level. Perhaps if there had been a common foreign policy we would have been constrained and would have avoided a very ghastly mistake, but I would not want to constrain our action for that reason and that reason alone. It seems to me that EU foreign policy is too obsessed with process rather than substance and that it would be far better to concentrate on implementing what we have got rather than always building new structures. It is right that we should examine those structures, and it is right that there should be wrecking amendments, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, called them, to find out just how constrained our foreign policy is or is not.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08050616000040"></a>As my noble friend Lord Howell said, it is important that foreign policy should not be justiciable and that it should be decided on a unanimous basis; I very much welcome Article 10C and what it says about that. Then you have the areas, as my noble friend Lord Howell pointed out, where the ECJ can adjudicate between the CFSP and external policy. There must be some doubt about that, because the Government got a declaration about foreign policy into the treaty, showing that&#151;as in other areas such as the European Charter of Fundamental Rights&#151;they are saying, &#147;Oh, this is fine, this is watertight, this is absolutely secure; but just in case it is not, we also have a declaration&#148;. I think that we are right to pursue these things.</p>

<a name="80506-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08050616000041"></a>How is the office of the high representative different in substance from the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs in the constitutional treaty, which Mr Hain was very keen should not happen? He did not want there to be two posts, one for external affairs and one for foreign affairs, but they were merged in this treaty. The high representative will chair the foreign affairs council, even though he is a member of the Commission. That was something that Mrs Beckett tried to take out of the treaty at the last minute at Lisbon, and yet it is there. Why is that important? Surely it is just a minor point. Not at all, because to some extent it compromises the pillared approach that was in Maastricht; the approach that said that foreign affairs ought to be intergovernmental. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said that we on this side seem to be forgetting our enthusiasm for intergovernmental co-operation; not at all. Our amendments are tabled precisely because this treaty appears to take us a little bit away from intergovernmental co-operation to something that is much more supranational.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08050616000042"></a>Then there is the relationship between the high representative and QMV. I know that we have a separate batch of amendments coming up on that, which I will not talk about. Article 31 of the consolidated treaty  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_468"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lists a whole series of areas where QMV could come into being. There are the passerelle clauses. There is also the provision under the treaty whereby, if the Council unanimously asks the high representative to frame a policy proposal, that proposal can be subject to QMV. You can ask, &#147;What is wrong with that; it is initially by unanimity, but it later becomes QMV?&#148;. That means that a Government have to take a position early on in the process on whether something is in the national interest. One can easily envisage circumstances in which a view might change as a situation in the world develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08050616000043"></a>Lastly, I strongly support what my noble friend Lady Park said about the external&#151;I nearly said eternal&#151;action service. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred to the usefulness that it could have in countries where Britain was not represented, but it will not exist just in countries where Britain is not represented. As my noble friend said, in many countries there are already lavish EU embassies. That is how they are regarded; the heads of mission have diplomatic status. It is not so long ago&#151;and I shall not embarrass him&#151;that I was in one major Asian country where late at night the ambassador sat me down, gave me a whisky, and said, &#147;Could you explain what on earth the EU embassy is doing here? Does it protect British citizens when arrested? Is it promoting British trade? Does it help people following some natural disaster? What is it and all its staff doing?&#148;. There is already ridiculous duplication. There is not enough focus on the external representation that the EU already has with the many offices&#151;even those for small business creation&#151;all over the world in countries such as India. This is among the most lavish provisions that are wholly unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08050616000044"></a>That is not the main point that I support in the amendment. The main points are those that probe whether the treaty is as watertight as the Government maintain. That is difficult to believe when they worked so hard at the convention and late at Lisbon to take out provisions that now remain in it.</p>

<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="08050616000045"></a><a name="80506-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80506-0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08050616000128"></a>Lord Anderson of Swansea:</b> The noble Lord&#146;s argument had a certain contradiction. He talked about the danger of our being put in an EU straitjacket in terms of foreign policy, yet he referred to Kosovo and Iraq where there were clear differences in national perceptions. Those differences remain. Clearly the declaration to which the noble Lord referred clarifies the position, but it was put in effectively as an abundance of caution.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08050616000046"></a>I gladly follow my noble friend Lord Robertson of Port Ellen. We had many happy times together during the 1990s in my noble friend Lord Healey&#146;s team, when it was said that he was like one of those great African trees which spread its branches so wide that nothing grew under it. My noble friend Lord Robertson is perhaps the exception to that. Rather like a bad film, I have the view that this is where I came in, as there seems to be something of a whiff of the latter-day Bourbons who have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing about the European Union. The EU has indeed moved on and is a very different creature from the subject of our debates in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_469"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 469</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08050616000047"></a>I also follow with a certain puzzlement what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, about the Commonwealth. It is a magnificent obsession, but my memory goes back to the 1980s when the then Conservative Government almost destroyed the Commonwealth by their policies on South Africa. Only latterly have they discovered the Commonwealth, and I refer noble Lords to the speech of Don McKinnon, the outgoing Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, who had a far more realistic vision of what the excellent Commonwealth can do. I speak as someone who chaired the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK branch for four years and considered myself a Commonwealth man even during the 1980s when the Conservative Government were pursuing policies that almost destroyed that same Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08050616000048"></a>It is clear that the opposition Front Bench has a view of the European Union as minimalist, if at all, and one that is out of step with our partner countries. I can envisage very great damage to our national interests if the Conservatives were to move into government because of how we would yet again become isolated in Brussels. There would be a constant tension between the realists and the fundamentalists; those who have a fairly realistic view of where our interests as a country lie and the fundamentalist, bitter-enders. It is absolutely clear that, for a great swathe of foreign policy, our interests and those of our European partners largely converge. One thinks, for example, of the Balkans, climate change and a whole range of issues where our policies as Europeans are rather closer than those between Europeans and our great partner, the United States.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08050616000049"></a>What also puzzled me about the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, was that he was far more ready to accept the view of one Foreign Minister&#151;the Finnish Foreign Minister&#151;than the considered views of the House of Lords European Union Committee. It investigated in great depth and heard evidence from a wide range of witnesses. It is not a committee of Euro-enthusiasts or fanatics, but an all-party committee. In <I>The Treaty of Lisbon: </I><I>A</I><I>n </I><I>I</I><I>mpact </I><I>A</I><I>ssessment</I>, it concludes at paragraph 7.16:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08050616000101"></a>&#147;These changes to the structure of the Treaties serve to consolidate, streamline and clarify the provisions on the EU&#146;s external relations. They do not change the overall objectives of the EU&#146;s external policies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000093"></a>At paragraph 7.36, it concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08050616000102"></a>&#147;The evidence is that the Lisbon Treaty has preserved the independence of the UK&#146;s foreign and defence policy, subject to the constraints arising when unanimous agreement does prove possible. The fundamental principles of the CFSP will not change under the new Treaties. In particular, the principle of unanimity and the search for consensus in decision-making will continue to apply to the CFSP&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000094"></a>In my judgment, those clear quotations speak for themselves. Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Robertson, proposed, there is a case for far greater co-ordination of EU policies and greater working together, particular in fields such as energy policy where we now see how we are being disadvantaged in respect of Gazprom and the Russian policies as a result of the pursuing of independent national policies by so many of our partner countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08050616000050"></a>Our foreign policy interests are infinitely strengthened by working together in areas such as Iran. The noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, is perhaps unaware of the degree of co-operation that currently exists at all levels between the European Union representatives and national governments on what will be called the EU External Action Service; from first secretary through to regular meetings at ambassadorial levels, where joint representations are made and our clout is far greater because we are members of the Union.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08050616000051"></a>Finally, the Opposition show a certain lack of confidence overall in ourselves as British people in the European Union and in the leading role which we have already played. They continue to view the European Union almost as if it is a hostile country which we are afraid to get close to. It is indeed in our interests to play a far more positive role within the European Union. I hope that every Member of the Committee looks carefully at the considered conclusions which the House of Lords European Union Committee drew, having carefully examined all the evidence before us.</p>

Above all, I agree with his puzzlement about the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford. I cannot work out whether I was more depressed or frightened by hearing the arguments put forward by those on the anti-European side opposed to closer European integration on foreign affairs and defence. I think I was more frightened overall because the arguments bear no relation to the changing world in which we are living or, above all, to the new threats that the nations of the European continent and the European Union are now facing. My puzzlement and bewilderment is about the strange positions taken by old friends. I have always had a very high regard for the voice of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, on matters related to foreign affairs. I have always respected him, so it comes as something of shock to hear him mouthing the same arguments&#151;indeed, sometimes even the same words&#151;as Mr William Cash down the corridor in the other place.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08050616000053"></a>However, I agree with him about one thing. At the end of his speech he said&#151;I think I quote him precisely&#151;that we need,</p>
<ul><a name="08050616000115"></a>&#147;foreign policy instruments that suit the world to come and not the world of yesterday&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050616000095"></a>That is where I find his arguments so extraordinarily deficient because the arguments that I hear advanced are arguments that come out of a vacuum and are completely unrelated to the reality of the new threats that we now face. They bear the same sense of importance as Nero would have recognised regarding his fiddle case as the flames leapt higher outside or the same sense and understanding of the strategic threat that we face as informed those who designed the defences of Singapore and put the guns resolutely facing out to sea while the enemy came from behind. I wonder whether people have been to Washington recently. Do you often hear the word &#147;NATO&#148; there? Do you often hear the word &#147;Europe&#148; there? No, you do not. Washington&#146;s obsession these days is one thing: homeland

If you are relevant to homeland defence, you are relevant, and Europe is not. Indeed, the European Union is regarded as a collection of countries that failed to come to the aid of their primary ally in its hour of pain in Iraq and failed to come up to the plate when it meant fighting our common enemy in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="80506-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08050616000054"></a>Europe will occupy a much less important position in the pantheon of American interests in the future than it does today. I suspect that the new American Administration, whichever side they come from, will re-establish positions with Europe and improve relations. I welcome that. But the reality is that the United States is looking elsewhere in the world and the European Union and the Atlantic relationship, which will always be there, will be far less important than they were. Let us take a look at one fact. How many US soldiers are there today on the mainland of the European Union? How many US tanks are there? There are almost none. There are now 30,000 US servicemen in the European Union today, but almost all of them are manning the airbases that America finds it convenient to use to prosecute its war in Iraq and Afghanistan. I do not complain about that; it is a fact of life; but the reality is that the American security guarantee under which we have sheltered for so long and under which many European Union nations have abandoned the need for a strong defence, which I greatly regret, is not going to be there in the future in the way that it was in the past. If we in the European Union do not understand that the consequence of that is that we should deepen the integration of our foreign policy and defence institutions rather than weaken them, we are fools. We do not understand that realignment.</p>

I do not see a contradiction between the two. One of the ways we will refurbish and renew the Atlantic relationship is to strengthen the integration of the European Union, not diminish it, to make ourselves more effective, not less effective. We are not dealing with just a retrenching United States; everybody knows that we are also dealing with a more assertive Russia under a muscular new president who has found new leverage in the form of energy. If there is a clear example of how we fail if we deal with Russia on an issue as a fractured series of nations, each negotiating a bilateral treaty, it is energy because our failure to speak with a single voice has given Putin more leverage than he would otherwise have and diminished our bargaining power. We are not without bargaining power in the energy debate. Russia needs our markets and our investment quite as much as we need its oil. There are only two existing pipelines&#151;a third is being built to China&#151;and both of them come to Europe. However, the fact that we completely fail to speak with a single voice has increased enormously both the political leverage of Putin on this issue and the pain that we suffer in consequence.</p>

We are not dealing with just an assertive Russia, but a rising China, a nation that is becoming more and more important. I happen to believe that China&#146;s ascent will not be smooth. It will not be a relatively easy rise. It will have to come to terms with the need to democratise its society following the liberalisation of its economy. However, there is no doubt about where China is going to end up&#151;as a nation immeasurably more powerful than any single European Union nation and probably more powerful than the European Union put together. If we do not understand that in the face of these new powers&#151;China is only one; India is following&#151;the right reaction from Europe is not to weaken the integration of our foreign policy and defence, but to deepen it, we are fools.</p>

It is not impossible that we will wake up within the next 15 years and discover that we are not among the world&#146;s first economies any longer, but among its second tier ones. Imagine what that will mean for the governance of our countries. In the face of that, do we seriously believe that we want to consign ourselves to the role of little corks bobbing along in the wake of somebody else&#146;s ocean liner rather than integrating Europe to give us all a stronger voice, integrating and pooling our sovereignty on some of these key issues on which the decent lives of our citizens depend? If we do not understand that the right response to those circumstances is not to weaken the integration of our foreign policy, security and defence, then we are fools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08050616000058"></a>We are looking at a whole new different shape to world affairs. We are not looking at a world dominated by a single super power&#151;a mono-polar world&#151;but at a multi-polar world. It will no longer be good enough to shelter behind the apron strings of our neighbouring super power and say that that is a foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08050616000059"></a>The great British Foreign Minister, George Canning, used to talk about the European areopagus in the middle of the 19th century, the concert of powers in Europe&#151;the five sides of powers in Europe. He said that Britain should always seek to counterbalance any coalition of others in order to preserve the equilibrium of the concert of Europe. In so doing, the peace of Europe was kept for 50 years and Britain was kept out of continental armed entanglements for more than a 100 years. That is much more like the world that we are going to look at and that we are going to be in. If we do not understand that, in these circumstances, Europe will have to be much more independent and more subtle to be able to play its role among this multi-sided, multi-polar structure of world affairs and therefore that we should not weaken the institutions of our defence and foreign affairs, then, we are fools.</p>

<p><a name="08050616000096"></a>You do not have to listen very hard to hear the distant drummer and the sounds of feet marching. We are living in an extremely turbulent world, one in which we will be facing possibly mass movements and migrations in the face of, for instance, global warming and starvation; a world in which conflict will, I fear, be more, and not less, common and in which the threats to our civilisation, future and security, will be deeper and stronger than any we have experienced since the end of the cold war and maybe even more so than that. If we do not understand that in the face of such threats, the right response for Europe is to deepen the integration of our foreign and defence institutions, then, we are fools. The problem with the Lisbon treaty is not that it is too strong but that, in this matter, it is too weak.</p>

It was extremely kind of him to explain who Canning was. I am most grateful to him, in this place, for explaining such things in his speech. I hope it is a speech that he will make to our friends in Scotland at some stage, because it might almost be adapted to a defence of the union as well. I offer that to him. It is obviously a good speech and he should not just waste it on us again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08050616000062"></a>I also like to agree across the Floor of the House whenever I can. In particular, I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, when he said that the EU of today is nothing like the Europe of the 1980s and 1990s. I will say that and why my view of it has changed since then and why, although I supported the Single European Act, I opposed the Maastricht treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08050616000063"></a>It was the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, who said today that we need more Europe, not less. Would he ever say that we have had enough Europe&#151;that we do not need any more of it? That was the conclusion that I reached some years ago. I hope that he will follow me before too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08050616000064"></a>My remarks appertain principally to Amendment No. 113, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, saw as something quite extraordinary. Well, it is, in a way, extraordinary that it should be thought necessary to emphasise in this House that no Parliament should have the power to bind its successors. I thought that was something about which we all agreed, but not anymore it seems. Amendment No. 113 would reassert that but the treaty, as it is written today, does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08050616000065"></a>After all, our positions change from time to time. The European Union might take a position on foreign policy and subsequently wish to change it. Why not? Circumstances change. A British Government elected by the people of this country might come to a conclusion on foreign policy which falls into line with the conclusions of the European Union. However, what if, at a subsequent general election, that foreign policy issue is a matter of

Is it not right that the British people&#146;s decision should stand about what their country&#146;s foreign policy should be? Should we not be able to change that? Should a Government elected by the people be bound to a policy that had been repudiated at that general election? Amendment No. 113 is dedicated to a simple purpose, to make sure that that could not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08050616000066"></a>My noble friend Lady Park raised the issue of the Falklands. I remember very well indeed being at the Council of Ministers in Brussels in the week following the Argentine invasion of the Falklands. You had to shop around pretty hard to find any of my colleagues who supported what we were doing. The general view was, &#147;I suppose if you want to make this big gesture of sending the fleet, well, all right, but of course you won&#146;t do anything about it. It would be madness. It would be contrary to the interests of the world, particularly of Europe, to pick a quarrel with the Argentinians&#148;. There was one exception among my colleagues, one Minister who understood what we were doing: the French Minister. France unilaterally assisted us a great deal in the advice and information that it gave us about the Argentines&#146; Exocet missile capacity, but so far as the rest were concerned, forget it. They were more interested in their trade with Argentina than our interest in upholding the right of freedom of the Falkland Islanders.</p>

I am sure my noble friend will agree that whatever private doubts some Ministers expressed about the wisdom of some aspects of British policy, the European Union&#151;or the European Community, as it was then known&#151;very quickly imposed sanctions against Argentina and very quickly maintained a united front at the Security Council of the United Nations. It came as a great shock to the Argentinians to find that whereas there was no common front in Latin America, even countries in Europe which they had supposed would be sympathetic to them stood by Britain in trade and in the United Nations. I recognise that the Irish and the Italians deviated somewhat further down the road&#151;many people of Italian origin live in Argentina&#151;but at the moment that it mattered, our European partners rallied around us with sanctions and in the United Nations.</p>

They followed once we had acted. There would have been little chance of their doing so if we had been dependent on them to act or to allow us to act if they had the ability to prohibit us from acting. That was what I experienced on the ground. Again, it emphasises the fact that we must have the right to unilateral action at any moment, even in defiance of what our European colleagues want us to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08050616000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Robertson, also spoke of the time when his party was unilateralist. That emphasises the fact that all our parties change their views at times, and that it is important that we ensure that we do not produce a mechanism by which our parties can be, if not forbidden from changing their views, then prevented from implementing their change of view. That is the important thing about Amendment No. 113.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08050616000072"></a>The noble Lord reminds us that there could be changes in the politics of Europe more broadly under the stress of the economic problems that will be caused by the European single currency until there is one chancellor of the exchequer for Europe. We all know that a currency cannot have more than one chancellor. Those stresses will continue to bear heavily upon various countries in Europe. According to some on the left, Italy is veering towards a neo-fascist style of government again. There is much talk of neo-fascism on the Continent of Europe. I am not very comfortable binding my country and its foreign policy to countries over whose electoral fortunes we have no control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08050616000073"></a>I still believe that we should be an independent nation, and that there is a place for independent nations in the world. I do not take the view of the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, that that is all silly old stuff that belongs to the past and is sentimentalism. If a country cannot have untrammelled rights over its own foreign policy and to change that policy when it wills, it is not a fully sovereign nation. I support Amendment No. 113 to make that matter plain.</p>

I will have a glass of water. I may have to stop, but I am tempted to speak because the issue that underlies this debate is so fundamental. I shall speak about the European External Action Service. We in this House must recognise that in the European Union we are dealing with a very varied grouping of nations. If you come from a very small country, your belief that the European External Action Service can be in your direct national interest is perfectly understandable. It is extraordinarily difficult for small countries such as Estonia to be represented in all the countries of the world&#151;indeed, to be represented in anything more than the member states of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08050616000075"></a>When we consider the external aspect and almost all aspects of foreign policy, we must from time to time consider what it means to be a small member of the European Union. In fairness to such member states, they frequently look at what it means to be a large country with a proud, historical record&#151;and in our case a very large empire&#151;and with substantial armed forces. They realise that they will have to accept the recognition inside the European Union that large countries count for more than small countries. Of course that is  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_476"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not spelled out, but it is a fact with which people live very sensibly. Moderately sized countries must also accept that.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08050616000076"></a>I well remember how Greece faced many of the issues affecting the Balkans. It disagreed, sometimes in my judgment correctly and with better understanding of the problems of the Balkans than many of the larger states did, but it accepted that it was in a minority. Even though it disapproved of some of the actions over Kosovo, for example, it allowed troops to come up through Thessaloniki and into Macedonia, even though that was difficult for it politically. There are many other examples.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08050616000077"></a>I thereby come to the European External Action Service. As I understand it, this may be the only opportunity that we will have to discuss this question. Crucial to the service is the balance between people being under secondment from national Governments to it and those who come from the European Commission or Community institutions. If we are to keep common foreign policy predominantly intergovernmental, there must be a large element of secondment from the diplomatic services of the larger nations. I hope that this will be championed not just by the larger countries but by smaller ones, who will understand that the way to get the external service accepted is when it has to represent the fundamental elements of a common foreign service policy&#151;not integration, but representation of the member states. It is a mechanism for getting greater measures of agreement and it seems not unreasonable to introduce that at this stage.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08050616000078"></a>A common foreign policy is not a single foreign policy. In the parlance of the European Community, integration means a single foreign policy&#151;and I understand that there are people who want that. If there is genuinely compromise, agreement and consensus then it is preferable to have a united foreign policy, but we are not talking about a single foreign policy, and we have to examine carefully any aspect in this treaty that could lead to one. That is why we will come, in later debates, to what I consider the most important amendment; namely, that we could not have a common foreign policy inserted on this country by moving to qualified majority voting without substantive legislation through this House and through the House of Commons. I believe no other issue lying within our powers and which does not affect the treaty, yet is a fundamental issue for parliamentarians, is more important for us. On that motion, I hope that the Liberal Democrats will be voting as they voted in the House of Commons&#151;in favour of primary legislation, at least on that aspect of the passerelle clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08050616000079"></a>I come back to the external service, on which I hope that the Minister will feel able to explain some of the Government&#146;s thinking. Now, the service will of course be discussed inside the European Union; as I understand it, that will be under a qualified majority vote because it will come on a recommendation from the high representative, having discussed it with the Commission. I would prefer that it were a genuine consensus and had to have unanimity.</p>

This treaty is very difficult to understand, but if there will be unanimity on that then I very much welcome it. It means that the British Government can and should argue strongly that the predominant element of an External Action Service should not be as a European Union diplomatic service, but one that will predominantly come from the member states. If that is the case, then the British Government can maintain that position and&#151;since the Minister says that this is unanimous&#151;even if they find themselves in a minority of one I would expect them to hold out.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08050616000082"></a>I have found that in many cases, in negotiating on common foreign and security policy, British Governments had a perfectly sensible negotiating position that was then given up during negotiations. On this position, they must not give up. It is an essential element in keeping a common foreign and security policy predominantly intergovernmental, with some of the serious strength of the member states.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08050616000083"></a>Ultimately, a foreign policy requires on your capacity to back your words up with actions. That is why defence is secondary to foreign policy, which has to be able to call on defence and on the sacrifice of the citizens of an individual country who are ready to risk their life for what their country believes to be an essential element in its foreign policy. Take that away, and you have nothing that means seriousness in foreign policy. Without the capacity to threaten military action, as we have seen so often in the past, foreign policy ends up as mere words. Therefore, that stiffening of EU foreign policy requires a number of member states&#146; capacity to put their troops online for it. For that reason, each aspect of developing a common foreign and security policy has to reflect that it is predominantly intergovernmental.</p>

As we have heard, these amendments drive to the heart of the contradiction between, on the one hand, saying that we want to be part of an increasingly common European policy and, on the other, declaring that we have retained UK independence. It is not a question, as some have said, of whether we want to co-operate with other countries, for of course we want to do that. It is a question of whether we want to be bound into the particular form of treaty clauses and restrictions introduced by the treaty of Lisbon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08050616000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, set out a powerful analysis of how the world is changing. I, for one, would disagree with little of what he said about the sound of the drum telling us that the world has changed, but I completely disagree with the conclusion he draws there. In my view, that changing world makes it ever more important that we retain the flexibility to respond to countries around the world and to form alliances with them&#151;not to be bound into an outdated, centralist and inward-looking club designed for the world of the past century. That is why we have different views on how we should respond, not on the underlying issues with which we are trying to deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08050616000086"></a>The core question here is the extent to which we can retain our independence. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, quoted the House of Lords report effectively saying that the UK had retained its independence except in those areas where the EU had formed a common position. In the tortuous language of a consensus report, that is effectively what that sentence said; of course, if it is turned around the other way&#151;in a more common-sense way&#151;it actually says that the UK is constrained in its foreign policy, except in those areas where no common policy has been agreed by the European Union. The question then becomes: how much of our policy will be in the areas of common agreement, where we are constrained and no longer have the ability to pursue an independent policy?</p>

Whether it is a single or common foreign policy in that position, as I will go on to describe, we no longer have a level of freedom and independence. The other questions are how that position is determined and how it evolves over time.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08050616000089"></a>The Government would like us to believe that these areas of common foreign policy are few and far&#151;that they would be constrained to the peripheries and minor issues. As others have said, that is not the impression one gains from the treaty. The phrasing quoted about achieving an ever increasing degree of convergence in member states&#146; actions, and references to the ambitions of the External Action Service, make it clear that the intentions behind this treaty are that the European Union should increasingly command the major areas of policy issues in both foreign affairs and defence. The Government also stress that those areas where we will be part of a common foreign policy will largely be agreed by unanimity.</p>

By my count, it was one hour and five minutes before anybody in the Committee faced up to the difference between those two; now that my noble friend has set it out, I would hope that the debate can follow down that path. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, could start where we are now. Could he tell me which existing aspect of common foreign policy&#151;in the Balkans, to Iran, and so on&#151;he is dissatisfied with? If he is happy with them all, he can take comfort from the fact that that is how the European Union makes policy&#151;bit by bit and common element by common element.</p>

As the noble Lord well knows, those policies will not always be agreed by consensus. Article 31.2 of the consolidated text makes it very clear that once the Council has agreed a general strategic interest or objective, the specific decisions on actions and positions that follow from that will be taken by qualified majority voting.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08050621000003"></a>The agreement of a general strategic interest or objective in the Council of Europe late at night will be the subject of consensus drafting in order to reach agreement that will need many countries to sign up to statements about which, inevitably, they have some discomfort or doubt. But those statements emerge at the end of conferences as common positions. Under this treaty, once those statements have been put on the stocks as a common position, there will be freedom for the European Union to take actions or positions that extend those positions by qualified majority voting. That is the fact of the treaty. As my noble friend Lord Lamont pointed out, once the Council has asked the high representative to set out a position on an area, whatever he comes back to the Council with will be voted on by qualified majority voting.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08050621000004"></a>In a number of areas we have a ratchet built in&#151;a continual creep. The pressure will be for the UK to be a good citizen and to sign up to a general statement, not necessarily immediately, but perhaps one, two or three years down the road. It will form the base from which a decision can be taken by qualified majority voting. The problem&#151;and the reason why I insist that a common position can become a single position&#151;is that this treaty contains all the language which we have heard in the past requiring countries to abide by common policies once they are agreed. They would not be able to take any action, not to speak against them or to register any dissent once a common position has been stated. That is a very significant development in the extent to which these treaties bind us to a position where, ultimately, we may be constrained by countries with very different strategic and tactical interests to our own.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08050621000005"></a>Under Amendment No. 111, I should like particularly to draw attention to how that affects our position at the United Nations. As the treaty makes clear, when we have a common position, the UK must request that the European high representative presents that position to the United Nations. Again, the House of Lords&#146; report is very clear. It is not an option, a nice thing to do. If we have a common EU position, the UK must require that the EU representative presents that position at the United Nations. Where the EU has a common position, it is clear that when the EU representative addresses the United Nations he will be taken as speaking for Europe. That is his status and how he will be seen, not just in isolated areas, but increasingly in all the main topics where the EU, as we can see from this treaty, will seek to occupy the ground of representing a common position of Europe in the world as one of the superpowers.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08050621000006"></a>Yes, the UK can speak and has its own vote. But once the European representative has declared the European position to the United Nations, under these treaties the UK is bound not to dissent, not to oppose,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_480"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 480</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not to vote against and not to disagree even with the interpretation that the EU representative has given to the United Nations, even if, when that original common position was defined, the UK voted against under QMV, or if it were a decision taken by unanimity where the UK had abstained. As I see it, that is the threat to our ability to maintain an independent position to side with those countries with whom in the long run we may have a different interest on the world stage than the narrow interests of the European continent.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08050621000007"></a>If the Government believe that my concerns are unfounded, as I am sure that the noble Baroness will argue, my Amendment No. 111 offers them a clear way out. Unlike earlier amendments, my amendment does not require changes to the treaty or any change in anything that the Government have signed up to. I distinguish it from Amendment No. 112 on those grounds. It is purely a statement that the UK Parliament retains sovereignty over independence of UK foreign policy. If the Government can assure us that the UK has that independence, I am sure that the noble Baroness will be delighted to accept my amendment to make that clear to the Chamber.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08050621000008"></a>Amendment No. 113 addresses the related and very serious point made by my noble friend Lord Tebbit on the danger of a Government under these treaties binding a successor. The treaty appears to be a one-way street. Once a common policy has been defined, there is nothing that I can find in this treaty that allows a Government to dissent or to undo that common policy. As my noble friend has described, if a Government are elected who disagree with a number of policy positions taken by their predecessor and where they have had those endorsed at an election, there is no way that they can repudiate that position unilaterally. It is not like a country entering into its own treaties or agreements where a Government, if they so choose&#151;they may not wish to do that very often&#151;can change them. We will be bound into a common position by the European Union treaties where we have no facility under that treaty for a Government to change their mind. Any change would require the same legislative processes as we have described for introducing the change, which would largely be by unanimity, but, in many cases, by QMV. But we would not have the ability unilaterally to change our policy. These treaties undermine the important principle of no Government holding their successor into a straitjacket. There may even be Governments who of their own volition change their mind or find that circumstances have changed, but are not able to make that clear once they have signed up to a common European policy.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08050621000009"></a>I would welcome the noble Baroness the Lord President allaying my fears by saying where in the treaties it is explained how this situation would be dealt with. Assuming that she can do so, I am sure that she would be delighted to accept my amendment, which simply makes clear, as my noble friend Lord Tebbit said, that these treaties do not require one Government to be bound by another. I hope that the Government will allay all my fears by accepting Amendments Nos. 111 and 113. If the noble Baroness does not accept my amendments, I hope she will make clear how the Government can allay my fears.</p>

He was among that group of people who slogged through the chapter of the report from your Lordships&#146; European Union Committee on these issues, which agreed the position that we thought we had reached&#151;or at least I thought we had reached&#151;unanimously. The noble Lord says that he fears that this&#151;I repeat, this&#151;treaty compromises the independence of the United Kingdom in common foreign and security policy. I remind him that has put his name to paragraph 7.20, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08050621000036"></a>&#147;The Treaty will not change the scope of the CFSP or transfer any additional powers to the EU in this area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050621000031"></a>The section is clearly marked:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08050621000037"></a>&#147;EU powers in CFSP matters&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050621000032"></a>That is not a qualified statement; it is a sentence standing as it is which the noble Lord put his name to. The noble Lord has asked my noble friend the Leader of the House to assure him of independence. A moment of two ago from his Benches it was claimed that assurances of this nature, which actually appear in Declaration 13, are only evidence that the Government were not sure of their position. We have a very clear declaration in Declaration 13, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08050621000038"></a>&#147;The Conference underlines that the provisions in the Treaty on European Union covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the creation of the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the establishment of an External Action Service&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050621000033"></a>and here we come to the point&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08050621000040"></a>&#147;do not affect the responsibilities of the Member States, as they currently exist, for the formulation and conduct of their foreign policy nor of their national representation in third countries and international organisations&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08050621000034"></a>that is, the United Nations. Here is an unequivocal statement, agreed by all the members of the EU, which is not quite good enough for the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, and he wants my noble friend from the Dispatch Box to repeat it. She is very welcome to repeat it but I am not sure why, if he was not convinced by this in the first place, my noble friend is going to have any greater success and on his Benches some will claim that my noble friend doing that is only evidence of not being sure of the position in the first place.</p>

<a name="80506-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08050621000011"></a>Let us turn to the UN. The noble Lord said that where the EU has a unanimous common position, the UK will be required to request that the High Representative present that position. That is what we said in our report but the noble Lord left out the opening sentence, which he put his name to, where we said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08050621000039"></a>&#147;It is clear that the Treaty changes nothing in the UK&#146;s right to retain its seat on the UN Security Council, its role as a permanent member, its right to speak, and its individual vote and veto&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050621000035"></a>We went on to say that although we can invite the High Representative, that possibility does not displace the UK&#146;s right to speak or vote. The noble Lord could not have forgotten about those passages because he was there when we slogged out that wording. I am afraid he was very partial in forgetting what he put his name to.</p>

It would be unwise to tangle with her and I do not wish to do so. I want rather to state the other side of the argument which she effectively pointed to in her very eloquent intervention, and that is the significant argument for a common foreign policy. I take the points of distinction made by the noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Owen, between a single foreign policy&#151;which we are not at present talking about&#151;and a common foreign policy. In doing so, I hark back to what the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, said about the fact that the CFSP remains an intergovernmental structure and therefore one in which one has to seek the agreement of all to produce a single statement or a single policy. </p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08050621000018"></a>To go back to the importance of a common foreign policy, the key question is not whether after a common foreign policy has been agreed the countries that agreed it are bound to support it. That seems a very fundamental principle, like the principle of the collective responsibility of a Cabinet, even where some members may disagree with the decision reached by that Cabinet. The much more important point is whether a common foreign

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08050621000019"></a>My noble friend Lord Ashdown gave very powerful arguments in the military field for reaching common agreements to deal with some of the essential security considerations that we have to face. Incidentally, in that context it would be appropriate to point out the absolute necessity of such co-operation in dealing with terrorism, which no individual country could hope to deal with on its own. The same goes, in rather different ways, for organised crime, people trafficking and other areas, where no country defending its own borders can hope to have any impact on organised methods of getting around those borders and making them effectively unnecessary or dispensable.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08050621000020"></a>The point I want to make is a slightly different one. There are certain areas where the European Union has a very specific approach and one that the world badly needs. Let me state a couple of examples other than those which have already been presented by my noble friend Lord Ashdown. The first is very close to my heart&#151;nuclear proliferation and nuclear disarmament, probably the single greatest issue facing the world after that of climate change. We cannot hope to get anywhere as an individual nation state on issues of this kind, which necessarily require international agreement in order to be effective. To reach that international agreement there is nothing more effective than a grouping of countries which share common values and a common purpose.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08050621000021"></a>Let me give an example where there is a divergence between the European Union and our single most important and closest ally, the United States. The United States has so far found it impossible to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although the matter has been before the US Congress for more than 15 years, it has still not been ratified. That means that one of the great barriers against the further development of nuclear weapons into yet more and more effective and lethal mechanisms has been so far prevented by the failure to reach agreement. On something like the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty&#151;essential in limiting nuclear proliferation&#151;the compelling arguments of the European Union as a whole are far greater than that of any individual country, even our own, close as it is in many ways to the United States, if we are to move towards an agreement under which countries will begin to ratify that treaty. For example, the United States has in recent years come out in favour of the independent verification of test weapons and their development. It is clear that that does not work: one cannot have independent, national verification of the dangers of nuclear proliferation. I am delighted to say that the United States has changed its position and returned to accepting that multilateral verification is absolutely essential if one is to limit nuclear proliferation. However, there was a time when the United States strayed from that position into quite dangerous areas where others were only too inclined to follow, which is one reason why three nuclear-weapon powers are not signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and shows the importance in some areas of a common foreign policy.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08050621000022"></a>Another example is disarmament in the crucial area of small weapons. The Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva is still locked into unending arguments on small weapons, which have devastated Africa. Far more deaths have been due to small weapons than to weapons of mass destruction in the past 10 years. How does one then move towards international treaties that limit the trade in and supply of small arms? It is only by reaching agreement within international organisations such as the Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations. How does one do that without a powerful group of nations united in their determination to bring about an agreement of that kind?</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08050621000023"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, pointed out in his forceful speech, it is easy to see that, in some cases, only a common European position will advance the very things that, as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, said, the British public would like to see. They want to see security; they want to see peace; they want to see us move back from the danger of serious development of weapons of mass destruction. To do that, it is no good falling back on the independent foreign policy so eloquently described by various noble Lords, because it will not bring about the outcomes that we desperately need. They require a group of nations that are committed to pursuing them&#151;not every single issue in the world, but some of the key issues that can be achieved only by collective decision to move ahead. I plead, therefore, with those who are listening to this debate to recognise that a common foreign policy in some areas&#151;for our purposes, that must mean a common European foreign policy&#151;is essential to bring about the very purposes for which our Parliament in the House of Commons was elected, and which we in this Chamber believe is an essential responsibility of our presence here to further in every way that we can.</p>

It is obvious that compromises will from time to time be necessary, and the common position may not be the same as that which we would have wished the European Union ideally to have taken or which we would have taken if we were able to act alone. However, when one looks back over the experience of recent years, one finds that the extent to which common positions compromised the position with which we started when we were dealing with our European allies is infinitely less than has been the case when we have found ourselves dealing with our great ally, the United States. I agree with my noble friend Lord Lamont that nothing should drive us away from the United States and that our alliance with it is important, but we are not unique in wishing to have a close connection with the United States. Germany, France, Holland, Italy and every other state in Europe wishes to have that; it is not some British peculiarity. The position of the United States in the world is so powerful that everybody wishes to be closely connected with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08050621000025"></a>The Iraq experience has perhaps taught us that, while the French were unable to make much of an impact on the United States by seeking to prevent it

Both the French and the British have learnt no end of a lesson. If one wishes to influence the United States, which one does&#151;because it is obvious that nothing very much can happen in the world if the United States is not involved&#151;it is much more likely that one will be able to do so if we are singing from the same hymn sheet as our partners in the European Union. If there is more weight on the European end of the see-saw than we alone are able to put on it, there is more likely to be an agreement with the United States that runs closer to our interests than has perhaps been the case in the recent past.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08050621000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, drew a distinction between Britain&#146;s outward-looking interests and the narrow interests of our Continental allies. That theme runs through the speeches of many opponents of the European Union and of this treaty, but it is mistaken. Just as everybody wishes to have a close relationship with the United States, so one will see in the patterns of trade of France, Germany, Holland, Italy or any of the other trading nations in the European Union that they, too, wish to export a great deal to China, India and the burgeoning economies in the East. One will see that they, too, are seeking closer relations with the new powers in the Pacific area. Looking outward to Asia and the Pacific, again, is not some unique British characteristic; it is something that any right-minded European country wishes to do. It is a slightly backhanded compliment to the way in which the Chinese view Europe that it is the French in particular whom they have picked out for retribution over the mishaps of the Olympic flame, although the flame had pretty much as bad a time of it in London as in Paris. That perhaps shows that, in a certain way, the profile of the French in China is perhaps higher than ours. It is therefore false to draw a distinction between narrow Continentals and worldwide Britons.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08050621000027"></a>I agree that Britain must ultimately be able to act alone to preserve its right to independent action. But that is very much a last resort. If we find that we are unable to carry any of our friends in the European Union and are isolated in pursuit of an international objective, it might suggest, first, that our case is not as overwhelmingly strong as we would like to think and, secondly, that we are unlikely to be able to prosecute our position very successfully. We are much more likely, as the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, pointed out, to be able to pursue our objectives successfully in the world if we are able to do so in partnership with others. He and others here may remember that great American diplomat, George Vest, who at one time was the American ambassador to the European Union and ended his career as director-general of the United States diplomatic service or the State Department&#151;I cannot remember his precise title. He always used to talk about the habit of co-operation in the European Union and how effective it was in enabling countries to reach common positions even when they started some way apart. He was always impressed by the degree to which the constant communication and exchange of information and views between the members of the European Union enabled them to begin to see issues

That is how the European Union develops, not according to the rather hard and fast, black and white rules that the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, was talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08050621000028"></a>Finally, I take up a couple of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Owen. He made a very important distinction, which is not drawn often enough, when he talked about the difference between a common foreign policy and a single foreign policy. It is an important distinction and I am absolutely in agreement with what he said on that subject, and his point about the external offices of the European Union. The European Commission, both when I was a Commissioner and since, has sometimes been too enthusiastic about wanting to set up offices here, there and everywhere. They have a purpose. The ambassador who was kind enough to give my noble friend Lord Lamont whisky late at night could, perhaps, have devoted more of his energies to finding out what the European office did. Often, they run important aid programmes or deal with trade relationships. I remember when Sir Roy Denman was head of the European Commission office in Washington. He played an important part in multilateral trade negotiations, as I am sure my noble friend Lord Brittan would concur.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08050621000029"></a>At different times, the European Commission office in Japan has played an important role. Certainly, there has been a tendency to set up too many, with sometimes ill defined objectives. If we are moving forward with this external action force and having external offices, the noble Lord, Lord Owen, makes the point that their credibility will be enhanced if there is a strong representation from the larger European countries with the most experience of international relations and the most interests in the most far-flung parts of the globe. That would certainly be desirable. When one looks at the totality of the issues covered by these amendments, the treaty as it stands, though not perfect, enables the European Union to continue to develop.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08050621000030"></a>In conclusion, I refer again to the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell. He said that the European Union was designed for the last century. Yes, it was designed in the last century and it did very well in helping to preserve peace in Europe, in helping to encourage democracy in the member states, and in contributing to the spread of democracy and human rights over a far wider area of Europe than has ever been seen before. It was devised in the last century and it did very well in the last century. Now we are putting it into a position to operate equally effectively in this century. As the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, and others have pointed out, this debate should be about how Europe performs in the future, as well as how it has performed in the past.</p>

I make one or two points because this part of the treaty takes us a long way forward. I think I have taken part in every debate on every treaty since we signed the treaty of Rome in 1972. Therefore, I remember some of the things that were said. When we were discussing  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_487"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Maastricht treaty, when the issues of foreign policy and other matters were introduced, we were given the assurance that our essential sovereignty would not be affected because these matters would be considered on an intergovernmental basis. On those assurances, some of us felt reassured.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08050623000002"></a>What has gone wrong? Those assurances, apparently, were not good enough. Now foreign policy is no longer to be on an intergovernmental basis, but part of the treaty and part of the European Union. It is clear from the treaty that there is to be an ever-increasing degree of convergence of member states&#146; actions. The word &#147;convergence&#148; means getting towards a single objective. We have come away from intergovernmentalism and it is part of the treaty. We have a foreign minister, although he is called something different, the high commissioner for foreign affairs. He will chair the Foreign Affairs Committee. He is going to be deputy chairman of the European Commission, which is a powerful position. Make no mistake about that. Intergovernmentalism has collapsed. In certain circumstances we will be bound by decisions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08050623000003"></a>What is more, there is to be this External Action Service. I, too, over the weekend saw the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> article mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. According to that, it is going to be a very powerful External Action Service indeed. It will have 160 ambassadors, as they are to be called. Some politicians, perhaps even in our own Government, are concerned about the influence they will use abroad to the detriment of the influence that can be maintained by our own diplomats. What is the Government&#146;s attitude towards the setting up of the External Action Service before the treaties have been ratified by all member states? That, I understand, is what is happening at the moment. Discussions are taking place, either in private or in secret. I do not know what the difference between the two words is. What, exactly, is the Government&#146;s attitude towards this? It would certainly weaken our position if the growth of the European External Action Service undermined our own Diplomatic Service. Furthermore, the External Action Service, unlike our own Diplomatic Service, will be in some way accountable to the European Parliament. There is no way in which our Diplomatic Service, except through a Minister, is accountable to this Parliament. There are some worrying aspects to what is proposed.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08050623000004"></a>Why has it been necessary to go away from intergovernmentalism, into making this part of the treaty. What has not worked? Why can it not work? Will the Minister also say whether this is not yet another ratchet&#151;I have always talked about ratchets&#151;towards a single European state? People say, &#147;Well, of course it&#146;s not&#148;. But if it is not a ratchet towards a single European state, why are we collapsing the intergovernmental position, which most people had accepted? We will no doubt have further discussions on various matters in which we will ask why we need these changes. But I should like at this stage to know why intergovernmentalism has failed, why the new arrangements will not undermine Britain&#146;s ability to pursue an independent policy and whether our Diplomatic Service is safe from being undermined by ambitious European foreign diplomats.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08050623000006"></a>The amendment would leave out 10 words from amended Article 11 of the TEU&#151;the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08050627000001"></a>&#147;and shall comply with the Union&#146;s action in this area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050623000032"></a>Do the Government agree that those 10 words represent an advance in EU solidarity in the Council? The words that we had before, in the treaty of Nice, read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08050623000034"></a>&#147;Member States shall actively and unreservedly support the Union&#146;s common foreign and security policy in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050623000033"></a>That has been in the treaties for quite some time and is a pious hope of good intention and all the rest of it. But then the treaty says,</p>
<ul><a name="08050623000035"></a>&#147;and shall comply with the Union&#146;s action in this area&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08050623000007"></a>Member states are no longer representing their countries&#146; interests; from this moment on they are complying with the Union&#146;s actions, which are then reinforced by the actions of the new high representative, who is given new discipline in this area.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08050623000008"></a>I trust that noble Lords agree that that contribution was refreshingly brief. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s specific reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08050623000012"></a>To the noble Lord, Lord Owen, who is not in his place at the moment, I should say that I am conscious of how difficult it is to speak with such a bad throat. However, I am delighted that he was able to do so because the point that many noble Lords have raised, on which he specifically focused&#151;the difference between common and single&#151;was extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="80506-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08050623000013"></a>I do not intend to go over all the issues that have been well aired. I shall focus my attention on giving some comfort to those who have tabled amendments, although I am not sure that I shall entirely succeed. I have been very taken with the almost wistful way in which noble Lords have reminisced about their time&#151;either from those who sat on green Benches, as my noble friend Lord Robertson reminds us, for a year in deliberating on previous treaties, from noble Lords who had the privilege to represent this country at various Councils of Ministers, from those who have been involved in the Commission as Commissioners, or from those involved with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

But I hope to bring some clarification to those noble Lords for whom this is not their natural subject and offer some thoughts that noble Lords can deliberate on before we reach the next stage of our discussions.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08050623000015"></a>I should be clear at the beginning that it was with great wisdom that the Government in 1992 agreed to establish the common foreign and security policy. Without it we would not have had EU crisis management missions in Bosnia and Afghanistan or EU sanctions against Iran, which went beyond the position of the UN Security Council. I want to be absolutely clear that when we and other member states agree on a course of action at European Union level, it increases our influence, which is incredibly important in an increasingly interconnected world. The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, talked about the future and other noble Lords referred to it as well. This is a changing world; it is not the world of 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Through all the developments that we see and the way in which the world is on the move, whether because of starvation, climate change or conflict, we are increasingly interconnected and increasingly have to think of ways in which as nation states we operate together. When we do not agree on a course of action, however, we shall continue to act independently, as this country has always done&#151;and as it has always done under previous treaties, so it will continue.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08050623000016"></a>The motivation behind the treaty of Lisbon in putting forward these reforms is that member states want to improve the delivery of shared foreign policy objectives. What they are considering is based on the experiences that we have gained in collaboration over the years. I believe that the move in this treaty is to build on that shared experience and take us forward&#151;as I have already said, when we agree.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08050623000017"></a>Noble Lords referred to the beginnings of all this in the Maastricht treaty. However, long before the Maastricht treaty, when the intergovernmental pillar of foreign policy co-operation was established, policy and funding instruments under the European Community were important to the delivery of our foreign policy goals. Trade policy, development and enlargement are all examples of what one might describe as traditional Community activity, ultimately decided by the member states but largely delivered by the Commission, which can have a profound and important impact on how we deliver our foreign policy objectives.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08050623000018"></a>I question whether what one might describe as classic foreign policy tools could have helped the countries of central and eastern Europe towards a stable, democratic and increasingly wealthy and economically open status. The reform was driven by the prospect of eventual EU membership. A process delivered by the Commission was central to achieving that key objective of British foreign policy. When I spent time in Romania and Bulgaria before accession, discussing with the Justice and Home Affairs team in both countries ways in which we could support them to deal with issues with their courts, anti-corruption measures and collaboration on many issues, they were very focused on the opportunity  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_490"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that being part of the European Union would afford them for their future development, trade and economic and social well-being.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08050623000019"></a>We also see environmental policy in global terms, with market-based carbon trading, which is a Community competence and an important element in tackling climate change. The consequences of not tackling it have been discussed in your Lordships&#146; House during the passage of the Climate Change Bill and in many other debates. As we look at states emerging from conflict all over the world, we use both our own foreign and security policy instruments, delivered by member states and the Council, whether that is for policing or peace-keeping, combined with the longer-term tools&#151;development agreements that could be delivered by the Commission. If we are going to help to bring long-term peace, stability and prosperity, whether in Afghanistan, the Middle East or Aceh, we have to ensure that these efforts reinforce themselves in the most effective and efficient way.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08050623000020"></a>Improving the delivery of our foreign policy objectives through the European Union is a long-standing UK aim, to which all member states agreed at the Hampton Court summit during our presidency in 2005. I submit that it makes sense to bring these two ways of delivering external policy objectives closer together while respecting the fundamentally distinct intergovernmental nature of the common foreign and security policy. That is what the treaty does. CFSP remains intergovernmental and non-legislative. The decision making is by unanimity. European Court of Justice jurisdiction is excluded with two narrow exceptions. That is a clear and fundamental objective of what the treaty seeks to do.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08050623000021"></a>Perhaps I may give a couple of examples of where that greater coherence could make a difference. If one thinks of what is happening in the Middle East peace process, Javier Solana, the high representative, is engaged in political dialogue with the parties in pursuit of the EU common, foreign and security policy objectives set by member states. Two European security and defence policy missions are decided by the member states. The first looks at the border crossings in Gaza which are currently suspended; the second looks at Palestinian security reform and police training.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08050623000022"></a>At the same time the Commission under the EC treaty is engaged in activity to promote Palestinian economic development and institution building and provide funding to the Palestinian authority; and, of course, Mr Solana and the External Relations Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, both represent the EU in the quartet. The treaty will bring together these activities in a more coherent and effective manner. The high representative, in pursuit of the political priorities agreed by the member states in the European Council and the relevant Council of Ministers, is able to do that under the treaty. That is an important example&#151;I could give others&#151;of how the coherence within the treaty could make a difference.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08050623000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, talked about the role of the European Court of Justice. I know that we will return to that issue. The noble Lord quoted from my letter. Three words&#151;&#147;as at present&#148;&#151;were missing from the quotation. My letter says that the court may  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_491"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>police the CFSP/non-CFSP border. That is not new. That, as noble Lords who were involved will know, dates back to the Maastricht treaty. Interestingly, the treaty requires the European Court of Justice to make sure that there is no encroachment the other way; in other words, that non-CFSP policies cannot encroach into CFSP policies. I know that noble Lords have worried in the other direction, that maybe the European Court of Justice, for those who believe that it is a&#151;I quote&#151;&#147;creative court&#148;, would see it in that way. Actually the treaty says that it is very important that the European Court of Justice polices that border and ensures that there is no encroachment. So the treaty strengthens the ring-fencing of CFSP, and the European Court of Justice will, if necessary, be able to restrict any other activity that impinges on the CFSP.</p>

In our discussions on the previous day of Committee, when we referred to the European Court&#151;we will again, I have no doubt, in our discussions particularly on justice and home affairs&#151;we looked at examples. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, who is not in his place at the moment, as a former judge in the European Court of Justice, was extremely helpful in describing both the methodology of the court and the fact that it does not operate in a political fashion, but that a lot of the work of the Court in determining its role and function was established long before the UK joined the European Union. The noble Lord will know that for himself. Any suggestion that the Court was seeking to try to move beyond its role of interpreting the law was in the noble and learned Lord&#146;s view wrong.

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, said yes of course the Court advances the project of European integration because that is what it was always meant to do. That is what is in the treaty.

I have discovered in my days in Committee that interpretation is everything. As far as I am concerned noble Lords were divided in their interpretation. I think we go back to the words of the noble and learned Lord. He is not in his place at the moment, but I know that he intends to give us the benefit of further interventions. I am sure that he would indeed speak to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, about these issues. I am very clear that this is about the role of a court in interpreting the law as it stands,

We have already discussed the value of that. The point I make in this context is that I believe that the treaty helps to define the boundaries more effectively between the role of the Court in terms of non-CFSP and CFSP.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08050623000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, quoted an Open Europe allegation about the moves to QMV within CFSP. It is quite clear within the treaty that unanimity remains a general rule for CFSP. Implementing measures can be taken by QMV where the original decision has been unanimous; so if all 27 member states decide they want to do something they can then decide to implement it by QMV. That is our choice. We are not bound to do it; we do it because we want to do it. Unanimity is the determining factor on the decisions that we take.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08050623000029"></a>The Lisbon treaty has one case&#151;and noble Lords referred to it&#151;where the high representative returns with a specific request that has been given to him by the Council. It is not beyond the wit of this Government or another 26 governments to determine the precise boundaries of what the high representative will return with proposals on. Any noble Lord will know that as it will be a QMV decision, such proposals the high representative returns with will work only within set parameters and boundaries. Therefore they will make sure that those parameters and boundaries are set. As they are set by unanimity, we need to have no fear. We can point to examples. We talked about this in the context of our previous discussions where QMV can be an important tool to aid moving on and getting on with implementing decisions.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08050623000030"></a>The other cases cited by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, refer to non-CFSP action, where QMV already applies; for example emergency and humanitarian aid, and so on.</p>

The response was that that required unanimity. The reason I believe there may be some uncertainty about that is that the treaty says that the Council will act on a recommendation from the high representative in establishing an External Action Service. As the noble Baroness has said, elsewhere in the treaty it says that when the high representative is asked to come to the Council with a recommendation that may then be by QMV. I just want to be clear whether the Government have got precise legal interpretation on this point or whether there is scope for ambiguity.</p>

Amendment No. 13A calls for a report to be laid annually before Parliament certifying that nothing undertaken in pursuit of common policies and actions promoted in any international forum has restricted or will restrict the independent foreign policy of the UK. The CFSP is a tool which this Government use to further their policy aims. Where we agree unanimously

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08050639000004"></a>The declarations have been partly read out and partly cited, either to confirm that we have got this absolutely nailed or used, depending on noble Lords&#146; views, to suggest that we do not have it nailed at all. I shall read out the two declarations. These were agreed unanimously by all member states. Declaration 13 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08050639000094"></a>&#147;The Conference underlines that the provisions in the Treaty on European Union covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the creation of the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the establishment of an External Action Service, do not effect the responsibilities of the Member States, as they currently exist, for the formulation and conduct of their foreign policy nor of their national representation in third countries and international organisations.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08050639000095"></a>The Conference also recalls that the provisions governing the Common Security and Defence Policy do not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of the Member States.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08050639000096"></a>It stresses that the European Union and its Member States will remain bound by the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and, in particular, by the primary responsibility of the Security Council and of its Members for the maintenance of international peace and security&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08050639000005"></a>Declaration 14 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08050639000097"></a>&#147;In addition to the specific rules and procedures referred in to paragraph 1 of Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union, the Conference underlines that the provisions covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including in relation to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the External Action Service, will not effect the existing legal basis, responsibilities and powers of each Member State in relation to the formulation and conduct of its foreign policy, its national diplomatic service, relations with third countries and participation in international organisations, including a Member State&#146;s membership of the Security Council of the United Nations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000087"></a>I think that wording is crystal clear and that the UK&#146;s independent foreign policy is protected.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08050639000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, is not in her place, but she referred to the relationship between the External Action Service and the diplomatic services of existing European Union countries, particularly of ours. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, raised the same issue. We have had EU Commission delegations in third countries and international organisations since the 1970s. At the present time, there are 131 overseas delegations. They will be renamed Union delegations under the authority of the high representative. We believe that makes them more accountable through the high representative of the member states and ensures that they represent the Union as a whole&#151;as defined by the member states&#151;rather than those of just one of its institutions, in this case the Commission. It is about making better use of existing Union resources and better policy implementations. That will be an important element of how the service will bring together existing work that is going on. Of course we make clear in the treaty that the External Action Service shall work in co-operation with the diplomatic services of other member states. That is an important part of the work it will do. It will not be issuing visas for any other nation. It will be  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_494"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>working in collaboration with existing diplomatic services and consular services. It will not be in any way replacing them.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08050639000007"></a>The treaty is clear on the establishment of the External Action Service. The EAS establishment is by unanimity. If it is decided to go ahead and establish it, that will be how it is established. Again, that is clear within the treaty. When I was in Brussels a couple of weeks ago, I spent some time talking about the potential for the External Action Service in terms of the opportunity it will give to bring together the different elements of the service to provide a better service through member states and provide opportunities for diplomats from countries all over the European Union who want to spend time working in the External Action Service. I see this as nothing other than a great move. I see nothing ambiguous about it. It will be important in terms of the development of supporting the policies of the European Union. I hope that noble Lords will agree with that.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08050639000008"></a>Amendment No. 14 aims to exclude the UK from having to comply with EU action taken under the common foreign and security policy. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, spoke with brevity about this amendment. We have agreed by unanimity our policy in the Council. Of course, we want to see it delivered and respected by all member states, otherwise there is no point in agreeing it unanimously in the Council. If member states did not comply with what they had agreed, then the whole thing would be completely unworkable. That is just inexorable logic. The new wording requires that member states shall comply with the Union&#146;s action in this area. I would say that that is simply common sense. We have agreed something unanimously because we all want to do it. Therefore we all do it. That is it.</p>

<a name="80506-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08050639000009"></a>In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, about binding future governments, the noble Lord will know that it is a basic principle of international law that the signatories of a treaty respect the provisions of the treaty. That is why they have signed it. United Kingdom Governments, on coming into office, have always accepted the international obligations and rights which they inherit. To do otherwise would be to undermine, in my view, our international standing. There is nothing new in substance in any of this. The Maastricht treaty in 1992 stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08050639000098"></a>&#147;The Member States shall support the Union&#146;s external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000088"></a>It also made clear that member states were obliged to ensure that their national positions complied with the positions which they had just agreed in the common foreign and security policy. Of course, noble Lords who do not want us to be part of the European Union do not like that. I completely accept that. But the fact is, if you sign up to something you agree to it. It is as simple as that.</p>

The noble Lord asks the question in a very particular way and I am going to answer it in my own particular way. The long-standing tradition is that treaties that have been signed are respected by incoming Governments. That does not mean&#151;the noble Lord will know this&#151;that Governments do not on occasion go back to renegotiate their position. The noble Lord will know that when coming to power in 1997 this Government signed up to the Social Chapter, to which the previous Government had not signed up. So there are changes that are made. The tradition is that we come into treaties that we have signed up to. In the main, most of the treaties that this country is a part of are well respected on all sides and have often been negotiated through such long time periods that Governments have come and gone. The argument I am making is that that would be the position now. It is not a case that noble Lords would expect to come into a Government of a particular kind, who took a different view, and expect that that treaty was null and void. It would be required that a Government would have to renegotiate. I think that that is the position&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="08050639000015"></a><a name="80506-0010.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80506-0010.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08050639000355"></a>Lord Tebbit:</b> The noble Baroness is making a point about treaties. I am making a point about the policy which is to be carried out under a treaty. Those policies change from time to time under the European treaties, as she knows. I am not talking about repudiating the treaty. We know that we could repudiate the treaty of Rome if we so wished. It is the policy I am talking of, not the treaty.</p>

I was using the treaty as an example. The noble Lord is not incorrect in saying that if you look at the policies that follow from the treaty&#151;if we had an agreement between 27 nation states&#151;we would, for example, wish to support a mission in Kosovo of around 2,000 personnel. If a Government came in who did not wish to continue that, they would wish to open and re-open the discussions on that. My point is a different one. At the point of becoming the Government, one is bound by the obligations until one has renegotiated&#151;whether it is a policy or a treaty.</p>

It is important that we are clear on it. As my noble friend was saying, the difference here is that where, on a particular policy, which may be covered by a particular treaty, a Government may change their mind and take the consequences, in this case, the only way you can change your policy position is by repudiating the whole of the European treaty. There is no single treaty

It was that Governments have a long tradition of being bound by the international agreements that they sign and that incoming Governments who wish to renegotiate them can do so. However, they do not come in on the assumption that the treaty, or whatever, is ripped up. I think that I have laboured that point long enough. Members of the Committee either agree with me or disagree, but that is the point I want to make.</p>

If there is a change of Government who have previously disagreed with a policy that is subsequently agreed by the EU through the various parts of the treaty, do they then not become part of the acquis communautaire, which cannot be renegotiated away?</p>

I was trying to make the point that there is a legal effect in treaties, UN Security Council decisions, and decisions that come under common foreign and security policy. The legal effect is that they bind us, which is why we sign them. We do not have to, but if we choose to do so, we are bound by them. The long tradition&#151;long before the EU, going back centuries&#151;has been that if new Governments want to renegotiate that is their choice, but they are bound by the treaties when they come into power. No one has yet said anything to suggest that I am wrong in that. That is the way it has been, and that is the way it is.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08050639000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, will know that there is an opportunity to renegotiate on the back of an election, with a manifesto in which specific things have been stated&#151;for example, withdrawal from the European Union, which would be UKIP&#146;s manifesto. If that party were elected, the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, were he Prime Minister, could seek to renegotiate. Under this treaty, of course, the opportunity exists to leave the European Union in a measured way&#151;and I notice that the noble Lord has tabled an amendment to oppose that, although I am sure that it is not really for that. There is nothing to stop member states doing so. The point I am making is very straightforward. I am going to move on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08050639000022"></a>Amendment No. 15A talks about the laying of a statement. I have already explained&#151;Members of the Committee accept the point or they do not&#151;that there is nothing in the treaty which restricts the freedom of Her Majesty&#146;s Government to act in the interests of the United Kingdom. The treaty does not change in any way the intergovernmental and consensus-based nature of common foreign and security policy. Member states are bound only where they have agreed policy in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. Agreement on CFSP remains by unanimity, and we will agree to it  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_497"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only where it is in our national interest. I therefore see no need to provide the undertaking that is requested in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08050639000023"></a>Amendment No. 111, to which the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, spoke, appears to take as its premise the idea that the Lisbon treaty will undermine the independence of our UK foreign policy. Indeed, I think that that is probably the noble Lord&#146;s position. It is clear that in the treaty the Government have successfully argued that the CFSP remains subject to rules and procedures that safeguard its separate character. Decision-making is on the basis of unanimity. It is a non-legislative policy area and the European Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction except in the two specific limited areas: first, the boundary between that and other policies; and, secondly, that were there sanctions against the individual, the individual would have the right to go to the European Court of Justice. These can all be found in Article 24 of the treaty of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08050639000024"></a>In another place, the Foreign Affairs Committee said that the,</p>
<ul><a name="08050639000102"></a>&#147;Common Foreign and Security Policy will remain an intergovernmental area, driven by Member States. We welcome this&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000089"></a>Our own Select Committee, which is much quoted with great respect, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08050639000099"></a>&#147;The evidence is that the Lisbon Treaty has preserved the independence of the UK&#146;s foreign and defence policy, subject to the constraints arising when unanimous agreement does prove possible. The fundamental principles of the CFSP will not change under the new Treaties. In particular, the principle of unanimity and the search for consensus in decision-making will continue to apply to the CFSP ... We conclude&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000090"></a>the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, was one of the &#147;we&#148;&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08050639000103"></a>&#147;that the Lisbon Treaty will provide for safeguards against encroachment of other areas of EU activities into the area of CFSP. This should protect the intergovernmental character of the CFSP&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000091"></a>Indeed, Javier Solana, in my conversations with him in Brussels, was clear to me that the intergovernmental nature would not be undermined in any way shape or form by the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08050639000025"></a>On the ability to represent views at the United Nations, again the treaty is clear. The high representative for foreign affairs and security policy will be able to put forward agreed EU positions, but there is nothing new in that. The rotating presidency and the current high representative already present agreed EU positions to the Council. It is clearly in our interests that when we have agreed an EU position, we make it clear to interested parties, of which the UN Security Council would be one, that it has the backing of all 27 member states. But that has not and will not change our role and responsibility at the UN as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. That is made explicit in the treaty at Article 34 TEU, and underlined in Declaration 14 of the treaty, which I shall not repeat.</p>

The condition that would have to be met under the treaty for that would be that all 27 member states decided to do it. In addition, both Houses of Parliament in this country would have to agree it. Each House has a veto. Any decision to trigger the passerelle provision which allows moves to QMV in common foreign and security policy&#151;</p>

Each House has a veto. But national Parliaments have to agree&#151;that means that every national Parliament has to agree&#151;so that if there were any attempt to move to QMV under CFSP, it would have to be agreed by every one of the 27 national Parliaments. In our case, and in other bicameral systems, both Houses of Parliament would have to agree. If anyone does not agree, that is a veto. Perhaps I may also be clear that you cannot use a passerelle clause for issues that have any kind of military implications, or in the area of defence. They cannot go to qualified majority voting.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08050639000029"></a>Let me speed on to Amendment No. 113, which we have partly dealt with in our discussions on international treaties. The noble Lord spoke eloquently particularly about his time during the Falklands War and discussions in the European Union. Of course, his noble friend Lord Tugendhat may have a slightly different emphasis of memory on what happened, but I am not going there&#151;I know better than to tread in that territory. I have made it clear that we are bound by decisions with which we agreed. It is as simple as that.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08050639000030"></a>Amendment No. 165 would require that we renegotiate everything.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08050639000031"></a>I have tried to set out as far as I can why I think the moves in this treaty are of great benefit. I said when I began that it was about building on the experience of member states. If we rewind to the beginning of our deliberations on the purpose of the Lisbon treaty, it is in part to recognise that we are 27 strong and potentially growing a little, if not much, further. We want to ensure that we have a treaty that takes us into the next steps of working together, and this is but one part of that. The proposals, while retaining the unanimity which is so important, and retaining our independent action, will enable us to collaborate where that is important. As many noble Lords have spoken so eloquently about the need for collaboration in today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s world, I think that the case is made. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I assure the noble Baroness that being a novice in the establishment of British foreign policy is no bad thing&#151;on the contrary, it could bring fresh light to a rather messy situation.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_499"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08050639000033"></a>I do not have time to answer all these superb insights. I am sorry that I shocked the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, who has been so effective on the world stage. Of course we want a more effective foreign policy&#151;any suggestion to the contrary would be ridiculous. The question concerns what kind of tools we use and how we use them in a constantly changing, sometimes near-anarchic international situation. Of course I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, that there are situations when it would be wonderful, indeed essential, to have a common 27-state agreed foreign policy going through all the procedures laid down in this treaty, and indeed other procedures as well. That is what we must work for. Call that &#147;collaboration&#148; if you like&#151;call it &#147;co-operation&#148;, call it &#147;intimate collaboration&#148;. Certainly, let us do whatever we can and whatever is practical and prompt in the search for genuine consensus. As the noble Lord, Lord Owen, reminded us, let it be genuine and not a consensus that has to be agreed because the procedures so insist.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08050639000034"></a>The central question has been why, and to what extent, we need to be locked into a straitjacket from which, as we have heard, there may in some circumstances be no escape. That is the question rightly asked by the Government all through the negotiations on this and the previous, near-identical treaty. The Government have sought to answer it by trying to ensure that foreign policy is locked into the intergovernmental system&#151;there it is in the Bill&#151;and that our freedoms are protected; perhaps not all the time, but at least in the last resort. As my noble friend Lord Tugendhat said, in a very profound speech, we could face all kinds of unexpected situations&#151;who knows? We are told nowadays that the fashionable phrase is &#147;black swans&#148;&#151;unexpected things that happen. Are we geared up and flexible enough to deal with these things, or have we tied ourselves down? That has been the debate and one is left with an uneasy feeling of uncertainty about the degree to which the Government have succeeded in these matters.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08050639000035"></a>We believe that we must maintain the distinction between, on the one hand, practical togetherness in common foreign policy&#151;and flexibility about how we approach that togetherness&#151;and, on the other hand, codified top-down procedures in a single legal pattern. That is the aim&#151;that is what the Government were trying to do and that is what we believe is still in doubt in this treaty, despite all their efforts. At least let us close our discussion of this stage. We argue in Amendment No. 15A, for instance, which the noble Baroness mentioned, that the Secretary of State, before the coming into force of the treaty, should assure the House in a statement that,</p>
<ul><a name="08050639000104"></a>&#147;he will uphold the freedom of Her Majesty&#146;s Government to undertake any action on the international scene that he perceives to be in the interests of the United Kingdom without consulting the European Council if he thinks that the security interests of the United Kingdom so require&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000092"></a>That is a very modest amendment. It is not a treaty-wrecker, so the Liberal Democrats need not worry. It is well within our powers to propose such an improvement and reassurance on this central issue of our sovereignty, direction, purpose and national identity. It is a modest amendment behind which lies a mighty principle. I

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08050639000048"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it is a gloriously opportune date on which to congratulate the new Mayor of London and to tell him that we expect his policies and his actions to make London an even better city to visit than it is now. He will be judged by residents on results and on the way in which lives are improved. Tourism is a huge source of revenue for London and all residents here, even if they get disgruntled sometimes when crowds of visitors make life slower for them. We must value the contribution that tourism and the money that it produces make to London&#146;s amenities. London&#146;s visitor economy&#151;overseas and domestic&#151;totalled &#163;10.9 billion in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08050639000049"></a>I came to London as a visitor in the 1950s, planning to spend six months in the UK and mainland Europe before returning to Australia; I am still here half a century later. As a keen tourist myself, I have a list of things that I believe most tourists seek: first, personal security; secondly, an interesting place to visit; thirdly, a welcome arrival; fourthly, good value for money; fifthly, special events; sixthly, permanent attractions; seventhly, accommodation at all price levels; eighthly, good local transport; ninthly, clear instructions; 10thly, that a place be child-friendly; and finally, that it be disability-friendly. Some of those items go together, but I intend to outline each one separately, as they are all important.</p>

<a name="80506-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08050639000050"></a>I put personal security as the top priority. Tourists will not visit if they believe that their lives are at risk. That does not mean that a country has to be on a list

London has survived the terrorist attacks, but it is essential that the new mayor creates a safer London.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80506-0012.htm"/>


<a name="80506-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08050639000051"></a>On interesting places to visit, London has a very rich cultural heritage, with famous galleries, museums and ceremonial events such as Changing the Guard, which are a great draw card. Pageantry delights visitors, be it at the Tower of London, a ceremonial procession for a state visit, or the annual State Opening of Parliament. West End theatres have a worldwide reputation and, in recent years, outdoor ice skating in winter has added a new recreation and charm. The varieties of entertainment are almost unlimited.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08050639000052"></a>On welcome arrival, Eurostar brings visitors to the heart of the capital at the new St Pancras terminal, but Heathrow holds the key for visitors and brings in even more of them. The fast train link from the airport to Paddington has helped, and there is a Tube connection. The fiasco of terminal 5 has made headlines throughout the world and done a lot of damage to the British reputation. Visitors will expect improvements, or they will use other airlines, terminals and airports or simply not come. It is essential that a visitor&#146;s first experience in the UK should be a pleasant and welcoming arrival. As an Australian passport holder, my experience is finding immigration desks undermanned at Heathrow, causing unacceptable delays for passengers who are often exhausted by their long journeys.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08050639000053"></a>Business tourism accounts for 25 per cent of visits to London but 34 per cent expenditure. The average daily spend of a business visitor is &#163;159 compared to &#163;84 for a leisure visitor. This makes it clear how important it is for London to retain its image of a successful and desirable place to do business. We must not frighten away from the UK these important businesspeople by creating a threatening business tax structure.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08050639000054"></a>On the issue of good value for money, the drop in the value of the pound means that people find that their money goes further, so they are more willing to spend it on attractions and shopping in London. Well prepared good food is part of this, too. My husband served for many years as a member of the London Tourist Board and at that time Paris was the big challenger and London was missing opportunities. In 2007 London was second only to New York and ahead of Madrid in attracting numbers of visitors.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08050639000055"></a>People plan their trips around special events&#151;personal and public. Right now we are all thinking about and planning for the big one&#151;the 2012 Olympics. This is a huge task and the costs appear to be running away. One of the benefits for London will be what remains for locals to use afterwards, such as a greatly improved transport system. Transport is vital and worked well in Sydney, but I recall the total breakdown of transport at the Atlanta Olympics and the embarrassment that that caused. With any and all Olympic special preparations, the lesson learnt from terminal 5 is that they must be completed and trialled thoroughly, well in advance of the date of the Games. Only by these means can we avoid being held to ransom by overtime rates to avoid meltdown of the new systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08050639000056"></a>Hotel rooms do not seem to be a problem as Athens had 18,000, Sydney had 24,000, and London has 135,000 rooms. Day visitors from the continent will come by Eurostar. Some of the permanent attractions come in as special events. London has so many world-renowned galleries, museums and other attractions. The British Museum is always popular but never more so than with the recent special exhibition of the terracotta warriors. The Royal Academy scored with the Russian exhibition. The London Eye, which seemed controversial when installed, has now been made a permanent feature and it is a super experience for people of any age.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08050639000057"></a>On the issue of accommodation at all price levels, I was rather stunned to see in the press that rooms for VIPs for the Olympics had been block-booked by the organisers at the top Park Lane hotels at up to &#163;3,000 per night. Rooms in London in the top 25 hotels that were members of the British Hospitality Association averaged &#163;460 per night and operated at 93 per cent capacity. Across the 130,000 rooms in London, the average cost was &#163;70 to &#163;80 per night with a 98 per cent occupancy rate. People may well be offering accommodation in private homes, too.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08050639000058"></a>I find that the buses and Tube in London provide good transport but it is not easy for visitors to understand how to pay on the buses that require a ticket to be purchased in advance of boarding, and I regularly see perplexed visitors arguing with bus drivers. It would help if travelcards or Oyster cards were more widely available at the point of arrival in London and their use explained in multilingual leaflets and posters. Why can these not be bought easily at kiosks and local shops as in France and Australia?</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08050639000059"></a>There is no better way to give clear information than by the use of internationally recognised symbols that do not require English language. A green light at a crossing is understood by all. So many tourists are family units and need to know which establishments are appropriate for children. London enjoys beautiful parks and open spaces, a splendid zoo, and for many children the London Dungeon is the first choice.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08050639000060"></a>Shops should all now have disabled access. Heritage buildings have done their best but in some cases compromise has been necessary. Buses have ramps, and it is essential that they are in working order as wheelchair users depend on them. There have been considerable improvements in the past few years. I appreciate that there are particular problems in Underground stations, which may be below property that is not in their ownership. It is not a simple matter. Even stations with lifts usually have a few steps down to the platform, so are unsuitable for wheelchair access. It should be possible to modify some of those. New stations have disabled access and you can, for example, get on to the Circle line at Westminster station. That is not much benefit unless you just want to ride the full circle, as the only place where you can get off is back at Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08050639000061"></a>London&#146;s visitor economy was worth about &#163;15 billion in 2007, which is 10 per cent of London&#146;s GDP. Tourism supports 280,000 full-time jobs. The benefits could be even greater if the young London unemployed chose to work in the hospitality and

For some reason, in London&#151;I stress in London, as it is not the same in other parts of the country&#151;these jobs are not filled by local people. There is a need for training opportunities and many of these should be on-the-job training for school leavers who would find the work interesting and fulfilling.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08050639000062"></a>I believe in an aspirational society. We must make it clear that being part of the hospitality industry in London can be very exciting and can open the world to those involved. It is important to ensure that Londoners can benefit from this work, which is such a valuable part of London life.</p>

<a name="08050639000063"></a><a name="80506-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80506-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08050639000367"></a>Baroness Valentine:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, for calling this timely debate, and will touch on many of the themes that she has already introduced.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08050639000064"></a>Visit London tells us that last year there were 16 million visitors to London, and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said, they contributed an estimated &#163;15 billion to the economy. Many of these visitors go on to visit the UK. London is the natural gateway to Britain.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08050639000065"></a>In just four years, the Olympic curtain will be raised and, as the directors of the show, we must be ready. We won the Olympics based on our claims for their legacy, and hospitality and tourism can be one of the most important facets of that legacy. Aside from the extra tourism spend accompanying the Games, 2012 is a trigger to upgrade our visitor offer so that those visiting recommend the capital to their friends, and to employ more Londoners in a sector that is traditionally a magnet for migrant workers.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08050639000066"></a>This, I am afraid, is the crunch. London must have two things if it is to realise these benefits: a transformed quality of visitor experience; and a workforce with the skills to do the hospitality and leisure jobs. In 2012 London will be on display, with hundreds of thousands of people passing through the East End, the West End, and dare I say it, Heathrow. Let me start at the airport. Heathrow was last year ranked 90 out of 101 international airports for overall passenger service. I am delighted that BAA and BA have fastened their seatbelts for take off to remedy recent local difficulties. We have four years to get the experience at London&#146;s airports back to world class.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08050639000067"></a>I suggest a couple of steps along the way. There should be one owner of terminal waiting times, whether airline or airport operator, with the primary responsibility for getting the passenger off the aeroplane and through the airport with the minimum hassle. The Home Office should set itself targets for queues at immigration, which progressively decline over the four years, and it must commit itself to delivering the staff resource needed to meet them, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, alluded, means more immigration officers, not fewer. And please, BAA, can we have Heathrow East open in time for the flame to be lit, rather than after it is extinguished? By the time we get to 2012, visitors must be made to feel welcome from touch-down to take-off.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_506"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08050639000068"></a>From Heathrow to the West End&#151;the heart of one of the world's most famous cities&#151;we find the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, the British Museum, a renovated South Bank and a wonderful variety of restaurants feeding, and fed by, London's cosmopolitan people. London's theatres have never been more popular. They contribute &#163;1.5 billion per year to the capital&#146;s economy, yet their buildings and facilities owe more to the 19th than the 21st century. Surely, in the next four years, owners and government could find a way to upgrade at least some of these buildings in time for 2012; I note that several of us will be back here tomorrow debating this precise issue.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08050639000069"></a>However, some of London's iconic streets do not have the quality feel of the European boulevards. The West End is busy in an ugly way: traffic congestion and pollution. Compared with staging the Olympics, improving our streetscapes ought to be simple. Now is the time for central London boroughs, working with the new mayor, to create a deliverable and imaginative plan for upgrading their public realm in the next four years. Renovated streets, pavements, meeting places and lighting are critical, but we must also show imagination. We must help visitors find their way. There are already plans for signposting walking routes across the city, which could allow for pauses at traffic-free oases brightened by public art, events and animation. We have to make the West End the best end.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08050639000070"></a>Finally, what of east London? The Olympic organisations have to get the venues ready and prepare for the event itself. They seem to be making good progress. However, there is an Olympic opportunity to make sense of the visitor attractions in this area: the O2, ExCeL and the new aquarium, Biota, on top of the venues.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08050639000071"></a>A further thought: after many years of debate, London remains the only major city in Europe to lack a convention centre such as the Palais des Congrès in Paris, to host the largest, most prestigious&#151;and, of course, most profitable&#151;conferences. We must not forget business travellers to London, who are the most valuable contributors to our capital&#146;s hospitality and tourism industry.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08050639000072"></a>The five boroughs united by the Olympics are also united by high unemployment. As a region, London has the highest unemployment rate in the UK. We have a new London Skills and Employment Board, established recently with a remit to match training provision to the needs of employers and would-be employees. Its employer accord guarantees interviews to unemployed applicants who have the necessary skills, for up to 30,000 additional jobs surrounding the Games. It is vital that the hospitality and tourism industries sign up to such initiatives wholeheartedly. We must equip the people of London to take advantage of the benefits coming our way, and not remain in a situation in which some of the cities&#146; largest employers put jobs on a website and are inundated with applications&#151;not one of them from a Londoner.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08050639000073"></a>Making the most of the Olympics for London's tourism sector is not a solo performance. It requires a large cast. If London is to take a bow to a standing ovation from both visitors and residents alike in 2012,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_507"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we must have a script worthy of the occasion and of the world's leading city. If we do that, the contribution of tourism to London and the UK economy can only get better.</p>

<a name="08050639000074"></a><a name="80506-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80506-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08050639000368"></a>Lord Harrison:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, is an expert on all subjects, from Tasmania to toothaches and tourism. I congratulate her on how she introduced the debate tonight on tourism, the world&#146;s largest industry and the fourth most important industry in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08050639000075"></a>Last week, in London, Boris Johnson was voted in. He, of course, is a tourist attraction in himself. Indeed, the <I>Times</I> on Saturday reported that Romanian student Irina Paletscu asked journalists queuing outside City Hall:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08050639000101"></a>&#147;It is The Boris, yes?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050639000093"></a>Now, the Boris offers us a new opportunity, especially working with Visit London and the London Development Agency. I hope that two things can happen. First, I hope that my Government will indeed work with the Boris. Whatever enmities are there must be set aside. We must help London do its best to produce jobs for London and the country. Secondly, Boris does not know very much; I do not think that he knows an awful lot about the tourism industry. There is a golden opportunity to teach him about it. I must say that he shares that with many other politicians, who are wholly ignorant about tourism. I wrote a little book many years ago called <I>Tourism Means Jobs</I> to try to illustrate that. Politicians do not understand tourism, partly because it is so successful, partly because it deals with leisure and pleasure and they do not take it seriously, and partly because it is so disparate and varied and involves so many small businesses. Here is an opportunity to get the Boris to understand and do something about it.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08050639000076"></a>My advice to Boris on tourism policy is that what is good for London is therefore good for tourists and visitors. A classic example illustrated so well tonight by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, has been transport. Get the transport right for the residents of London and you begin to get it right for tourists and visitors who come here. There are nevertheless complementary and buttressing features of our tourism policy which must identify specific problems about tourism and London. One example from Visit London is that while, happily, overseas visitors to London rose in 2006, we are losing domestic visitors from the United Kingdom. We must ask ourselves why that is and begin to remedy it.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08050639000077"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, has mentioned, business tourism for London is crucial. One in four tourists is a business tourist, and they of course have a higher spend. One of Visit London&#146;s five objectives is to encourage and exploit that. However, the vexed problem of our airports, which has been mentioned tonight, must be tackled. Otherwise, we will begin to lose the business tourist and, with them, the businesses, as well as London as a financial sector.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08050639000078"></a>We must also pay attention to improved training within the sector and knowledge of the tourism product. So many times, not just in London but elsewhere in  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the country, when I visit a pub and go for one of the guest beers, I ask where it comes from. Quite often, the person behind the bar does not know. Now, they should know that, because it is information about the product that should be given to the visitor, the tourist or interested person. Last week, I was sitting in a London pub and asked for a pint of bitter. The barmaid said, &#147;It is green&#148;, and produced a pint of green bitter; it tasted perfectly all right. Back at my table, I was asked by five American tourists at the next table what it was, where it came from and whether it tasted nice. I was not able to tell them because the person serving the green beer was not able to tell me: she just did not know. We must improve the whole level of training for those working in the industry, to increase what they know about the products they serve.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08050639000079"></a>London tourism is of course currently much supported by young migrants from eastern Europe as well as the ANZAC backpackers. It would be an irony if some of them are returning to eastern Europe. Some of the new sources of visitors to London are the accession countries which came into the European Union so recently. Of course, having come from service industries in their own countries and having the languages, they have all the natural skills. Again&#151;I hope that the Minister can reply to this&#151;it is essential that we do something about language tuition as way of welcoming people to London and, indeed, exploiting the fact that London is so multilingual. Let us take advantage of it.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08050639000080"></a>I am going to lead my noble friend on to dangerous ground by reminding him of the euro. I have been passionately in favour of the United Kingdom adopting the euro, but things have come home to roost as we have not made the decision to enter the euro, and we now impoverish ourselves and make life more difficult, particularly for the tourism industry where the exchange rate means that the tourist coming in is at a loss. It also means that when multi-destination tours are offered to overseas visitors, there is an inducement to leave London off the list to stay within euroland and the eurozone.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08050639000081"></a>Finally, I shall say something about London and the Olympics from the point of view of the regions. I must declare that I used to be deputy chairman of the North West Tourist Board. At the moment, we are celebrating Liverpool 2008, which is in many ways a forerunner to London 2012, and we must ensure that the regions support London. In the regions, people ask why they should support London, and I say because there is a national common purpose and also because when London gets full from time to time, we can pass those visitors who have come to London, this country&#146;s first attraction, to see the delights in the regions. We must develop more than the usual path of Oxbridge, Stratford and Edinburgh. Why not come to Chester and north Wales, the finest part of the country?</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08050639000082"></a>I conclude by saying well done to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, for introducing this short but important debate. I hope we get a vigorous reply from the Minister. We need to take tourism seriously and there is nowhere better to begin than in London.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, has been a keen supporter of London ever since she arrived; she demonstrated her devotion once again this evening. I have to declare a past interest, which was entirely honorary, in that I was president and subsequently patron of the Restaurant Association, which is now totally integrated into the British Hospitality Association. The BHA, as it is known, is an incredibly important organisation covering hotels, catering and restaurants. Several noble Lords have mentioned the economic value of the industry, and it certainly needs better recognition. However, it seems to be getting that in one quarter because, as we speak, a large representative group from the BHA, led by its very able chief executive, Bob Cotton, is being entertained at a reception given by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08050639000084"></a>Hospitality in its widest sense is a growth industry, but it has to a certain extent been hindered by Treasury impositions, which is not unknown. There are several of them: first, removing the hotel building allowance, which enabled hoteliers to renovate old stock; secondly, the reduction in capital allowances; and thirdly, the increase in capital gains tax, which has been especially detrimental to family-run and small businesses, which is certainly the case with restaurants.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08050639000085"></a>Within the hospitality sector, the restaurant trade plays a major role. Over 100,000 people work in London restaurants alone, not to mention, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, did, the rest of the country. This sector will certainly suffer from food inflation; the dramatic increases in prime item prices will be a problem for it. Several noble Lords have mentioned the skill shortage. It is principally in front-of-house staff&#151;waiters and sommeliers&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, mentioned a good example. To fill this gap, the Academy of Food and Wine Service has devised a programme to get unemployed people back to work and off benefits. This programme is part of the hospitality skills alliance sponsored by the BHA. Here I have to declare another past interest in that some years ago I was patron of the academy, a position now held by the noble Viscount Thurso, who used to sit in this House and is now an MP. He is much better qualified than I ever was for that role because he worked in that sector of the economy.</p>

<a name="80506-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08050639000086"></a>Finally, the Olympics were mentioned by my noble friend Lady Valentine. They will bring a vast inflow of visitors to London. In terms of hotel capacity, London is well served as it has over 130,000 rooms, which is five times greater than the number that Sydney had. However, it is essential that the reconstruction of Terminals 2 and 3 is completed, tested and working properly well before August 2012. That has not happened in other cases, and I hope the Minister can give us some assurance on that&#151;and perhaps he can do something about the tax matters I mentioned.</p>

There are two short points I wish to make, but first I thank my noble friend Lady Gardner for introducing this debate so comprehensively. My first point follows what the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, said about languages and language skills. They are important. The fact that most people speak at least a smattering of English does not make any difference. In giving a welcome to visitors, it is important that we should be able to welcome them in their own language. I was recently in China, and there is no doubt that not only will many visitors and tourists be going to China in the future, but many Chinese visitors will be coming to the United Kingdom. Where is Chinese language training taking place? It is important to get this right.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08050645000003"></a>My second point is that a lot needs to be done to make central London cleaner. Around Parliament Square, there are no litter bins for security reasons. Something must be done to cope with the litter. It may be that people who do not walk much do not notice, but the remains of meals and half-drunk cartons of drinks are quite revolting. If we want to welcome visitors, it is important at least to show a clean city so that when they come here and enjoy the experience, they will come back again. It is not only the litter problem that has to be dealt with, it is also the cleanliness of the pavements. It is horrible that people seem to spill food and other things all over the place and nothing seems to be done. There seems to be no system for cleaning up that sort of mess. Many people berate our French friends across the Channel, but in France they have a system of washing down the pavements. Every shop holder washes the pavement outside his or her shop. Is there not something that can be done here? With the new mayor of London, the time is ripe. Let us hope that we can get the message across.</p>

In addition, since its foundation I have been chairman of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, the 42 members of which each have to receive more than 1 million visitors a year. I am glad to say that the Palace of Westminster is a fairly recent addition to our membership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08050645000005"></a>As has been said, London is the number one city destination for international travel. No other city in the world has such a rich tapestry of tourism opportunities: history and heritage through museums and galleries; theatres and restaurants, as the noble Viscount mentioned; historical palaces; and more modern attractions such as the London Eye. The statistics were mentioned a little earlier. The visitor economy is worth &#163;15 billion to London. It provides 280,000 full-time jobs&#151;heaven knows where those jobs would be filled from if we did not have all those who come from eastern Europe to work in our hotels and restaurants&#151;and provides 10 per cent of London&#146;s GDP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08050645000006"></a>At a time when the financial services industry, which is so important to us, is suffering a decline, thankfully we have tourism to sustain London&#146;s economy. Last year, 16 million overseas visitors came to London, nearly double the number that visited New York and, of course, London is the national gateway to the United Kingdom. Some 50 per cent of overseas visitors come to London and 75 per cent come through London airports.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08050645000007"></a>However, the current trends are not over-encouraging&#151;2008 will be a tougher year, not least because of the situation of the world economy. As far as London is concerned, we saw strong growth in 2006 when the numbers were up by 12 per cent, and in 2007 when they were up by 3 per cent, but this year looks like more of a standstill. The broad trend is that we have an increasing number of day trips to the capital, particularly domestic ones, but a declining number of overnight visitors.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08050645000008"></a>We are seeing a gradual decline in London&#146;s percentage of global tourism. London is not sharing proportionally in its growth. There are some considerable opportunities. The Olympics have been mentioned. It is a great tragedy and a lost opportunity that the Government have so far&#151;I repeat, so far&#151;not allocated any hypothecated money to promote the Olympics. We are spending billions in capital terms&#151;surely we should be spending some in income terms as well.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08050645000009"></a>Without wishing to be too political tonight, I have to say that this Government have taken very little interest in the tourism industry. Reduced funding for VisitBritain has been the message. The terms of office for its chairman require him to do just six days per month, which frankly is an insult to the industry. I know that he does more, but we should have a full-time chairman.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08050645000010"></a>Major challenges have been referred to. It is crazy that London has no major conference or convention centre. We have lost a huge amount of business, as has been referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. On hotel accommodation, we may have a substantial number of beds in total, but we certainly do not have enough budget accommodation in London. The Government were not very clever when they abolished the 4 per cent hotel building allowance, as has been referred to earlier. That was bad news.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08050645000011"></a>In terms of minor improvements that would make a difference, I would like to see the pedestrianisation of Parliament Square and an improvement in the Exhibition Road tunnel leading to our major museums&#151;it is tired and unimpressive. We could also smarten up a number of this country&#146;s entry points.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08050645000012"></a>The previous Mayor, Ken Livingstone, substantially supported the London Development Agency and I hope that Boris Johnson, our new Mayor, recognises the importance of the tourism industry to London and becomes its champion.</p>

I have a tourist attraction&#151;it is not in London but, just in case, I declare my interest.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_512"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08050645000014"></a>Whatever view is taken on the right level of support for the tourism industry, one or two facts stand out. The tourism deficit stands at &#163;19 billion, compared with &#163;4.7 billion in 1997 when this Government were first elected. The noble Lord, Lord Lee, has commented on this. I do not think that all of that deficit can be attributed to government incompetence. For example, the massive reductions in the cost of air travel&#151;reductions available entirely through action by the private sector&#151;have meant that more Britons are able to go abroad for their holiday although it is also cheaper for tourists to visit Britain.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08050645000015"></a>However, at a time when new tourist destinations are opening up all over the world, the Government have introduced a number of measures which, if not specifically designed to keep visitors away from this country, have certainly had a negative effect. Indirect taxes aimed at tourists increase the cost of visiting the country. If costs are increased, Britain becomes a less attractive destination. For example, the cost of a student visa has increased 130 per cent and now costs &#163;60, whereas a visa to visit the 15 Schengen countries costs &#8364;60. It was very nice to hear the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, showing the same enthusiasm for London as he shows for Liverpool, although I cannot share his enthusiasm for the euro. The fact is that &#8364;60 is considerably cheaper than &#163;60 and for his or her money the student gets 15 countries to visit rather than one. The air passenger tax has doubled. The Licensing Act 2003 has meant that the cost of a licence for a bed-and-breakfast establishment to sell alcohol has risen from &#163;30 to &#163;300&#151;and so on and so forth.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08050645000016"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Government think that if you increase the cost of goods and services there will be no impact and life will continue as before, but there will be an impact. If the Government are in doubt about this simple principle, they have only to look at the current exodus from this country of a number of international corporations, unwilling to pay Britain&#146;s higher corporation taxes. However much the Minister may disagree, let us hope that the business tourist does not also disappear.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08050645000017"></a>A number of steps need to be taken to improve tourism. My noble friends Lady Gardner of Parkes and Lady Hooper have alluded to some of these. Of course, the first and most important step was to get rid of Ken Livingstone, so the capital can be run properly. Now that has happened, it is hoped that Her Majesty&#146;s Government can try and remove some of the other impediments to visitors considering visiting London.</p>

The Government welcome the opportunity to discuss tourism on all occasions. The short answer to the noble Baroness&#146;s Question is that the Government regard the tourism and hospitality industries as vital not only to the capital but to the wider economy of the whole country. As such, the Government are working hard with their partners in the public and private sectors to support  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_513"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the London tourist industry and to improve further their contribution to tourism across the UK, particularly as the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games come ever nearer.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08050645000019"></a>The scale of London&#146;s visitor economy is vast, as noble Lords have attested this evening. Visit London, the former London Tourist Board, estimates that the capital&#146;s tourism and hospitality industries are worth &#163;15 billion a year, which is 17 per cent of the total &#163;85.6 billion turnover of these industries across the UK. That shows how significant London is in this respect. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, rightly identified it as the crucial gateway. There were 26.2 million overnight visits to the capital in 2007 and an estimated 150 million tourism day trips, including 52 million people visiting London&#146;s free and paying attractions.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08050645000020"></a>I emphasise the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lee, that we look not only at overseas visitors when we consider London&#146;s tourism role but at UK citizens, who visit London in very large numbers and need to be catered for adequately. These are big numbers, but as noble Lords have identified in this debate, London faces big challenges in an increasingly competitive world tourism market. We know how sharp the challenges are because our own people travel abroad more readily, as indicated by the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, and the noble Lord, Lord Howard. London needs to compete with the opportunities that British citizens take up elsewhere in the world.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08050645000021"></a>Overseas visitor numbers increased by 3 per cent in 2007. We have to compare that with the 12 per cent rise in 2006, so there is no cause for complacency. The trend is for the numbers of domestic visitors staying overnight in the capital to fall, as they did by 7.5 per cent in 2007. Visit London has forecast a fall of 1 per cent in visitor numbers over 2008&#151;a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lee&#151;but we hope and indeed plan for the fact that the capital&#146;s performance can buck that trend over the past year or so. The latest available figures show that the numbers of people visiting London&#146;s tourist information centres increased by 12 per cent in February. That is a very positive sign, and indicates to the Government that there is no reason for gloom in the London industry. We do, however, need to look at the things that we can improve so that it can increase its advantages. Its advantages over its competitors in Europe and beyond have not gone away, and show no signs of doing so. The four world heritage sites&#151;Greenwich, Kew Gardens, the Tower of London and the Palace of Westminster&#151;have been here for a considerable time and show every evidence of being a feature of the London tourist landscape for the foreseeable future. The retail sector in London generated sales of &#163;4.4 billion last year&#151;a significant number. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, emphasised London&#146;s 26 Michelin-starred restaurants and nine major concert halls, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, referred to our national museums and galleries, which are a major attraction for tourists to this country.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08050645000022"></a>Several noble Lords, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, emphasised the concern about business visitors. A London convention centre would certainly  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be an additional feature but is a matter for the mayor in the first instance. We as a Government have signalled our general support for the proposal in the department&#146;s tourism strategy for 2012, which we published last September. It is now for others to do substantial work in these terms, which is an obligation for the new mayor. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, castigated the previous mayor and, I guess, expects the Government to co-operate with the new mayor. Let us assure him that there will be the fullest co-operation in working with the new Mayor of London on the manifold challenges that he faces, but let us not forget the achievements of the outgoing mayor. The Olympic Games were achieved for London, and Ken Livingstone played a significant part in that. There is no doubt that when we look back over this period in four to five years, the Olympic Games will feature in every tourism debate, very much to the advantage of the capital.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08050645000023"></a>Let me say to wider parts of the United Kingdom, for I was glad that my noble friend Lord Harrison broadened the debate to stretch beyond London, that 2012 has to be not just about London but about spreading the benefits wider in the country. We expect that tourism businesses outside the capital will start to benefit from the increased interest in the Olympic Games.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08050645000024"></a>I was chided in the debate for the limited progress, thus far, in selling the Games, but it is a little early given that we still have to complete the Beijing Olympics. We have not formally had the torch handed to London; that will happen with the emblem of the Olympics at the end of those Games. It is Beijing&#146;s Olympics at present, but it will soon be London&#146;s&#151;and as soon as the banner is taken up then London will be required to begin to sell the Games, within the preparations of the next four years. I have not the slightest doubt that there will be co-operation between the Government, the mayor and, indeed, all other interested contributing parties&#151;including industry and, particularly, the tourist industry in London&#151;which are eager to play their parts in reaping the rewards from that quite unique opportunity.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08050645000025"></a>Some of your Lordships suggested that we were not preparing the ground sufficiently well at present; the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, was concerned at the withdrawal of the hotel buildings allowances as part of the last Budget. That was part of a wider group of measures in that Budget designed to benefit small businesses, including hotels and restaurants. The new annual investment allowance will allow all businesses to claim full tax relief on capital investments of up to &#163;50,000 a year, so I assure him that we have the interests of small businesses at heart. Those interests were part of the business considerations during the Budget, within which the hotel and restaurant industries are important.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08050645000026"></a>I was delighted that we then came on to the question of skills. The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, mentioned language skills; I think that other noble Lords did so too. It is not just language skills but that whole range of hospitality skills in which we would be perhaps prone to indicate that our skill levels, on many sides, compare poorly at times with other major centres. To take the most obvious aspect, the standard  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of waiting in the average restaurant in the United States usually compares rather well with London&#146;s, let alone at higher skill levels such as the organisation of business&#151;although London delights, as does the UK, in the extent to which high levels of skills are being shown among chefs and at the improvements with food in this country.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08050645000027"></a>We need to raise skill levels, which is exactly why the Government have invested so significantly in skills. In 2006, the public sector spent about &#163;500 million on skills, including regional development agency and Learning and Skills Council funding, compared to &#163;144 million invested by employers. I bring the attention of the House to the Government&#146;s determination&#151;it is scarcely directly relevant to this debate, but related to the skills agenda&#151;to improve vocational opportunities at secondary level in our schools and colleges. That is absolutely crucial to enhancing skill levels in this country. Undoubtedly, we will only make sufficient progress when we have raised those levels and are able to give the welcome that we should to visitors; noble Lords on all sides referred to that.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08050645000028"></a>That welcome depends on the point of arrival, too, and there is no doubt either that Heathrow has to improve its performance, or that the fifth-terminal mishap was a limited one from which the airport will recover. It was costly, no question, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, indicated that the world was well aware of failures in that respect; however, the fifth terminal is an important and welcome addition to the airport. As a Government, we are clear that the third runway is important, too, for tourist development; the noble Lord leading for the Opposition this evening did not, I think, mention that position, but the third runway is important in access to this country. I was pleased that several noble Lords also emphasised the importance of rail links, with the development of St Pancras and the link with Europe it represents. That not only improves opportunities for people from Europe to come to the United Kingdom, but has brought benign effects on the carbon imprint.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08050645000029"></a>We have not the slightest doubt that, to make a success of the tourist industry, we need to improve our transport infrastructure; yet, on all sides, we can see our railways improving apace with modernisation and the track improvements that guarantee faster rail travel in the UK. That, with the European Channel link, is an important dimension, but it does not alter the fact that we need to pay attention to our airports. For the foreseeable future, a large number of our tourists will come in by air.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08050645000030"></a>This has been a most interesting and challenging debate. None of us underestimates the challenges facing the tourist industry. The Government are providing their support for an industry which is so important to the economy. Great opportunities beckon, not only in the obvious fact that London maintains its position as second only to New York in terms of a city to be visited. We all know that its range of attractions needs to be improved.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08050645000031"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, is right about litter. Standards of cleanliness speak well of a city, but London&#146;s are not high enough. There is a real problem about providing litter bins in these days of guaranteeing  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>security. Again, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said, without security the capital cannot expect to attract visitors. One of the great achievements of London in its response to the terrorist outrage a few years ago was the rapidity with which Londoners made sure that the capital returned to normal and remained the same welcoming place for visitors that it had always been.</p>

<a name="80506-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08050645000032"></a>There are real challenges and the greatest of opportunities. The Olympic Games puts London on the map. I do not think that the country has realised yet what a prize we have secured. I understand those who have a limited interest in sport and those who think that the Olympics can be oversold&#151;but not in terms of worldwide perception, they cannot. Once the Beijing Olympics are over, the focal point of the Olympic Games will be London. It gives us an enormous opportunity to advance tourism. I have not the slightest doubt that the Government will continue to play their full part with their partners to ensure that that opportunity is grasped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08050645000042"></a>The information that is referred to in new Article 25A will be some of the most sensitive data that Governments will ever handle. For example, it will cover information gathered by the intelligence services of European Union countries and other countries allied with us. Much of this information will have been shared with us by those who expect the data to be as strongly and as closely protected as possible. So my first question to the noble Baroness the Lord President is: how will this Government handle a request made by one of our colleague countries in the European Union for relevant information made available to us, for example, by the United States? The answer to that question will be interesting, but I hope it will also have taken into account whether the Government have thought about the special relationship between the British and United States intelligence services becoming seriously restricted by the possibility that, in future, some information will have to be passed on to 26 other countries whose relationship with the United States may not be as close as ours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08050645000043"></a>The controversy surrounding the agreements between the European Union and the United States concerning passenger name records shows just how dangerous this area can be. The possibility of our sensitive personal data being passed out of the hands not only of our Government but even of the European Union without proper safeguards is real. What safeguards will the Government ensure are put in the rules and procedures to stop this happening in future? I am not saying that data should never be shared for the purposes of common foreign and security policy&#151;that would be nonsense. I am, however, deeply concerned that the safeguards that will be put in place under this new provision will not be adequate.</p>

If they are unable to keep sensitive data secure, how can they be confident about the capability of others to do so? We on these Benches frequently criticise this Government for presiding over some pretty astounding examples of bureaucratic

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08050645000045"></a>My Amendment No. 16A highlights a new offence of reckless loss of data. This Chamber has managed to insert this change in the criminal justice Bill. I am unaware of what discussions are taking place, but I understand that the principle of it at least is being accepted in another place even as we speak.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08050645000046"></a>It would be wrong of the Government to approve the sharing of data with other countries which do not maintain equally rigorous laws to protect personal data. It is a matter not just of carelessness, but of wilful misuse. Many countries in the European Union, some of which are our closest friends, suffer from high levels of inefficiency when protecting data and have highlighted examples of wrongful behaviour by their officials&#151;if I can put it as euphemistically as that. Many of the countries with which we deal outside the European Union also suffer. We have even less influence with them with which to encourage their reform.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08050645000047"></a>It is clear that the rules and procedures by which these data will be protected are crucial, yet this treaty hands over the final say to independent authorities.</p>

I was Secretary-General of NATO, which is an organisation that lives by confidentiality and a lot of things that go way beyond the normal aspect of data. There are 26 members of NATO. Most of them are members also of the European Union. If NATO has since it was established in 1949 managed procedures to protect what needs to be protected, why should we not assume that the European Union can have similarly effective procedures?</p>

I doubt that the personal records of millions of people would have been lost if he had been in charge in the Cabinet. Equally, I am sure that his experience within NATO raises an important area that we ought to think about. But this House has just decided to impose on the criminal justice Bill a high standard of offence; namely, reckless use of data. In the light of that, I am anxious to ensure that we have a similar test for all data, right across the European Union. The European Union may well be wise to adopt the policies that were so successful when the noble Lord administered them within NATO. We shall wait and see. Who knows, the Minister may well be able to give me the assurances I seek.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08050645000050"></a>I am troubled by the fact that, unlike with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, decisions on this are going to be handed over to independent authorities. I do not think that was the case with NATO. I am worried about the phrase &#147;independent authority&#148;. I do not think we should accept an independent authority. The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said that we were trespassing

We are inserting into our amendments ideas that the Government themselves proposed, as we did earlier this evening. I quote, in support of this amendment, Mr Peter Hain, of vivid memory. It was he who said that we cannot accept an independent authority in this context. I anxiously await the Minister&#146;s response because the Government cannot so easily reverse their position without at least some explanation. We have to protect our data to the necessary standards, both within this country and, in particular, when we share it. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="08050645000051"></a><a name="80506-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80506-0014.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08050645000071"></a>Baroness Ludford:</b> I confess that I am thoroughly confused about what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, wants to achieve. He is worried that if data passes out of our hands it will not be protected by the proper data protection safeguards, but the precise purpose of the two provisions against which he has tabled amendments is to establish common data protection rules. First, there are specific provisions under the common foreign and security policy. Secondly, the provision that Amendment No. 38 targets is the data protection rules, which would apply normally within the European Union.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08050645000052"></a>If we are worried that there will not be proper data protection safeguards, surely we want to make sure that there are common high standards. I found the noble Lord&#146;s account really rather confusing. On the one hand, he deplores, as we all do, the loss of data that we have experienced in the UK. I happen to believe that the UK is not the only member state where this has happened; we have just had rather more publicity. We have to try to make the member states not only pass the laws but live up to them. That means having those strong independent authorities. I remind the noble Lord that those independent authorities are the national data protection supervisors&#151;in our case, the Information Commissioner. This is made clear in paragraph 7.45 of the report from the EU Committee. That makes clear that the independent authority is not some Euromonster. Our own Richard Thomas will monitor compliance. We need the rules and we need them to be respected. If these amendments aim at having no common data protection rules, we are indeed at risk of not having proper protection.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08050645000053"></a>There is some concern that we need to make sure that there is clarification on the scope and purpose of the specific rules for common foreign and security policy, so that they do not then apply to things that should properly be covered by the other clause. I was reassured when the Minister for Europe told the Lords EU Committee that, for instance, a passenger name record agreement, which was agreed with the United States last year precisely on a common foreign and security legal basis&#151;which was shocking&#151;in future would not be agreed, so the specific rules for common foreign and security policy would not apply to data sharing on things such as air passenger data. There will be a lot more coming down the track in that vein, which reassures me to some extent. You would expect me to say no less because the CSFP rules will not be subject to the codecision or assent of the European Parliament, so we are cut out of the  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_520"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>picture on the those rules. There is some danger that if the member states use them as the way to circumvent the normal codecision, we would have to look to the national parliaments to be especially vigilant&#151;perhaps more vigilant than they normally are.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08050645000054"></a>I do not think that the noble Lord is on the right track with these two amendments. We need common rules and need them to be enforced properly, which they are not always at the moment. In fact, I believe that the European Commission is contemplating infringement proceedings against the UK, not least because the Information Commissioner does not have the powers and resources that he needs. But we need those common rules and we need them to be properly enforced everywhere, including by our own Information Commissioner. Something that may emerge in future is the requirement to notify a breach of that personal data, which I would welcome. That is perhaps for the future. I hope that the noble Lord might rethink his approach on this, because we need the safeguards of common data protection laws.</p>

Presumably the data that might be handed over to this new authority would be handed over only provided it was within our own data protection law. Presumably data would not be handed over to this authority or to any country of the European Union unless that was in conformity with our own legislation&#151;and once they were handed over, they would be subject to the safeguards agreed by the European authority. Am I right in that? Is that how it is?</p>

However, I shall be so presumptuous as to attempt to reply. There is no authority, as he puts it; the data will concern things that happen in Europe, or people in Europe. It will be European data that we want to protect if they are shared, in the case of the CFSP, with other countries&#151;particularly the United States. With regard to the CFSP it would be narrowly drawn and might relate to things done under foreign policy, which at the moment include terrorist listing and financing and that sort of thing, given that national security and intelligence are outside the EU purview altogether and is reserved to member states.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08050650000003"></a>The data are not handed over to some authority; they may be handed over to the authorities of a third country, but the idea is to ensure that when they are handed over they are protected by the data protection rules and that, therefore, we can have some confidence in that regard. That will be monitored by all the 27 separate national data protection supervisors&#151;which in our case is called the Information Commissioner. I hope that that is clear.</p>

That is widely recognised as an essential part of what is needed to ensure that data protection is covered efficiently&#151;when I was a Minister responsible for data protection I spend a huge amount of my time dealing with this&#151;and that appropriate data sharing takes place. Those two&#151;data sharing and data protection&#151;go hand in hand.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08050650000008"></a>The purpose of Article 39 is to set out the specific rules for how we deal with data processing by member states in the issue of common foreign and security policy. A measure that we might be looking at would be, for example, personal data on individuals serving in EU crisis management missions, which would be agreed through the common foreign and security policy, to make sure that when dealing with their data we are suitably thinking about issues to do with data, processing and data protection.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08050650000009"></a>It is absolutely right and proper that these issues are covered in the Lisbon treaty, but in so doing we should recognise the distinctive character of CFSP by having a separate provision for the processing of data by member states in that context, and making it subject to the distinct rules and procedures, including adoption by unanimity. This new article provides that for the first time. Before the treaty in the second pillar there was no capacity to deal with data in the same way as, for example, we had sought to do in the third pillar for justice and home affairs.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08050650000010"></a>The amendment asks the Secretary of State to give an undertaking that he will not vote in favour of any decision that has different standards and penalties for reckless loss of data from those set out in the UK law, or Parliament agrees otherwise to adopt the decision.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08050650000011"></a>The amendment is unnecessary because any proposal would be subject to scrutiny by Parliament in the usual way, and of course it would require unanimity. We believe that the treaty makes sure that there are adequate safeguards to ensure that where provision is shared it should be subject to independent scrutiny. It says that&#151;the noble Lord has already quoted it&#151;compliance with these rules shall be subject to the control of independent authorities. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, is absolutely right that although the authorities will vary from member state to member state, as noble Lords know in our case this will be the Information Commissioner Richard Thomas, which of itself should bring some comfort to the noble Lord. The Information Commissioner and his office is a tried and tested source of information, support, guidance, advice and making sure there is compliance around issues to do with data, as well as the other issues he deals with.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08050650000012"></a>This is an important step forward. It is the first time that there has been expressed provision for data protection in relation to CFSP. Therefore, it is an improvement on the current position, particularly where I have indicated where the independent authority is. The scope for processing such data is likely to be limited. For example, in relation to people in missions, whether to take sanctions against individuals, or in relation to crisis management decisions. But the purpose of the  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_522"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>new provision is to recognise that data protection also applies to the processing of personal data by member states when they carry out their CFSP activities and to enable the Union to set rules to ensure that that data are presented.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08050650000013"></a>The European Union Committee conclusions were focused mainly on the repercussions on justice and home affairs issues in particular, as the noble Baroness, indicated, to try to clarify the scope and purpose of Article 39. I reassure the noble Baroness on passenger name records, which has been an important issue. That would not be covered under Article 39 as my honourable friend Jim Murphy indicated, but will be covered under Article 16, and therefore would remain appropriately as the noble Baroness would wish it to be.</p>

<a name="80506-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08050650000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, raised the issue of the coverage for intelligence agencies. These are not covered. The UK secured in the Lisbon treaty explicit confirmation that national security remains the sole competence of member states. We believe that that is a very important objective. It is important that intelligence agencies remain outside the scope of the treaties, as indeed they do. As the noble Lord indicated, discussions have been going on in another piece of legislation about the reckless loss of data. I understand that in the other place they are&#151;or may already have done so&#151;debating the question in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill to look at a civil monetary penalty, which I believe is supported by the Information Commissioner. It will be a government amendment and I think that there has been a great deal of support in your Lordships&#146; House for the proposals that have gone forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08050650000015"></a>Whether terrorism is covered within Article 39 depends, as the noble Baroness indicated, on the nature of the activity. It can also fall within justice and home affairs issues, depending on whether one is dealing with law enforcement, and can also be connected to security. The individual case that is before us raises a specific issue. I hope that the noble Lord will feel reassured that the independent authority is where it should be and that this covers very specific issues of CFSP for the first time. Therefore, it is a significant and important addition. Those issues to do with, for example, data sharing with the United States are covered under Article 16, as they would have been in the previous three-pillar structure that existed before this treaty was proposed or comes into force. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord can withdraw his amendment.</p>

Everything about the fund is to be decided by qualified majority voting, including the amounts that are to be paid by member states. Once again, the UK Government fought bravely but lost on this issue. They wanted the decisions about the fund to be taken by unanimity. That was overruled, so we are left with the QMV arrangements. The question is whether the Government expect to pay these moneys into the start-up fund in a way that is audited as a matter of course? If the prior agreement is on that and on the finances, management and procedures for the start-up fund, that would at least be reassuring. Could the Minister explain what the main objectives for the fund could be? Is it possible to begin to put ball-park figures on how much we are in for? Could she reassure us about the financial management and auditing of the fund concerned? Very large figures bandied about

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08050650000026"></a>In 2004, the European Council established the Athena mechanism to meet the requirement for limited common funding for military missions, and the funding can be dispersed rapidly. The text on a start-up fund predates the 2004 creation of the Athena mechanism and there is no member state consensus on whether the start-up fund will actually prove necessary. In launching the EU military operation to Chad and the Central African Republic, member states unanimously agreed a joint action which incorporated the common-costs element of the mission which was subject to the Athena mechanism. This enabled the rapid release of funds to launch the mission&#151;50 per cent of the funding was available immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08050650000027"></a>For activity not charged to the Union budget&#151;in other words, with defence and military implications&#151; the new provision envisaged a start-up fund made up of member state contributions. The Council is to agree by QMV to proposals from the high representative on, first, the procedures for setting up and financing the fund; secondly, the procedures for administering it; and, thirdly, the financial control procedures. However, the decision to launch an activity, and thus to draw down on the funds, would be subject to unanimity.</p>

The leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, made an interesting speech some weeks ago at Chatham House in which he proposed a common fund for NATO operations. Does the Conservative Party have any more detail on that? I imagine that it would have many characteristics similar to these proposals and it would be helpful to us, in discussing these proposals, if the Conservatives put more detail on, I suspect, their comparable proposals.</p>

That is paid without the specific authorisation of the House of Commons: it is based on the supply that is voted each year in the Budget, as no doubt this money would be.

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08050650000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, asked a perfectly fair question about why we do not have a common approach to all these things. They are very different operations and, as I made clear, I moved the amendment in a spirit of inquiry rather than with the intention of driving a wedge of a treaty-wrecking nature into the system. We cannot do that, as we know perfectly well, but we are required to look at this whole treaty and the Bill very closely indeed and we are doing our best.</p>

I say to the noble Lord that, as he understands, the Lisbon treaty does not change current practice in setting out where the administrative and operating expenditure is charged to the Union budget. It does not change where and how operations having defence or military implications are charged to member states. The rapid financing of EU civilian missions and military operations is important, as all noble Lords agree. The provision enables the Council to set up a start-up fund for preparatory activity for tasks with military and defence implications.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08050652000002"></a>For EU military missions, the rapid financing of early costs is important to allow missions to get under way. The start-up fund is another tool to enable this. As the noble Lord, Lord Lee, has said, the requirement for rapid financing of military missions has already been met by the Athena mechanism. The establishment of procedures for the start-up fund for activity with military and defence implications, as noble Lords have indicated, will be decided by QMV. We think that this is a sensible means of sharing the cost of an operation&#151;but a decision to launch any operation with military implications, and a decision to use the fund, will remain, as the noble Lord, Lord Lee, has said, subject to unanimity. The costs of national contributions to military ESDP operations will continue to lie where they fall. In other words, they will be borne by the contributing member states.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08050652000003"></a>Activity under CFSP, as we have discussed at length, is generally decided by unanimity, but there is limited scope for QMV&#151;as we discussed in the last, longer debate on the question of QMV in CFSP. The exceptions are for secondary or implementing measures. For example, the treaty provision introduces QMV for three specific  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_526"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>procedures for the start-up fund&#151;setting up and financing the fund; administering it; and the financial control procedures. The substantive issues, as we have said, lie still with unanimity&#151;a decision will be taken by the Council. Under existing procedures for informing Parliament of Council decisions, the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committee would scrutinise the decision to establish a start-up fund.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08050652000004"></a>Linked to this amendment is Amendment No. 100, which concerns provisions relating to funding arrangements for activities under CSFP, and in particular the new arrangements for access to rapid funding. Again, the Lisbon treaty does not change current practice on setting out where the administrative and operating expenditure is charged. It does not affect where and how operations having defence or military implications are charged. It does, however, set up new arrangements to enable the Council to access rapid financing for urgent preparatory CFSP activity. That, of course, includes rapid access to the EU budget to fund, for example, a civilian fact finding mission after a peace agreement has been signed; or rapid initial civilian deployments that could prepare the ground for a full crisis management mission.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08050652000005"></a>We want to be sure that, where member states feel that it is important to put a mission on the ground quickly, to support a peace agreement or to prevent conflict, financial procedures allow us to draw immediately on the budget. This change also provides for the Council to set up a start-up fund for preparatory activity for tasks with military and defence implications. That responds to the agenda set by the United Kingdom at the Hampton Court informal meeting of heads of government during our presidency, to ensure that we can respond quickly and effectively.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08050652000006"></a>We believe that this is an important aspect of being able to support the work of the EU, and the establishment of procedures will be decided by QMV. We think that it is a sensible means of burden sharing, but the decision to launch any fund remains subject to unanimity. The costs continue to lie where they fall, but it is too early to give figures&#151;the figures are all pure speculation at this stage and I cannot give them, as I guess the noble Lord would expect me to say. However, I hope that the noble Lord is reassured by what I have said about the way in which the fund will be set up and used, and the requirement of unanimity for the decision to do so, and then of QMV to move into the operations stage. I hope that the noble Lord will feel reassured and will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to spar with the noble Lord at the Dispatch Box again.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08050652000012"></a>Amendment No. 18A inserts a safeguard that the provisions and the development of a co-ordinated EU defence will not lead to the United Kingdom losing its right to take the final decision on the deployment of its troops. The other amendments in the group focus on provisions about which we have some concerns. At best, the provisions set up meaningless bureaucratic institutions, and at worst they represent the first step down a counterproductive path that will lead to reduced defence capability for Europe and for NATO.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08050652000013"></a>The cornerstone of the UK&#146;s and Europe&#146;s defence is NATO. It remains the only effective forum in which our European neighbours contribute to the goals of peacekeeping, conflict prevention and international security; and yet the treaty barely mentions it. To consider our future defence strategy without acknowledging the primacy of NATO or the overwhelming capability of our North American allies is meaningless. In Afghanistan, our troops are fighting alongside Americans and Canadians who are providing more troops to NATO there than any other ally.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08050652000014"></a>The United States Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, said during his Congressional nomination statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="08050652000029"></a>&#147;I would support the European Security and Defence Policy, based on the understanding that it would ... help build new European capabilities (that are also available to NATO) ... conduct operations &#145;where NATO is not engaged&#146; ... do so in a manner that is cooperative, not competitive or duplicative, with NATO&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050652000025"></a>The provisions do none of those things. They provide no incentive to build new European capabilities, add nothing to the NATO remit and are entirely duplicative. We are being asked to sign up to a ghost NATO, a duplication of its structures and principles, with nothing behind it. The Bill rightly excludes the parts of the treaty dealing with CFSP from UK law; foreign policy,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_528"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 528</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>especially when it comes to defence, cannot be imposed on an unwilling Government. Yet, the treaty suggests that the Commission, a supranational organisation, should have a say in the development and implementation of our defence policy through the high representative, who is even to be given the right to propose military operations. That appears to be completely unfeasible. Examples abound of crises where the EU has been unable to take action because of internal divisions&#151;Kosovo is often mentioned&#151;and it provides a textbook example of how effective an intergovernmental, rather than a supragovernmental, organisation can be in contrast.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08050652000015"></a>We are concerned that these provisions will be an expensive distraction from real issues in UK defence. What can we do more closely and effectively to engage European members in NATO? What provision does the treaty make for including Turkey, which is one of the few NATO members that spend more than the recommended 2 per cent on defence? It makes no provision at all, since the EU is divided on the role that Turkey should play in its future. How can the EU have a meaningful military role outside NATO when it actively excludes the only countries, other than the UK, that are willing to spend money on the Armed Forces? It is vital that Parliament should have a final say in the deployment of our troops, hence Amendment No. 18A. The others are probing amendments. I beg to move.</p>

I led NATO for four years, but I am also a passionate European. More than both of those, I am a passionate realist. I live in the United Kingdom; we are part of the European continent and a European community of nations. If we are to look after ourselves and our neighbourhood, we must have provisions to allow that to happen. Simply relying on the institutions, capabilities and attitudes with which we dealt with previous enemies will simply not be good enough in future.</p>

The American Administration of President Clinton and that of George W Bush when Donald Rumsfeld was Defense Secretary&#151;and now Robert Gates&#151;supported the concept of European defence. That is a European defence that is not competitive with NATO, is not a duplicate of NATO and is not, as the noble Lord, said, a ghost of NATO. As somebody who led that alliance, I assure him that the proposals in the Lisbon treaty under the provisions known as Berlin Plus, whereby the European Union for autonomous missions can neutralise the capabilities of NATO through a prescribed procedure, are all designed to ensure that Europe has the capability.</p>

Do we wait for what the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, said was the decision of the Americans on some occasions to say sorry; they could not do it as they were full up.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08050652000019"></a>That has already happened. In the early part of 1997 Albania went into meltdown. A country simply collapsed, perversely enough, over a banking scheme that went wrong&#151;a pyramid scheme that got out of control and led to a country essentially going into meltdown. Workers destroyed their own factories and machines. Enver Hoxha&#146;s huge stock of rifles and ammunition was broken into and people shot each other. In that crisis the United States of America said no. NATO said, &#147;Too small, too local, not our business. Europe, you look after it&#148;. By a process of a coalition of the willing, led by the Italians who had a direct interest in the people who were fleeing across the Adriatic sea, a number of nations, which did not include the United Kingdom, and a bit of good luck, Albania was saved, and it is now joining the European Union and NATO itself just 10 years after that took place.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08050652000020"></a>It is not an imaginary scenario to say that something will come along and that Europe will have to take responsibility for that. The Albanian experience took place just before we came in, in May 1997, and I cast no blame on my predecessor Michael Portillo for taking his decision then. Through what we experienced at the end of Bosnia and in Kosovo, I have been worried ever since about what we would do if something else happened in Europe.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08050652000021"></a>The issue is one of capabilities. I am reassured, rather than worried or scared, by this treaty because for the very first time a European Union treaty has actually taken responsibility for where we need to address that. For from not mentioning NATO, as the noble Lord said, the treaty states in Article 42 of Section 2:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08050652000030"></a>&#147;Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050652000026"></a>So that is what we wanted. For a long time we have wanted the European Union explicitly and categorically to state the role of NATO, and there it is in stark terms. For those who say that it hardly mentions NATO, NATO is there.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08050652000022"></a>Not only that, but the architects of the Lisbon treaty also listened to the key issue of European defence: the inability of Europe to translate a wiring diagram into capabilities to deal with a crisis. I used to say when I was Defence Secretary, and then repeatedly and relentlessly&#151;to an almost boring extent&#151;in NATO, &#147;You can&#146;t send a wiring diagram to a crisis&#148;. You can have all the fancy procedures in the world, all the books and magazines, and all the great PowerPoint presentations; at the end of the day, you have got to be

Article 42 of Section 2 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08050652000031"></a>&#147;Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050652000027"></a>It then goes on to say how that will be done: a European Defence Agency, the subject of a later group of amendments. That was a British idea, floated by the British Government in order to give some teeth to the sentiment here, that we will progressively improve our capabilities. We have taken two major steps forward in the European Union in, first, recognising the deficiency, which the treaty does, and, secondly, by saying that NATO is the cornerstone of what we do.</p>

<a name="80506-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08050652000023"></a>Nobody is suggesting that there is going to be a single European army. I do not even think that William Cash and company down the Corridor have gone on about Mr Prodi&#146;s European army any more. There was never any thought of a European army, and there is none. If there is to be a European rapid reaction force, it will be made up of components from different nation states, usually with a headquarters based in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe at Mons. That will almost invariably be the case&#151;after all, the troops serving in the aftermath of the Pakistan earthquake and helping the African Union in Darfur are all being co-ordinated by SHAPE in Mons in Belgium. So we are not talking in those terms; we are talking about component parts that will allow Europe to fulfil its own destiny and deal with problems and crises that occur in our neighbourhood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08050652000024"></a>We listened to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, in the previous debate, telling us of fantasies that we have heard so often before: that Europeans will drag this mighty United Kingdom into something that we do not want to do. I do not know where the noble Lord has been, but I know where he started off: in the Royal Air Force. It was the United Kingdom trying to drag other European countries into dealing with serious problems. I cannot think of a single instance where other European countries have dragged the United Kingdom unwillingly into dealing with some of these problems.</p>

His memory lapse must have involved him forgetting that the Americans did not support us in the Falklands either. The United States sat firmly, albeit occasionally uncomfortably, on the fence while the task force went down to the Falkland Islands. Mrs Jeane Kirkpatrick made absolutely certain that President Reagan was not going to support the Iron Lady in her mad escapade that would overturn American foreign policy in Latin America.

Even this country did not get involved in Vietnam. When it came to Iraq, there was a division among the allies, as there was in the United Nations Security Council. There will be times when we will act together and times when we are divided and individual countries will go their own way or be part of coalitions of the willing. However, where we need to act, where we should act and where there is a collective interest in doing so, we must have the capabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08050660000003"></a>I am a bit tired of the arguments over the Iraq war. I supported the invasion at the time, as did the Conservative Party and a number of other people, but we have gone way beyond that, and terrible mistakes were made after that as well. I think that if we had not dealt with Saddam Hussein at the time we would be dealing with him now. The fact is that there was a division among the allies at that time. Some felt it was important and urgent that we went ahead, and we did. The idea that anything in this treaty or, indeed, the previous treaty or the Maastricht treaty&#151;which was, after all, signed by the Conservative Government and is the first time that a European defence was talked about in a treaty&#151;is going to bind us and grip us together is nonsense because we will remain in charge of our own destiny. I believe that European defence is good and will reinforce NATO as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08050660000004"></a>Where I am critical, almost to the point of feelings of anger and impotence, is because we in Europe are able to do so little. We talk a great game. Even the critics of the treaty talk a great game about what we can do, what they can do, what they will do and how they will drag us into it, but the reality is so puny. The European Union is an economic giant, yet it is a military nonentity. If we take the graphic statistics, boots on the ground are what count in most missions today. There are 1.5 million Europeans in regular forces and another 1 million in reserves. That is about twice what the United States of America has, yet of all these people who the taxpayers of Europe are paying for, only about 2 per cent can be deployed in the kinds of missions that will be required for the future. Lots of them are ready and prepared and are part of grandiose plans to stop the Soviet Union invading Europe; there are still tank formations that have that primary objective. However, in terms of what we need to do now, only 2 per cent of all those troops can be used. We have twice as many fast jets in the European portfolio than the United States of America has, but only 10 per cent of them can fly day and night in all weathers and deliver guided precision weapons, the only kind of weapon that will have any utility in future.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08050660000005"></a>In each of the catalogues&#151;apart from tanks, of which we have more than enough&#151;we are grossly and seriously deficient. If a decision about Kosovo had to be taken today, I sometimes wonder whether we would be in any better position, almost 10 years on, to be able to do what we did then&#151;to complete a mission in 78 days without a single casualty on the allies&#146; side and to achieve all the objectives that we set out. I fear and worry that we cannot. We are not much further on, but I certainly hope that, in this treaty, we have started to do what is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08050660000006"></a>In the previous debate, and probably in this one as well, we will talk about the reality of what is going on. My noble friend Lady Ashton outlined a number of the areas where the common foreign policy is working and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, mentioned a few areas where there is great potential for the future.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08050660000007"></a>One experience during my time in NATO has almost disappeared from the scene. It was an insurgency in the small country of Macedonia&#151;still obliged by the United Nations to be called the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It was scandalously&#151;and I say that with great deliberation&#151;excluded from an invitation to NATO membership at the recent Bucharest summit because of an unreasonable and indefensible veto by Greece on that country, simply because it will not change its name. However, in 2001, it was beset by an insurgency and all of the agencies came together&#151;the European Union, NATO, the OSCE, the World Bank, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the European Union&#146;s representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown. Everyone got involved.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08050660000008"></a>Javier Solana and I went to Macedonia 11 times between March and November of that year. It got huge coverage and was the biggest story of that time. In the <I>Times</I>, Sir Simon Jenkins, wrote an article saying that it was an unmitigated disaster that we were getting involved in yet another Balkan swamp. The strap line to his front-page article said, with the characteristic understatement for which Simon Jenkins is so well known, that I would not be content until the Balkans were aflame from the Adriatic to Istanbul.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08050660000009"></a>However, all those agencies came together, worked together, on the ground at the highest and lowest levels. A peace plan was designed and, of course, Macedonia is now on the brink of both European Union and NATO membership. If people would like to learn a little more about it, the Royal United Services Institute has just published a small book by Mark Laity, who used to be my representative in Macedonia at the time, chronicling both what happened there and the lessons from it. It is well worth reading for those who would like to know, not about the scary prospects of European defence, but about how it works in action. I think that is of more relevance, frankly, than a lot of the scaremongering we have heard as each stage of the European integration debate has gone along.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08050660000010"></a>However, I say, and I know that my successor would also say, had he been here in the House of Lords as well, that what the treaty proposes&#151;the Berlin-plus arrangements and European defence as part of the common and foreign security policy&#151;will strengthen and not compete with NATO. It will not duplicate NATO but provide assets that will be useful to NATO as a whole. Overall it will add to our capability as Europeans to be able to defend ourselves from the threats of the future rather than the enemies of the past.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000052"></a>Those were the words of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, at Second Reading on 1 April&#151;words which I and my colleagues on these Benches happily endorse. The fundamental difference between us is that while we believe that the Lisbon treaty takes us in this direction, the noble Lord believes that it risks taking us in the opposite direction, or at least gives rise to certain doubts to that effect, a number of which are reflected in the amendments that we are discussing this evening.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08050660000012"></a>Since its first peacekeeping operation in 2003, the European Union has undertaken roughly 20 missions under its European security and defence policy. Although these operations have been relatively small&#151;the largest was a 7,000-strong peacekeeping operation in Bosnia that is now down to 2,500&#151;most ESDP missions have not been primarily military operations. More interesting have been their complexity and range: preventing civil unrest in Macedonia, reforming the Congolese army and the Georgian judicial system, training Afghan and Iraqi police forces, monitoring the Rafah crossing point in Gaza and overseeing the implementation of the peace agreement in Aceh. Demand for EU action is growing&#151;witness the developing deployments in Kosovo and eastern Chad.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08050660000013"></a>The UK has always supported foreign policy co-operation with our EU partners. If we now want meaningful foreign policy co-operation that amounts to common policies and action among 27 countries, it is in the UK&#146;s interests to support the arrangements needed to make this possible. The UK has the ultimate safeguard in the CFSP in that no decision can be taken without its consent or at least acquiescence. Under the Lisbon treaty, the important decisions will continue to be taken unanimously. There is a provision in the existing treaties for implementing decisions to be taken by qualified majority voting, but it is never really used. There is also the so-called emergency break, or safety net. If a likely QMV decision will affect a member state&#146;s vital interests, no vote can be taken. If no agreement can be reached, the issue can be referred to the European Council, but the European Council decides the issue unanimously.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08050660000014"></a>On the relationship between a closer European defence policy and NATO&#151;it is a great privilege to follow the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Robertson&#151;we on these Benches do not believe that there is any conflict, and we fully accept the primacy of NATO. As the impact assessment from our own committee on the treaty of Lisbon concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08050660000068"></a>&#147;The central role of NATO in the defence policy of certain Member States such as the UK will continue to be recognised under the new Treaties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08050660000015"></a>As Victoria Nuland, the US ambassador to NATO, made clear in a speech on 22 February,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="08050660000081"></a>&#147;I am here today in Paris to say that we agree with France&#151;Europe needs, the United States needs, NATO needs, the democratic world needs&#151;a stronger, more capable European defense capacity. An ESDP with only soft power is not enough&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08050660000053"></a>Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, again in his Second Reading speech,</p>
<ul><a name="08050660000082"></a>&#147;the continuing leading of NATO is of the highest priority&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 1/4/08; col. 959.]</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000054"></a>We concur with that sentiment. As the impact assessment concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="08050660000069"></a>&#147;As regards the EU Member States, such as the UK, which are also members of NATO, the Lisbon Treaty will not change the current situation with regards to their collective defence, which will continue to be organised and implemented in the framework of NATO&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="08050660000016"></a><a name="80506-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80506-0016.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08050660000094"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> This debate, like many others in this Committee, brings d&#233;j  vu all over again. It strikes me that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition are now more concerned about the United States attitude towards European defence than the United States is, as the noble Lord, Lord Lee, has just demonstrated by the quotation that he gave and as the various quotations from the US Secretary of State and the President of the United States showed in the run-up to the Bucharest meeting. The US actually wants the European Union to move in this direction. It knows perfectly well what is in the Lisbon treaty. If it did not like it, it would say so, but it is not; it is saying the opposite. There we are, then&#151;or, rather, there Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition are, manoeuvring themselves into the position which they got into over the reunification of Germany while in government. We all know where that ended; in tears. That should not happen again; frankly, it is clear that things have moved on and that the United States wants Europe to get its act together.</p>
<a name="time_36"></a>
<a name="80506-0016.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08050660000091"></a>9.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08050660000017"></a>Secondly, the provisions in the Lisbon treaty seem important for European defence capacities. The noble Lord is quite right to emphasise that capacity is very important, but we should just reflect on this: for every country in Europe which might find the need to strengthen its capacity in NATO compelling, which I believe would be this country&#146;s view, three or four are more likely to be moved by the argument that they need to make the European capacity to fulfil the Lisbon treaty a reality.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08050660000018"></a>We have to understand that other people sometimes look at these things a little differently from us, but that the net outcome will benefit us. If their defence capacity increases and they are members of NATO, that will be good news for us too. If they do so because of the provisions in the Lisbon treaty&#151;including those for enhanced co-operation, which will invite people who really want to put their backs into this to go ahead&#151;then that will also be good news for this country.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08050660000019"></a>I hope that the Opposition will be convinced that this amendment should not be pressed. I find it a bit puzzling that they seem to be constructing a completely new set of provisions to deal with powers that will be covered by the war powers resolution that the Government have committed to bring to this House. I imagine that we would all agree that European Union operations involving hostilities should be treated in exactly the same way as all other such operations, not by a different and more restrictive set of provisions.</p>

He, of course, has wide experience in government, in NATO and elsewhere on defence matters. I would not, perhaps, have been on my feet had he not referred to scare stories on defence matters. There have been no scare stories; such matters, in my experience, were introduced into discussions on the European Union in the Single European Act. They first appeared then, so when, for example, we first discussed the issue in 1972 there was no suggestion that there would be a European Union with a defence aspect.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08050660000021"></a>Bit by bit, defence has been introduced into the treaties&#151;and piece by piece, the defence aspect has been built up as being far more important than we were assured in previous debates that it would be. For example, while discussing the Nice treaty, I well remember testing the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, about a European army. She was a Minister of State at that time and really set about me, saying that I was talking absolute rubbish about that&#151;so I, of course, accepted what she said. I respected her as a good Minister and thought, &#147;Well, that&#146;s put me in my place&#148;. The following day&#151;the noble Lord referred to this&#151;we found that Mr Prodi was saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="08050660000070"></a>&#147;When I was talking about the European army, I was not joking. If you don&#146;t want to call it a European army, don&#146;t call it a European army. You can call it &#145;Margaret&#146;, you can call it &#145;Mary Ann&#146;, you can call it any name&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000022"></a>Mr Prodi was then the President of the Commission. So I thought about who was right, and I thought that it had to be the noble Baroness, Lady Symons. But it appears that it was not because, on 23 March 2008, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="08050660000071"></a>&#147;Within the EU itself, we will have to move closer to establishing a common European army&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000055"></a>On 16 July 2007, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="08050660000072"></a>&#147;The basis for a European Defence exists. We must make it grow. I want Europe to be capable of ensuring its security autonomously&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08050660000023"></a>Those of us who do not really want a European army, which would be responsible to the institutions of the European Union, want proper co-operation between independent nation states. I think we all want that. Some of us are afraid of a European army per se. The noble Lord, Lord Robertson, said, &#147;It ain&#146;t gonna happen&#148;. I hope he is right, but the problem is that ratchet by ratchet the whole defence aspect is growing. A sort of high-command structure and a procurement structure have been set out. We are rationalising&#151;if that is the right way to do it&#151;defence equipment, so that bit by bit the whole basis for a European army is being built up.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08050660000024"></a>Do not blame those of us who mentioned these things before. We are worn out by the remarks and statements of the former President of the European Commission, the German Chancellor and the French President. I hope that in future people will not say that we are putting scare stories about. This is a serious debate, which deserves great scrutiny and intelligent scrutiny, which it has had so far. We must

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08050660000025"></a>Finally, I support Amendment No. 18A, which proposes that both Houses of Parliament should not only be consulted, but also give their consent to the employment of British troops under the arrangements proposed in the treaty. That is extremely important. I believe that somehow or other we must get assurances that that will be so. The Government will find that easy to do, because Mr Brown, on becoming Prime Minister, promised that British troops would not be committed in Europe or anywhere else without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. I hope that the government spokesman will give us that assurance tonight. He can safely do that in the light of the promise made by our Prime Minister, who is an honourable man and, I am sure, would not have made that statement unless he intended to see that it was carried out.</p>

But I find myself searching to understand what these words in the treaty, like so much else in it, mean. The trouble is that we seem now to have a common pattern where we are told that the words should not be taken to mean what they say, because somewhere else in the treaty there is a declaration or protocol that says exactly the opposite, or the Government assure us that the words do not need to be taken seriously because they have them under lock and key, and that they would never be used.</p>

<a name="80506-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08050660000027"></a>As an example, the article referred to by Amendment No. 20 talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="08050660000083"></a>&#147;the progressive framing of a common defence policy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000056"></a>It goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="08050660000073"></a>&#147;This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000057"></a>To me a common defence means an integrated force. It does not say &#147;a common policy&#148; or &#147;an alliance&#148;; it says &#147;a common defence&#148;, which sounds as though we are forming a common force with our allies to defend ourselves jointly. That may well be what is intended and it does say,</p>
<ul><a name="08050660000084"></a>&#147;when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000058"></a>But many of us have a problem with the thought of a common defence. The noble Lord, Lord Robertson, assures us that it would be a building block of NATO rather than duplication and yet, in the cold light of day, we know that many of our European neighbours have a very different view of NATO&#151;indeed a fairly antagonistic view. The thought that we would be forming a common defence force with those other members of Europe that would not be antagonistic&#151;</p>

If they are, that is quite consequential for the United Kingdom&#146;s future policy. The Government may say, &#147;This will never happen. We are not advocating a common defence. When the European Council acts unanimously, we will do this. We will never agree to it. You can forget all about it because this is a locked room&#148;. The trouble is, this treaty is full of locked rooms with the Government saying, &#147;You do not need to worry about what is in this room because we will keep it locked&#148;. I feel slightly uneasy about agreeing to a treaty that has lots of rooms that the Government will keep locked because they can veto them. Or are the Government saying, &#147;Actually, we are very keen that this room should be part of the treaty. We want this common defence&#148;? In that case, this seems a very significant step to include in one article of the treaty without explaining more fully to the British public and to the House what &#147;a common defence&#148; means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08050660000036"></a>My second question to the Minister is even simpler: does he agree with the recent statement of the Polish Defence Minister, Mr Bogdan Klich, who has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="08050660000077"></a>&#147;We are in favour of a much stronger role for European defence, and that would include a military headquarters&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000065"></a>Do Her Majesty's Government support the independent military command structure for the European army? If, as I suspect, they do, where will the money come from? Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, with his vast experience in this field, can enlighten us. Where will the money for this European army come from, particularly for the lift and intelligence which will be necessary and for which, at the moment, the European Union presumes to depend on the United States of America?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08050660000038"></a>We were lucky enough to hear a tour de force of a speech by my noble friend Lord Robertson, using his vast experience to inform the Committee.

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08050660000039"></a>The amendments relating to the common security and defence policy would exclude innovations in the area of defence introduced by the Lisbon treaty, but would also remove changes which are not substantial but reflect existing practice. Indeed, one amendment, no doubt a probing amendment, seeks to remove the  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_539"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>CSDP altogether. That is not a position that the Government can support; indeed, I think very few noble Lords would support it as a principle that is not in the interests of our country.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08050660000040"></a>I shall make a few general comments about why we support the common security and defence policy, and then address each amendment in turn, doing my best to answer the points that have been made in the debate. Noble Lords will know that the common security and defence policy, currently known as the European security and defence policy, is not a new beast. The Maastricht treaty set the Union the objective of,</p>
<ul><a name="08050660000088"></a>&#147;the implementation of a common foreign and security policy including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000041"></a>I am pleased and proud to say that we, as a country, have driven this process forward. The UK-French declaration at St Malo in 1998, where the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, played a prominent part, led directly to the creation of what became known as the ESDP. The treaty of Nice, some two years later, subsequently established the structures and procedures to give political control and strategic direction to ESDP. ESDP helps the European Union in its efforts to be an effective conflict-prevention and crisis-management actor to the benefit of both the international community and ourselves. EU missions bring real benefits to people on the ground today. This is what my noble friend Lord Robertson had in mind when he talked about the reality of the situation, whether it is in Bosnia, where a military operation provides a safe and secure environment for continuing stabilisation efforts; in Afghanistan, where a civilian mission is helping to reform the Afghan national police; or in Chad in Africa, where a military operation provides a secure environment for refugee camps. We can be proud of what these missions are achieving.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08050660000042"></a>We have led the way in pushing for the development and enhancement of an effective ESDP. The defence provisions of the treaty contribute&#151;and this is fundamental&#151;to the open, flexible, militarily robust and NATO-friendly ESDP that the UK pioneered and supports. Let us be clear: the provisions of the Lisbon treaty do not alter the long-established fundamental principles of ESDP, which we support. Unanimity remains the primary method for decision-making. The UK will always have a veto on whether the EU should undertake a particular operation. Member states offer military or civilian assets on a voluntary basis. The UK always decides for itself whether it will contribute to any operation. There is no European army. ESDP is about crisis management, not war fighting. The so-called St Petersburg tasks that ESDP is designed to undertake make this crystal clear.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08050660000043"></a>As noble Lords will recognise, there are many threats to international security that require an international response. We therefore need to take advantage of the collective will of European partners to participate in crisis management and stabilisation tasks in support of the international community. The particular combination of civilian and military instruments that ESDP offers endows the EU with what I would argue is a unique capacity that can and does add real value to international stabilisation efforts. In spite of what  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_540"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been said, there is and remains a clear recognition of NATO as the foundation of its members&#146; collective defence. As the EU Select Committee report states:</p>
<ul><a name="08050660000089"></a>&#147;the central role of NATO in the defence policy of certain member states such as the UK will continue to be recognised under the new treaties&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08050660000044"></a>Indeed, Article 42 of the Lisbon treaty says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="08050660000078"></a>&#147;The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000066"></a>It could hardly be clearer.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08050660000045"></a>The ESDP complements rather than competes with NATO. There will of course be times when NATO is best placed to respond; that will nearly always be the case if high-intensity combat is envisaged. Conversely, there will times when only the EU will have the right tools to respond. I pray in aid of that the Palestinian territories, where ESDP activities provide a good example. Additionally, the ESDP can help share the burden of ensuring European stability&#151;for example, as it has done by taking over from NATO the stabilisation force in Bosnia. Increasingly, both the EU and NATO will be operating in the same theatre, such as in Afghanistan, but bringing to bear distinct but complementary instruments and capabilities.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08050660000046"></a>We strongly support renewed efforts to address the need for both organisations to work effectively together, and indeed with other security actors&#151;because there are others in the world&#151;such as the United Nations and the African Union. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, referred to Bucharest. I draw the attention of noble Lords to the recent NATO Bucharest summit communiqu&#233; which stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="08050660000079"></a>&#147;We recognise the value that a stronger and more capable European defence brings, providing capabilities to address the common challenges both NATO and the EU face. We therefore support mutually reinforcing efforts to this end&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08050660000047"></a>For those noble Lords who still express concern that the ESDP somehow undermines NATO and the transatlantic alliance, I quote the President of the United States, President George Bush, who said in advance of the Bucharest summit:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="08050660000080"></a>&#147;Building a strong NATO Alliance also requires a strong European defence capacity. So at this summit, I will encourage our European partners to increase their defence investments to support both NATO and EU operations. America believes if Europeans invest in their own defence, they will also be stronger and more capable when we deploy together&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050660000048"></a>Surely that must give food for thought to those who still maintain that somehow there is this inherent conflict between NATO and the EU capabilities.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="08050660000049"></a>The ESDP provides a mechanism to leverage European capability improvements. As my noble friend Lord Robertson said earlier, the issue is, frankly, capabilities. This remains a key objective&#151;it has to, given the position in Europe. Since there is a single set of forces in Europe, these improvements will be available to NATO as well. The ESDP is a key vehicle through which EU member states can share

This directly benefits ourselves as well as strengthening the transatlantic alliance.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08050660000050"></a>I shall speak to the amendments in turn, taking some of them together since they are substantially the same. Amendment No. 18A would seek to exclude the Government deploying troops unless both Houses of Parliament have formally given approval. That seems to have two sides to it; one is about British troops being forced to fight in Europe and the other is about constitutional changes that may take place. Let me be clear at the outset that there is no question now or in future of the European Union forcing British troops to be deployed against our wishes. Any decisions, agreeing to and subsequently launching an EU operation, is by unanimity. If we do not think that an EU operation is advisable, we will be able to veto it.</p>

At one level it would be a decision for the Executive too. It would be the British Government of whatever colour who would say, &#147;We don&#146;t think this is an occasion for British troops&#148;. They would have the absolute right&#151;this is what seems to be denied elsewhere&#151;to say &#147;No. No British troops&#148;. All decisions regarding whether particular member states wish to participate in an agreed ESDP operation, whether by providing troops or other assets, are for those members states to take by themselves. All forces are offered to the EU on a voluntary basis. That has been the case since ESDP began. There is nothing in the Lisbon treaty that changes that.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0805072000002"></a>We have just discussed the Government&#146;s proposals to give Parliament a say&#151;this is the second limb of Amendment No. 18A&#151;over the deployment of our Armed Forces into conflict overseas. The White Paper has been referred to. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, referred to what the Prime Minister said just after he took office. The White Paper published in March of this year outlines proposals granting Parliament the power to approve such deployments. A draft resolution seeking to implement these proposals has been released. That draft resolution is designed to achieve parliamentary oversight of UK deployments while maintaining the operational flexibility necessary to address emergencies or maintain secrecy. Furthermore, the choice of a resolution as a mechanism for the changes eliminates the liability of forces personnel to indictment. There are matters still to be considered in relation to those proposals. They are being considered and discussed as we speak. It would not be appropriate to seek to anticipate that discussion further here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0805072000003"></a>Amendment No. 109 seeks to exclude the common security and defence policy from the scope of the Bill. I hope I have made the Government&#146;s position clear on that. We think it brings benefits to the UK in terms of enhanced security and greater global stability. The noble Lord, Lord Lee, in his excellent speech, mentioned a number of ESDP missions that the EU has. I am not going to repeat them. They are around the world in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In some of the most

It is for that reason in itself that we would reject Amendment No. 109, which, as I said earlier, I take to be an amendment to raise discussion.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0805072000004"></a>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 would seek to exclude the provision on the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, talked about this issue. Noble Lords will know that the provision on common defence is not new. As noted by the European Union Committee report, it was first established at Maastricht. The references to a common defence draw directly on the Maastricht language.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0805072000005"></a>The Lisbon treaty retains the clear requirement that any move to a common European Union defence would require two conditions to be met, just as in the current treaty on European Union. First, such a move will only be,</p>
<ul><a name="0805072000075"></a>&#147;when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000052"></a>We retain a veto over any such decision. In addition, the Lisbon treaty goes on to make clear:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="0805072000064"></a>&#147;It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000053"></a>It is the double lock that we hear so much about&#151;unanimity in Europe and then each country following its own constitutional requirements before that could happen. The possibility of any British Government of whatever complexion going down this road is so remote that it seems to me that it is extraordinarily unlikely that it would happen.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0805072000006"></a>Some noble Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, in particular, referred to the wording regarding common defence,. The Lisbon treaty states that a common defence policy,</p>
<ul><a name="0805072000076"></a>&#147;might lead to a common defence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000054"></a>Regarding a common defence policy, it also states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="0805072000065"></a>&#147;This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000055"></a>I should have thought that any reasonable analysis of that use of language suggests that is simply two ways of saying the same thing.</p>

At the present time, the Executive can make war without the consent of Parliament. That is the constitutional position. The Prime Minister has said that he wants Parliament to be given the right to say yes or no. All we want is an assurance that if that is agreed by Parliament, that system of parliamentary approval will also apply to going to war, providing troops to a European adventure, going to the assistance of another country, or whatever you might call it.</p>

There is a definite role for Parliament to play in the eventuality that we decided. As I said, it is an extraordinarily remote possibility that we would decide that it was in our interests to have a common European Union defence policy. If all other 26 European countries agreed that at the same time, then of course Parliament would have a role, undefined at the present time&#151;let me be clear about that&#151;but Parliament having a role means that Parliament could say yes or no.

If the noble Lord is saying that it is extremely unlikely that the United Kingdom would want to join in the common defence policy and the Minister is assuring us there is a double lock to prevent that, is the Minister effectively saying that the Government would be happy to accept Amendment No. 20, which removes this provision from the treaty if it were that that required the treaty negotiation? In other words, the Government would be quite happy not to have this provision in the treaty; it is just that they cannot get rid of it.</p>

The provision that the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, is trying to remove is a part of the treaty itself, so this is a wrecking amendment. It is as simple as that. The issue before us is whether this provision in the Lisbon treaty contains operational provisions. It does not. It merely states that if the European Council so decides, it may move on to another stage, but surely it will be up to the Government

For him to say that there is a huge difference between Maastricht and what is stated in the Lisbon treaty is absolutely against the use of a good sense of language. It is quite clear that the &#147;will&#148; that appears in the Lisbon treaty applies only if and when there is unanimity in the Council. The position is absolutely the same. So, Members of the Committee should be aware that the Lisbon treaty does not alter the current situation with regard to EU member states such as the UK which are also members of NATO. As the Select Committee report noted, the treaty makes it clear that the collective defence of such member states will continue to be organised and implemented through NATO.</p>

<a name="80506-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0805072000023"></a>At paragraph 7.112, the EU Committee report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="0805072000067"></a>&#147;What will not change is that a unanimous European Council decision will be necessary before the EU moves to establish a common defence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0805072000024"></a>Amendments Nos. 21A and 101 would seek to exclude the provision on member states making their civilian and military capabilities available to the EU to undertake operations and missions within the remit of the common security and defence policy. The provision reflects practice since the establishment of the policy. There is no standing EU army. Indeed, EU member states offer on a voluntary basis civilian military capabilities

After the European Council has decided by unanimity to undertake a mission or operation, those member states which are willing and able to participate in a specific mission will provide national forces during the force generation process. This reflects the reality that all of the EU forces belong to the member states and not to the Union itself. We welcome the fact that the treaty emphasises that common security and defence objectives will be pursued by means of member state capabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0805072000025"></a>Amendment No. 22 seeks to exclude the provision on entrusting the implementation of European security and defence policy tasks to a group of member states that are willing and have the necessary capabilities for such tasks. Although this is a new treaty article, it reflects current practice. The EU Committee report noted:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="0805072000068"></a>&#147;The provisions on the European Defence Agency and on crisis management missions are a codification of current practice and will therefore have little impact on the European Security and Defence Policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000058"></a>The Council already decides by unanimity to entrust the implementation of an ESDP operational mission to the group of member states willing and able to lead or participate. This is the case, for example, in the recent missions to Chad, where France is the lead nation, with some 10 other member states providing forces. Let me remind the House that the launch of any EU operation requires unanimity. Lisbon treaty Article 1.49.C4&#151;new Article 42.4.TEU of the consolidated treaty&#151;says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="0805072000069"></a>&#147;Decisions relating to the common security and defence policy, including those initiating a mission ... shall be adopted by the Council acting unanimously&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000059"></a>I repeat&#151;any decision to deploy UK troops for an EU-led operation will continue to rest with the UK Government.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0805072000026"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 99 seeks to exclude the provision that allows, in principle, enhanced co-operation to be established for matters with military and defence implications. The procedures for enhanced co-operation originate in the treaty of Amsterdam, but they have never been used. Enhanced co-operation allows a group of member states to work together without affecting those that do not want to. Under the Lisbon treaty, the process would be triggered when at least nine member states want to co-operate in a specific area. The Lisbon treaty makes clear that any decision to set up enhanced co-operation in the area of CFSP, including in areas with military or defence implications, will be taken by the Council acting in unanimity. Enhanced co-operation with military or defence implications cannot take place without the approval of the UK Government. As I have said, it has never been used and there is no proposal for it to be utilised. We would consider any future proposals on their own merits.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="0805072000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, asked a couple of questions. He asked me about the defence industry and procurement. The UK Government support improved co-operation among Governments in order to provide Europe with a strong defence, industrial and technological base. This will help the development of military capabilities, the importance of which we have heard  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_546"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 546</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about and which lies at the heart of this debate. Do we support military command HQ? We do not believe that an EU operational headquarters would be the best use of scarce resources. That is why we agreed on an EU operations centre that can be activated when necessary.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="0805072000028"></a>I finish with a quotation from the successor to my noble friend, Lord Robertson. The present Secretary-General of NATO, who was referred to during the debate, said on 29 January 2007 that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805072000077"></a>&#147;an ESDP must be seen as an opportunity, not a danger. And no one today would still seriously assert that NATO and the EU are rivals whose aim is to drive each other out of business&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000060"></a>He went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="0805072000070"></a>&#147;Such discussions are now altogether obsolete if they ever existed in the past&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000061"></a>I am afraid that the Secretary-General may have been a little optimistic, because some voices are still saying that NATO and the EU are set on a collision course. That is nonsense and I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendments.</p>

One question I put to the noble Lord that he has not answered&#151;he may want to come back to it at Report&#151;is: where is the money for this dangerous dream? Where is the money for lift and intelligence? Or are we going to go on relying on the United States for that?</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="0805072000030"></a>I think the noble Lord said that the Government do not approve of an independent command centre or independent military centre in Brussels, in which case we look forward to the conflict that their position will create with the Poles, the French and others. I noticed that in his reply the noble Lord did not mention the Farnborough agreement. Maybe that is something that we can come back to on Report. I want to put those matters on the record before we move on from this amendment, unless the noble Lord has more precise information to give at the moment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Robertson, spoke with great authority as a former Secretary of State for Defence and an eminent Secretary-General of NATO. The noble Lord said that he is passionate about Europe; I am also passionate about Europe. I worked in France for 11 years, and I spend a lot of time out there.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="0805072000032"></a>I was very reassured by what the noble Lord said, and I make no apologies for raising these issues. None of us wants to see NATO being undermined by these provisions. It has served us well for 60 years, and we do not want to drive a wedge between us and our transatlantic allies. I very much hope that the noble Lord is right in his reassurances. The noble Lord was angry at the impotence of Europe, but that will continue as long as European countries have such small defence budgets or where they are so reluctant to share their capability with their allies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="0805072000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, said that I am raising doubts. We all want NATO and the EU to succeed. It is important that the amendments were tabled to enable us to debate all these important issues. I was heartened by the noble Lord&#146;s confirmation of his party&#146;s support for the primacy of NATO. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, had yet another swipe at my party. Of course the United States wants to see a greater defence capability in Europe, but not all Americans whom I have spoken to share the noble Lord&#146;s optimism that this will happen.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="0805072000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, spoke about a European army, and he was concerned that it would happen bit by bit. My noble friend Lord Blackwell was concerned at the apparently different meanings and intentions of the treaty of Lisbon. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, asked the Minister about the Farnborough agreement of 2000, and he asked where the money is for what he described as &#147;this dangerous dream&#148;. I thank the Minister for his very full response to the amendments. As he said, the defence of our country is more important than anything else. The noble Lord addressed our amendments in great detail, and I was assured by his words about a NATO-friendly ESDP; time will tell whether that remains the case. I was assured by his general assurances on the primacy of NATO.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="0805072000035"></a>I said at the outset that, with the exception of Amendment No. 18A, these were probing amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said that Amendment No. 20 was a wrecking amendment. I said that it was a probing amendment. With regard to Amendment No. 18A, I was grateful to the Minister for his strong assurance that there would be no question of the EU forcing British troops to engage in any military activity against our will. The noble Lord included the word &#147;Parliament&#148; in the decision-making. On that basis, and his assurances on our other amendments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="0805072000041"></a>The noble Lord said: The provision highlighted in the amendment is an example of our concern with the provisions that this treaty establishes on European defence. As my noble friends have pointed out, during the European convention in 2003, the Government held a very different opinion on some of the paragraphs in this treaty on the issue of providing aid and assistance for mutual defence. They stated categorically that they,</p>
<ul><a name="0805072000078"></a>&#147;cannot accept a provision importing mutual defence commitment in the European Union&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_548"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 548</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0805072000062"></a>They were quite right. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government&#146;s views on this provision have so radically changed.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="0805072000042"></a>Paragraph 7 of the inserted Article 28A clearly duplicates NATO&#146;s Article 5 and, as Her Majesty&#146;s Government have said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="0805072000072"></a>&#147;The EU cannot duplicate this role&#148;&#151;</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="0805072000043"></a>As I made clear in the debate on the previous group of amendments, I do not believe that this treaty will in any way increase the European capability for defence, within or without NATO. The idea that ESDP will be able to implement an effective campaign against an aggressor without NATO or the USA is a fantasy. The inclusion of the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="0805072000080"></a>&#147;this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0805072000063"></a>shows how resistant many European countries, for example, Ireland, Austria and Sweden, are to any threat to their neutrality.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="0805072000044"></a>This provision at least mentions NATO, but between the right to neutrality and the obligation to abide by NATO commitments, there is nothing left of this obligation for mutual defence. I beg to move.</p>

This new provision reflects the reality that EU member states would come to the aid of other member states in the unlikely event that they were the victim of armed aggression on their territory. The crucial point to make is that the obligation to provide assistance falls on individual member states, not the institutions of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="0805072000046"></a>The provision does not provide a basis for the development of an EU collective defence organisation to rival NATO. In fact, as the EU Select Committee report noted, the treaty clearly states that for its members NATO remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation. The Lisbon treaty confirms rather than changes that. The committee report made it clear at 7109, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="0805072000074"></a>&#147;The mutual assistance clause, which is examined below ... is even more forthright, as it states that NATO remains the &#145;foundation&#146; of the collective defence of those Member States who are members of it and the forum for its implementation&#146;. It further states that commitments and cooperation under the CSDP &#145;shall be consistent with commitments&#146; under NATO. This is a new provision and represents a strengthening of the reference to the role of NATO in the Treaties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="0805072000047"></a>We accept that we have an obligation to come to the aid of an EU member state in the specific circumstances that it has suffered an armed aggression on its territory.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="0805077000035"></a> Clause 2, page 1, line 12, after &#147;excluding&#148; insert&#151;</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="0805077000004"></a>The noble Lord said: I also speak to Amendment No. 24. Once again, we are considering a provision that sets up an EU institution but adds nothing to defence capabilities and might actively harm NATO&#146;s effectiveness.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="0805077000005"></a>The history of the EDA is illuminating. It was proposed in the 2003 constitution, which was of course summarily rejected. This did not prevent the actual creation of the agency. The EDA is up and running, and we are now being asked retrospectively to legitimise it. The EDA, as set up by this treaty, has a wide remit. It is to infer identifying members&#146; capabilities and evaluate how well they are meeting their commitments. It will promote harmonisation and compatible procurement methods, and so on.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="0805077000006"></a>All that sounds very sensible until one remembers that it completely disregards NATO. As I have already said, EU capabilities are derisory, and members&#146; commitment to meeting its military objectives minimal. With this provision, we are committing ourselves to harmonising our military capabilities with the weakest of our NATO allies instead of the strongest. Greater interoperability is indeed desirable, but our military equipment will be useless if it is not interoperable with US equipment. What is the point of developing joint procurement projects with countries whose defence spending levels are too low to purchase the end products?</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="0805077000007"></a>The rules and procedures of the EDA are to be decided by QMV. Countries that have no intention of providing troops, equipment or money to build the military capability of Europe are to have a say in the procurement of equipment by those few countries that, through NATO, are expected to carry out all Europe&#146;s obligations. What we have here is a waste of money. As General Sir Kevin O&#146;Donoghue, the chief of defence materiel, defence equipment and support in the Ministry of Defence, so clearly laid out in January, this waste of money actively reduces our military capability. As he put it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="0805077000036"></a>&#147;It is inevitable that our top priority will be current operations and the equipment needed to support them ... We need to think carefully about priorities when every pound sterling or Euro spent on international institutions is a pound or Euro I cannot spend on equipping and supporting deployed front line forces&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0018.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="0805077000008"></a>Once again, we see the Commission getting involved where it has no business to be. Defence is a matter that should remain squarely in the hands of the national Government. I beg to move.</p>

I put to him the answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch: where do we get the money from? One of the ways that Europe can find the money for the required capabilities, including the heavy airlift planes that are currently so vitally necessary, is to do so collectively and not individually. The United Kingdom is currently the only country in Europe with heavy lift. We have five C17s leased&#151;or maybe partly bought&#151;from the Americans, a decision taken during my time at the MoD. There is literally nothing else in the European arsenal for that, yet we know that it is required.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="0805077000011"></a>If European countries are willing, through the European Defence Agency&#151;which was, as I said, instigated as a British idea&#151;to get the heavy-lift aeroplanes on a collective basis, then they are available for NATO missions just as much as for any European Union mission. The model is the AWACS fleet. Individual nations, apart from Britain and France, cannot really afford&#151;and could not use&#151;the advanced early-warning aircraft. It therefore made sense for NATO at that time collectively to buy a fleet of AWACS planes. They are literally used all the time. They were used after 9/11 to protect the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City as part of our Article 5 commitments, and they were used to protect pretty well every European summit and a lot of other summits as well. That is the model. If we can, through another constituency, not just NATO, but through the European Union get collective ownership of some of these scarce capabilities, the money will be well spent. It will move away from the old territorial defence much more to collective defence, and it will be equally available to NATO when it needs it as it is to the European Union. I would have thought that he, especially, and the Opposition, generally, would be applauding the concept of the collective purchase of the equipment that is required. That is basically what the European Defence Agency is about. It is no more sinister than that. It is a device to make sure that European nations get the capabilities so that they are available when the European Union or NATO requires them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="0805077000013"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Astor, on his introduction of this amendment, if that does not trouble him too much, but I recommend that he reads the Farnborough agreement, about which I have not had an answer this evening. Perhaps he will study in particular Article 46, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="0805077000037"></a>&#147;The parties&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="0805077000040"></a>&#147;recognise the need to co-operate in establishing a long term master-plan that would present a common view of their future operational needs.

There is no doubt that in the European Union we are dealing, as my noble friend Lord Blackwell has indicated, with French antagonism to the United States of America, inspired, as I have mentioned before, by its deep psychotic need to bite the hand that fed it in two world wars. That is what we are dealing with, and it is supported by misplaced German guilt, but German guilt none the less. The United Kingdom needs to be extremely careful before it goes down this road of European military collaboration with the European Union at the expense of the special relationship that has served this planet very well over the past century or so.</p>

<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="0805077000015"></a><a name="80506-0018.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80506-0018.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="0805077000046"></a>Lord Bach:</b> It is not at the expense of the special relationship. The quotation from President Bush, which I am pleased to have used, suggests that it is the noble Lord who on this occasion is out of kilter with what is being said and thought in Washington. There is not the concern that he expresses. That is, if I may use the French word, pass&#233;&#151;it is the past. There was concern some years ago. I remember when I used to debate regularly with the noble Lord, Lord Astor, there was concern about the emergence of European defence, but that is gone. The Americans are pleased and delighted by it. The quotations I used are real quotations from the president himself. It is the noble Lord who has been left behind by history a bit here.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="0805077000016"></a>Let me talk about the EDA. The British should be proud of having thought up the idea. It had a very distinguished first chief executive who was a very eminent member of the Ministry of Defence senior Civil Service before he took on that important job.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="0805077000017"></a>Improving the military capabilities of EU partners is a key UK objective. No one will disagree and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Astor, would not. Improving these capabilities allows the European Union to share the international burden for crisis management more effectively and is to our direct benefit as a country. For example, the EDA is overseeing a five-member-state project to improve the interoperability between civilian and military radios. Such work will provide real benefits to the civilian side and to the military personnel working together in theatres of operations as they do.</p>

<a name="80506-0018.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="0805077000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, suggested that there was no mention of NATO. The EDA focuses on EU capability development, as would be expected of an EU agency. However, the EU-NATO capability group, at which EDA participates, works to ensure that the capability development in the two organisations is complementary.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80506-0019.htm"/>


<a name="80506-0019.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="0805077000019"></a>It is important to remember that there is a link between the EDA and the assets that NATO wants and achieves. We support the objectives and work of the EDA in its role managing the work to improve European defence capabilities including the facilitation of more efficient defence procurement. Furthermore, we welcome the references to the agency in the treaty. The treaty states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="0805077000038"></a>&#147;The Council, acting via a qualified majority, will adopt a European decision defining the Agency&#146;s statute, seat and operational rules&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_552"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column 552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0805077000034"></a>That has already happened. In reality, those decisions were taken by joint action in July 2004, which established the agency. There is no appetite among member states to reopen these issues. In the second half of last year, the head of the EDA reviewed the applicability of the joint action with all member states, and there was consensus that the joint action was fit for purpose and no appetite for it to be changed. As the EU Select Committee impact assessment notes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="0805077000039"></a>&#147;The provisions on the European Defence Agency and on crisis management missions are a codification of current practice and will therefore have little impact on the European Security and Defence Policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-0019.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="0805077000020"></a>The agency three-year financial framework and guidelines for its work programme are agreed by the Council acting by unanimity. It sets the overall framework and size of the agency and ensures that the UK would have the ability to prevent a substantial increase in the size of the agency if it did not fit in with our policy. The money comes from member states&#151;nothing new in that.</p>

<a name="80506-0019.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="0805077000021"></a>As far as money for capabilities is concerned, I will give an example of a France and UK initiative on helicopters&#151;a prospect fund to upgrade European helicopters, with France providing pilot training for hostile conditions. The initiative is being developed through both NATO and the European Defence Agency, as part of the EU. It will make European money go further to provide key enablers.</p>

<a name="80506-0019.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="0805077000022"></a>Beneath the framework, which is set by unanimity, regular decisions are made at the steering board by QMV for rapid decision-making. If there were a decision of strategic importance to the UK that the agency proposed to make by QMV, the UK could use the clause in the joint action which would allow us to have the decision reverted to the Council, which, as I say, acts by unanimity.</p>

<a name="80506-0019.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="0805077000023"></a>I repeat that the agency&#146;s main purpose is to help develop EU military capabilities by facilitating joint capability projects between member states and, by goodness, Europe does need some more defence capabilities. Improved EU military capabilities will improve the effectiveness of the ESDP military operations.</p>

<a name="80506-0019.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="0805077000024"></a>Let me make it abundantly clear: the agency does not have any role in the decision to launch or in conducting those operations, and the reference to operational rules in the treaty is only referring to the rules by which the agency itself operates. For those reasons, with the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Astor, his criticism of the EDA is slightly dated. There was concern about it when it was first set up. I remember because I was involved to some small extent at the time. It has yet to prove itself fully, but I submit that it has made a good start. To abandon it now would be quite against the principle of establishing more and better European defence capabilities.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000009"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 33, 36, 69, 73, 84 and 86&#151;but not 85&#151;91, 98 and 103, which are in my name. I am grateful to my co-signatories for their support. Most of these amendments are designed to bring the commissioning of health services, not just their provision, more clearly within the scope of the Care Quality Commission&#146;s regulated activities. Amendments Nos. 33 and 36 would clarify and widen the meaning of &#147;health services&#148; covered by the Bill. In tabling the amendments, I have done no more than attempt to put the Bill in the shape that I would have preferred if I had continued as the responsible Minister, so in mitigation I claim at least intellectual consistency in my position.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000010"></a>Let me start with the commissioning amendments. In any local area, commissioners of health services can do more damage to that community&#146;s health than any individual provider. It is their capacity and competence in assessing local health needs, identifying appropriate service responses, contracting for the necessary services and dealing with poor providers by terminating contracts that most affect local health. Commissioners have been given the authority and the access to resources to effect real change. About 80 per cent of the NHS budget of some &#163;110 billion a year passes through their hands. If the Government want a risk-based regulatory scheme for health services, with which I agree entirely, as I think do many Members of the Committee, it seems to me perverse to exclude commissioners or to leave matters unclear as to the new commission&#146;s role and powers in this area.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000011"></a>This has been a contested area, with some in senior NHS positions arguing that oversight of commissioners is a performance management matter for strategic health authorities&#151;and so it is, up to a point. When the original consultation document, with which I was heavily involved, was issued in November 2006, it showed, on page 63, commissioner assurance as a shared responsibility between strategic health authorities and the new regulator in the proposed future structure.

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000012"></a>I am told that nothing has changed and that the new commission can still intervene with commissioners. However, I do not consider that the current wording of the Bill adequately makes it clear that the commission can take action in respect of failing commissioners where SHAs do not take sufficient action. We will come to some of that later. I also do not think that the Bill makes it absolutely clear that the commission has rights to intervene in various functions in relation to commissioning.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000013"></a>The performance of commissioners under successive Governments has been less than convincing. Too often, commissioners have been out-muscled by a powerful acute trust and too often in some of our most deprived communities they have failed to replace inadequate and failing primary care services. Sometimes, a cosy relationship within the so-called NHS family has worked against the public interest.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000014"></a>The Government&#146;s new World Class Commissioning initiative is extremely welcome. It certainly has my support and I hope that it will improve matters. I was pleased to see in Ben Bradshaw&#146;s recent <I>Health Service Journal</I> interview the recognition of the need for clear dividing lines between commissioning and providing, because primary care trusts are too often conflicted in this area. However, if, as I think we should be, we are providing for a future regulatory system for health services, I believe that we must clearly state in the legislation the ability of the commission to be involved in, and to take action on, commissioning and not simply leave matters to strategic health authorities. Similarly, we should not leave in doubt the commission&#146;s ability to intervene and take action in this area.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000015"></a>Amendment No. 29 would bring commissioning clearly within the scope of the commission. Amendment No. 69 would ensure that the standards that the commission inspected against included commissioning, as they do now. Amendment No. 73 would ensure that the commission&#146;s periodic reviews of primary care trusts covered commissioning as well as PCT provision of services. Amendments Nos. 84 and 86 would bring commissioning within the scope of special reviews and investigations that the Care Quality Commission may need to carry out. Amendment No. 98 would require the commission to keep the Secretary of State informed of commissioning. Amendment No. 103 would ensure that inspectors could get involved with commissioning.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000016"></a>I hope that the Government can accept these improvements, which put the commission&#146;s role on commissioning well beyond doubt. Indeed, I think that these changes will reduce ministerial frustration when the NHS family declines external therapy for failing PCT commissioners. I confess that I may have overdosed with Amendment No. 96 by including PCTs in the definition of &#147;health authorities&#148;. I am not totally inclined to pursue this amendment but it would be helpful if I had the Minister&#146;s reaction to it. </p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000017"></a>I turn briefly to Amendments Nos. 33 and 36. My reading of Clause 5 is that &#147;health care&#148; is too narrow a term for defining the activities of the new regulator. My amendment would broaden the term to &#147;health  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC109"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services&#148;, which include preventive services, and it would bring into the definition the issue of commissioning, for the reasons that I have explained. Amendment No. 36 would carry this broadening into Clause 5(4). The whole area of genomic medicine is developing at a phenomenal pace and is likely to reshape health services in ways that we cannot fully envisage at present. Therefore, in my view, we need a broader definition than is currently provided for in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000018"></a>I regard these amendments as important ways of strengthening the Bill and giving the commission a clearer remit in the area of commissioning. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000019"></a><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08050624000111"></a>Baroness Murphy:</b> I support this group of amendments. In my view, we come to the absolute nub of the role of the Care Quality Commission and its ability to act as a quality improver of NHS and other service providers.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000020"></a>I reiterate what the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said. It seems to me that in the current structure of the National Health Service the commissioners should play a crucial role in demonstrating that they are the champions of the local community and that they are purchasing on its behalf for the improvement of public health. It is true that they are directly responsible to the strategic health authorities for the delivery of that, but they are simply managed by the SHAs. With the Care Quality Commission, we are proposing that there should be independent regulation by people who have no direct interest in how the budget is spent or divvied up across their patch and no direct interest in the support of the providers; we are proposing a body that can monitor independently the quality of what is being provided.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000021"></a>I remind the Committee of a good example. The Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust inquiry report clearly demonstrated that the local primary care trusts were&#151;not to put too fine a point on it&#151;fiddling while Rome burned. They were so busy joining themselves up and reorganising themselves from two primary care trusts into one that their functions went to pot and they were not adequately monitoring what they were purchasing in terms of the quality of care being delivered.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000022"></a>At a Monitor board meeting this morning&#151;I declare an interest as a board member&#151;I came across a good example of how things can go wrong if you monitor the providers and not the commissioners. We were having a board-to-board meeting with an acute hospital in the Bristol area that wishes to become a foundation trust. We noted that its performance on its MRSA and C. difficile targets looked dodgy last year and that it did not look as though it would be in great shape this year unless something was done about it. The trust pointed out to us that the local Bristol primary care trusts had set it a target for this year with which it could comply because the new contract would include only MRSA that was picked up in the hospital and excluded that which was picked up in the local community, thus at a stroke allowing the local hospital to meet its contractual targets.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000023"></a>It seems to me that, from the point of view of the Department of Health, that is perfectly okay&#151;we want local commissioners to make local decisions  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about the health of their local populations. Under the old system, the strategic health authorities&#151;right up to the Minister&#151;were responsible for the lowering the contractual target. Under the new local commissioning arrangements, it is very directly the responsibility of the primary care trust. However, will the Care Quality Commission pick up where a local area produces more community MRSA and does not improve against its hospital MRSA targets? It will have satisfied its local commissioners but what is delivered to the local community will be of poorer quality. If the NHS reforms are to work and we are to have arm&#146;s-length responsibility in the local commissioning bodies, it is crucial that we have independent regulation of what is purchased by local community primary care trusts.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000024"></a>When we talk about commissioners, we ought also to include joint commissioners of health and social care, because they, too, are responsible for what is delivered. The commissioners of services must be held just as accountable when things go wrong. We must make it clear that the whole gamut of the processes that we put in place for the system must be able to deliver and be accountable to the regulator.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000025"></a><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08050624000112"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I cannot better the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. However, I should like to add some brief remarks.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000026"></a>The Bill is not absolutely explicit about whether commissioning is to fall within the ambit of the CQC&#146;s regulatory duties. Reading the <I>Hansard</I>s of the debates held in other place, I detect that the Government intend it to do so. However, if we read what the Bill actually says, we see that it refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08050624000101"></a>&#147;the provision of health or social care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000089"></a>It may be that the legal interpretation of this phrase is different from the ordinary language interpretation and that it does in fact encompass commissioning. However, if that is so, it is not clear. In Clause 5(2), &#147;health care&#148; is defined in a way that appears to exclude commissioning and, if we look ahead to Clause 42(1), which covers periodic reviews, we see that it states that the commission must,</p>
<ul><a name="08050624000102"></a>&#147;conduct reviews of the provision of health care by the Trust and by other persons pursuant to arrangements made by the Trust&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000090"></a>Again, &#147;health care&#148; in this context is defined in Clause 92(2) in a manner that seems to focus exclusively on the provision of services.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000027"></a>We need to be clear in our minds about why this issue is so important. We have heard a number of the reasons already. Those noble Lords who have read the evidence given by Anna Walker to the Public Bill Committee in the Commons will have been struck by her succinct analysis of why it would make no sense for there to be statutory regulation of healthcare providers without simultaneous regulation and oversight of what happens at the commissioning and purchasing end.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000028"></a>It could be argued that, as commissioners, primary care trusts benefit from being overseen by strategic health authorities, whose job, as we have heard, is to performance manage what they do. But performance  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>management and assessment by an independent regulator are two distinct things. Anna Walker spoke specifically about the CQC&#146;s power to conduct wider reviews. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050624000098"></a>&#147;The difficulty is that it is limited to providers only. What we find in health care ... is that you can say to a provider, &#145;Look, that service simply is not good enough&#146;, to which their answer can often be, &#145;But we are not being paid to provide any more than that&#146;. In order to get the issue right, on behalf of the user and the patient, you have to look at a mixture of commissioning and provision; at what the primary care trusts are doing, as well as what the provider is doing&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Health and Social Care Bill Committee, 8/1/08; col. 17.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000091"></a>That point was endorsed by Chris Heginbotham of the Mental Health Act Commission, who pointed out that monitoring the way in which commissioning is undertaken is important as a means of ensuring that the money is available to pay for any necessary changes or improvements. I thought that that was a very telling point.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000029"></a>A basic further point relates to this: without good and effective commissioning, it will be next to impossible for standards of care to be driven upwards, which is part of what the CQC is there to facilitate. Performance management on its own will not do that. Moreover, as practice-based commissioning becomes more established, as it surely will, the importance of this area of the CQC&#146;s work will most certainly increase. What the CQC will undoubtedly do in the area of commissioning, as in other matters, is to make the NHS more publicly accountable. That principle surely has to be right.</p>

I said that I had overdosed on Amendment No. 96, but of course there is no Amendment No. 96 in this group; I meant to refer to Amendment No. 91.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000031"></a><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08050624000114"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I, too, should like to speak in support of these amendments. I start by setting the PCTs in context. When the Government came to power, they inherited eight regional offices. Four years later, those offices were abolished in favour of four regional directorates. The directorates lasted for just one year and were replaced with 28 strategic health authorities. The 28 SHAs did not last long and were merged into 10 bodies. I find that quite ironic because, in 1997, there were eight regions with organisations that had very similar functions. The importance of mentioning this is that these are the bodies that are accountable for the performance management of organisations that are much lower in the hierarchy and, of course, that deliver services, so it is all of a piece.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000032"></a>GP fundholding was scrapped nine years later; practice-based commissioning was put in its place. In 1997, the internal market had to go and was replaced in 2005 by payment by results&#151;a purchaser/provider split by any other name. In 1998, primary care groups were formed, but they were swept aside in favour of 303 primary care trusts. Established in 2003, those trusts were merged three years later to 152. Not all PCTs merged&#151;those in London were left as they were for political reasons. In June 2006, the PCTs were told

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000033"></a>Some PCTs are considerable providers. For instance, Hampshire has more than 1,000 hospital beds in addition to all the community services, such as district nursing, health visiting, physiotherapy and speech therapy. The Gloucester PCT has a provider budget of &#163;100 million&#151;considerably larger than the neighbouring foundation trust. If the Government are serious about commissioning, it seems sensible to encourage PCTs to divest themselves of their provider role, but the question remains: who is to manage those services and where are they to go? Is the Government&#146;s long-term plan to divest PCTs of their provider role and, if so, where are those services to go? I have given the Minister notice of that question.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000034"></a>In its report following an inquiry into PCTs, the Health Select Committee commented:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050624000099"></a>&#147;The Government&#146;s numerous announcements and subsequent retractions mean that it is still unclear what its policy is&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000092"></a>The committee goes on to describe the Government&#146;s approach as &#147;clumsy and cavalier&#148; and states that PCT reform has,</p>
<ul><a name="08050624000103"></a>&#147;produced a flawed and incoherent policy that is ill judged in the extreme&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000093"></a>That is very strong language for a Select Committee with a Labour chair and majority. In giving evidence, the chairman of Basildon PCT told the committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="08050624000104"></a>&#147;some staff have had different employer names on their payslips five times in ten years&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000094"></a>The average life of a chief executive in one post is three years.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000035"></a>I take up the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. Is it any wonder that PCTs have not fulfilled all the Government&#146;s expectations of powerful, well informed commissioners when they are in a state of constant turmoil? Individuals are worried about their jobs, homes, mortgages, schools for their children and continuing employment opportunities.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000036"></a>In addition, salaries are low compared with foundation trust salaries. On our first day in Grand Committee, we debated the salary level of the new chairman of the Care Quality Commission. We agreed that a salary sends a strong message about the importance of the position. The chief executive of a medium-sized PCT with a commissioning budget of &#163;760 million and a turnover of provider services of &#163;100 million receives a salary of &#163;140,000. I mentioned that the foundation trust up the road with a turnover not of &#163;100 million but of &#163;30 million&#151;less than one-third&#151;receives a salary of &#163;180,000. That is &#163;40,000 more than the head of the neighbouring PCT who is to commission its services. What signal are we sending to PCTs, which are doing a much more complicated and difficult task? I suggest that it might be that they are less valuable, and certainly less appreciated.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000037"></a>Several clauses cover PCTs as providers of services, as we have heard, apart from Clause 42(1)(a), which is quite opaque, using the words, &#147;pursuant to arrangements&#148;&#151;I cannot find anything else that might refer to commissioning. Is it the Minister&#146;s interpretation that that is all that we need to meet the concerns  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expressed in the amendments? Whatever arrangements are made to regulate PCTs, it is of fundamental importance that they do not duplicate the performance management functions of the strategic health authorities, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said. I agree with him. Mark Britnell and his team are doing a splendid job in trying to introduce the World Class Commissioning programme and it would be a great pity if any proposals interfered with what he was trying to achieve.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000038"></a>PCTs have a huge responsibility. In addition, they are effectively local monopolies, buying care in any given locality and acting on behalf of users of the service. Since they are local monopolies, there needs to be some form of comparative information and competition to drive up performance. I see a parallel with the water industry, which is also a local monopoly. There, the regulator is keen to encourage competition by ensuring that there is comparative information for him to use. In addition, I realise that, as there are two parts in our system, purchaser and provider, it is difficult for a regulator to regulate providers without seeing the other half of the equation, the purchasers&#151;a point that has been ably illustrated by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000039"></a>A problem in a service may well arise due to the service not being commissioned or being commissioned incorrectly in the first place, thus affecting the delivery of quality in the service. As the Bill already provides for the assessment of local authority commissioning in social care, it seems a little perverse not also to consider the assessment of healthcare commissioning. I am delighted that some enlightened authorities and PCTs are experimenting with joint commissioning, which leads to the conclusion, in my view, that joined-up regulation as mooted in these amendments is also required. I live in hope that we are pushing at an increasingly open door and that the Minister will think again and return with her own amendments.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000040"></a><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08050624000115"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I have some sympathy with these amendments, as my amendments in the following group might indicate. My name is not on these amendments solely because I have one or two questions for the noble Lord, Lord Warner. He said in his introductory remarks that he was completely sold on a risk-based approach to regulation. In the light of some of our discussions in the first two days of Committee, does he accept that, at least in the world of social care, there is a need for a rights-based approach?</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000041"></a>My key question is whether his definition of &#147;commissioning&#148; also includes procurement. Those of us from the social care field understand only too well the difference between the two. Commissioning is an engaging process of negotiation and discussion between stakeholders and potential service providers that sets out what one would ideally like to buy. That is then handed over to the procurement officials, who get down to the realities of what is going to be bought and provided.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000042"></a>That process, under the European directive rules, is direct and limited. It is pretty much the same whether it applies to the procurement of social care or of street furniture; indeed, I have seen examples of contracts  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for social care services that, when one drills down into them, are based on templates for contracts for the procurement of street lighting. It is exactly the same process. Procurement is altogether a much harder legal process, which has much less to do with quality of outcomes and more to do with price and risk.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000043"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, talked about PCTs becoming solely commissioners. That is already happening: Kingston PCT is in the process of divesting itself of all its provision and moving to becoming solely a commissioner and procurer of services. Whether or not that is the Government&#146;s intention, it is becoming a reality. I would be grateful for some clarification.</p>

Yes. However, the primary objective for a regulator is to protect the public against risk. By all means encourage a regulator to promote a rights-based approach, but it is more for Governments and Parliaments to specify rights, which then become part of the day-to-day business of providing services.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000045"></a>I do not want to carry out a course 100 seminar on commissioning and contracting, but what I mean by &#147;commissioning&#148; is starting with a local needs-based assessment, specifying what services actually have to be put in place to meet those needs and contracting for those, and deciding at the end of the day to turf a contractor out when it persistently declines to provide the services of the quality, and at the price, that it has agreed. To my mind, contracting is a narrower concept than commissioning, but commissioning ultimately embraces contracting.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000049"></a>I think that we all agree that commissioning assurance is important. SHAs have the primary role for commissioner assurance in the NHS and have been working hard to build commissioning capacity locally, as noble Lords have mentioned. The commissioning assurance system, which is part of the World Class Commissioning programme, will help to deliver improved commissioning through strengthening the SHAs&#146; roles.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000050"></a>The Care Quality Commission will also play a vital role by publishing independent comparative information on the performance of commissioners for public accountability purposes. We will expect PCT commissioners and SHAs to take account of this information in determining how they can provide a better service to their population. It is clear that a service failing is sometimes a system-wide failing, not just a failing by an individual organisation. It is quite right that, in reviewing the outcomes that are being achieved through periodic reviews, or when conducting a special review or investigation, the CQC should look across the whole system, including at the effectiveness of the commissioning process. Ultimately, it will be for SHAs to address concerns and ensure that improvement plans are put in place if PCTs are not commissioning effectively.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000051"></a>My noble friend Lord Warner mentioned the potential scope of the CQC regarding gene therapy. There is no reason why that could not be covered by the definition in Clause 5, but I am happy to take the issue away and check that with lawyers. The consultation will define which services will need to be registered.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000052"></a>On the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege&#151;and I thank her for the notice that she gave me&#151;PCTs clearly have an important job and it is for local commissioners to review their provision of community services and to consider how they should be provided. There is a range of options that PCTs can consider, including the provision remaining with the PCT, with the appropriate governance arrangements in place. The options include social enterprise, general practice, care trusts, NHS FTs, third-sector providers, partnerships with local government and other options centred on service delivery, including vertical integration and joint ventures.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000053"></a>PCTs ensure that community services are locally driven and offer a real opportunity for working closely with clinicians and partners to ensure that the best innovative care pathways across health and social care are developed to ensure seamless care for patients across the community. PCTs will want to consider a number of drivers when reviewing provision of services, such as improved quality, improved efficiency and ensuring that they are fit for purpose to take forward shifting care closer to home.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000054"></a>The 2008-09 operating framework states that, during 2008-09, all PCTs should review their requirements for community services and use this process to consider all the options for models and provision. While this is being undertaken&#151;from 1 April 2008&#151;all PCTs should  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>create an internal separation of their operational provider services, business and financial rules as applied to other providers. The reviews support World Class Commissioning and ensure at least internal separation of PCT provision to help PCTs to focus on World Class Commissioning and ensure transparency in decision-making.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000055"></a>The CQC has a role but it is one player in the broader system and we need to ensure that we do not unnecessarily create another layer of accountability or duplication. The registration system has been designed to apply to both health and adult social care providers across the sectors to ensure that the services provided to the public are safe and of acceptable quality. A registration system for providers is right and we are consulting on this, but I do not believe at present that it is appropriate to extend that scope to commissioners when we have existing mechanisms such as the Secretary of State and SHAs to address issues of failure.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000056"></a>I turn now to the various amendments, which, I believe, are based on differences in interpretation. Amendments Nos. 73, 84, 85, 86, 91, 98 and 103 would ensure that the Care Quality Commission could look at PCT commissioning in its periodic reviews under Clause 42, its special reviews and investigations under Clause 44, its advice to the Secretary of State under Clause 49 and its inspections under Clause 56. As has been mentioned, these points were debated in Committee in the other place. We believe that the definitions of &#147;health care&#148; in Clause 5 and the provisions in Clauses 42, 44, 49 and 56, as drafted, already meet the intention behind the amendments.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000057"></a>Indeed, my honourable friend the Minister for Health, Ben Bradshaw, stressed that we agree the commission must be able to look at commissioning in carrying out these functions. We have also provided reassurance on this point to the Healthcare Commission and amended the Explanatory Notes that accompany the Bill to make this clear. However, I am conscious that noble Lords are seeking clarification and I am prepared to look again at the drafting where the Bill refers to healthcare and the provision of healthcare to see what can be done.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000058"></a>Finally, on Amendment No. 69, it is not our intention to set standards on the commissioning process. We have already set out the guidelines that we are publishing as part of the assurance system towards achieving World Class Commissioning. There is therefore no sense in duplicating this work. Standards under Clause 41 will be quality improvement tools aimed at NHS healthcare providers, whether in the public sector or private sector. We will provide commissioners and patients with additional information to help them to compare the quality of service between providers. Indeed, Clause 133 places a duty on PCT commissioners to take the standards into account in fulfilling their duty of improvement under that clause. They will also provide clinicians, other health professionals and NHS managers with a method of measuring how they are currently performing and a definitive level of quality at which to aim.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000059"></a>To clarify the situation for the Committee, at present I am resisting Amendments Nos. 29, 33, 36 and 69 and I propose to consider Amendments Nos. 73, 84, 85,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>86, 91, 98 and 103. With this clarification, and with my undertaking to look at the definition of commissioning, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However&#151;there is always a &#147;however&#148;&#151;there is a real issue about Amendment No. 29. What did the Government mean in the consultation document of November 2006 and, perhaps more significantly, in the Secretary of State&#146;s response in October 2007, where he clearly shows in the diagram that I mentioned that there is a shared responsibility between strategic health authorities and the independent regulator? I find it difficult to believe that, for the regulator, that shared responsibility goes only as far as drawing public attention to concerns that it may have in an area such as commissioning. However, as I understand what my noble friend is saying, that amounts to the Government&#146;s position. I cannot see how that position is sustainable if, in any part of the country, after the persistent failure&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned a particular case&#151;of a PCT or collection of PCTs and their associate SHA, the regulator is unable to take more direct action than simply drawing the attention of the Secretary of State or the public to the matter.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000061"></a>I will look carefully at what my noble friend and other noble Lords have said and think further about Amendment No. 29, but I cannot at this point guarantee that I will not bring an amendment back at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>

</ul>&#147;( ) the assessment of social care needs under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 (c. 19);&#148;
<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000064"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment to some extent carries on the argument that was being tested with the previous set of amendments in that it would introduce into Clause 4 the assessment of social care needs as a regulated activity. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, made the case that it is not possible to come to an informed judgment about the quality of service provision if one does not know what the commissioning process has shown up. Equally in social care, it is impossible to come to a judgment about the quality of services if one does not know the needs of the population.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000065"></a>As I said at Second Reading, the assessment of social care needs is problematic. The right to have one&#146;s needs assessed is one of the few rights that people who need social care have. They do not have entitlement to receive services in the way in which people who require health services do, but they have a right to an assessment. That assessment should indicate to them what their needs are and how those needs should be addressed. Increasingly, those needs are met not by local authorities but by the individuals themselves. Indeed, as individual budgets are rolled out, those needs will increasingly be met by other arrangements.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000066"></a>What form an assessment should take is the subject of an interesting debate in the social care field. In relation to learning disabilities and adult social care, there is a growing belief that there should be only self-assessment. However, for other groups, most notably older people, there is a strong and informed body of opinion that assistance or the right to an independent assessment is an important part of the process of ensuring that people get what they require. </p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000067"></a>At Second Reading, I mentioned my concerns that a number of local authorities are starting to abandon the assessment process or, more likely, are engaged in the absolute minimum of assessment, with a process that consists of an initial question, &#147;Do you have &#163;21,000 or other capital?&#148;. If the answer is yes, you are handed a list of approved suppliers. That is increasingly what is happening. I do not believe that that is an adequate way in which to determine the needs of individuals. Moreover, I believe that it is damaging in the longer term, as it means that our overall understanding of social care needs across populations is decreased. I believe, therefore, that there is a case to be made for ensuring that assessment of needs is a regulated service.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000068"></a>Amendment No. 31 is slightly different. Noble Lords will have worked out that it is a probing amendment. Clause 4(3) states that the CQC will be responsible for addressing,</p>
<ul><a name="08050624000105"></a>&#147;the supply of staff who are to provide ... care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050624000095"></a>I am intrigued by the word &#147;supply&#148;. The supply of staff within the NHS is a subject about which noble Lords know a great deal. We have discussed it endlessly in the past two years as the debacle of MTAS has unfolded. I do not wish to spend a great deal of time focusing on NHS staff, not least because we have had the recent proposals of the Tooke report for an NHS board for medical education in England and the changes to the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board and the GMC.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000069"></a>How do the Government believe that the CQC will be in a position to address the issue of supply of social care staff if it is not responsible for the assessment of social care need at the same time? It is an incomplete proposal that would leave members of the CQC shooting in the dark. That is the thrust of these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

I support the noble Baroness particularly on Amendment No. 30, because in many cases local authorities have shut up shop and gone home when it comes to assessing the needs of older people who are, for example, returning home from hospital. Providing a list of private care services is about all that they do. I have experienced that personally.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000071"></a>If we are to hold local authorities to be ultimately accountable for the quality of social care that they deliver in the local area, so that we have some ability to take them to task when someone is not getting an assessment or is getting an inappropriate assessment, the Care Quality Commission should be able to look

The amendment is, therefore, attractive.</p>

I want to return to the issue of a risk-based regulatory system. If we are running such a system, it is no good concentrating just on the provider side of the equation. You can do more damage to people in a community if you fail to assess them or you fail to assess the total need for services in that area. That is a greater risk than the failure of individual providers. We really need to get this point across. It is that failure that presents a great risk to individuals living in a community. We will do only half the job if we are to regulate, in considerable detail, the quality of the providers but then say that the assessment of needs is down to the SHAs and the Secretary of State, or the local authority and the Secretary of State, whether it is to do with an individual or a community.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000073"></a>We have to do better than that if we are trying to put a piece of legislation in place for the future regulation of social care and healthcare. I ask the Minister to go back to her colleagues and think seriously about this, because we cannot just leave it to SHAs. As I see it, that was never the intention in the Secretary of State&#146;s response to the original consultation document.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000074"></a><a name="80506-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08050624000122"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Needs assessments are of course a very important part of the process of ensuring that patients and service users receive the services that they need. As was discussed in Committee in the other place, Clause 4(2) states that an activity may be a regulated activity if it involves or is connected with the provision of health or social care. Needs assessments may therefore already be prescribed as regulated activities, as they are connected with the provision of health and social care. Indeed, our suggested first registration requirement in the current consultation document&#151;noble Lords will by now be well aware of it, as I mention it fairly regularly, if not in every speech&#151;would specifically require that registered providers ensure that people have their health and/or social care needs assessed. I hope that that answers part of the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, was making. Amendment No. 30 therefore seems to duplicate what the Bill already allows.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000075"></a>This issue was discussed at some length in Committee in the other place on 15 January 2008. After the clarification given by my honourable friend Ben Bradshaw that needs assessments are within the potential scope of registration with the new commission, a similar amendment was withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="08050624000076"></a>I am sorry that my noble friend is peeved with the Government.

Such services would include, for example, those agencies that provide domiciliary care staff, which are registered with CSCI under the Care Standards Act 2000. Clause 4 is drafted widely, as we are consulting on the exact activities that will be within the scope of regulation. We have therefore included the supply of staff who provide or are connected with the provision of health or social care, to allow us to consult on which activities should be regulated. As set out in our ongoing consultation, we had envisaged that most care services currently required to be registered with the Healthcare Commission and CSCI would continue to be covered by registration with the new Care Quality Commission. In any system there is a need to draw a boundary, but we believe that the definitions of health and social care that are contained in the Bill set a sufficiently wide boundary to work within to allow for flexibility for future models of social care. With that clarification, I hope that the noble Baroness will now be content to withdraw the amendment.</p>

At the moment, the first registration requirement in the consultation document is to ensure that people have their health or social care needs assessed. That is the first requirement. It does not address the wider issue of whether a whole area is covered. That is not what this part of the registration requirements is about. I may need to consider the question and come back to my noble friend, because we are clearly talking at cross-purposes; I may not be understanding exactly what he is asking me and therefore may not be answering it adequately for him.

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000083"></a>This is a small, technical but very important amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, and I were both arguing two things: that assessment of individual needs must take place and be a regulated activity; and, from that, that the commission needs to be capable of assessing population needs across the piece and communicating it to Ministers.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000084"></a>I must take issue with one thing that the noble Baroness said. She said that it would be the responsibility of providers to ensure that assessment of needs happened. We know that assessment is not happening today. Local authorities are simply not carrying out assessments of people&#146;s social care needs. Why? Because they know that they cannot provide the service and what is the point of assessing something that you know you cannot meet? That becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We then, across the board and individually, have false presentation of the level of social care need. That is the central issue that we need to deal with and I will return to it.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08050624000085"></a>On the issue of staff, I assure the noble Baroness that I have read the regulations. It was precisely because I read the draft regulations that I tabled the amendment. On page 75, the examples of what would not need to be registered with the CQC include private arrangements between individuals, such as personal care carried out by family or friends&#151;I understand that point. However, also not to be registered is the provision of personal care by a personal assistant engaged and directed by the person receiving their support, whether self-funding or using direct payments and/or individual budgets to fund the arrangement. That will be the majority of social care provision in many places in future. So at the same time as not considering the assessment process, we are narrowing down the scope of what has to be considered in terms of provision. Increasingly, people will be given individual budgets. In a sense, I am saying that, unless we retain our focus on the medical services in the NHS, to a large extent the provision in this amendment will become increasingly meaningless.</p>

At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, but I give notice that I shall probably have to return to both these issues.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000002"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment aimed at future-proofing the scope of the new commission and enabling it to take on new functions in an orderly way. There has been a good deal of discussion about the scope of the commission&#146;s remit, and I do not intend to go over that in great detail, but certainly this afternoon&#146;s discussion suggests that there is some uncertainty about the precise scope of the commission. We are getting into a tangle about what is provided for in legislation and what is provided for in a consultation document that is still out for consultation with no firm decisions having been taken. We are being asked to take quite a lot on trust in that area.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000003"></a>The other point that I want to make is that the dividing line between clinical services and cosmetic services is becoming increasingly blurred, especially in areas such as dentistry. When is something clinically necessary and when is it cosmetically preferred? The only thing that seems to be certain is that in the future the range of technologies and treatments and the places where they are located are likely to change and, in some cases, are likely to be very different from what we know now. That is not a subtle plug for polyclinics or anything else; it is just a statement of the way in which technologies and treatments are, in reality, changing. It is also likely that new professionals will appear and that they will be in new groupings in new types of facilities.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000004"></a>In those circumstances, I think that there is a case in any risk-based regulatory system to start from a different position from that in the Bill. The amendment would put the onus on the Secretary of State to show that there is insufficient risk for particular activities to be regulated in subordinate legislation; otherwise, all services will be included in the health sector. This is what the first part of Amendment No. 32 would do.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000005"></a>The second part addresses some of the concerns about the Bill expressed at earlier Committee sittings; namely, that the new commission may be swamped by new functions and activities in relation to the resources available to it. I have therefore provided for time-limited exclusions for the commission where that can be shown to be appropriate. That seems to me a practical and sensible way to proceed.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000006"></a>I recognise that we may be too far down the track for the first part of the amendment to have much appeal to the Government. Therefore, I shall be neither peeved nor surprised if I get a fairly friendly but dusty response to it. However, I should like to hear my noble friend&#146;s arguments in a little more depth than she has been able to give so far about how the legislation will be future-proofed and whether we can really be certain that it is likely that the legislation, as currently drafted, will be able to cope with a range of new services that may cause concern. Cosmetic surgery is a good example of where, in the past, we have struggled to keep up with potential damage in the regulatory system.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000007"></a>On the second part of the amendment, I should like to know how the Government will ensure that the commission is suitably placed to take on its new functions without a provision of the kind that I have provided for. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050636000008"></a><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08050636000058"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My noble friend Lord Warner and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, are fundamentally in the same position of aiming for proportionate regulation that minimises the burden on providers. Clause 4 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations that list the activities that need to be registered with the commission. As the Committee will be aware, we recently started a three-month consultation on the registration of health and adult social care providers, which includes our proposals for the list of health and adult social care services that we believe should be within the scope of registration.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000009"></a>While I agree with my noble friend that some activities will pose a sufficiently low risk to exclude them from regulation, we do not believe that the best way of ensuring this is by negative resolution. We want to ensure that there is maximum engagement and scrutiny in developing the registration system. We therefore propose that affirmative procedures should apply to the regulations that determine the activities that will be regulated by the commission, both the first time that they are made and any time that they are changed.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000010"></a>Given the impact on services to be brought into or removed from the scope of registration, it is our intention that any change to the regulations would also be subject to public consultation. The removal of activities from the list of regulated activities is a serious matter and noble Lords and Members in the other place would wish there to be parliamentary oversight and debate of these decisions. Indeed, the Delegated Powers Committee took into account the fact that the affirmative procedure will apply to these regulations; in its judgment, this broad delegation was appropriate.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000011"></a>Even within the scope of registration, the new commission will take a proportionate approach to regulation. This means that it will inspect some activities more than others, depending on the relative risk of carrying on those activities. We recognise that the list of regulated activities will need to be revised from time to time as new ways of delivering services are developed, as new techniques that make activities less risky are developed or, indeed, as my noble friend mentioned, as other activities are taken within the scope of the commission&#146;s work. This might mean that an activity can be removed from the list of activities requiring registration. That is precisely why the list is to be defined in secondary legislation as opposed to being on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000012"></a>I hope that I have made sufficiently clear the reasons why the amendment is not necessary and that my noble friend will feel at least relatively satisfied and withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000019"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 35. These two amendments can be dealt with quite quickly. The first amendment seeks to clarify what is meant by the term &#147;health care&#148; and again picks up a concern expressed by Anna Walker in her evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place on 8 January, when she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050636000052"></a>&#147;We are very perturbed at the moment the administration requirements explicitly exclude catching work on health, as opposed to health care ... People&#146;s health needs to be looked after as well as their health care&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Health and Social Care Bill Committee, 8/1/08; col. 12.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000020"></a>Anna Walker was principally talking about the registration requirements, which are covered a little later in the Bill; Amendment No. 74 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is relevant in this context. But reading Anna Walker&#146;s remarks made me wonder whether the term &#147;health care&#148; in Clause 5 needed to be fleshed out. Maintaining and promoting good health, whether for particular NHS patients or particular residents of care homes, or as part of a wider and more general public health programme, are surely as important as the treatment of a person&#146;s illness. Public health programmes are as much about protecting people from the risk of harm in the future as they are about rectifying actual illness, but &#147;health care&#148; is normally taken to denote the latter rather than the former. The whole concept of patient-centred care is predicated on the importance of improving not only treatment but also well-being. I was heartened to read the department&#146;s consultation document on the framework for the registration of health and adult social care providers, which has much in it that is focused on outcomes and outcome measures rather than merely on process. That is excellent.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000021"></a>The other aspect of this is Derek Wanless&#146;s &#147;fully engaged scenario&#148;. The health of the nation is not going to improve unless to a great extent we all take greater responsibility for our own health than we have before. Part of the function of the NHS is to promote the right messages to enable that to happen. It is not clear to me whether that kind of activity needs to be explicitly allowed for, if only to remind the commission that it must be. I shall be glad to hear the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000022"></a>My second amendment is intended to make certain that the definition of &#147;social care&#148; does not inadvertently include informal care. It would be unfortunate if it did because, while we envisage the CQC having a role in the regulation of domiciliary care provided by professionally qualified and paid people, it would not be appropriate for it to monitor or assess care given informally and free of charge by friends and family. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me on that point. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050636000023"></a><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08050636000061"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I support my noble friend on these amendments. In my experience, health promotion is a tricky area for Governments. First, it is extremely boring. The messages are dull: a full and varied diet, lots of painful exercise, keep chaste, drink in moderation, do not overeat&#151;or, as a businessman told me the other day, it is a question of infinite supply with limited demand. It is not too much of this and not too much of that&#151;moderation in all things. Boring. Really,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deeply boring. Secondly, people do not like to be told what to do by authority, particularly when the authority happens to be the Government. Thirdly, Governments are reticent; they are fearful of being dubbed the &#147;nanny state&#148;. Fourthly, it is difficult to change people&#146;s behaviours and to maintain that change. Lastly, Governments are of course short term, with a maximum of five years, while health promotion is long term, often requiring a generation.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000024"></a>I speak with some passion about this subject because when I was Minister I was responsible for a government policy called <I>The Health of the Nation</I>. It was a delight. It was the one area in my portfolio other than maternity that was not about pain, suffering and death; it was full of razzmatazz and encouraging people to live a healthy life and do some things that they did not really want to do. That policy was interesting&#151;it was cited by the WHO as a model for other countries to follow. When I went to international conferences, I was proud of it.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000025"></a>When the new Labour Government took over their responsibilities, they decided not to adopt <I>The Health of the Nation</I>. A few years later they had their own promotion strategy, <I>Our Healthier Nation</I>. It covered much of the same ground, but not sexual health. Quite a lot of momentum was lost and we are seeing an increase in sexually transmitted diseases; indeed, between 1997 and 2005 the number of diagnosed cases of HIV increased from 2,700 to almost 7,500 and chlamydia increased by more than 300 per cent.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000026"></a>I do not want to be negative, however. Some progress has certainly been made. It is hugely encouraging that since 1995 we have seen premature deaths from heart disease fall by over 40 per cent and premature deaths from cancer cut by nearly 20 per cent. Since 1986, life expectancy for men has increased by almost five years and for women by more than three years. So far, so good, but in other areas the nation&#146;s health is getting worse. As we know, obesity is a real problem; it is on the increase and is a condition linked with a whole range of diseases. The proportion of men classified as obese has risen from 13 per cent to more than 22 per cent in the past 12 years. In women, the rate has gone up from 16 per cent to 24.3 per cent, or just under a quarter of the population. I fear that we are becoming the lard bucket of Europe.</p>
<h5><a name="08050636000056"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000027"></a>The number of alcohol-related deaths has almost doubled in the past 13 years and the number of alcohol-related admissions to hospital has risen by more than 80 per cent. That is a huge toll and a huge expense for our acute services. We know that binge drinking among young people has become fashionable. Young people are more likely than any other group to drink more than twice the recommended amount. This excessive drinking is more common in highly deprived areas, where the death rate is about 45 per cent higher than in other areas. People from the most deprived areas live at least five years less long than those from the most well off areas and spend a greater proportion of their lives in poor health. This inequality in length of life and good health is distressing and shameful and has to be tackled.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000028"></a>Sir Derek Wanless, <I>Securing Our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term View</I>, which, incidentally, was commissioned by the King&#146;s Fund, not the Government, and clearly pointed out that unless we embrace his third scenario, with the population becoming fully engaged in looking after its own health, the NHS is in danger of collapsing under the burden of ill health. Sir Derek states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050636000053"></a>&#147;Individuals are, and must remain, primarily responsible for decisions about their and their children&#146;s personal health and lifestyle&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050636000047"></a>He goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050636000054"></a>&#147;But this does not remove the duties on government and many organisations in society, including businesses, to help individuals make better decisions about their health and welfare. Significant failures in how decisions are made can lead to individuals inadvertently making choices that are bad for both themselves and society. Therefore, to promote improved health outcomes and to reduce health inequalities, the government and other bodies need to act to reduce these failures and assist individuals to make better decisions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050636000048"></a>This is where the new Care Quality Commission comes in.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000029"></a>PCTs are one of the agencies that are tasked with promoting good health, but we know that it is not high on their agenda. In its 2007 report, <I>State of Healthcare</I>, the Healthcare Commission cites a mixed picture both of commissioning and delivery of services by PCTs, especially in relation to preventing illness. The commission assessed, as part of a pilot study, PCTs on a development standard for public health. It was a voluntary self-assessment scheme and of those that reported more than half described their progress only as fair. The Healthcare Commission is the only regulatory body in the world that has responsibility for the promotion of health enshrined in law and yet this responsibility is left out of the Bill. If we do not include this amendment, we will be taking a serious backward step. We need a champion for this cause and we need a regulator that has a duty to monitor the progress of PCTs in what I admit is a very difficult area.</p>

<p><a name="08050636000030"></a><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08050636000062"></a>Lord Warner:</b> I certainly do not share the noble Baroness&#146;s view on the Government&#146;s track record on public health and health promotion, but I have a good deal of sympathy for Amendment No. 34, which is rather more elegant than my Amendment No. 33, as is often the case with the drafting of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It tries to get to the same point as Amendment No. 33 and therefore I have a good deal of sympathy and support for it.</p>

Although it may be normal practice to get rid of something when you come to office and then perhaps reinvent it slightly differently at a later stage, the fact that you will save money if you act early and get the message across to people is to be highly recommended. I would have thought that there should be no difficulty whatever in the Government accepting the amendment. I hope that they will.</p>

I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that health promotion can be deadly boring, principally when it is carried out by the NHS. When it is done by other people, it is somehow emancipated and in my experience it can be good fun, particularly when it is carried out by voluntary organisations. The same applies to social care, a great deal of which is preventive, although it may be of preventive value simply in preventing people who have a problem from becoming worse and enabling them to maintain their level of social and personal functioning.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000033"></a>The question to which I want to return is: who does health promotion and on what terms? In my previous job, I sat down with a bunch of voluntary organisations to try to work out some output and impact measures for their health promotion schemes. The example that I was most profoundly affected by was the person who had been given &#163;4,000 and six months in which to achieve a healthy outcome for an ageing population. Strangely, she did not manage to. The way in which PCTs deal with voluntary organisations on health promotion is one of the most unrealistic things that I have come across. That is because voluntary organisations get the fag end of budgets at the end of the year. That is the truth.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000034"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, was right about my Amendment No. 74. It is precisely because health promotion and prevention must be longitudinal that they are so important. The further one moves away from acute interventions, the more difficult they become to measure; one is dependent on population and international studies. It is extremely difficult for any organisation to receive funding for health promotion when all the time it is being asked to prove that by its intervention something will not happen. That is often what goes on in health promotion. That is almost as difficult as&#151;dare I say?&#151;persuading the world that you do not have weapons of mass destruction when you do not have them. You cannot show them if you do not have them.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000035"></a>That is why the noble Baroness and the noble Earl are right to site this responsibility with the Healthcare Commission. It is the one strategic body that might just have a hope of ensuring that health promotion activities are not carried out in an ad hoc and piecemeal way and that we eventually begin to get some of the data that would back up the arguments that Sir Derek Wanless made in his report.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000036"></a>Finally, I entirely understand what the noble Earl is trying to do in Amendment No. 35, in which he mentions &#147;commercial terms&#148;. A great deal of social care is provided not on commercial terms but by voluntary organisations, which subsidise it enormously. I understand what he is trying to say, although it is an unfortunate way of saying it. If he could come up with a better phraseology to encapsulate what he means, that would do everyone a great service.</p>

<p><a name="08050636000037"></a><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0003.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08050636000065"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> For the purposes of Chapter 2, Clause 5 effectively sets the outer boundary for the kinds of activities that could be included as regulated activities in regulations under Clause 4.

I have a great deal of sympathy with this discussion on public

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000038"></a>The definition of &#147;health care&#148; in Clause 5 explicitly includes all forms of healthcare provided to individuals. Any public health services that provide healthcare to individuals could therefore fall within the scope of registration under Chapter 2 and might include, for example, a smoking cessation clinic or sexual health clinic. It seems appropriate for the Bill to allow for the possibility of providers of these services to be registered in the same way as providers of other sorts of healthcare. Therefore, although public health campaigns do not fall within this definition, we believe that it is important for the commission to be able to look at public health campaigns generally in respect of its other functions. For example, if a PCT runs a public health campaign, the commission should be able to consider that in its assessment of how well the PCT is meeting the needs of the local population. That is why Clause 92 clarifies that, although these kinds of activities do not fall within the definition of healthcare for the purpose of Chapter 2 only, they will fall within the definition for the purposes of reviews, special reviews, investigations and so on, thus, it is hoped, helping to remedy the &#147;lard pot&#148; issues outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000039"></a>I hope that my explanation has gone some way towards satisfying the noble Earl and the noble Baronesses that public health services are already included within the remit of the Care Quality Commission to the right and appropriate extent.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08050636000040"></a>With Amendment No. 35, the noble Earl is looking to ensure that registration of people who provide personal care specifically excludes domestic arrangements, such as where the personal care provided to a relative would not usually be on commercial terms. Although I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of our current consultation, I expect that domiciliary care agency provision is likely to be covered, as is currently the case. I do not expect that there will be any call to regulate purely domestic personal care arrangements, such as care provided by relatives, neighbours and so on; nor do I think that it would be practical or desirable to do so. I have to tell noble Lords that my next words are underlined in my briefing notes, so I shall try also to underline them in my remarks. As such, although I understand and agree with the underlying point, I think that the amendment is probably unnecessary. With that clarification, I ask the noble Earl to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 38. These are both important amendments. Fortunately, I can be brief, as the Government have already signalled their intention to table their own amendment&#151;indeed, the Minister said so during Second Reading&#151;but not, unfortunately, until a later stage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000004"></a>The amendments concern the scope of the Human Rights Act and the decision of the House of Lords in the case of YL v Birmingham City Council and others in June 2007. YL was an elderly lady evicted from a private sector care home whose care was paid by Birmingham City Council. By a majority of three to two, the Law Lords ruled that YL could not bring an action against the care home under the Human Rights Act and Article 8, which covers the right to respect for her private life and home. They ruled that her claim lay solely against the local authority that funded her care. The Human Rights Act covers public authorities and the care home was not in this case acting as a public authority according to that decision of the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000005"></a>I do not need to go into any of the legal aspects of this. I imagine that the Committee will welcome that, as I am not at all qualified to do so. However, from the perspective of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, this is an important issue. The committee has been engaged with the Government on this since at least 2003, when it launched an inquiry on the meaning of &#147;public authority&#148;. The committee has published two stand-alone reports and has pressed the Government many times. Eventually, on 27 March this year, the Government announced that they would introduce an amendment to the Bill to ensure that those receiving publicly funded care in private care homes would be covered by the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000006"></a>I said that these were important amendments&#151;I have always been convinced of that&#151;but, since I have had the privilege of sitting through the Committee stage so far and of listening to a number of people&#146;s personal experiences, particularly the experiences of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I am forcefully reminded why the Joint Committee on Human Rights has been so determined to convince the Government that action needs to be taken.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000007"></a>Will the Minister make sure that the Government&#146;s amendments, should they be published, will appear soon enough for all those who have been working on this issue for a number of years to scrutinise them properly and that all the opinions that people have about them can be fed into the debate about this important matter, which we shall no doubt be having at a later stage? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000008"></a><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08050659000286"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I, too, have put my name to the amendment, but it would be tiresome for the Committee were I to speak to it at any length. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has sketched the background to the amendment and indicated that we are awaiting the Government&#146;s thoughts. I am also aware that the Equality and Human Rights Commission, while giving its general support to the amendments, has indicated one or two reservations to suggest that we may not have got the wording quite right yet. It has also indicated that it is deep in discussion with the Government with a view to getting the wording quite right.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000009"></a>Given that to that extent we are somewhat shadow-boxing as we await the Government&#146;s amendment, it would be wearisome for me to detain the Committee any longer, save to indicate my support for the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. We are concerned that there should be an amendment to the Bill in this area and in this regard. We eagerly await the amendment that the Government are committed to bringing forward and we shall obviously engage with it at that point.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000010"></a><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08050659000287"></a>Baroness Greengross:</b> I support this amendment, on which I shall make a couple of points. I do so as a commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission. I am particularly pleased to see that Amendment No. 38 would bring private care homes within the scope of the Act where social services have arranged the care, but I hope that the Government will not miss this legislative opportunity to clarify when private care homes will be subject to the Act and to take into account the most vulnerable people with the greatest needs, such as those suffering from dementia, who are placed in care homes by the NHS. They are either totally funded by the NHS, which is a statutory function under Section 3 of the National Health Service Act 2006, or they fund their own social care and accommodation with their registered nursing care being funded by the NHS, also under Section 3 of the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000011"></a>It is important that the Government should include both NHS and social care services in order to avoid any more ambiguity. I say that because ambiguity and confusion have been the name of the game for a long time. While it is welcome that the Government are going to tackle the problem of YL and the Leonard

It would be excellent if the Minister could assure us that both areas will be covered.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000012"></a><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08050659000288"></a>Lord Warner:</b> Perhaps I may make a few remarks based on my experience before and after the 1997 election of introducing the Human Rights Bill, as it was, to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights. At the time I was a policy adviser for the then Home Secretary. It was never intended that public services provided by private providers should be excluded from the Human Rights Act and the incorporation of the convention through that Act. This is a good example of unexpected consequences. When the legal judgment was made, it came as a real surprise to many of us. It is therefore important that the Government should go back to where they thought they were when the Human Rights Act was introduced. That Act was a great contribution by this Government, who should put right what was never intended to be wrong at the time.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000013"></a><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08050659000289"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> These two amendments relate to the application of the Human Rights Act to care provided in private settings. Many noble Lords will recall the case that has been mentioned of YL and Birmingham City Council. The Appellate Committee of this House adopted a narrow interpretation of the concept of public authority and the Human Rights Act. Of course it is unlawful by virtue of that Act for a public authority to act in a way incompatible with the convention, a right that is drawn down from the European Convention on Human Rights and on which, thanks to the Act, we may now rely in our courts.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000014"></a>In another place, my honourable friend the Minister related that it was the Government&#146;s intention that the term &#147;public authority&#148; should be interpreted reasonably broadly so as to encompass the provision of most public services, regardless of who provides them. It was certainly the Government&#146;s intention, and a point on which my noble and learned friend the then Lord Chancellor argued strongly in his intervention on YL, that this should include the provision of publicly arranged care and accommodation in an independent sector care home. Regrettably, their Lordships on the Appellate Committee did not share the Government&#146;s interpretation of the Act to that effect.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000015"></a>As the Committee may imagine, I am therefore most sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments. We share the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the noble Lord, Lord Low, the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and my noble friend Lord Warner about the effect that this narrow interpretation is having and we are determined to rectify it. I am therefore pleased to confirm that we are currently finalising a government amendment to the Bill on this subject, which will make all care homes directly subject to the Human Rights Act when providing publicly arranged care and accommodation .</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000016"></a>In answer to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, about whether health is included, we agree that publicly arranged healthcare also needs to be covered. However, I am not in a  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>position to discuss the details of the amendment today. I hope that we can discuss this further when we get to the amendment.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000017"></a>My officials have been discussing the drafting of the amendment, within government and beyond&#151;&#147;beyond&#148;, I am told, includes noble Baronesses and others&#151;to ensure that it achieves exactly what we want it to while causing no unintended consequences. Drafting an amendment of this limited nature has proved an exceptionally challenging task. The Government&#146;s amendment will seek to insert a new clause towards the end of the Bill. We therefore have the luxury of being able to have this debate today and then, when we table the amendment&#151;I am assured that it is absolutely imminent&#151;we will have plenty of time to debate it later in Committee.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000018"></a>However, I need to reiterate two points. First, the Government are also committed to the principle that the scope of the Human Rights Act should not be extended to cover care that is privately arranged by individuals and their families without the involvement of the state. The European Convention on Human Rights places limits on the powers of the state in relation to individuals, so, although the state must ensure that individuals respect each other&#146;s rights, that is not the same as placing private individuals and enterprises directly under obligations that were designed to apply to Governments. It follows that the Human Rights Act is not the appropriate framework for regulating purely private contracts.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000019"></a>Secondly, I stress that any amendment to the Bill can address only a limited part of the complex issues about the scope of the Human Rights Act. They go far wider than only care homes and it is important that we find a solution that is lasting and effective. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Human Rights therefore intends to address this wider issue in the context of the consultation process on the British Bill of rights and responsibilities and to draw on a wide range of expertise in that process in a genuine spirit of consultation. Therefore, our amendment to this Bill will be a limited solution pending a much wider examination of this issue.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000020"></a>My colleagues, my officials and I stand ready to discuss our amendment before we return to this issue. We must make sure that we get a provision of such importance absolutely correct. I am therefore in a happy position to invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment in expectation of government action very soon.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for his support and to the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, for feeding in the views of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has been very supportive on this issue. I am very grateful to the Minister for what she said. I look forward with enormous anticipation to seeing this government amendment and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000026"></a>The noble Earl said: In the absence of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and at her express request, I shall move Amendment No. 39. It is a probing amendment about GP practices and community services. It is not at all clear from the announcements made by the Government to date, or from their recent consultation document, what their intentions are&#151;or, indeed, what their inclination might be&#151;as regards bringing GPs within the registration requirements of the Bill. The Minister may say that it is too soon for the Government to give such an indication, but GPs are currently in a rather strange position. Being independent contractors, they fall outside the current inspection regime, yet 80 per cent or more of all NHS care is delivered in primary care and community settings. That figure is likely to go up over the next few years as we see the growth of practice-based commissioning and&#151;dare I say?&#151;the advent of polyclinics. More and more care will be shifted out of acute hospitals and into the community. It would therefore seem extraordinary if the quality of care provided in GP surgeries or in polyclinics were not to be monitored by the commission.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000027"></a>The NHS, as we know, is a mixed economy. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us how Part 1 is likely to affect GP practices both large and small as regards the quality assessment of services and what will happen to other independent practitioners or bodies that contract to work for an NHS organisation. Do the Government envisage that these individuals and very small bodies will need to be registered with the CQC? I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some clarification. I beg to move.</p>

In the light of this being a probing amendment and particularly in the light of other independent bodies, I am concerned about the position of independent midwives, of which there are roughly 150. These exceptional midwives offer a really remarkable service for some very vulnerable women. They were the model that I used when I drew up the policy for the report, <I>Changing Childbirth</I>. I want an assurance from the Minister that, to repeat the phrase that she used in an earlier debate, there are no unintended consequences that might result in these remarkable women being put out of their jobs and their profession due to the Bill before us. If she could give me that assurance, I would be grateful.</p>

Obviously we would welcome input from noble Lords during this consultation. At the moment, we are not saying that all primary care providers will be included in the remit of the commission; we are simply committed to considering this further and are consulting on the options. The Bill as drafted does not make it an offence to work for a person or organisation providing care that is unregistered, nor does it make it an offence to deliver care under the employment of a registered person or organisation but without being registered separately. The purpose of the offence of carrying out a regulated activity without registration is to hold a person, whether an individual, a partnership or an organisation, accountable for registering with the commission.</p>

It would not be the responsibility of the Care Quality Commission to find a new commissioner but only to say, in effect, that enough was enough regarding the old commissioner.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000040"></a>I do not move this amendment lightly. I know that it would be unpopular in many parts of NHS senior management, and I am not totally convinced that it would go down terribly well in some parts of the Department of Health, which regards it as the job of the strategic health authorities and Department of Health Ministers to administer the red card based on the information provided by the commission. However, even if we accept that position, the commission has to be able to intervene sufficiently in commissioning to provide the evidence for the red card to be administered by someone else. Therefore, some issues arise here about how effective the commission could be in providing the information to enable that action to be taken by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000041"></a>Equally, I know how difficult it is for both strategic health authorities and Ministers to administer the coup de grace to a failing health authority, whether it is a PCT or a hospital trust. In the real world, the local politics can make this extremely difficult, especially when heartrending stories are told about the inadequate funding provided and there is a string of hard-luck stories. I have heard some of those stories and have heard some of the reasons why it is impossible to take action in a particular area. Therefore, I sympathise with many colleagues who end up sitting in the ministerial seats. As I said, I have been around long enough to hear those stories myself. </p>

<p><a name="08050659000042"></a>I also know that Ministers are often frustrated by the seeming inability of the NHS to tackle local failure adequately. That is not a new phenomenon; it has been the case under successive Governments. My amendment would make it easier for Ministers to act dispassionately because the red card would have been administered by an independent commission and therefore the decision would have been taken outside politics. If the commission could act for the providers of services in this way, that would be extremely welcome. In this amendment, I am simply providing for equality of treatment between providers and commissioners of services, as I would have done if I had still been responsible as a Minister.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000043"></a>Looking at my drafting afresh, I can see that it could be improved&#151;I am not proud of the wording&#151;and that it could possibly be located elsewhere in the Bill. However, as I think I said earlier, I strongly believe that it should be up to the commission, rather than SHAs, to administer what I am calling the red card when, after persistent failure, a PCT is shown to be not up to the job. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000045"></a>I am very attracted to the amendment but I am not optimistic that the Government would be entirely happy with it. It would have a wonderful impact on the providers and purchasers if, through the Bill, the commission had strong intervention powers in trusts and foundation trusts. This kind of intervention power on the commissioning side would be a miracle.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000046"></a><a name="80506-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08050659000297"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I am drawn to the amendment and I was considerably persuaded by the case made by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. While not completely connected to the points he made, perhaps I may spend a moment or two on Clause 14 which, at first sight, appears to contain some puzzling provisions. I have been prompted to raise these questions by the Relatives and Residents Association, to whose work I pay tribute.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000047"></a>The intentions behind the clause are difficult to understand. It deals with what one might term slow suspensions&#151;that is to say, suspensions that will not take effect pending written representations and any appeal to the Care Standards Tribunal of a decision to suspend. It is difficult to see the circumstances where this power would be invoked given that it will potentially not take effect for many months. There is a requirement in the clause to specify a time period for the suspension&#151;for example, three months&#151;but what happens if an appeal to the Care Standards Tribunal takes seven or eight months to be heard after the initial decision to suspend?</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000048"></a>If there is a risk of harm to anyone&#151;let us say the residents of a care home&#151;then it is likely that the regulator would choose to use the urgent procedure provided for in Clause 27. Once a notice is served under that clause, it takes effect immediately. There is then provision for an appeal to the Care Standards Tribunal. The threshold in Clause 27 appears to be relatively low, which raises the question of what the threshold is under Clause 14. Ofsted has the same test as under Clause 27 with regard to childminders and daycare providers in the sense of reasonable cause to believe that there will be an exposure to risk. However, the Ofsted regime is further qualified by a statutory purpose to reduce or eliminate risk or to allow for an investigation to take place. The Ofsted suspension period is limited to six weeks plus a further six weeks, and then a continuing suspension if matters are beyond Ofsted&#146;s control&#151;for example, where there is an ongoing police investigation.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000049"></a>Can the Minister elucidate the intention behind Clause 14 and the kinds of circumstances where it might be thought appropriate for the CQC to invoke it? It would appear that the suspension applies to the entire registration. Is that correct or will there be the option to apply it to part of a service? What would need to happen to the residents of a care home if a service provider&#146;s entire registration were to be suspended? I am struggling with the thought of what might happen to an acute hospital trust if its

It would be helpful if the Minister could take us through how the provisions are intended to work.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000050"></a><a name="80506-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08050659000298"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> We of course expect the CQC to consider taking enforcement action where providers fail to improve to meet safety and quality requirements that are currently the subject of our consultation. It will have a range of powers at its disposal, including the cancellation or suspension of the registration of a provider or registered manager if necessary.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000051"></a>The review function is additional to the registration and enforcement system, reporting on the quality of services and looking into specific or general matters in relation to statutory health and adult social care services. Of course, if the commission uncovers significant safety or quality issues when carrying out a periodic or special review of a registered provider and the matters are covered by the registration requirements, the commission will, as a last resort, be able to cancel registration. Amendment No. 40 is intended to ensure that.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000052"></a>That is not, however, the only way that problems uncovered in reviews can be addressed. The comparative information that the commission will publish as part of its review function will not only help the public, patients and users of social care services to make informed choices about who should provide their care; it will also prompt local authorities and PCTs to address poor provider performance through their contracting arrangements.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000053"></a>Where a body is found to be failing in its role of commissioning care, the Care Quality Commission will of course publish those findings and be able to give advice to the Secretary of State. In England, the performance management of NHS bodies is the responsibility of strategic health authorities, while the Care Quality Commission can recommend special measures in relation to local authorities. Those are important roles in the system and will play an important part in driving forward quality improvements.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000054"></a>Rather than necessarily cancelling a registration outright, there will be occasions when it is more appropriate for the Care Quality Commission to suspend the registration of a manager or a service provider in respect of a regulated activity for a specified period, so that a breach of a specified requirement can be resolved. Two routes to suspension are set out in Clause 14. Under the first route, the Care Quality Commission will have to give the provider or manager a notice in writing of its intention to suspend the service. The provider then has the right to make representations before the commission decides whether to continue with its proposal. If it continues with suspension, the provider will have the right to appeal to the tribunal before the suspension takes place. The noble Earl is right to say that there will be time implications there. Should the breach that led to the suspension remain unresolved at the end of the suspension period and the associated risk continue, Clause 14 allows the commission to extend suspension for a further fixed period.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC138"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000055"></a>We anticipate that the non-urgent route of suspension will be most appropriate where the provider and the commission agree to a period of suspension&#151;especially as it is preferable to cancellation of registration. Therefore, there would not be appeals to the Care Standards Tribunal. That should be the standard procedure; it allows the provider a chance to make representations before action is taken. That should both encourage issues to be resolved before costly enforcement action is taken and protect the provider&#146;s rights by giving them access to due process.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000056"></a>The Bill also allows for an urgent suspension procedure under Clause 27. The commission will be able to use that expedited route when it has reasonable cause to believe that unless it acts, people may be exposed to the risk of harm. The CQC will use that when a provider is not only failing to act within the registration requirements but is exposing people to the immediate risk of harm.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000057"></a>Suspension is different from de-registration in that a suspended provider or manager will remain registered with the new commission. That is to ensure that once a suspension has been lifted the person will not need to re-apply for registration. That will avoid unnecessary delays for service users and for the provider. Clause 2 means that the CQC must balance the risks of its actions against the risks of allowing dangerous services to continue.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000058"></a>I hope that my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, are now reassured that Amendment No. 40 is not required for the Bill to achieve their intention. I hope that I have also been able to explain clearly the purpose behind Clause 14.</p>

She seems to be saying &#147;yes&#148;, but I cannot quite reconcile that with her earlier remarks on Amendment No. 29, which seemed to exclude commissioning as a regulated activity. We will have to speak afterwards about what the terminology used particularly in Clause 4(2) actually means. Does it or does it not include commissioning&#151;in which case, who has the final say?

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000249"></a> Clause 16, page 7, line 35, after &#147;are&#148; insert &#147;not&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000070"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 44 to 47 and 49. Clause 16 makes provision for regulations to be made about the requirements that have to be met before anyone can be registered as a service provider or manager under Clause 8 and which they will continue to have to meet so long as they remain responsible for delivering regulated activities. Perhaps I may stress before going any further that all the amendments should be read as probing in nature. They do, however, reflect a range of concerns on which I should appreciate the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000071"></a>We have here yet another example of how the Secretary of State in quite a major sense will be in control of what the commission does. I recognise the realities: it is true that we are going to allow the commission to exercise a good deal of discretion in assessing people&#146;s fitness to provide regulated services, but beyond a certain point we cannot have a commission which is allowed to make up all its own rules and enforce those rules without any accountability to Parliament. There are important aspects of its work where parliamentary scrutiny and approval are entirely appropriate and right. However, there needs to be a balance.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000072"></a>In giving the Secretary of State the broad powers set out in subsection (1)&#151;they do seem to be particularly sweeping&#151;surely we can also say that there are certain issues with which Ministers and Parliament need not and should not concern themselves, either because to do so would be unnecessarily prescriptive or because they are matters which should more properly be seen as part of the process of due diligence on the part of those who commission health or social care services. Let us look at what the clause sets out. Subsection (3)(a) states that regulations may,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000263"></a>&#147;make provision as to the persons who are fit to carry on or manage a regulated activity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000230"></a>A similar provision is made in subsection (3)(c) about,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000264"></a>&#147;persons who are fit to work for the purpose of the carrying on of a regulated activity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000231"></a>Potentially, these seem to allow the Secretary of State an extraordinary degree of control over who can or cannot work in a care home or hospital. In any event, how on earth is it possible to define a priori who are fit persons? What are the criteria that Ministers will use? I could understand it if the Government restricted themselves to proscribing people whose names appear on lists held by the Criminal Records Bureau or who in other ways might be seen as clearly unsuited to being a registered service provider, but the drafting leaves scope for all manner of detailed criteria to be applied, some of them subjective, no doubt. I question how appropriate this is. Could not the wording be tightened?</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000073"></a>Subsection (3)(b) states that regulations may cover,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000265"></a>&#147;the manner in which a regulated activity is carried on&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08050659000232"></a>What does that actually mean? Taken literally, it would enable the Secretary of State to dictate every little detail of how health and social care services should be delivered but I am sure that the latter has no intention whatever of doing any such thing. For the most part, I hope the Minister will agree that the way in which a regulated activity is carried out is a matter of professional practice, and that is not a matter in which the Government should get directly involved.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000074"></a>In subsection (4) we see that one aspect of this issue relates to the,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000266"></a>&#147;control and restraint ... of persons receiving health or social care ... services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000233"></a>The rules for controlling or restraining a patient or service user are most certainly a matter that needs to be dealt with by regulations and I have no quarrel with that. However, subsection (3)(b) refers very broadly to,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000267"></a>&#147;the manner in which a regulated activity is carried on&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000234"></a>That is very broad. Why is it not possible to word this part of the clause a little more tightly so as to capture only those concerns which are a legitimate matter for regulation?</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000075"></a>Subsections (3)(d) and (e) allow regulations to lay down requirements about the,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000268"></a>&#147;management and training of persons who work for the purpose of the carrying on of a regulated activity&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000235"></a>and the &#147;fitness of premises&#148;. I question whether it is appropriate to prescribe these matters in regulations. Of course, the management and training of staff are not at all irrelevant considerations in this context, nor is the fitness of premises. They are important but, to my mind, they are things that fall to be assessed primarily by those who commission services. A responsible commissioner will wish to make sure that a hospital or care home has the right number of staff trained to the right level and that the premises are fit for purpose, but it is surely wrong to expect regulations to spell out in precise detail what counts as a fit set of premises or an adequately trained workforce. The most that regulations should do is to authorise the commission to reach its own view on these matters when making an assessment of someone who applies for registration. If the intention is for the regulations to make only that sort of generalised provision, why not have wording that achieves that and no more?</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000076"></a>Finally, on subsection (3)(h), it is impossible to imagine how regulations could ever adequately define in advance the financial position required of a person to be registered as a service provider. There are simply too many factors at play. Of course, no one wants a care home owner to get a certificate of registration only to go bankrupt within a few weeks, but we cannot seriously expect the commission to become bankers or credit analysts, which is what is implied. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain the thinking behind this paragraph. I hope that it is straightforward&#151;for example, that someone should not be registered as a provider if he is an undischarged bankrupt or in receipt of a petition from his creditors. That would be fine, but surely it is not realistic or feasible to go much further.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000077"></a>This is all about balance. How far is it appropriate to try to cram provisions into regulations and how much should be left to the discretion and good judgment of the commission? Clause 16 gives us no feeling at all on how that balance is to be struck. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it. I beg to move.</p>

The criticism that I have heard from people within the care profession is that there is an insufficiently clear description of what would constitute good practice within care homes. As I understand it, the public look to Parliament to set out clearly the direction that the commission should be taking. All the examples which the noble Earl called on in arguing that the Government have gone too far were examples that the public would expect them to act on&#151;particularly in guiding the commission on what emphasis it should give to what the public regard as most important.</p>

At Second Reading, from these Benches we put a lot of emphasis on a light touch for regulation and proportionality. That was the Government&#146;s theme in earlier debates. I am anxious that we do not have a heavy-handed regulatory body. At Second Reading, I remember giving your Lordships an example of where, in the past, we had prescriptive regulations on issues such as the size of rooms, whether they should be en-suite and whether they should be doubles, singles or whatever. The result was devastating and a large number of nice little homely homes had to close. In the end, the Government had to rescind those standards because they realised what damage was being done. We are seeking to ensure that there is no repeat of that disaster.</p>

I do not know the detail of these issues in the way that the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, does, but she talks about room sizes. I do not know the answer and I am sure that the Government will explain, but perhaps they rescinded the standards because too many rooms were being removed from the market. That would not necessarily mean that the conditions in which people occupied those rooms were suitable. I would argue that the issue of room size is extremely important. When one goes around care homes&#151;which I am sure the noble Baroness has done&#151;and talks to people who live in them, one thing that they comment on is the size of their room. The Government may have rescinded the rules because they were worried about the lack of provision arising from controls, but I should have thought that room size was an extremely important issue of principle.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulations which pre-dated that Bill by a very long way. Much of the initial discussion was fuelled by the issue of the dignity and privacy of individual users. I think I am right in saying that those requirements were rescinded because the drug and alcohol charities entered into discussions with the department and made a strong and powerful case that having people with drug and alcohol problems in seclusion in individual rooms was not conducive to therapy.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000082"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, is right that we should ensure that the requirements are proportionate. Again, that points to the importance of distinguishing between different client groups and different forms of social care. We have gone on about that at considerable length throughout this Committee stage, but it is a point that cannot be stated too many times or with too many illustrations in our debates. Therefore, it is helpful that this matter has been brought up.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000083"></a><a name="80506-gc0005.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0005.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08050659000306"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, aims to limit the amount of regulation imposed on providers of regulated activities by limiting the scope of the regulation-making power under Clause 16. Subsection (1) gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations under Clause 16. Given the significance of this power, we are, as noble Lords are aware, consulting on the registration requirements.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000084"></a>I turn, first, to Amendments Nos. 43 and 45, which would alter the clause to state that regulations may make provision about who is not, rather than who is, fit to carry on or manage a regulated activity or work for the purposes of a regulated activity. Clause 16(1) already enables the Secretary of State to make regulations about any requirements, which could be both positive and negative attributes in relation to regulated activities, and this will ensure that the regulation-making power gives sufficient flexibility for the regulations to impose appropriate requirements.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000085"></a>Subsections (2) and (3) of Clause 16 give a more detailed indication of our intentions for regulations under subsection (1), making it clear that we intend these to focus on quality and safety requirements. Regulations may, for example, make provision stating that persons on the protection of vulnerable adults list are not fit to carry on or manage a regulated activity. They may also make provision stating that a person working for a provider of a regulated activity must have appropriate qualifications for that activity.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000086"></a>We believe it is vital that we make the regulations, whether positive or negative, as clear as possible so that providers and managers are clear about who is and who is not fit, and that is what the Bill as drafted allows. This is consistent with the wording in the Care Standards Act 2000, under which social care providers and private and voluntary health providers are currently regulated.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000087"></a>Amendments Nos. 44 and 46 to 49 probe the meaning of the matters in Clause 16(3). I appreciate the desire to ensure that providers have sufficient freedom to deliver services in a flexible manner and to reduce the burden of regulation. However, it may be worth drawing attention to the fact that subsection (3)  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sets out our intentions for regulations under Clause 16, rather than being a fixed list of the aspects that will definitely be included. Bearing in mind the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, it is not our intention to make regulation very detailed or overprescriptive.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000088"></a>As noble Lords know, we are currently consulting on the scope of registration and the proposed topics for the registration requirements. This process will be fundamental in determining which of these aspects are covered in the regulations. That said, I believe that all the aspects set out in this clause could quite properly be included in regulations. I am sure noble Lords agree that it is vital that regulations clearly set out the requirements that providers must meet to deliver safe services of appropriate quality. For example, the clause sets out our intention for regulations to make provision on the manner in which the regulated activity is carried out. Under that provision, we propose a topic of managing medicines safely in our consultation document.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000089"></a>One of the aims of the new registration system is to ensure a more proportionate, risk-based approach to regulation. Regulations under Clause 16 are not intended to be overly prescriptive. They will be focused on essential safety and quality issues across health and social care. The regulations will require providers to manage risks to the safety, quality and governance of the care they provide and address the concerns of those who use the services. We do not intend to specify every last detail of how a provider must operate.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000090"></a>The commission itself will be responsible for developing the more detailed guidance against which it will check that providers are complying with regulations. Providers themselves must be able to decide how to deliver services to achieve the best outcomes for those who use the services. Given those assurances about our intention in Clause 16, I ask the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000091"></a><a name="80506-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08050659000307"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I am delighted to say that my probing amendments succeeded in their purpose, because that was a very helpful reply from the Minister. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that I do not for a minute dispute or argue with the public&#146;s expectation that Parliament should be the body that looks at and decides on the broad requirements for registered providers. Of course Parliament should be accountable in that sense and there should be regulations. The Minister has helpfully confirmed what I had hoped: that prescriptiveness is not in the Government&#146;s mind and that the main thing that matters is safe services of appropriate quality, as she said.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000092"></a>I hope that we will get a set of regulations before us that give a clear steer to the commission to exercise its professional judgment in individual cases, but that we will not try to shoehorn every provider into a prescribed mould, because that is futile. As my noble friend Lady Cumberlege said, following the passage of the Care Standards Act we found how damaging that approach was. Very good care providers were being penalised and in some cases had to close for no reason other than that the room sizes or some technical measures failed to meet the laid-down

In many cases, it was a tragedy that that should have been allowed, for such reasons are by no means the only measures of good care in any individual instance.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000093"></a>I thank the Minister once again for her reply and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000097"></a>The noble Baroness said: I was slightly alarmed a moment or two ago when, racing down the list, the noble Baroness threw in Amendment No. 48. Hello, I thought, have we got to that already? We are now firmly there.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000098"></a>The first thing that crosses my mind is that Gordon Ramsay, Delia Smith and the chef of the Fat Duck at Bray have never found themselves seriously challenged by hospital food. I have never heard of patients refusing discharge because hospital meals were so delicious, nor have I heard of ex-TV chefs queuing for a job in a hospital kitchen. Woefully, the reverse is the truth. The quality of meals served to inpatients in hospitals is so appalling that we read in a recent report that a quarter of all complaints about nursing are about nutrition: poor standard of food quality, lack of appropriate food and complaints that the only edible food was that brought in by family members.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000099"></a>Even doctors&#146; advice on what a patient must eat is ignored. One young mother was told by a doctor in the hospital that she must eat iron-rich food like broccoli and red meat because she was anaemic, so she was delighted when the hospital menu given to her for the next meal included broccoli pasta bake and she ordered it at once. Alas for the doctor&#146;s orders, the dish had not one single piece of broccoli in it. She described it as &#147;like glue&#148;. As for having red meat, she says that that was offered only very rarely.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000100"></a>A breast cancer patient who was a vegetarian ordered vegetable hotpot from the menu. She was struck by the extreme paucity of any vegetables at all floating around in the pink sauce, so she counted the ones she could see. She assures me that there were six slices of potato, quite small, and one lonely haricot bean. It is tragic. That was the sum total of the vegetable content. No wonder nearly 70 per cent of hospital staff said that improvements in hospital food should be made and 21 per cent of them stated flatly that they would not touch the food served to patients. </p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000101"></a>Two points arise from these revelations. One is the huge waste of scarce resources in the number of meals that remain untouched on patients&#146; plates. Forty per cent of hospital food is wasted&#151;those are official figures, not mine. That is 13 million hospital meals being thrown away per year, at a cost of &#163;2.65 each. I have never claimed to be a mathematician, but I think that amounts to &#163;34.45 million per annum. When one considers what could be done elsewhere in the health service with that sum, one could weep.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000102"></a>The second point is that when people are sick they need proper nutrition to have a hope of getting better but, for the reasons I have just stated, new research shows that nutritional standards worsen during a hospital stay. Patients receive, at best, only 70 per cent of the energy and protein they need. There has been some government recognition of the importance of positive action on this matter&#151;and, knowing the Minister, I am not surprised. I do not know quite how far it should cheer me up, but it cheered me up a bit. The Food Standards Agency recently published nutritional guidelines for the food provided to adults in public institutions and the Department of Health itself has published a nutrition action plan.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000103"></a>All NHS trusts are supposed to meet a core standard but there is some doubt about whether they will, partly because the standards are self-assessed and only very few trusts are independently assessed. We all know how quickly trusts rush to defend themselves against allegations of any kind of bad behaviour&#151;they are very bad at admitting to what is found to be wrong in their particular areas&#151;but a recent Healthcare Commission report expressed doubt about whether the standards are being supported in practice. Almost half of the trusts visited were in dire need of improvement. Many did not provide dietary needs, and trusts were not monitoring nutrition properly.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000104"></a>Just over a month ago the Government published their draft requirements for registration in the Care Quality Commission. These included nutrition, but the requirements merely replicate the current system, which, as even the Healthcare Commission shows, just does not work. <I>Which?</I>, of the Consumers&#146; Association, points out that the proposals in the registration consultation make no reference to the FSA guidance or the nutritional action plan. It says that a,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000269"></a>&#147;tougher approach to regulation and inspection in this area is essential for real improvement in the quality of hospital food&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000105"></a>When Minister Ben Bradshaw spoke about this topic in another place he freely acknowledged the need for action. However, he linked it not with the Care Quality Commission, but with the NHS operating framework, which of course applies only to the NHS. The Consumers&#146; Association, Age Concern and a number of assorted Peers feel that the CQC should tackle the issue, because if it did it would have a priority right across the whole of health and social care and that is what is needed. In conclusion, <I>Which?</I> says that Parliament should make it clear that nutrition and food are so central to the well-being of patients and to users of social care services that the Care Quality Commission should have explicit responsibility for it.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000106"></a>I hope that the Government will listen to our aims and our reasons. Sadly, the Floor of the Committee is covered with the bodies of dead amendments. Earlier this afternoon I thought the Minister was like the Red Queen, saying &#147;Off with his head!&#148; to every amendment; in fact, I do not recall a single amendment being left with its head on. I hope that this one might just strike a chord, because I know that she cares about these matters and wants to see an improvement. I invite her to put away the notion of knocking my amendment&#146;s head off and to consider it kindly. I beg to move.</p>

When my husband was in hospital when he had serious problems resulting from diabetes, Parkinson&#146;s disease and post-stroke, he had great difficulty in swallowing in the latter years of his illnesses. On one occasion when he was admitted to hospital, the hospital had just gone over to a housekeeping policy for serving patients food. The woman who served his meals was helpful and interested. I told her why my husband had swallowing problems. She said, &#147;The hospital tells us nothing&#148;. Surely the people in charge of serving meals should know what the patients&#146; needs are so that they are given suitable food and thickened drinks when necessary.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000108"></a>Last year at the Royal College of Nursing&#146;s annual congress in Harrogate, nearly half the nurses revealed that they do not have enough time during their working day to ensure that patients get good nutrition. Just under half the hospital nurses said that the lack of availability of food outside of mealtimes was a factor, while 46 per cent of the 2,000 nurses surveyed nationwide said that generally there are not enough staff to ensure that patients get the help needed to eat and drink. The executive director for nursing at the RCN said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000251"></a>&#147;Good nutrition and hydration are vital for all of us, but they are even more important for people who are ill&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000109"></a>In the days when there were a matron and sisters on the wards to supervise and there was not a habit of nurses chatting around the nurses&#146; station, patients&#146; nutritional needs were part of nursing. I am sure that most of us have seen trays being left out of reach of patients; food being left while patients are asleep and then taken away; patients not being helped into a suitable position to eat or drink; and unsuitable food being given. I am sure that much more can be done to enable trained volunteers to help in this important matter, but volunteers should be co-ordinated with organised rotas to help nurses. If patients are to get better quicker, those nutritional needs should become a priority. I hope something will emerge from the amendments which will be acceptable and will help all patients who need good nutrition.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000110"></a><a name="80506-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08050659000310"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I listened to what the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, said, but her argument is more about the availability of specialist foods for patients who have particular difficulties. I refer to my experience in this matter. I support this eminently sensible amendment, but there is another side to the story.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000111"></a>It has become very easy copy in this country to knock hospital food. It is one of those things that turn up in newspaper articles because people are very ready to make complaints. People who have spent long periods in hospitals, as I have&#151;sometimes for months on end&#151;often have a very different experience of hospital food. When you are in hospital, you learn how to work the menu. You learn what are the good meals and what are the bad meals. I have never been in a hospital where I found the food deficient. Admittedly, when I was away at school in the 1950s and early 1960s, I became used to school breakfast, lunch and dinner menus. However, the point is that in hospitals conditions  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are very much the same in the sense that people can eat well if they choose to do so, but many people choose not to do so. They refuse to eat.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000112"></a>When I was in hospital, I found that people shunned their food because they did not want to eat. Their meals were often ordered by visiting relatives who filled in the forms. They were often filled in by nurses who asked someone what they wanted. That food was delivered to the patient and he or she did not eat it for all sorts of reasons, perhaps because they had been given food by their relatives who visited that day. To measure food on the basis of how much is returned uneaten to the kitchens is not a very good way of assessing whether the food in hospitals is nutritious. I accept that there should be standards and that this is an eminently sensible amendment about nutritional standards. Hospitals should comply with standards set down. But, equally, it is wrong of us to presume that in most hospitals in the United Kingdom standards of food are very poor; I completely disagree.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000113"></a><a name="80506-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08050659000311"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, which are in this group. My noble friend Lady Knight ably and persuasively drew our attention to an issue which is of immense significance for the health of the nation. I should like to supplement what she said with a few rather sobering statistics.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000114"></a>According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, at least 2 million people in the UK are undernourished. That figure is higher in absolute terms than that for Morocco, Libya or Algeria. The cost to our society is undoubtedly immense. The number of people admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of undernutrition has increased from 70,000, 10 years ago, to 130,000 in 2006-07&#151;a rise of 85 per cent. The overall cost to the NHS is estimated at &#163;7.3 billion a year. Only about half this cost arises in hospitals; the remainder arises in community settings&#151;for example, from the care required for the undernourished living in residential care facilities.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000115"></a>The guidance issued by NICE has been implemented, as so often, in a very patchy way. It recommends that all patients are screened for nutritional risk on admission to hospital, as well as on first registration at a GP practice. However, NICE itself has estimated that only about 30 per cent of patients are screened on admission to hospital, while a survey by BAPEN, the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, published in April 2008, found that more than one in 10 hospitals does not have a nutrition screening policy in place. I have heard it said that compliance with NICE guidance in community settings is likely to be far lower than in secondary care, but that is only surmise. Hard information on this is not readily available.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000116"></a>Undernutrition can occur at any age, of course, but as my noble friend has indicated, it is particularly associated with the elderly. Like my noble friend, I pay tribute to Age Concern and its campaign called &#147;Hungry to be Heard&#148;, which highlights among other things the greatly increased prevalence of malnutrition among patients aged over 80 who are admitted to hospital compared with those aged under 50, and how important it is to obtain the views and experiences of elderly patients if compliance with the standards is to be properly assessed.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000117"></a>The effects of malnutrition are well documented: prolonged hospital stays, delayed recovery, an increased risk of contracting healthcare-associated infections and poor respiratory function. In some studies, the mortality rate among undernourished patients is up to eight times higher than that among well-nourished patients. But it is a condition that is relatively easy to identify. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool is available for healthcare professionals to use, and once identified as being at risk, patients in hospital or vulnerable people in the community can be supported in their nutritional needs by a wide variety of measures. These range from simple steps such as red tray schemes and protected mealtimes; enteral nutrition, which means specially formulated foods that are taken by mouth or tube directly into the digestive system; to the most intensive parenteral nutrition involving tube feeding directly into the blood.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000118"></a>To their credit, the Government have done quite a lot to tackle undernutrition in recent years. A nutrition action plan was published last October and some useful work has been conducted by the National Patient Safety Agency. Nutritional care is also prioritised in the core standards monitored by the Healthcare Commission. Core Standard C15 B ensures that an individual&#146;s,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000270"></a>&#147;nutritional, personal and clinical dietary requirements&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000236"></a>are being met. However, there is some evidence to suggest that this requirement is insufficient. In 2006-07, none of the 34 NHS trusts which discharged the highest number of patients in an undernourished state failed the Healthcare Commission&#146;s Core Standard C15 B. Conceivably this may be because the way that adherence to the standard is measured is by providers assessing themselves.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000119"></a>The Government have undertaken work to improve the nutritional care offered to patients, but the evidence we have suggests that the problem is getting worse, not better. The Bill presents a valuable opportunity to oblige health and social care providers in primary as well as secondary care to put a higher priority on nutritional standards. The intention behind my amendments is that nutrition should be placed on the same statutory footing as tackling hospital-acquired infections. I am well aware that Ministers have said that they intend to use the powers in the Bill to tackle undernutrition, but there is a good case for being explicit about this. A consultation is currently running on the possible registration requirements, which includes a specific registration requirement on nutritional care. The problem is that the consultation does not commit the Government to taking action. It is entirely possible, given the difficulty encountered by the Healthcare Commission in monitoring adherence by providers to the current core standard, that the registration requirement on nutrition may be abandoned following consultation. We just do not know.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000120"></a>For all those reasons, the amendments deserve the support of the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000122"></a>I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 54 and 55. It is very disappointing that a voluntary organisation such as Age Concern should find it necessary to fight a campaign for nutrition in hospitals. As my noble friend Lord Howe mentioned, its report is very good indeed and I congratulate Age Concern on it. If only 45 per cent of all hospitals have taken action to tackle the shocking levels of malnutrition among older people, it is necessary to draw the attention of the nation to this subject.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000123"></a>I cannot understand how one hospital can have delicious food and another uneatable; how one hospital can ensure that patients are properly fed and another ignore the importance of good nutrition. Good nutrition is not only essential for good recovery but is one of the very few things that punctuates a boring hospital day and is nearly always a talking point with visitors. My experience is not quite as black as that of my noble friend Lady Knight. I remember being involved with a hospital where the food was so good that the staff and others chose the hospital catering service for their wedding receptions at competitive rates; and yet I know there are others where the patients are so hungry that they have to phone out for pizzas to be delivered.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000124"></a>As with so many other things, the Healthcare Commission takes the subject seriously. It sets two standards in accordance with the Better Hospital Food programme, which was introduced in May 2001. This programme outlines six requirements which should be implemented. In addition, the programme includes further advice and guidance relating to a balanced diet, a splendid NHS recipe book and national menu design. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s core standard C15 A states that where food is provided, organisations should have systems in place to ensure that patients are given a choice, that food is prepared safely, and that it provides a balanced diet reflecting the needs, preferences and rights&#151;including faith and cultural needs&#151;of its population. </p>

<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000125"></a>It also requires that the preparation, distribution, handling and serving of food is carried out in accordance with food safety legislation and national guidance, including the Food Safety Act 1990, the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995 and EC Regulation 852/2004. So we are not short of guidance or regulations. The 1995 regulations require that organisations should ensure that the preparation, distribution, handling and offering for supply of food are carried out in a hygienic way. That seems sensible. Further, the organisation should identify any step which is,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000271"></a>&#147;critical to ensuring food safety and ensure that adequate safety procedures are identified, implemented, maintained and reviewed&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000126"></a>The Healthcare Commission&#146;s second core standard, C15 B, states that where food is provided healthcare organisations have systems in place to ensure that patients&#146; individual,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000272"></a>&#147;nutritional, personal and clinical dietary requirements are met, including, where necessary, help with feeding and access to food and drink 24 hours a day&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08050659000237"></a>In order to do this, some trusts are using the<I> Essence of Care</I> benchmarking tool, which includes food and nutrition. This is practice-based and used by nurses to ensure that patients who are already malnourished or at risk of becoming so are identified early on. It is optional, and some trusts are using other benchmarking systems. The commission standards also recommend protected mealtimes, when all non-urgent clinical activity should stop. During these times, patients should be able to eat without interruption and staff should be free to offer assistance.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80506-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000127"></a>Therefore, although much is happening, there is still frustration that despite all the advice, guidance and regulation, a real problem exists here. Ultimately, this is a professional problem and it is about management. It relies on nurses being vigilant, caring and watchful, and ensuring that patients are treated with dignity and properly fed. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours: choice of food is a very personal thing and sometimes drugs, anaesthetics and treatment can alter one&#146;s taste. Fast throughput of patients means that meals may have been chosen by the previous incumbent of the bed or, as we heard this afternoon, by relatives, and they are not always the choice of the individual.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000128"></a>The Healthcare Commission states that on the whole the systems&#151;the training, hygiene and so on&#151;are in place. In my view, it is the professionalism&#151;the delivery on the wards&#151;that is lacking. It is my belief that regulation should have a light touch, as I have mentioned several times during our debates. I would not normally agree that what is essentially a management problem should be enshrined in legislation. However, I think that the concern is so great that there is a role here for the regulator. The Care Quality Commission will throw a spotlight on this subject. It will call people to account and make trusts think deeply about what can only be called a lack of good nursing care. I am sorry to say that because I have long been an admirer of the nursing profession, but in this area I think that there is a lack of professionalism. Yesterday, I visited a friend in hospital whose wife said to me, &#147;The cure is great. The care is wanting&#148;. Nutrition is about care, but it also stimulates a cure and a speedy recovery. I strongly support the amendments.</p>

I cannot emphasise enough that I share noble Lords&#146; concerns. As the noble Baronesses, Lady Knight and Lady Masham, know, I take this matter very seriously.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000130"></a>A great deal of work is currently being carried out on the ground in relation to nutrition and hospital food, as was very well described by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege. For example, the Government have invested &#163;67 million in care homes to improve the care environment, including dining rooms and support for residents at mealtimes. They are also working closely with the regulators, CSCI and the Healthcare Commission, to make dignity a key part of the inspections, because dignity  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is also part of this debate. We very much welcome the Healthcare Commission&#146;s decision to inspect 25 acute hospitals to check compliance with dignity and nutritional standards.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000131"></a>The department is using a number of different tools to tackle this important issue, including the current core standards, the Nutrition Action Plan programme and the NHS operating framework, as has already been mentioned. However, there is no excuse for people saying that they are too busy to assist at mealtimes. The introduction of protected mealtimes is a key tool in making certain that the right level of attention is given to ensuring that patients who can do so will enjoy their meals, while those who need assistance will receive it without interruption. It is unacceptable that some of our most vulnerable older patients, service users and people with special requirements do not receive the help they need in eating food and that efforts are not made to ensure that they enjoy it. It is an issue with which we are seized.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000132"></a>We have proposed a registration requirement to be made under Clause 16, which I hope will help reassure the noble Baronesses, Lady Knight, Lady Masham and Lady Cumberlege, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that we can achieve the intention behind Amendments Nos. 48 and 54 without amending the Bill. Our proposed requirement 5 is,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000273"></a>&#147;making sure people get the nourishment they need&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000133"></a>Under that proposed requirement, providers of care would have to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000252"></a>&#147;Ensure, where meeting nutritional needs is part of the service, that people have access to safe and sufficient nourishment. This includes: the provision of support for eating, drinking or feeding where required; the provision of a sufficient choice of palatable food to meet religious or cultural needs; and the prevention of harm through lack of access to sufficient nutrition and hydration&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000238"></a>This is important. It is out for consultation. The groups that have been mentioned and prayed in aid have the opportunity to comment on it and I encourage them to do so. The Care Quality Commission will be able to act on these issues whereas the Healthcare Commission cannot. So while the requirements are very similar, with nutrition as a requirement for enforcement, the Healthcare Commission can act to ensure that this is followed through. Noble Lords have expressed their concerns that this is not happening at the moment. I hope this comes close to noble Lords&#146; expectations of the comprehensive, appropriate and rigorous levels of care that service users should be entitled to expect.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000134"></a>As ever, the noble Earl and the noble Baronesses made a powerful case for specific standards for the promotion of adequate nutrition and criteria for assessing their compliance. We have acknowledged throughout debates on this Bill that the commission itself will be best placed to set the specific criteria by which providers are assessed for compliance with the registration requirements. We have already talked about the need for the commission to be as independent as possible, and so I still remain unconvinced that it would be appropriate for the Government to issue a code of practice on nutrition or for regulations to determine the criteria by which compliance is assessed.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000135"></a>We fully intend that this critical issue should form a part of the new commission&#146;s registration regime, and the Bill already enables this. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, that we have agreed&#151;despite chopping off heads, as she might say&#151;to look again at regulatory requirements, user involvement, LINks and the CQC, clarifying the role of the CQC in relation to commissioning in Chapter 3 of Part 1, and safeguarding the rights of service users. So we have gone some way to meet concerns. It is not the case that we have not considered everything. We think that the framework proposed in the Bill and the teeth that the Bill has to deal with these issues is sufficient. Therefore, I hope that the noble Earl and the noble Baronesses will feel able to withdraw these amendments.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000146"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments is related to how the CQC will discharge its functions in relation to the Mental Health Act and other legislation. In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to my Amendment No. 52 and to my noble friend Lady Meacher&#146;s Amendment No. 53. She sends her apologies to the Committee that she is unable to be present. The noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, asked me to indicate his support for the amendments in his role as chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000147"></a>Essentially, all the amendments are a little different. I shall try to be brief. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that regulations under Clause 126 can impose requirements regarding information on the numbers of admissions and discharges from compulsory powers under the Mental Health Act and to have the deaths of detained patients reported.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000148"></a>Some 15 years ago, there was no collection of the use of Mental Health Act powers and I well remember an interview between me, the then chairman of the commission, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and the then Secretary of State, Kenneth Clarke, about issues to do with the Mental Health Act. The Secretary of State asked us whether use of the powers had increased or decreased, and in what areas they had changed. I had the tremendous embarrassment of having no information whatever, except our impressions as visitors. Since then, the Mental Health Act Commission has made many requests and has finally been given powers to collect this information. We used to have to derive some of it from hospital episode statistics, but that was exceedingly difficult and very inaccurate.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000149"></a>Eventually, it was agreed that the commission would collect the data to ensure that it was possible to monitor the use of the Act. As the noble Lord, Lord Patel, told the committee in the other place, however, we know that information is not willingly collected unless it is mandatory. If the CQC is to effectively and comprehensively monitor the use of the Act, it is crucial that it collects information pertaining to the use of the powers. There is, indeed, a power to require information to be made available to the CQC in paragraph 8 of Schedule 3, but that does not specify the type of information. It is also true that the mental health minimum data set collects some relevant statistics, but the information is not necessarily available to the commission in a timely fashion, it is not comprehensive and it is not accessible.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000150"></a>There are still huge gaps. For example, under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act, on powers to take people to a place of safety&#151;a famous power which I am sure some colleagues will remember&#151;you can be taken either to a police station or to a hospital. Because hospitals are obliged to provide information to the Mental Health Act Commission, we can say how many Section 136 powers are used, but in the community, when you are taken to a police station under those powers, only a third of local authorities provide that information. It is not mandatory, so the information is nationally useless. So we are not getting to grips with one of the key issues. Some information is available, which would not otherwise be the case, such as the number of children detained on mental health wards.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000151"></a>At the moment, deaths of detained patients are notified to the commission by agreement. All of the deaths are reviewed by a specially trained commissioner who makes a visit if there is cause for concern either about the physical healthcare that the patient received or if the death is unnatural and triggers an untoward incident inquiry. The purpose of the reviews is to ensure that lessons are learnt about the causes of such deaths and that they are less likely to recur. The Mental Health Act Commission is a member of the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody&#151;an initiative set up for the specific purpose of providing statistical information to other bodies, such as the national confidential inquiry on homicides and suicides. The bottom line here is that we do not want to leave to chance what information the new commission collects. It must be able to discharge its functions in relation to information and data gathering and analysis of the use of the Act to give a comprehensive picture.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000152"></a>Amendment No. 52 would ensure that future registration criteria are sufficiently robust and set a high enough quality threshold by incorporating explicit mention of primary legislation that is essential for providing care. That largely arises because the Mental Health Act Commission has found for several years that users of the Act are not always well trained. That is particularly the case where there are a lot of agency staff or foreign doctors coming in. They are often exceedingly welcome in mental health services, but they require considerable training. That applies not only on the Mental Health Act but other legislation, such as the NHS Acts, the Midwives Acts, equality legislation, and so on. Organisations delivering care&#151;those 30,000 service providers of varying sizes&#151;should at least understand the primary legislation that informs their work when they are registered.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000153"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 53 provides for regulations to impose a duty about the need to reduce health inequalities and discrimination on the basis of disability. That is really about the implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act. Our main concern here is for people with severe mental illness&#151;who, we know, at present die 10 years younger than the rest of the population because of poor physical health. They are at far greater risk than the rest of us of developing heart disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and smoking problems. Some of those problems are a consequence of lifestyle, but often they are also the consequence of neglect by services to care for people&#146;s physical health problems when they also have a mental health problem. That is often at the root of the problems that we discover during the root cause analysis of an untoward death: someone has not received good quality physical healthcare.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000154"></a>We believe that many mental health trusts are failing on a massive scale to fulfil their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, chairs a trust in which I know there are special identified physical healthcare co-ordinators, whose responsibility is to ensure that that does not happen; but many mental health trusts do not ensure that.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000155"></a>The other issue addressed by the amendment is discrimination by health trusts against people with mental health problems. To give a very brief example,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC155"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a young man applied to become a volunteer at four different NHS hospitals. All four accepted him at first, but when he told them that he had a mental health difficulty, he was turned down. They claimed that he might pose a threat to the public because of his mental health difficulties, although he had never committed any crime or acted violently to anyone.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000156"></a>That is not completely straightforward. I realise that if an applicant for a voluntary position has a current mental health problem that would interfere with the proposed activities, it may be entirely proper to reject the applicant. However, let us suppose, for example, that an applicant for a voluntary position had suffered from depression some years earlier and was now well. It is entirely discriminatory to exclude that person from an opportunity to do voluntary work, which would no doubt be of benefit to him in confidence building.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000157"></a>We want to ensure that the ability for the commission to act in relation to failure to implement the Disability Discrimination Act with regard to mental health patients should be a matter for the Care Quality Commission. I know that the Minister in the other place felt that this was still a matter for the public consultation on registered activities, but I hope that the Minister today will agree that if we wish to fight the stigma of mental illness, it is important to have a potential signal of that commitment with regard to how the Care Quality Commission discharges its function. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000158"></a><a name="80506-gc0007.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0007.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08050659000322"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I support the amendments, particularly Amendment No. 51. Along with other noble Lords, I had the interesting experience of sitting through the Mental Health Act as it went through Parliament recently, which was a salutary and sobering experience. Perhaps one of its most important aspects was an issue that was dealt with principally in this House rather than in another place: the continuing practice of admitting children and adolescents to adult wards. Many noble Lords from all sides of the House worked hard with the Government to deal with that issue, perhaps one of the worst issues that we knew of&#151;that and the fact that mixed-sex wards are still found more in the mental health field than in any other part of the health service. That poses a great threat to people&#146;s safety. It is therefore of undisputed importance that detailed information is made publicly available, particularly information such as the number of children on adult wards.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000159"></a>I say this in support of the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. I suspect that the Minister may respond by saying that there is an expectation that the minimum data set for mental health will collect all the relevant statistics on mental health patients. That may be true, but there is no requirement that that be made immediately available to the CQC. It is therefore not clear that that information-gathering exercise will of itself be adequate. That is an important reason why the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment should be taken seriously.</p>

Amendment No. 53 refers more generally to discrimination and health inequalities, although I understand that the interest of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is particularly informed by the experiences of people with mental health problems, hence its place in this group.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000161"></a>I understand the strength of feeling that underlies the amendments, and I hope to provide some reassurance that they are already provided for in the Bill or in our proposed registration requirements. In particular, I emphasise that as one of the Care Quality Commission&#146;s core functions, set out in Clause 2, the commission will be under a statutory duty to monitor the use of the powers under the Mental Health Act. In doing so, I appreciate that the commission might need information on admissions, discharges and deaths of detained patients, as Amendment No. 51 seeks to address, both to enable it to take appropriate follow-up action and to make informed decisions about when to undertake a review or investigation of a particular hospital or trust. Draft registration requirement 13 includes a requirement to ensure that adverse incidents are reported. That will of course include the deaths of detained patients.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000162"></a>The Bill also allows other types of information to be gathered. New Section 120C of the Mental Health Act will enable both the commission and the Welsh Ministers, who will be responsible for monitoring the application of the Act in Wales, to make reasonable requests for information in connection with the exercise of their functions under the Act. It will, for example, allow them to obtain information from hospitals&#151;and from local authorities where patients are in the community&#151;about the number of persons detained under the Act in a given period, together with details of such matters as their age, gender and ethnic status. It will also enable them to collect patient-specific information for the purposes of undertaking an investigation or review, or for the purposes of investigating a complaint. I believe that that meets the intention behind Amendment No. 51 without imposing too great an administrative burden on providers.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000163"></a>Amendment No. 52 would enable the regulations under Clause 16 to require providers to demonstrate their compliance with the Mental Health Act. Providers of care for people subject to compulsion under the Mental Health Act already have a duty to comply with the Act, and the Care Quality Commission will have a responsibility to check that they are doing so. However, the Bill will provide some additional safeguards. The current consultation proposes that services which detain patients or deprive them of their liberty should be registered with the commission. The commission would then be able to act directly where there is a breach of the relevant requirements. Draft requirement 2 about,</p>
<ul><a name="08050659000274"></a>&#147;safeguarding people when they are vulnerable&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000239"></a>will be particularly relevant here. Crucially, the commission will also be able to take action if registered people are failing to comply with requirements in any other legislation that it considers relevant. It will therefore be able to employ its enforcement powers if a registered provider is failing to comply with relevant aspects of the Mental Health Act, the Mental Capacity Act or other legislation.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000164"></a>I am confident that the Bill will also enable the commission to play its part in reducing health inequalities and discrimination on the grounds of disability. As I have explained, the commission will be able to take enforcement action if registered people are not compliant with other relevant legislation. This would include elements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 or other equality legislation that the commission considers relevant to securing the health, safety and welfare of those using health and social care services. Requirement 12 in the consultation, entitled &#147;Respecting people and their families and carers&#148;, would also be relevant. It aims to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000254"></a>&#147;People&#146;s privacy, autonomy and dignity are safeguarded and their human rights and equality are respected. This involves treating people as individuals, respecting their human rights and having systems to ensure that they are not discriminated against&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000240"></a>However, it is important to recognise that regulation alone can only go so far in addressing the complex issues of inequality and discrimination. The Government are also taking action in other ways to address these important issues, such as through the SHiFT initiative to tackle the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health in England, and the National Strategy for Mental Health and Work, which is being chaired by Dame Carol Black.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000171"></a>The noble Baroness said: I suspect that by now the Minister may regret the fact that healthcare-acquired infections have been given such a status within the Bill, because it is an invitation for those of us who believe that there are other matters of equal, if not greater, importance to go along the same route.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000172"></a>Amendment No. 53A deals with a code of practice for employers in social care. I propose that the General Social Care Council&#146;s code of practice for employers of social care workers should be given the same status under Clause 16 as the code of practice on healthcare and associated infections. My reason for doing so is that the GSCC codes of practice, which are drawn up under Section 62 of the Care Standards Act, have become industry standards within social care, and there is a requirement for them to be issued to social care workers and to those who employ them.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000173"></a>Those codes of practice have been drawn up over the years as a result of extensive consultation. There are two codes, one for social care workers and one for their employers. Currently, the standards set out within the codes are taken into account when inspections of providers are conducted against national minimum standards. They have been a central driving force in setting standards of social care. Therefore, the proposal is that, instead of reinventing the wheel and requiring the CQC to set up specific compliance criteria, the commission should take on those codes of practice, which are industry standards for social care.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000174"></a>Amendment No. 65 concerns a different but related matter. It adds the General Social Care Council to the list of bodies in Clause 35 to which the Care Quality Commission must refer information in the event of an enforcement action being taken against a regulated social care provider. This is about ensuring consistently high standards within the social care workforce and among the bodies that employ them. To put it another way, it is also an important means of ensuring that those who engage in poor practice to the extent that they have an enforcement notice issued against them do not have escape routes by which they can get round the legislation. The General Social Care Council is a key body in relation to the registration of the social care workforce. That workforce is highly mobile and it will become increasingly so as much of social care is provided on the basis of short-term contracts. Therefore, it is important to ensure that, where people do not meet standards and have an enforcement action issued against them, they cannot move easily between employers to the extent that they get lost. That is a particular concern in social care.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000175"></a>Amendment No. 66 is there simply to enable me to make the point that a large percentage of the social care workforce in the third sector is employed by charities. If it were the case that a charitable body was an employer and was consistently failing to meet agreed standards, there is a case to be made that the Charity Commission ought at least to be notified of that. This is one of the arguments that people in the third sector often come up against. They often have an argument thrown at them, particularly by the NHS, that all they have to do is register with the Charity Commission and that the Charity Commission is interested only in narrow management functions. That

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000176"></a>So, although it may not seem so on the face of it, there is a thought running through the three amendments about ensuring that there are consistent standards across the different sectors. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000177"></a><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08050659000326"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendments Nos. 53A and 65 relate to the General Social Care Council. Amendment No. 53A seeks to make it a regulatory requirement for registered providers to comply with the GSCC codes of practice. Amendment No. 65 would require the Care Quality Commission to notify the GSCC when it has taken certain enforcement action. Amendment No. 66 would also oblige the commission to notify the charity commissioners when it has taken action against a provider which has charitable status.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000178"></a>The issues raised by Amendment No. 53A were debated in another place. At the time, my honourable friend the Minister for Health was able to give sufficient assurances to enable amendments to be withdrawn and I hope I will be able to do the same. The draft registration requirements currently out for consultation include a number around ensuring staff have the competence, skills and support to do their job effectively. It is important to remember that these will apply to all registered service providers of either health or social care. The commission will determine the criteria by which it assesses compliance with those requirements.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000179"></a>In another place, my honourable friend signalled his expectation that the commission will continue to refer to GSCC codes of practice when assessing registered social care providers, as CSCI does now. That remains our position. So, while I recognise the importance of the GSCC&#146;s role in this regard and the quality of the codes it produces, it is not necessary to be more prescriptive about this.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000180"></a>In responding to Amendments Nos. 65 and 66, let me first explain our intention behind Clause 35. There will be cases where primary care trusts and local authorities are commissioning care from service providers against whom the Care Quality Commission has taken enforcement action. We therefore feel it is important that the commissioner should have notice of the enforcement action that has been taken so that, where necessary, it is able to commission alternative services. I agree with the intention behind the amendment proposed by the noble Baronesses. It is important that the GSCC is informed of the relevant action that has been taken. However, I hope I can provide reassurance that there is already adequate provision in the clause for this to happen.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000181"></a>Subsection (1)(d) already requires the commission to give notice of the action specified to any other person it considers appropriate. Where the commission takes action against a person registered with the General Social Care Council, we would certainly expect the commission to notify the council that action has been taken. Likewise, if the action was against a charity&#151;for example, some of the care homes registered with CSCI are charities, as the noble Baroness explained&#151;we would expect the commission to notify the Charity Commission where appropriate. I entirely agree with

Similarly, it might be appropriate for the commission to notify the General Medical Council or the General Dental Council about certain matters.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000182"></a>There are circumstances in which that would not be appropriate. For example, some of the notices served under Clause 35 may be for very minor changes in conditions. We would not want the commission to have to notify the General Social Care Council of action taken in relation to healthcare providers. It is important that we do not create an over-burdensome system, but one that ensures that people have the information they need to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively. Rather than specify such detail in legislation, the commission will be better placed to make those decisions and decide when it is appropriate to inform other people of action that it has taken.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000183"></a>Given those reassurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I will certainly go away and read the text of what she said. I simply put this matter to her: in Clause 35, all but one of the bodies listed is a health body. I come back again to the point that we are dealing with social care as well as health. I think that she is wrong to underestimate the importance of the General Social Care Council in the provision of staff and standards by which employers in the fields of social care are judged. The General Social Care Council is a key player in that. She also underestimates the importance of the Charity Commission, given that provision of services is becoming much more diverse and fragmented. My view is that it is not appropriate that those two bodies, in particular, are included only in a general catch-all in subsection (1)(d), but I will take away what she said and return to it.

This is a probing amendment about the new function that the CQC will have to ask whether resources will be made available to it to take on the additional work of monitoring healthcare-acquired infections. The reason for the amendment is twofold. It is undeniable that the Government attach a degree of political importance to the issue that far outweighs the importance of other matters, such as nutrition and so on. It is therefore highly likely that with the political imperative behind it, the commission may well find that, whatever it may think, it has very early in its life to devote the bulk of its resources to that. The amendment is intended to ensure that the new commission, especially during its  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>formative period, is not so skewed by an emphasis on healthcare-acquired infections that it does not begin to set up standards of work in the other areas&#151;particularly social care and mental health.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000189"></a>Amendment No. 55A, which is also in this group, attempts to discover whether there will be consultation with people involved in social care on the code of practice on healthcare-acquired infections. The Government have already said that the new commission&#146;s work on healthcare-acquired infections will start in 2009-10, and therefore there will be some pressure for a code of practice to be consulted on fairly early. As a result of previous legislation, the NHS already has longstanding experience of the development of codes of practice on healthcare-acquired infection but, as this new regulatory body will be in charge of small care homes and so on where there is an incidence of healthcare-acquired infection, it is important to see what is appropriate to them in their work. It is completely different from what is appropriate in a major acute hospital. I want to probe those two issues. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000190"></a><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08050659000329"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I shall speak to my Amendment No. 110. Its purpose is straightforward: it is to oblige the commission to publish information specifically related to breaches of the regulations about healthcare-associated infections.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000191"></a>Clause 85 already contains a regulation-making power to require the CQC to publish certain categories of information. These include the conviction of any person in respect of an offence committed under Part 1 of the Bill, the cancellation of a person&#146;s registration, the variation of a condition in relation to a person&#146;s registration and the payment by any person of a penalty pursuant to a notice issued under Clause 82. In other words, when someone does something bad that patients and others need to know about, the commission will have a duty to make the facts public.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000192"></a>Why should healthcare-associated infections be placed in the same category? There is a simple answer: the incidence and prevalence of healthcare-associated infections are factors that influence consumer choice, as they rightly should, in relation to hospitals and to care homes. To deny consumers and patients that information is simply wrong.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000193"></a>Almost three times as many people are killed by hospital infections as are killed on the roads each year. The number of people killed by both MRSA and C. difficile in England and Wales has increased by nearly six times since 1997, with C. difficile responsible for the majority of those deaths. In fact, there has been a 50-fold increase in C. difficile infections since 1990. By any standards, healthcare-associated infections are a serious problem in our health service.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000194"></a>There have been endless false dawns and reheated announcements from Ministers. We have known for years that one of the main weapons for dealing with healthcare-associated infections is to isolate patients who are infected, so, in <I>Winning Ways</I> in 2003, the Department of Health promised the appropriate provision of isolation facilities. In 2004 John Reid assured us that new hospitals being built had more isolation rooms than ever before. In 2007 the current

For the majority of trusts, that will mean greater use of single rooms.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000195"></a>But then what do we find? The Health Protection Agency recently reported as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000258"></a>&#147;Three quarters of trusts indicated that they had problems implementing isolation policies due to inadequacies in the number and fitness for purpose of isolation rooms&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000196"></a>Then we have had the deep-clean initiative. There is absolutely no evidence that the deep cleaning of hospitals is a cost-effective use of funds. To be brutal, it is a populist gimmick. An editorial in the <I>Lancet</I> last September said that,</p>

The Countess of Chester Hospital, which spent &#163;300,000 on a deep clean, suffered a C. difficile outbreak four days later, when 26 people became infected. In fact, when he made the announcement last year, the Prime Minister promised that deep cleaning would be repeated at least every 18 months, but we now know from Written Answers that there are no plans to repeat the first deep clean exercise and no plans to assess how effective the first deep clean actually was. No one should think that deep cleaning of itself will make more than a tiny dent in the statistics.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000200"></a>In January, the Prime Minister went on the &#147;Andrew Marr Show&#148; and made a promise that is bound to have impressed a lot of people. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000260"></a>&#147;If you go to hospital, you will get screened by next year for MRSA or C difficile&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000242"></a>No one from the Government sought to correct that story, but two days later the Health Secretary&#146;s infection control strategy reported on C. difficile and said this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08050659000261"></a>&#147;Screening for colonised patients is inappropriate. (Most potential cases would not be identified ...)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08050659000243"></a>The promise of screening for C. difficile, which is not going to happen, was yet another example of Ministers giving false hope to the public by leading them to believe that the hazards of healthcare-acquired infections could be tackled effectively in a particular way when in fact they cannot be.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000201"></a>The Government clearly think that one of the first tasks for the new commission will be to address the problem of healthcare-associated infections. If they  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>did not think that, we would not have Clause 17 in the Bill, and nor would the advertisement for the chair of the new commission have been worded as it was. It must make sense to have a statutory reporting procedure whereby patients and the public are automatically alerted to concerns flagged up by the commission on these issues. I hope that the Minister will take this idea away and consider it seriously.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000202"></a><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08050659000331"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> I support these amendments. In a recent Question on this subject, I suggested that we should have statutory reporting because it is necessary. Screening is needed not just for patients but for staff. At a conference in Nottingham on this subject, a paediatrician from St. Thomas&#146; hospital said that he was absolutely horrified when he realised that he was a carrier of MRSA. Although he worked with vulnerable children, he did know that he was. We now have a new problem in Panton-Valentine leukocydin. It is now in the community and I am sure that it is being misdiagnosed by many doctors who think that it is pneumonia or a white blood cell deficiency such as anaemia.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000203"></a>Far more should be done and the numbers should be counted. Having worked on a regional health authority, however, I know very well that people can fiddle the figures. It is a worrying concern. Not long ago, I sat next to a judge at a family dinner who told me that he had to have a knee operation. He said that he was not at all worried about the operation itself but he was worried about contracting an infection such as MRSA. This is what most members of the public feel when they have to go into hospital.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000204"></a>I think deep cleaning is a good idea because people are horrified when they go into a dirty hospital. It does not matter whether or not deep cleaning helps deal with the infection, but it is much more helpful for the patients to go into a clean rather than a dirty hospital. One of the big problems is the beds being far too close together and patients being hot-bedded in and out and moved from ward to ward. This happens all the time. I have been dealing with a patient who was moved four times from a London hospital to another hospital and then to another. He eventually ended up in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where he is now in isolation with a very serious infection&#151;an even more dangerous strain of MRSA that is completely resistant to antibiotics. This is a great worry because these strains are now creeping into Britain. I believe there should be ring-fencing and carrots for those hospitals that are infection-free.</p>

<p><a name="08050659000205"></a><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80506-gc0008.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08050659000332"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> We all recognise the importance and the difficulty of dealing with healthcare-associated infections, both in our hospitals and care homes and in the provision of care in other settings. In 2006 we passed legislation approving the introduction of a code of practice on healthcare-associated infections. Under this legislation the registration requirements and new code of practice will apply to all regulated care activities and health and adult social care, and not only to those carried out in the NHS.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000206"></a>There is international agreement that nursing homes are a reservoir of healthcare-related infections and data on HCAIs in nursing homes are limited. However, a report from the Health Protection Agency covering  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>data collected by the mandatory surveillance scheme between April 2006 and March 2007 indicated that 18 per cent of patients who had their MRSA bacteraemia detected within two days of admission to a trust had been admitted from a nursing home. Improving hygiene measures in care homes would reduce the risk of infections to individuals, both in the home and if they are admitted into hospital. It would reduce the prevalence of infection and, consequently, prevent infections in both hospitals and care homes.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000207"></a>The commission will have a whole range of functions and, as an independent body, it ought to decide on how to allocate its resources in order to deliver those functions efficiently and effectively. I understand the concerns, which many noble Lords have already expressed, that social care and the monitoring of the implementation of the Mental Health Act may be marginalised in the new body and that these lie behind the intention of the proposal in Amendment No. 54A to provide separate funding for functions relating to healthcare-associated infections. I recognise that some noble Lords are concerned that if healthcare-associated infections are the top priority for the new commission with respect to the NHS, then, with a reduced operating budget, other areas could suffer. I should point out that an extra &#163;5 million funding has been allocated to the new commission to fund specialist inspections and to monitor compliance with the HCAI code of practice.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80506-gc0009.htm"/>


<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000208"></a>In rolling out the registration system to bring in NHS providers for the first time, the Care Quality Commission will give priority to healthcare-associated infections. The Healthcare Commission is already undertaking annual inspections of hospitals to ensure compliance with the code of practice, so this expertise and resource can be carried forward to continue monitoring compliance under the new system. Both social care and private and voluntary healthcare will continue to be regulated under the Care Standards Act, where sanction and enforcement powers already exist. They will continue to have to comply with the relevant regulations relating to infection control until the new registration system is up and running.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000209"></a>As others have pointed out, many of the required savings have already been made by CSCI and the Healthcare Commission. Further savings in operating costs of the new body will come from rationalising back-office functions and from increasing integrated and efficient working practices.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000210"></a>As already discussed, the commission will need to carry out all of its functions in order to meet its statutory obligations, not least its social care and mental health functions. I hope this provides some reassurance that there is no intention to sideline the regulation of social care as a result of the importance placed on healthcare-associated infections and indeed the intention is absolutely that this focus will benefit those receiving social care as well as healthcare.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000211"></a>To ensure this is the case, I agree with noble Lords that proper consultation must be carried out before a code of practice is issued. This is why the Bill makes provision for the Secretary of State to consult those he considers appropriate and I would, of course, expect this to include the people who use health and social care services, service providers and local authorities,  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as well as the NHS. This is our intention, and so I do not believe that this amendment is necessary. In addition, the consultation, as it was for the 2006 code of practice, will be an open consultation to which anyone can contribute, and I encourage all those who are concerned to do so when the time comes, which we hope will be later this year.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000212"></a>Given the importance we attach to getting this right, the public will want to be reassured that the commission is taking appropriate action where providers fail to meet requirements on tackling healthcare-associated infections, as the noble Earl and noble Baroness are suggesting. This is the intention behind Clause 85 as drafted, enabling the Secretary of State to make regulations, which either allow or require the commission to publish information about the enforcement action it has taken.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000213"></a>This will enable the commission to demonstrate the action it is taking when carrying out its functions and to reassure patients and service users that services which persistently fail will not be able to continue to provide services. The public will be able to access information about service providers where enforcement action has been taken. It should also be an additional incentive for providers to comply with requirements and avoid enforcement action. Publishing details of its enforcement action will also show that the commission is open and transparent in the way it carries out its functions.</p>

<a name="80506-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08050659000214"></a>I therefore believe that Clause 85 as drafted already allows for the provisions set out in Amendment No. 110 and can achieve the transparency sought by that amendment. I hope that I have provided sufficient reassurance on these counts to allow noble Lords to withdraw these amendments.</p>

It is important that there is transparency right from the beginning about the CQC&#146;s funding and the way in which that funding relates to its functions, objectives and priorities. I hear what the noble Baroness says about the notification process. However, I say again that there is a huge difference between an acute hospital and a small domiciliary care scheme. We are talking about a system that must cover both and be proportionate to both. However, with that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08050617000002"></a>Disabled People: UN Convention</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08050617000014"></a><a name="80506-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80506-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08050617000142"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08050617000015"></a>Today the Government have responded to the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#146; recommendation, in its report <I>A Life Like Any Other? Human Rights of Adults with Learning Disabilities</I>, that the Government should ratify the UN Convention on Disability Rights and the optional protocol without further delay or provide clear unambiguous details of any specific impediments to immediate ratification.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08050617000016"></a>The response makes it clear that the UK does not ratify any international treaty until it is in a position to ensure that it can implement the provisions and therefore comply with its obligations. In addition, the European Community is, for the first time, a party to an international human rights convention and this will inevitably affect the ratification timetable. Given the duty on member states to co-operate with the Community, the UK would wish to take into account the European Commission&#146;s proposal for Community Conclusion of the Convention which is still awaited.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08050617000017"></a>Article 33 of the convention on disability rights is an unusual provision in UN human rights conventions. Article 33 requires states parties to the convention to establish national monitoring arrangements, and the Government have wished properly to consult the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Devolved Administrations about these arrangements. These consultations are continuing.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08050617000018"></a>Ratification will be in respect of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Part of this process has required the Devolved Administrations and government departments to check their legislation, policies, practices and procedures against the convention&#146;s provisions. This has inevitably taken some time. However, this phase of the work is now over and we are considering carefully the emerging findings. Our aim remains to ratify the convention by the end of this year.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08050617000019"></a>The current position is that the Ministry of Defence has indicated that there is a need to enter a reservation in respect of service in the Armed Forces, consistent with the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended (DDA) and Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. Service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown are excluded from the DDA&#146;s employment provisions to preserve their combat effectiveness. The Department for Children, Schools and Families has indicated that there is a need to recognise that the general education system in the UK includes a range of provision, including mainstream and special schools which will require an interpretative declaration, and that there will also need to be a  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS14"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column WS14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reservation in respect of disabled children whose needs are best met through specialist provision, which may be some way from their home. The Home Office has indicated that there may be a need to enter one or more reservations or declarations in respect of immigration, nationality and citizenship.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08050617000020"></a>There are also a number of areas where we are continuing to explore whether there are any compatibility issues which may result in the need for an interpretative declaration or reservation. These are: measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity; aspects of mental health legislation; choice of place of residence; and cultural services (interpretive measures).</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08050617000021"></a>With regard to the optional protocol, the Government are aware of the importance that many disabled people and the committee attach to this issue. The Government are carefully considering their position as part of the convention ratification process in the light of the ongoing review by the Ministry of Justice of a similar optional protocol relating to the Conventionon the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08050617000027"></a>I agreed council conclusions that underlined the EU&#146;s deep concerns at the delay in announcing the results of the general election, condemned violence and called for moratorium on arms sales.

Ministers supported the Pakistani Government&#146;s fight against extremism and progress on reinforcing democracy since the election on 18 February. Ministers also underlined the importance of supporting the Government of Pakistan to implement the Electoral Observation Mission&#146;s recommendations for electoral reform to support the democratic process in Pakistan, improve transparency and help ensure participation of citizens in the election.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08050617000036"></a>The council adopted a common position renewing restrictive measures against Burma for another 12 months. I also agreed council conclusions on Burma, which highlighted the council's ongoing concern about the situation in Burma, and in particular the deep flaws in the regime's 10 May referendum on a new constitution aimed at entrenching military rule. The council underlined its readiness to consider further restrictive measures in the light of developments. Ministers had an exchange of views on the text of the draft constitution and referendum on 10 May.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08050617000040"></a>Discussion of the Western Balkans focused on Serbia.  The council agreed on the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia, which President Tadic signed in the margins of the council. I intervened to stress the importance of full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia remaining a condition in Serbia's EU accession process. The requirement for full co-operation was fully recognised in the council&#146;s conclusions, which make clear that ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and implementation of the interim agreement will be dependent on a council decision that Serbia is fully co-operating with the ICTY.  </p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08050617000047"></a>Last summer&#146;s exceptional floods caused widespread damage and misery for thousands of people. But the response was equally exceptional&#151;from local authorities and other local agencies, the police, fire and rescue services, the military and neighbours helping each other. The Government have been committed to playing our part and we have already made up to &#163;88 million available so far to flood-hit communities to support their efforts to get back on their feet.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08050617000048"></a>The costs of the floods to the country were significant. That is why in August we submitted an application to the European Union Solidarity Fund, which was set up specifically to help countries that have experienced extensive damage from natural disasters such as floods. We have worked closely with the Commission on this application and I can confirm that the European Commission gave clearance for the funding to be paid to the UK when it approved the amended EU Budget on 7 April. I welcome this clearance and recognise the key role played by Commissioner H?bner in the EU&#146;s decision to approve our UK application.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08050617000049"></a>The European Commission&#146;s clearance was for payment of around &#163;110 million as a contribution to the cost of recovery from last summer&#146;s floods. However, the UK&#146;s special &#147;abatement mechanism&#148;, agreed between Government and the EU and in place since 1984, means that the net value to the UK of this allocation is an extra &#163;31 million.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08050617000050"></a>I therefore announce today that all this extra funding will be paid to flood-affected local areas. The money will be distributed through a new one-off &#163;30.6 million restoration fund to local authorities, police authorities and fire authorities in England, with the balance allocated to the Northern Irish and Welsh devolved Administrations. I propose that eligibility for payments from the new fund will be based on the costs incurred in dealing with the flood problems since the summer and that local authorities will be free to spend this money according to the local

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08050617000051"></a>The restoration fund will mean the Government have made up to &#163;118 million available so far to local areas hit by last summer&#146;s floods.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08050617000052"></a>The Government will account for the spending of the EUSF payment directly to the European Commission so that local authorities eligible for payments from the new fund will not have to deal with the strict rules that govern EUSF and can concentrate on the job of leading the full recovery efforts in their communities.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08050617000056"></a>I am today announcing the next steps in our programme of comprehensive immigration reform for 2008. I am publishing statements of intent which set out how the points system will work for skilled migrants coming to fill vacancies here, and for those who come to the UK temporarily for cultural and other non-economic reasons.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08050617000058"></a>The UK&#146;s new points system is central to our plans for controlling the numbers and skills of people coming to the UK, and ensuring only those the UK needs from outside the EEA can come to work or study.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08050617000059"></a>We began the points system earlier this year with arrangements for highly skilled migrants. The statements of intent I am publishing today outline details on how the system will work for skilled and temporary migrants.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08050617000060"></a>These arrangements will significantly reduce the number of routes to the UK and will include five key changes for skilled workers.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08050617000061"></a>First, all employers who wish to employ skilled migrants will need a license, provided and monitored by the UK Border Agency. This will help ensure employers are fulfilling their obligations to the UK, for example, helping migrants to understand and comply with our immigration rules.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08050617000062"></a>Secondly, migrants will be required to show English language competence to assist with their effectiveness at work and their integration into  British life.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08050617000063"></a>Thirdly, all jobs will be required to meet the resident labour market test before a migrant can be recruited unless the job is in a certified shortage occupations or is a intra company transfer.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08050617000065"></a>Fifthly, there will be a maintenance requirement so that would-be migrants must prove they have the ability to support themselves for the first month they are here.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="08050617000067"></a>The MAC will produce shortage occupation lists for the UK, and Scotland only, showing where there are skilled shortages that can be sensibly filled by migration through the points-based system.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="08050617000069"></a>Tier 5 of the points-based system covers temporary workers and the UK&#146;s new international youth mobility scheme, allowing people to travel to the UK to satisfy primarily non-economic objectives including five sub-categories: creative and sporting; charity workers; religious; government authorised exchange; and international agreement.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="08050617000070"></a>As with our arrangements for skilled migrants:</p>
 all migrants will need a certificate of sponsorship from a licensed sponsor who will vouch that the migrant will comply with the terms of their stay in the UK, before they even arrive in the UK; and migrants must also meet the maintenance requirements, demonstrating that they can support themselves while they are here in the UK. 
<a name="80506-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="08050617000071"></a>The tier 5 international youth mobility scheme will allow young people from partner nations to come to the United Kingdom for up to two years to work and travel, while young UK nationals enjoy similar experiences in those countries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="08050617000072"></a>We are publishing these documents today so that those affected by the changes we are putting in place can prepare. We are also giving people the opportunity to comment on the documents. A statement of intent for students under the points-based system will follow later this year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="08050617000073"></a>Copies of the statements of intent on the skilled migrant tier and the temporary worker and youth mobility tier have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<a name="80506-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="08050617000082"></a>I am today publishing a draft Marine Navigation Bill, for public consultation and parliamentary pre-legislative scrutiny. The draft Bill contains legislative proposals to help to improve safety at sea and in our ports, to deal with wrecks if they do occur and to update the powers of the bodies responsible for maritime safety. Copies of the draft Bill, a consultation paper and other accompanying documents are available in the Libraries of the House and the Vote Office.</p>

In bringing forward this draft Bill I hope to address these issues as far as can reasonably be done. Any statutory safety measures  


<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS20"></a><b>6 May 2008 : Column WS20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>need to offer a balance between excessive controls and prudent management. The changes that I am proposing in this draft Bill are not fundamental but they do represent a considered approach to the issues that have been identified and they will provide the responsible authorities with useful enhancements to their powers where necessary.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="08050617000084"></a>There are also measures in the draft Bill that will help to reduce costs to the shipping industry through the better management of the General Lighthouse Fund. When the IMO Convention comes into force there will be significant improvements in our ability to recoup the costs of dealing with pollution and the aftermath of maritime accidents as it will introduce a strict liability regime and compulsory insurance for shipping operators, meaning that these costs will no longer be picked up by the authorities responsible for safety and the environment which can now happen when the operators or owners of the ship fail to accept responsibility.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="08050617000085"></a>The draft Bill sets out our legislative proposals to:</p>
allow the ratification of the IMO Convention in the UK so that the Government can compel ship owners to remove wrecks or, if emergency works are carried out by the Government or General Lighthouse Authorities, facilitate recovery of their costs from the ship owner or its insurers;enable the Secretary of State to direct a harbour authority which is exercising its functions unsafely;give all harbour authorities access to a power to give general directions to shipping;allow a competent harbour authority to relinquish its unwanted pilotage powers;provide a simple way for the duties of a harbour authority to be extinguished where it no longer serves a useful purpose and to ensure any residual duties are carried out appropriately;permit the introduction of compulsory national occupational standards for harbourmasters and pilots;improve the regulation of pilotage exemption certificates; andmodernise some of the powers of the General Lighthouse Authorities.
<a name="80506-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="08050617000086"></a>Publication of the draft Bill provides an important opportunity to ensure we get our proposals right through public consultation, and for Parliament to scrutinise the legislation in draft. We need to learn from and build on the diversity of experience of professionals in the ports and shipping industries and all who are concerned about the safety of shipping and the protection of the marine and coastal environment, so I encourage all interested parties to participate in the consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="08050617000089"></a>The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court is widely recognised as delivering first-class specialist rehabilitation of complex cases.  The enormous benefit of bringing together service personnel, both those wounded on operations and those injured in training, contributes to the astonishing recovery that so many of our patients make.</p>

 we now have our own workshops and technicians to provide a &#147;state of the art&#148; limb fitting service, enabling us to start to mobilise patients who have lost limbs as soon as they arrive at DMRC and to make adjustments to their prostheses as required;we have increased the numbers of therapists and nurses and introduced a new team to deal with head injuries, working closely with partner organisations;we have deployed physiotherapists into Iraq and Afghanistan to assess patients&#146; needs and start treatment, where appropriate, in advance of their arrival at Headley Court;last May we opened a new temporary ward annexe, providing 30 additional beds and giving us a total of 66 ward beds;Headley Court benefits from the use of a hydrotherapy pool and four gyms on site; andwe are building this year a new 58-bed temporary accommodation block, at a cost of about &#163;4 million&#151;work on site is due to start today.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="08050617000092"></a>Our review has confirmed that the DMRC Headley Court should continue to be the specialist centre for rehabilitation, and has recommended further improvements so that it can continue to deliver first-class care. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="08050617000093"></a>In the light of the review we have now decided to invest an additional &#163;24 million in the Headley Court site over the next four years to maintain and enhance DMRC&#146;s capabilities.  This will enable us to:</p>
replace the new ward annex (designed to be a temporary structure) by extending the Peter Long Unit, and incorporating into that extension an expanded prosthetics facility, treatment areas, and imaging facilities; and replace progressively over the next few years all the existing 180 non-ward bed patient and staff accommodation.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="08050617000094"></a>I pay tribute to the charitable bodies that have also contributed to the work of DMRC and its predecessor organisations since Headley Court first opened its doors to RAF patients shortly after the Second World

The estate is owned by a charitable trust, which has itself contributed generously to the improvement of facilities on the site.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="08050617000095"></a>The Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#146;s Family Association has purchased a house in nearby Ashtead which was opened earlier this year as a &#147;home from home&#148; for families visiting patients at Headley Court, supplementing accommodation that we had already provided on site. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="08050617000096"></a>Last year a new charity, Help for Heroes, generously offered to raise funds for a swimming pool and gym, which would together form a new rehabilitation complex, with additional space for rehabilitation and assessment.  The charity has already made impressive progress in its fund-raising.  We are working closely with Help for Heroes in planning the new facility.  </p>

<a name="80506-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="08050617000097"></a>We warmly welcome the contributions of charities to the welfare of the services.  Support for them enables the public to demonstrate their appreciation for the work of the Armed Forces in tangible ways. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="08050617000098"></a>The new investment I have announced today, together with current funding for new facilities, means that Headley Court will see investment over the next four years totalling some &#163;28 million in addition to the substantial funding that Help for Heroes intends to provide for the new rehabilitation complex.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="08050617000099"></a>Our review also looked at the services&#146; primary care rehabilitation facilities (PCRFs) and regional rehabilitation units (RRUs).  The review recommended enhancements to the permanent capability of RRUs, and improvements to the referrals process. The roles and locations of some of the RRUs should be adjusted to align better with current and future population centres.  I have agreed that we should provide an additional &#163;1.5 million per year from financial year 2009-10 to establish the necessary permanent manning uplifts at the RRUs, and commissioned further work to take forward the other recommendations. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="08050617000100"></a>The outcomes of the review demonstrate our commitment to rehabilitation.  The review charts the strategic direction we shall now follow, to build on our success to date in returning service personnel to mobility and usually to duty. In partnership with the charity sector, we are ensuring that service patients, particularly those severely wounded on operations, receive the best treatment that is available and that it is delivered in an environment that supports their rehabilitation in every way possible.  Our servicemen and women deserve no less for the efforts that they are making on our behalf.</p>

Risk criteria include: whether a deputy has been refused credit or is an un-discharged bankrupt; whether the deputy has any financial interests which conflict with those of the client; the value of the client&#146;s estate; the relationship of the deputy to the client and any objections which were made to the appointment of the deputy.</p>
90 per cent of new deputyship cases will be assessed and a supervision level set within 30 working days of the court order being served on the Public Guardian;100 per cent of ongoing deputyships with close supervision (type I) will have a formal reassessment of the supervision level within 13 months of the previous assessment; and we will carry out a case review on no less than 4000 type II cases during the year.A case review could be a combination of: review of annual report;carrying out a visit; and review of supervision level following short term intervention.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="08050617000127"></a>In a Written Statement on 9 January 2008, I summarised the remit of Sir Jim Rose&#146;s independent review of the primary curriculum. Among other things, his remit includes making recommendations on introducing greater flexibility to help schools narrow the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="08050617000128"></a>In the Children&#146;s Plan, the Government acknowledged that more needs to be done to improve outcomes and provision for children with special educational needs and to increase parental confidence that children&#146;s educational needs are being met, including for children with dyslexia.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="08050617000130"></a>In this context, we have now additionally asked  Sir Jim Rose, in the light of evidence, to make recommendations on the identification and teaching of children with dyslexia, and on how best to take forward the commitment in the Children&#146;s Plan to establish a pilot scheme in which children with dyslexia will receive reading recovery support or one-to-one tuition from specialist dyslexia teachers.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="08050617000134"></a>In the five weeks since the elections in Zimbabwe, 7,000 people have been displaced, 500 beaten, 120 hospitalised and at least two murdered. Many more were unable to access medical treatment. In addition, the police have arrested scores of people who they associate with the opposition in Zimbabwe and have raided their offices. The announcement of the result of the presidential election should be seen against that background. Violence has been commonplace in Zimbabwe but those figures and these acts show the brutality of the regime in its quest to hold on to power.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="08050617000135"></a>Very soon after the election it was clear that the majority of the electorate had rejected President Mugabe. But ZANU(PF) chose to delay the results, rather than face the truth. That delay has simply allowed the Zimbabwean authorities to contaminate the results. We can have little faith that the figures announced accurately reflect the will of the people. Significantly, the MDC opposition have not endorsed

<a name="80506-wms0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="08050617000136"></a>The first round of voting in Zimbabwe suffered from significant structural deficiencies. The electoral roll was and is still grossly inaccurate. The majority of the 3 to 4 million people who have fled Zimbabwe were and will still be prevented from registering as voters. Within Zimbabwe media coverage of the election was already biased towards Mugabe and ZANU(PF). And the Government of Zimbabwe, at their own admission, did not invite anyone to monitor the election whom they thought might point out its flaws&#151;including the EU and the UN. For a second round to be considered free and fair, there must at least be an immediate end to violence, and international observers must be put in place now, well ahead of the vote itself.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="08050617000137"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister, my noble friend Lord Malloch-Brown and I continue to engage regional leaders. They are feeling the destabilising effects of the crisis. They know it is in their interests for the SADC principles and guidelines on elections to be enforced and the rule of law in Zimbabwe established. Both SADC and the AU have a pivotal role to play now in ensuring an end to the violence, and by introducing observers to prevent further reprisals by ZANU(PF) to punish voters for the choices they made in the first round.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a><a name="08050617000138"></a>International concern about the situation in Zimbabwe remains high.

We will also call again for UN-backed monitors to go to Zimbabwe to observe any second round, and for the Government of Zimbabwe to allow EU and other observers in now to oversee preparations for the elections, as well as the voting itself.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="08050617000139"></a>We continue to support all those working for democratic change in Zimbabwe. We all share the wish of the Zimbabwean people to secure their democratic rights. We commend civil society groups in Zimbabwe who continue to fight for democracy and good governance in increasingly impossible circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="08050617000140"></a>We continue to respond to the humanitarian crisis on the ground. We are the second largest bilateral donor to Zimbabwe, giving around &#163;49 million in 2007 and more than &#163;200 million since 2000. UK aid currently keeps more than 1.5 million people alive. The UK, along with the international community, is committed to supporting recovery in Zimbabwe when conditions on the ground allow it. This cannot happen until the will of the people is respected and democracy returned to Zimbabwe. But when that happens we will be ready to respond.</p>

<a name="80506-wms0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="08050617000141"></a>It is clear to all, including many in ZANU(PF), that this situation is unsustainable. Economically, Zimbabwe has been in decline for many years: total economic collapse, with the massive humanitarian cost that will bring, is inevitable unless there is a radical change in policy and approach in Zimbabwe.

Under the terms of the EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC the total number of allowances auctioned cannot exceed 10 per cent of the number allocated during phase II. The auctioning levels for the EU ETS post-2012 have not yet been determined. However, the Chancellor recently announced that the UK will auction 100 per cent of allowances to the large electricity producers. The amount of revenue will be influenced by the market price at the time of the auctions.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_44"></a><a name="08050634000109"></a>We will not be hypothecating the revenues from the auction. The Government's spending priorities are not, in general, determined by the way in which the money is raised. Hypothecating revenues to particular-spending programmes imparts inflexibility in spending decisions and can lead to a misallocation of resources, with reduced value for money for taxpayers. The spending review process ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to deliver government objectives and ensures priorities, such as education and health, receive the increased levels of funding, as set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR).</p>

To this end the Government are contributing funding through the EU's Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance, which will channel around &#8364;4 billion to the western Balkans over the period 2007-11. The UK is separately providing around &#163;14 million for the region through the Department for International Development's bilateral funding, around &#163;2 million through the Reuniting Europe programme and an additional &#163;7.8 million through the Conflict Prevention Pool for 2008-09, all increases on last year's spending. The Government are further contributing to stability and security through their diplomatic efforts in the region, encouraging countries to deal with threats to inter-ethnic relations and also progress on the reforms needed for EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation membership. The Government will also participate fully in the International Steering Group on Kosovo, as well as the Peace Implementation Council for Bosnia.</p>

In some circumstances this is a statutory requirement. Government must also give local authorities the help they need to deliver and we have therefore produced policy and practice guidance to help local authorities in developing their strategies. Both sets of guidance are online at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/localauth/planning.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/localauth/planning.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_156"></a><a name="08050634000287"></a>Additionally, the waste infrastructure capital grant is an unring-fenced capital grant that will be paid to upper tier authorities (unitary and county councils) in most of England between 2008-09 and 2010-11. The funding available has been increased from around &#163;105 million to &#163;185 million over the next three years. The grant will be paid to local authorities in recognition of the need to get front-end waste infrastructure, e.g. recycling and composting facilities, on the ground in time to help England meet landfill targets. The grant is front loaded, i.e. more in the first two years and less in the third year, to help local authorities that wish to invest to help meet the 2010 landfill target.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_157"></a><a name="08050634000288"></a>The Defra-funded waste and resources action programme (WRAP) has provided advice on the design and management of and contracting with materials recovery facilities and will be continuing with work in this area. WRAP has also supported private companies in extending reprocessing capacity in paper and organics, so that there will in turn be greater demand for recyclables collected by councils. Additionally, local authority trials of food waste collections have been funded and infrastructure provided. Investment in home composting has also been supported by WRAP.</p>
