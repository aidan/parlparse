<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Blaker </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>What are their current policies towards Zimbabwe.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  My Lords, our policy towards Zimbabwe is to work with African and international partners to restore democracy, good governance, respect for human rights and the rule of law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that since the election the erosion of human rights has proceeded apace in Zimbabwe and that farms are still being taken over illegally, which has a consequent effect on the livelihood of farmers and farm workers and therefore on hunger and unemployment? Am I right in believing that the sanctions that were imposed by the European Union on Mr Mugabe and his cronies in respect of foreign travel and foreign assets do not apply to the spouses and families of those people? If so, should not those sanctions be extended, or are we content that Mrs Mugabe could still come here and shop at Harrods?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, is quite right. The number of politically motivated deaths has been assessed at 55 by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum. We have continued to express our concern about the violence, harassment and intimidation that continues in Zimbabwe. We also continue to be concerned about the economic collapse of the Zimbabwean economy and the implications that that has for the people of Zimbabwe. It has been estimated that about 7 million Zimbabweans&#151;about 60 per cent of the population&#151;may be dependent on food aid by the end of the year. The noble Lord was also right to suggest that current EU sanctions do not apply to spouses and children. The General Affairs Council will clearly wish to return to that. It will discuss Zimbabwe at its next meeting in June.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the situation in Zimbabwe is rapidly deteriorating? That is due not just to political strife but to a large degree to regional drought and the oncoming famine in the region. What measures are Her Majesty's <P>


<a name="column_634"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government planning to take in order to alleviate the famine that will inevitably affect thousands of innocent Zimbabweans?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, points to the regional problem with respect to drought and difficulties with food. That has been exacerbated by the Zimbabwean Government's economic policies and the fast-tracked land reform programme, which has meant that farmers have not, for example, planted in critical areas.
<P>

<a name="20521-01_para0"></a>On the measures that we have taken, noble Lords will know that we were the first to introduce a supplementary feeding programme into Zimbabwe. We did so in September last year and we contributed &#163;4 million to that. We have also contributed an additional &#163;6 million to UN agencies&#151;the World Food Programme and the World Health Organisation. The FAO and the World Food Programme are currently assessing the regional food security situation. There will be a conference in Johannesburg in June to consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred to the Government's anxieties about the economic collapse in Zimbabwe. What are the implications of that for the New Partnership for Africa's Development, in which she has been playing such a crucial role, and for southern Africa as a whole? How is that affecting the need for the leadership in that partnership to be taken by the leaders from southern Africa themselves?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, it is absolutely critical that the leadership of the New Partnership for Africa's Development comes from within the continent and the southern African region. One reason that we have sought to build a partnership between the G8 and NePAD is precisely because we recognise the importance of that leadership coming from within Africa. NePAD has done some good theoretical work on political and economic governance issues. The proof of that will be in its implementation. That is particularly important in view of the situation in Zimbabwe, which we do not regard as a test case for NePAD; it points to the serious issues that can arise in African countries and which require leadership from across the continent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, if NePAD is not prepared to implement measures for good governance, the rule of law and human rights or to establish mechanisms for monitoring the performance of those matters in member states, confidence in the G8/NePAD process would be severely undermined? I refer in particular in that regard to the arrest of 11 journalists since the new press law was introduced in the middle of March and the prospect that all the journalists who refuse to sign up to Moyo's application will be deprived of their livelihood on 18th June. Those serious matters need to be dealt with at the top level by NePAD.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the whole NePAD/G8 process could be undermined if African leaders did not take political and economic governance issues seriously. That is absolutely essential to the NePAD agenda. With regard to journalists in Zimbabwe, we have always deplored the action taken by the Zimbabwean Government in relation to the media. We believe that freedom of expression is a core principle in a democratic country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, while the children in Harare are starving and apparently hunting in dustbins for food, is it correct that Mr Mugabe has been attending a UN conference on child poverty in New York? Is it also correct that the blood-stained chief of police, Mr Chihuri, has been attending a police conference in Lisle? Who permitted these sanctioned individuals to travel? Why were they not apprehended and sent back to their own country at the very least, and what do the sanctions mean if they allow people who have committed or sanctioned atrocities to wander round the world at will?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, first, the US was obliged to let Mr Mugabe attend the UN, just as, under international treaty obligations, France was obliged to allow Mr Chihuri to attend the Interpol meeting. I believe that Mr Mugabe was consigned to within 22 miles of UN headquarters. Mr Chihuri is vice-president of the executive committee of Interpol.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew11"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, that is correct. The EU common position provides that member states may grant exemptions from these measures where travel is justified on the grounds of attending meetings of international bodies. And, yes, Mr Mugabe did attend the UN special session on children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, perhaps we could hear shortly from my noble friend Lord Acton, who knows a little about this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Acton: </B>   My Lords, while I applaud the efforts that the Government have made in giving aid to Zimbabwe in the desperate circumstances of hunger in which so many people find themselves, can my noble friend say whether, in the light of the conference next month, the Government will consider giving still further aid?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   Yes, my Lords. We are concerned about the situation of ordinary people in Zimbabwe and we shall review the humanitarian position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>Whether Railtrack's refusal to agree any further contractually guaranteed journey times with passenger train operators will contribute to the achievement of improved reliability and growth targets contained in the 10-year transport plan.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  My Lords, track access agreements are matters for the train operating companies and the network infrastructure manager. In the event that the parties fail to agree, the Rail Regulator has the power both to determine the terms of an access contract and to direct the parties to enter into one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that Answer. Is he aware that four train operators, including Great Western Trains and South West Trains, have been told by Railtrack that it can no longer guarantee timetable paths? Does he agree that that therefore means that no timetable can be relied upon? Of course, it also means that Railtrack will not have to pay compensation to any of the train operators for delays or for digging up the track. Given that the Government are probably paying three-quarters of Railtrack's costs at present, is there anything that they believe they should be doing about this before the administration ends?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020521/text/20521-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, it is for the train operating companies and Railtrack in administration to negotiate the terms of the arrangements that exist between them. The Rail Regulator has a role in that. If he is not satisfied with the arrangements that are being made, he can intervene. I believe that that is the right way for the matter to be left.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the job of a regulator in any privatised industry is to promote efficiency, reduce the prices charged to users, secure safety and promote the sharing of capacity? Which of those duties does the Minister consider the regulator to have discharged successfully? If the answer is none, why is he still in his job?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as read out to me, the summary of the role of the regulator sounds correct, but I hope that noble Lords will not hold me to the precise wording. I believe that the regulator has an incredibly important role to play in relation to the rail industry. Precisely where the rail industry is in relation to each of those issues is plainly a matter for conjecture. However, it is important that, in performing his role, the Rail Regulator delivers on all the tasks to which the noble Lord referred in his summary of the Rail Regulator's role.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is very proud of his Government's 10-year transport plan. <P>


<a name="column_637"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, can he explain how the train operators are expected to co-operate with that plan when they are being given only a two-year extension to their franchises?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the 10-year plan sets out a proposal for infrastructure in this country. It deals with the future of the rail industry. My right honourable friend in another place explained some time ago why two-year extensions were being given. It was in the context of the long-term future of transport in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware whether Railtrack is aware that the track between platforms 1 and 2 at Lewes station is in a decrepit and wholly dangerous state and has been for some time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware of that until the noble Lord mentioned it. Obviously his remark will be passed straight to Railtrack.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Greaves </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>Whether the safeguards in relation to postal voting in the recent local elections operated satisfactorily.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we have no reason to believe that the safeguards in relation to postal voting, which have been in place for many years, did not operate satisfactorily in last May's local elections. Some of the all-postal voting pilot projects experimented with changes to the postal voting arrangements. The Electoral Commission's evaluations of the pilot projects, which are due to be published before 2nd August, will include examinations of how each change worked.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. In fact, it has been reported that a number of severe abuses of the postal voting system took place on 2nd May throughout the country, including in my own borough of Pendle in Lancashire. There, some 984 postal votes in four marginal wards were sent out, not to the electors to whom they were addressed but to a number of central addresses which turned out to be those of close relatives of Labour candidates or of known party activists. The votes were then delivered&#151;if they were delivered at all&#151;to the electors at a time and in a manner of their choosing. Does the Minister agree that that should not happen within the postal voting regulations and that the potential for abuse&#151;people walking down the street with fists full of postal voting papers belonging to other people&#151;is huge? Before any further extension of postal voting can take place, does he also agree that some of the loopholes that are being discovered and <P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exploited by unscrupulous people in Britain, as well as in Northern Ireland, should be investigated and closed? This matter is extremely serious as it concerns electoral fraud and the foundations of our democracy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I cannot comment on the allegations made by the noble Lord, as I know nothing about them. Postal voting was extended for the last general election, when it was made easier to obtain a postal vote than it had been previously. The number of people who used postal votes increased from about 2.1 per cent to about 3.9 per cent. The Electoral Commission looked at the overall conduct of the general election and came to the conclusion that there was no reason to suppose that there had been increased fraud in relation to an increase in postal voting. As the noble Lord knows, a number of all-postal voting electoral pilots in the local elections led to a significant increase in voting. Those pilots will be examined by the Electoral Commission and it intends to report on 2nd August. Perhaps we should wait to see what the commission says before coming to any conclusions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend agree that, if anyone has a complaint of an improper act, he or she should report it to the police and not to the House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, it has been suggested that the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is considering introducing all-postal voting for the European elections, as appeared in the press over the weekend. In view of what the Minister has said about the report of the Electoral Commission, will the results of that report be discussed in the House before any further decision is made about all-postal voting? Will the House have an opportunity to consider the safeguards raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves? All-postal voting means that votes will be sent to everyone in a constituency, where quite often there can be a 40 per cent turnover of people in an area. Will the House see the report and have an opportunity to discuss and to consider it before any further decisions are taken about all-postal voting elections?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the Electoral Commission is an independent body. It says that it will publish the report before 2nd August. These issues are important, but it is more than my life is worth to commit the Chief Whip to any agreement to a debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, the Electoral Commission is carrying out work because of the low turn-out in recent elections. Does the Minister agree that it takes democrats to make democracy work? Walking into a polling station to deliver a vote is not the most onerous of civic duties. Rather than experimenting in various ways with polling stations <P>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hither and thither, postal ballots and so on, a programme of civic education in our schools and wider could be instituted and we could ask the media to co-operate so that our citizens put a value on a vote for which our parents and grandparents sacrificed a great deal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I agree that it takes democrats to make a proper election, but there is no reason at all why sensible steps should not be taken to make it easier for people to vote. Let us see the effects of the Electoral Commission's report on 2nd August. We should all applaud increases in voting if they have occurred in a proper manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   My Lords, is my noble and learned friend aware that one of the functions of the Electoral Commission is to provide voter education and to look at the bodies that can most satisfactorily help in that process? The Opposition opposed that proposal when it was put forward during the passage of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that that is the role of the Electoral Commission. It is an important role that it is discharging with considerable skill. Yes, I am aware that the Opposition opposed such a proposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that Australia has an effective electoral system, whereby one is obliged to vote. If people do not vote they are heavily fined, and if people conscientiously do not want to vote, they can deface their paper, so there is no restriction on that. Does the Minister agree that such a process may overcome the lack of education in relation to voting?

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="20521-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the British Government have made repeated representations to the Indian authorities on behalf of Ian Stillman.

We have noted the allegation of a miscarriage of justice <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend recall that Ian Stillman is an Englishman, who was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in India because cannabis was found in a taxi in which he was travelling with other people. Ian Stillman is profoundly deaf and relies upon sign language, yet at his trial he was denied an interpreter, which meant that he could not follow the proceedings. That means that he did not have a fair trial. As my noble friend knows, the organisation Fair Trials Abroad has said that this is the worst miscarriage of justice that it has ever seen. I ask my noble friend whether it is possible for the Government to institute vigorous, urgent and determined action at the highest level, not only in regard to his conditions in gaol, but also on his conviction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the facts of the case and that Ian Stillman is profoundly deaf. I am also aware of the comments made by Fair Trials Abroad. We have been active in Mr Stillman's case, not only with respect to his welfare, but also, on a number of occasions, in raising this case with the Indian authorities. We have reached the point where the judicial process has come to an end and we are waiting to hear from Mr Stillman's family what next steps they intend to take. On that basis we shall determine the next steps that the Government take. We have to understand what Ian Stillman and his family intend to do next.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, is Mr Stillman's family being given any advice by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, Mr Stillman's family is being given advice by the Government about his welfare. The legal aspects of his case are being handled by Mr Stillman's legal representatives. We have offered the use of a lawyer from our pro bono legal panel.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I speak as a trustee of Fair Trials Abroad. Does the Minister recognise that this state of affairs does not apply to Mr Stillman alone? In many countries around the world people suffering from deafness, or other disabilities that interfere with their ability to understand what is taking place in a trial, do not receive proper assistance. Will the Government take all steps open to them to ensure that proper practices are observed in foreign trials?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, with respect to Mr Stillman's disability, I am aware that disparaging remarks were made about that at the recent trial. I have asked our High Commissioner in Delhi to take up the matter with the Indian authorities. Of course we shall look at other ways in which we can bring this to the attention of authorities in other countries of the world where this practice is ongoing.

We also support pleas on health grounds if a prisoner is chronically ill or where continued incarceration would endanger or reduce life expectancy.

<A NAME="20521-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn </B>   rose to move, That this House takes note of the report by the working group appointed to consider how the working practices of the House can be improved, and to make recommendations (HL Paper 111); and that the report be remitted to the Procedure Committee, with an instruction that it makes by 8th July recommendations, for approval by the House, as to the implementation of the report.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para4"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para5"></a>This is an important time for this House, and the decisions that we make about this report may be critical for our future. The debate today is to take note of the report of the group which I chaired. The Motion also asks the Procedure Committee to consider the practical implementation of the group's recommendations and to report back to this House by 8th July with proposals for its approval.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para6"></a>The report is the product of nine months' work. The group comprised the present Leader of the Opposition, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, the former Conservative Leader of the House, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, the Chief Whip of the Liberal Democrat Peers, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, the Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, and my noble friend Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe. I invite your Lordships to study that list and to try and find one of whom it could fairly be said is not devoted to the interests of this House.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para7"></a>We took evidence. We circulated a questionnaire. Our starting point&#151;I ask your Lordships to accept this&#151;was that this House has a duty on behalf of the public to hold any government to account. We believe that Parliament's scrutiny of the Government needs to be enhanced. This is particularly true when any government has a substantial Commons majority.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para8"></a>The changes recommended in the report are intended to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of this House. The watchdog must have a louder bark and sharper teeth. If one looks at the changes in a fair and open-minded way, I believe that they offer enhanced opportunities to this House.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para9"></a>Efficiency, of course, is bound up with other issues, such as procedural reform, sitting hours and working conditions. Procedural reform alone will not make us more effective. My belief, shared by my colleagues on that small group, is that the effectiveness of the House depends significantly on an approach by consensus in the interests of the general health of Parliament as a whole.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para10"></a>The Government ought to be willing to agree to changes which they may find burdensome or inconvenient. Some of these changes, if approved and adopted, will be. Burdens and inconvenience ought to be accepted if we are to deliver the great prize of improving the quality of legislative scrutiny and therefore of legislative output.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para11"></a>Such an approach is reflected in all that we have tried to do. I fundamentally believe that we can improve the institution of Parliament as a whole. Effective parliamentary scrutiny is a valued and valuable discipline for governments of all complexions. If we go forward on this path, we can go some way to reducing the undoubted present public disenchantment with politics and political systems.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para12"></a>We tried to produce a coherent whole. From the identities I have so far disclosed, plainly, we do not share a unanimous political view, but we have the <P>


<a name="column_643"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>general view that we ought to have looked for consensus, which we achieved. This is a unanimous report. Therefore, all of us had to bend to the others' opinion. No one could be adamant to his original stance. I stress, as we tried to do in the report, that this is intended to be a package, not every item of which will satisfy everyone, but the broad thrust of which I hope commends itself to the House.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para13"></a>Some proposals looked at in isolation will seem either to burden or benefit the Government, the Opposition or the Cross Benches. I invite your Lordships to look at the totality of what we have tried to achieve. We recognise that the House may want to test the package. Your Lordships will have seen in paragraph 4 of the report that we suggest a trial period of two Sessions, thereafter the House would have to approve any continuation.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para14"></a>In speaking of the drafting of the report, I pay particular tribute to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley. Significantly, it was he who induced and encouraged us to produce a short report which was easily understood. Perhaps I may quote from the recent report of the Hansard Society, entitled The Challenge for Parliament: Making Government Accountable. I suggest that these are useful words. It stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The potential exists [for the Lords] to develop a different dynamic to the Commons, opening up new and innovative means of scrutinising the Government".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-03_para15"></a>
As a group, we tried to respond to that general call.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para16"></a>We have made some minor, early starts. We now have much more realistic subsistence allowances. At last, we have access to the postal system without paying for it ourselves. Last summer, we acquired Fielden House which will provide more accommodation for your Lordships, who work in difficult circumstances. But we need to do a lot more. As we improve our working conditions, we need to improve our methods of work.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para17"></a>I repeat: we proceeded entirely on the basis of consensus and agreement. At page 7, recommendation (a), our first recommendation, states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"virtually all major government bills should as a matter of course be subject in draft to pre-legislative scrutiny".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-03_para18"></a>
That is closely linked to recommendation (b), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"subject to the right of the House of Commons to determine its own procedures, bills that have received pre-legislative scrutiny in either House should, on a motion moved in the house in possession of the bill at the end of the session, be allowed to be carried-over into the next session; but if a bill that has been carried over does not reach the statute book by the end of the session following carry-over it should fall, as now".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-03_para19"></a>
This is a long-term agenda. We are speaking of years, not months, but I have no doubt that if we can achieve more pre-legislative scrutiny, we will have better Bills and a significant lessening of the need to return to the same topic.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para20"></a>Parliament as a whole does not perform its legislative scrutiny well. I must say&#151;I hope without offence to anyone in the other place&#151;that the way to cure that, the remedy, will be found in this House. If <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we have pre-legislative scrutiny, we will at least address and, I hope, solve a problem. It is a criticism frequently levelled that we produce legislation that is ambiguous, inaccurate and not always fully thought out. In my 10 years' experience here&#151;which I know is brief compared to many of your Lordships&#151;that has been true of all governmental legislation. Constantly, observers of Parliament say that defective legislation is the result of weaknesses in the system. It is often easier for the Government to accept changes to a draft Bill than to seem to accept the humiliation of a change once policy is set. That recommendation will increase the burden on Ministers. The length of time for which each Bill is scrutinised and the lead-time from publication to delivery of Royal Assent will lengthen. However, the potential benefit to the public good is such that that burden is well worth taking on.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para21"></a>It is not in our power alone to make that a reality. It will depend on the Government producing Bills for pre-legislative scrutiny in the first place. My right honourable friend Robin Cook has already given his view that that is the way that we ought to proceed, and I absolutely agree with him. I hope that your Lordships today and subsequently will give strength to that argument by encouraging the Government to follow that direction.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para22"></a>In the past, pre-legislative scrutiny has been conducted in Lords Committees, Commons Committees and Joint Committees. It could occur in the House of introduction or in the other House. Our group thought that it would be a good idea if liaison arrangements were established between the Houses to determine which scrutiny option to adopt. We can proceed with that only if carry-over is adopted. Proposal (a) is utterly linked to proposal (b). The ability to carry over for a single Session would enable each Bill to proceed at its own pace, but I stress that that is dependent on the decision of the House on any particular occasion. In the past, we have performed too little pre-legislative scrutiny. When we have done so, we have produced a better outcome.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para23"></a>I turn to recommendation (c). One of the strengths of this House is that we have a large number of experts who know of which they speak. We do not fully realise the potential of the financial expertise to be found here. I stress as firmly as I can&#151;this is highlighted several times in the report&#151;that we do not intend in any way to encroach upon the financial privileges of the Commons, but we ought to be able to work towards a procedure to enable this House to deal more effectively, within its limited scope, on matters relating to Finance Bills. I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Saatchi and Lord Roper, for their contribution to developing the proposals either in written evidence or, in the case of the noble Lord, Lord Roper, in his personal comments.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para24"></a>We suggest for consideration at least that, before the Chancellor makes his Budget Statement, this House should appoint an ad hoc committee to consider and comment on the Budget and Finance Bill. The terms of reference would absolutely preclude the committee from considering the incidence and rates of tax rates. It would concentrate on the technical issues of tax <P>


<a name="column_645"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 645</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>administration and make suggestions&#151;they can be no more than that&#151;that the Commons may or may not accept. That would enhance the House's opportunity to contribute in an area of undoubted expertise, but I stress again that we make no form of challenge to the Commons. We simply intend, if the proposal is carried, to offer suggestions.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para25"></a>A number of your Lordships from all quarters have said that secondary legislation is not properly scrutinised. It is often as complex and detailed as any Bill. Recently, an extremely thoughtful and careful leader in the Daily Telegraph made that very point. Large chunks of law&#151;secondary legislation&#151;are passed without effective scrutiny. Again, without disrespect to the Commons, I suggest that we can do work here that is not presently attempted elsewhere. Since 1980, the number of statutory instruments laid before Parliament has increased by more than a third. It is no exaggeration to say that much secondary legislation may affect the individual more keenly than primary legislation, which we scrutinise.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para26"></a>We therefore recommend a Select Committee of your Lordships' House to examine the merits of every statutory instrument subject to parliamentary activity. There would have to be a sifting process&#151;the work would be impossible otherwise&#151;but if we work at the mechanisms, we can produce a good outcome.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para27"></a>I turn to Questions. They are extremely burdensome for a Minister who is not entirely on top of his or her brief. They offer the House not only an enjoyable opportunity for those who, like myself, are keen supporters of blood sports but, especially in topical questions, allow the House to challenge the Government before time passes. We have therefore suggested that, as an experiment, for two days a week&#151;on Tuesdays and Wednesdays&#151;Question Time should be extended to 40 minutes and that the extra, final Question should be a topical Question.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para28"></a>It cannot be claimed, as has been said somewhere, that that is a plot by me to try to safeguard the Government. I did not consult my colleagues before offering that proposal; I expect that they will be extremely cross with me, but I shall have to bear that with such fortitude as I can muster. That is, and is intended to be, an extra burden on Ministers. At present, the executive faces insufficient challenge, as it did when the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, was Prime Minister. There is a minor quid pro quo. There would be one day when, say, the Home Office or the education or health departments would not be subject to questions, simply so that Ministers could go to prisons&#151;as they ought to&#151;schools and hospitals.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para29"></a>I shall be as brief as possible, because I know that there has been quite a rush on the red document, but as part of the package, we recommend that we should not sit after 10 o'clock at night, which would mean a new Standing Order. In our happier moments, we frequently congratulate ourselves that we perform revision extremely well. We do not after 10 o'clock at night. We collude together to go home in the early hours of the morning because we are exhausted. If that proposal is acceptable, the detail will have to be worked out by the Procedure Committee.
<P>


<a name="column_646"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 646</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para30"></a>We suggest a greater use of Grand Committees, which were first proposed as long ago as 1994 by the committee chaired by Lord Rippon. Lord Rippon made it perfectly plain that they are not a device to help the Government to pass more legislation more quickly. They are intended to improve scrutiny and therefore produce better quality.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para31"></a>There is no nomination to a Grand Committee; it is a Committee of the whole House. I understand the criticism made in the Commons that the composition of a Committee for the Committee stage of a Bill can be fiddled. There is no prospect of that here, nor ought there ever to be. All Members can attend, and the procedure will be the same, except that there will be no Divisions. We recommended&#151;again, unanimously&#151;that "Rippon Bills" ought to be committed to Grand Committee, but the decision will be one for the House to make on every occasion.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para32"></a>In this House, we receive very good reports from Select Committees, and sometimes, I think, we deal with them rather churlishly. They are of exceptionally high quality. I do not say that in a self-congratulatory mode; I have never been on one. Often, high quality material is produced, only for it to be debated in the dead hours of a Friday. Therefore, it is not properly reported or, ultimately, properly considered.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para33"></a>We also recommend that there should be three additional Wednesdays for Back-Bench debates in each Session and more debates on Select Committee reports and general topics in prime time. That is not a device to emasculate the House: utterly the opposite. We suggested that, on Thursdays&#151;this is not our old friend, the Wednesday/Thursday split, on which we decided relatively recently&#151;we should start at 11 o'clock and finish at 7 o'clock. Many of us do not live in the South East, and it would be a legitimate convenience for people to know that they could be away&#151;after quite a long day, after all&#151;at 7 o'clock on Thursday.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para34"></a>We recommend that the House&#151;in particular, the Grand Committees&#151;should be willing to sit in September. We will adjust our sitting times, and, in accordance with what has been generally welcomed about my noble friend Lord Carter's timetable for this year, we will have sensible breaks at convenient times. We shall sit not longer but, I hope, more conveniently. The Grand Committees could do useful work in September. I shall explain our underlying thoughts on the matter. Most Committees are not well represented on the Floor of the House. If there are 12 of us present late in the evening, that is a good turn-out. Not every one of your Lordships is interested in every Bill. If we could have Second Readings, say, before we rose in July and had the Committee stages organised well in advance for two or three days in September, your Lordships would be able to plan, and everyone with an interest in a particular Bill&#151;and others&#151;could attend.
<P>

<a name="20521-03_para35"></a>There is a vast wodge of excellent Law Commission reports, most of which have draft Bills at the back, carefully locked away in a cupboard marked "Not to be disturbed". We do not do those things well. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridgeman, has, rightly, <P>


<a name="column_647"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 647</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>frequently complained that consolidation Bills would be useful to the general public, practitioners and the courts. Subject to your Lordships' views, we could consider doing consolidation Bills. I think that I can say, with the eyes of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridgeman, boring into me, that consolidation Bills are not&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am so sorry. I meant to say the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. His eyes were boring into me for another reason. That was my fault.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has frequently said that consolidation Bills would be useful. They are not a subject of pulsating interest to many people. If we could sit in Grand Committees on unwhipped business&#151;there would be no votes in September&#151;we would make the House work better.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para1"></a>I am approaching 20 minutes. The last point that I shall make relates to an observation made by many noble Lords. The increasing volume of Europe-derived legislation is not subject to sufficient scrutiny. That is why we suggest that the Select Committee on the European Union, which does excellent work, should review the House's scrutiny of European legislation and consider the appropriate balance between the scrutiny of general policy and that of specific legislative proposals.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para2"></a>I am sorry if the wording of the Motion caused distress. The original draft Motion that I considered was in a form that the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Roper, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, said was inappropriate. I accepted their suggestion, and we had correspondence about it. The date&#151;8th July&#151;was thought appropriate by the Clerk of the Parliaments. In correspondence, every member of the group agreed that this was an appropriate Motion. I hope that it is not regarded, in any way, as an arrogant attempt on my part to dictate to your Lordships: it is not. I know that the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Roper, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, can confirm that. We all agreed on it.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para3"></a>It is not a brief time. There are seven weeks for consideration of the matters, and not all the recommendations need any scrutiny by the Procedure Committee. I stress that the Motion says that the Procedure Committee should report back by 8th July with proposals&#151;I underline the words&#151;for the approval of your Lordships. The Committee will offer us a menu, and we must come to our conclusion.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para4"></a>I said that that was the last word; lawyers always say that when they have another paragraph. I shall end by thanking Brendan Keith and Chloe Mawson, who put up with us for a long time&#151;16 meetings over many weeks. They smiled tactfully and Delphically, and their work was invaluable, underlining again the high quality of the officials who serve the House. I commend the Motion to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Denham </B>   rose to move, as an amendment to the above Motion, to leave out all the words after "Committee".
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, procedures in both Houses of Parliament have evolved over the years, and it is right that they should do so, in order to take account of new circumstances as they arise. But it has always been an accepted rule, again in both Houses, that any change should be made by agreement.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para7"></a>The history of the body whose report we are considering this afternoon has been an unusual one. Its existence was announced by the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House in answer to a Question for Written Answer on 19th July last year, as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a Leader's Group to consider how the working practices of the House can be improved and to make recommendations".&#151;[Official Report, 19/7/01; col. WA 144.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-04_para8"></a>
Those recommendations were presumably to be made to the noble and learned Lord himself, although it was he who was to chair the group.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para9"></a>Of course, the noble and learned Lord had every right to appoint such a body to advise him and to select the membership himself. I would have liked to see the inclusion of the noble Lord, the Chairman of Committees, whose knowledge and experience would have had much to add, even among such an already illustrious group of Peers. Again, as the group was set up to advise him, I would have preferred the noble and learned Lord to send such of the suggestions as he personally supported to the Procedure Committee for it to consider and make recommendations to the House in the usual way. However, I shall not make too much of that.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para10"></a>On the morning of Thursday 2nd May, it was widely believed that today's debate would be on a straight "take note" Motion. By the time of the party meetings, however, it had been made known that the debate was to be on a Motion for approval of the whole report. By that time, a considerable number of noble Lords, myself included, had begun to have the gravest reservations on many of the recommendations in the report, but that was not the point. Even to ask the House to approve the report, referred directly to it, of a wholly unofficial group would have been conferring on both the group and the report an authority that neither of them possessed.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para11"></a>When, later that afternoon, I found that the draft Motion for approval had, indeed, been tabled, I added to it a "next business" Motion, which, as your Lordships will know, is the prescribed remedy for a Motion on which it is held to be improper for the <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>House to record an opinion. Within a couple of hours, the Motion, together with my addition, had left the draft Order Paper as mysteriously as it had arrived. I had hoped that Her Majesty's Government would thereafter revert to their original intention of tabling a straight "take note" Motion. That would have been the procedurally correct thing to do. Not a bit of it, however.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para12"></a>On Wednesday, 8th May, a new Motion was tabled in the form in which it stands today, a "take note" Motion to which has been added referral to the Procedure Committee, which is unnecessary, and the setting of a time limit for the Procedure Committee to report, which is unheard of.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para13"></a>A Motion that "this House takes note" is described in the Companion to the Standing Orders as enabling,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the House to debate a situation or a document without coming to any positive decision.

<P>

<a name="20521-04_para17"></a><P>

<a name="20521-04_para18"></a>I can find no precedent for "tacking"&#151;and I use a word that, in parliamentary terms, has always been considered highly pejorative, deliberately&#151;any form of instruction on to a "take note" Motion. Nor can I find one for setting the Procedure Committee a time limit over any matter referred to it. On these two grounds alone, I believe that I am justified in pressing my amendment to a vote.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para19"></a>I must also tell noble Lords opposite that I, together with a large number of Peers, have the gravest of reservations about, at the very least, the majority of the recommendations that this report contains. Some of them are all too seductive at first sight&#151;the House normally rising not later than 10 p.m., for example. Who in his right mind could object to that? Yet, if we should reach that hour on the last of the days scheduled on a particular stage of a particular Bill and we still have not finished&#151;we are a revising Chamber, remember&#151;what happens then? Does the noble Lord the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms produce an extra day or two out of somewhere? Or could it be that some gentle form of guillotine might contrive to creep surreptitiously in? I can tell your Lordships this. If, in my time as Chief Whip, I had tried to sell this package or anything approaching it, to the noble and learned Lord's predecessors as business managers of his party, I would have received a very rough answer indeed.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para20"></a>Your Lordships will be aware of the many ways in which, since the general election of 1997, procedures in another place have been changed&#151;not by agreement between the parties which, as I say, has been the long established practice, but through the sheer voting power of the Government's vast majority. Those changes have included, first, the reduction of Prime Minister's Question Time from two afternoons to one, and, no, half an hour on a Wednesday is not an adequate substitute for two separate quarters of an hour on Tuesday and Thursday afternoon; secondly, <P>


<a name="column_650"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 650</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the all too frequent practice of political advisers making statements direct to the press from Downing Street rather than Ministers making them on the Floor of the House; thirdly, no votes on business after 10 p.m., with all too rare exceptions; fourthly, deferred Divisions on business debated after 10 p.m., these to be taken at 3.30 p.m. the following Wednesday afternoon, by a happy coincidence (for the Government) immediately following the one Prime Minister's Question Time of the week; and fifthly, routine severe timetable motions&#151;guillotines&#151;of Committee and Report stages.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para21"></a>And still to come, first, Tuesday and Wednesday sittings from 11.30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; secondly, only 13 Friday sittings for Private Member's Bills; and, thirdly, carrying-over of Bills from one Session to another, this last being already familiar to your Lordships as one of the recommendations on the paper before the House today.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para22"></a>Her Majesty's Government have not got an overall majority in your Lordships' House, but it is against this backdrop that every one of the proposals in the group's report should be examined minutely to make absolutely certain that no hidden agenda attaches to any of them. And this is why it is so vitally important that the Procedure Committee should not feel pressurised by a time limit into taking what might, just might, be disastrous decisions for your Lordships' House. That is all I am asking by my amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para23"></a>I beg your Lordships not to hand to this Government on a plate, just because they have asked you nicely, things they have taken for themselves by brute force of numbers in another place.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para24"></a>I understand that the Table has ruled that today's Motion is in order. Indeed, it has accepted the Motion, so I suppose it must be so. But it is certainly not in accordance with convention&#151;and conventions in this House are always honoured.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para25"></a>The value of the "take note" Motion&#151;I say this to the noble and learned Lord having had the benefit of some years' experience of the procedures of the House&#151;is that it enables important, and sometimes highly controversial matters to be debated dispassionately, without risking a Division. It is infinitely more often used by the government of the day than it is by either opposition party or by Cross-Bench or Back-Bench Peers. If the noble and learned Lord allows this convention to be breached this afternoon, for the sake of some passing convenience, I can tell him that he and, perhaps more important, his noble friend the Chief Whip, will come to regret it, again and again and again. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para26"></a>Moved, as an amendment to the above Motion, to leave out all the words after "Committee".&#151;(Lord Denham.)

<P>
<A NAME="20521-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend Lord Denham. I have always believed that if he were not in this House we would have to invent him, because he is a true guardian of its procedures. If one looks at his record, one can see why. <P>


<a name="column_651"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 651</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>My noble friend was for 11 years government Chief Whip and spent 30 years on the Front Bench. What he does not know about procedure and the reasons for it is not worth knowing. We need that expertise in this House. It leads me to recognise how much I miss the contributions made by the late Lord Shepherd and Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos. Between them and with my noble friend they ran this House extremely effectively over many years.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para27"></a>Just after the last general election, not yet 12 months ago, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House told me that he intended to set up a Leaders' group to examine the working practices of this House. I suggested that it should be chaired by a senior Back-Bencher, as was the case eight years ago in 1994 when the late Lord Rippon of Hexham chaired such a committee, or as the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, did in the previous Parliament. But the noble and learned Lord felt that this issue was of such importance that he wished to chair the committee himself. I and other noble Lords who have been mentioned joined it.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para28"></a>I regard this as entirely a House matter. I represented myself, not the Conservative party. If any of these matters come to a vote, it will be a free vote. I thank my noble friend Lord Waddington for his work and I join the noble and learned Lord in thanking the Clerks, who worked extremely hard.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para29"></a>Over many meetings we covered almost every subject imaginable dealing with the working practices of this House. It has been said many times outside the Chamber&#151;perhaps it will be said in this debate&#151;that the report hides a secret hidden agenda of the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House. That is not true. The noble and learned Lord has been open about his ambitions. He has discussed them in this House and outside it. His comments have been reported in the press. He has never hidden his view that more business should be taken off the Floor of the House and that, for example, there should be no votes in Committees. He proposes also the selection of amendments; programming debates; the use of guillotines or "bringing down the knife" as it is referred to in another place; the possibility of a Speaker for the House; codifying the conventions; morning sittings and so on.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para30"></a>Those suggestions have been more than a gleam in the noble and learned Lord's eye.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para31"></a>Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that the original intention had been to report well before the Christmas Recess. The report is the result of our work and debates. As the noble and learned Lord said in his introduction, the report was brought about by consent and agreement. It will still affect every single Member of your Lordships' House. It is in part a fundamental change.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para32"></a>When I agreed to the changes, I had two principles uppermost in my mind. The first was to ask whether the proposals reduced the ability of the House to scrutinise legislation. The second was to ask whether they allowed the Government to cram even more, often unnecessary, legislation through Parliament. My <P>


<a name="column_652"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>view is that on balance the proposals do not offend those principles. On that basis, and after a great deal of discussion, I have agreed to them.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para33"></a>Perhaps I may briefly examine the proposals. There are seven broad issues, four of which are non-contentious. I welcome the new proposals for the Finance Bill. As regards the proposal for a committee on statutory instruments, I believe that we should see how that works. As regards more Starred Questions, I am not wholly convinced that we need more than half an hour, but if topical Questions are on offer let us see how they work in practice. If a ministerial off-day is the quid pro quo, fair enough, but when I asked the Library how many Questions had not been answered by Ministers since the turn of the year I was told just under 20 per cent. Therefore, we already have a system which allows Ministers to visit prisons, schools and hospitals. The fourth relatively non-contentious item is the review of the European committees and I hope that that will take place.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para34"></a>However, three other issues raise more serious concerns. The first is the sittings of the House and how they will fit in with Grand Committees. The second is pre-legislative scrutiny and carry-over. The third is September sittings. As regards our daily sittings, the proposed change to sittings on Thursday was the issue least debated in the group because it had been overwhelmingly popular in the questionnaire sent to every Member of this House. That is precisely the kind of issue on which the House will have a vote when the report comes back from the Procedure Committee in due course.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para35"></a>Likewise, closing at 10 p.m. was popular, but that will not work unless there is clear co-operation between Front and Back Benches and between the Front Benches through the usual channels. In exchange for the time lost after 10 p.m., there is a recommendation that there should be an increase in the number of Grand Committees. In my experience, Grand Committees are not hugely popular. They do not provide much better scrutiny than Committees on the Floor of the House and they do not save much time. But I have agreed with the proposal for an increase during the experimental period in order to see how the system works.
<P>

<a name="20521-04_para36"></a>I note in passing that in the 1994 debate on Lord Rippon's report, the then Leader of the Opposition, the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said that he was not convinced of the merit of Grand Committees.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord has been kind enough to mention me, perhaps he will give way. He will recollect that in 1994 the Labour Party representation in this House was approximately 120, while the government representation in this House was approximately 600. If any noble Lord believed that in those circumstances I would have agreed to give away some of the most important weapons in the Opposition's armoury, I should have been surprised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a good point and that is why many Members of the House are concerned about a substantial increase in <P>


<a name="column_653"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 653</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the use of Grand Committees. In addition, the promise in relation to Grand Committees made in 1994 did not work because it was then also tied to an earlier closing by agreement and in the event that did not happen.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para0"></a>I turn to pre-legislative scrutiny and carry-over. We are all in favour of more pre-legislative scrutiny. It is entirely in the hands of the Government and not in the hands of this House, and there is no reason why we should not previously have had more. However, we will need to be reassured by the Lord Privy Seal that it does not mean that another place will undertake all the pre-legislative scrutiny and that the House of Lords will undertake all the carry-over work. That would be unacceptable and it would fulfil the worst fears of those who oppose the proposal.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para1"></a>Sessions are a good discipline for the Government, for the Opposition and for Parliament. Everyone knows where they stand. However, the new proposal is but a limited extension of an existing right that the House has given itself in exchange for the desirability of pre-legislative scrutiny. Again, I believe that we should see how it goes, but in the Procedure Committee the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House will need to explain what, if any, ramifications there are for the workings of the Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para2"></a>The next contentious issue is that of September sittings. The report is not prescriptive. My view is that if another place starts to sit in September, it will be very difficult for us not to go down that route also, particularly if it is tied in with an earlier rising in July. But that is also a matter on which the House can reach a view in due course.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para3"></a>I am slightly more concerned about Grand Committees sitting in September when the House is not sitting. After all, if Grand Committees can sit, why does not the House sit in a full Committee? I am not sure how the proposal will be made to work in practice. In addition, Law Commission Bills and Bills for consolidation are to change the law and in some cases they are highly contentious. We would find it difficult to agree to the passage of such legislation if they were so highly contentious.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para4"></a>Finally, I turn to my noble friend Lord Denham. I hope that he will not press his amendment to a Division. He raises a most important point today, but it is not hugely significant whether or not the Procedure Committee must meet the 8th July deadline. I am not sure what will happen if the committee does not meet that deadline and, as far as I am concerned, there is no magic in the 8th July date. However, as it was recommended by the Clerk of the Parliaments, I am happy to go along with it. On my understanding of the work which the Procedure Committee must carry out, it should not take it many meetings to deal with the matter.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para5"></a>I know that some noble Lords, including many of my noble friends, have misgivings about the proposals, but clearly the Procedure Committee will take careful note of many of the points raised in today's debate. The Leader of the House will no doubt reaffirm that we will have an opportunity to vote on the proposals in the light of the Procedure Committee report.
<P>


<a name="column_654"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 654</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para6"></a>What is more, I would like to re-emphasise a point I made at the beginning of my comments. I would not have put my name to these ideas if I felt that they limited the ability of the House to scrutinise governments; if I felt that they would enable governments to force even more legislation through Parliament; or if I felt that they encroached on the freedoms and privileges of each and every noble Lord in this House. On balance, I do not believe that they threaten any of that. But if the House believes that they do, it has the unfettered right to amend or reject the report of the Procedure Committee when it comes back.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para7"></a>It would be a fine thing if work in the House was always to the convenience of Members and even of Ministers. However, the old ways and the little inconveniences also have their merits. The noble and learned Lord called them the "burdens". We should never lose sight of our fundamental objective, which is to enhance the authority of this House; sustain it as an independent revising Chamber; and preserve its freedoms.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para8"></a>I have said previously that I believe that many of our procedures could usefully be exported to another place and that, if they were, the whole of Parliament might work better. The worst result would be to import procedures from the increasingly discredited House of Commons. Our free and open procedures have made this House the pre-eminent place for the revision of legislation. We should value those procedures; we should not imperil them. I do not believe that these proposals do so and that is why, with all due diffidence, I commend them to the attention of the House and to the Procedure Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, he told us that he was speaking as an independent in terms of a free vote. However, he is the Leader of the Opposition. Is he recommending, in his own right as Leader of the Opposition, that his noble friends and the rest of the House should vote against his noble friend if he insists on pressing his amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, I expressed the wish that my noble friend would not press his amendment to a vote. I stand by my signing of the report. If there is a vote, I shall be supporting the original Motion.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_time0"></a><H5>3.50 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   My Lords, I too speak as one of those who served, with a number of other colleagues, on the Leaders Group. I support the recommendations in the report introduced this afternoon by the Leader of the House. Serving on the group was an educational experience. I learnt a great deal more about the procedures of this House. I want to thank particularly the Clerks, who enabled us to make, over quite a long period, some significant progress. The report is, I believe, in keeping with the evolutionary change in our working practices as reflected in our Standing Orders and in the Companion.
<P>


<a name="column_655"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para9"></a>It is one of the charms of this House that each of the Standing Orders is accompanied by a side-note giving the date on which that particular Standing Order was first introduced. It is, therefore, interesting to read that we are still governed by Standing Orders the majority of which go back to the 17th century. They have, in fact, been modified and changed on a number of occasions since then; but if the noble Lord, Lord Graham, consults the list of Standing Orders, he will see from the side-notes that, in the majority of cases, their original introduction dates back to the 17th century. We need, therefore, to look at how these can be re-examined and revised to make them relevant; at how we can, as the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House said, improve our consideration of legislation; and at how we can find ways of holding the Government more effectively to account.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para10"></a>But perhaps the most important point about our report&#151;as was made clear by both the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House and by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde&#151;was that its proposals have been put forward as an experiment. When they come forward from the Procedure Committee later this summer, they will, if the report is accepted, have a sunset clause attached; that is, they will operate for two years; then it will be for the House to decide whether they will provide a satisfactory way of taking our procedures forward, and we shall have a chance to re-examine them. Therefore, some of the fears that I have heard expressed, both in the Chamber today and elsewhere, have to be seen in the light of that sunset clause.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para11"></a>In another way, this debate reflects the maturity of this House. In no part of this House today will our votes be subject to advice from the Whips, even though the procedural matters that we are considering today&#151;the mechanisms that we use to scrutinise legislation and to hold the Government to account&#151;are probably the most political subject that we have to consider. It is right that we should make decisions ourselves, individually, on this topic.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para12"></a>As has been stated, we came at the end of our work to a consensual unanimity on the proposals that we place before the House today. It was as if, during those 16 meetings, we had been climbing a mountain from different sides. We certainly did not all begin in the same position. However, during the process of our discussions we came to conclusions which we felt we could share and put forward as a useful contribution as an experiment to improve the workings of our House. It was for that reason that, although I do not find the word particularly happy, the word "package" has been used to describe our outcome.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para13"></a>Perhaps I may begin by describing five of the matters that I believe will be widely welcomed, as they will, without doubt, add to the effectiveness of the House. I suggest that the acceptance by the Government that it would be the normal practice for Bills&#151;it is Bills to which I refer, not Green Papers or anything less clear&#151;should go first for pre-legislative scrutiny is an important step forward. It will certainly improve the quality of legislation. To that extent, it <P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be to the Government's advantage. It will also be to the advantage of all the citizens of this country if we get legislation which is clearer and which does not need&#151;as has happened too often in the recent past&#151;very rapid amendment after its introduction.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para14"></a>The second is the proposal which has been referred to for giving this House, with the expertise that it has, an opportunity to contribute, without interfering with the privileges of the Commons, to the consideration of Finance Bills. Like the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, and indeed my noble friend Lord Newby for some suggestions which led to the final product being something which I believe will be a useful contribution to the future work of the House in this area.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para15"></a>The third area where I believe we are taking an important step forward if, after the considerations by the Procedure Committee, we are able to go forward and make a change, relates to our consideration of statutory instruments. At present, our scrutiny of the substance of statutory instruments, as distinct from the vires of instruments, is selective and far from satisfactory. The new committee that has been proposed would act as an effective filter and would ensure that statutory instruments of political importance were properly considered by this House. That would be an important step forward in this House fulfilling the tasks that it should undertake.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para16"></a>The fourth matter relates to Questions. The half-hour that we have for Questions each day is a relatively effective method&#151;it is one of the ways&#151;of holding the Government to account. This modest increase should therefore be welcomed, particularly as it will include two further topical Questions, which are one of the real strengths of Question Time in this House as compared with that in another place.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para17"></a>Finally, I believe that the extra time made available for debates on the Floor of the House&#151;three extra days, two for the opposition parties and one for the Cross-Benchers, together with more time for debates on Select Committee reports and general debates&#151;is welcome. It is one way of ensuring that the extra time that will become available by more Bills going to Grand Committee will not be used by the Government to push more legislation through the House. That is one dimension of the package.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para18"></a>The second group of proposals, which may well be more controversial, are related to what the Leader of the House has referred to elsewhere as a more rational use of our time. The suggestions for a more balanced year&#151;including a Sitting in September, balanced by more generous Recesses at Christmas, Easter and at the spring holiday, and an earlier date for the commencement of the Summer Recess in July&#151;are, I know, unpopular with those who like to take their holidays in September. But there will be many others of your Lordships who will find that, on balance, a significant step forward&#151;particularly if the dates can be given well in advance so that we have some predictability of the totality of the parliamentary year. <P>


<a name="column_657"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 657</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As has been said, if the other place is moving to a September Sitting, this is one of the matters with which it seems to make sense for this place to experiment.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para19"></a>The second change in our own sitting times is the suggestion for an earlier start on Thursday. Here, there is obviously a division between those who live and work in the South East and do not like the idea that their morning should be disturbed on a Thursday, and those who live outside the South East and would like to get away on a Thursday evening. This is clearly one of the issues that we shall need to debate in some detail when the report comes back from the Procedure Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para20"></a>Is the proposed 10 o'clock cut-off a subtle form of guillotine&#151;as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Denham&#151;taken from another place? Certainly that was not what we discovered in our discussions in the committee. I hope that the work of the Procedure Committee will reassure the noble Lord on that particular point.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para21"></a>There is a feeling in many parts of the House that continuing our debates until midnight and beyond does not always improve the quality of scrutiny. If we had earlier closure, more time would be available because of Committee stages being taken in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para22"></a>I turn to more controversial issues. It is true to say, as the noble Lord, Lord Denham, suggested, that when a Leader of the House comes forward with a set of proposals for procedural changes, many remember the Latin tag, "Timeo danaos ut dona ferentes". Those of your Lordships who are naturally suspicious of any Leader of the House of another party will look carefully at the proposals for carry-over and greater use of Grand Committees. I suspect that we will hear more of those topics today.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para23"></a>Both proposals seem at first sight to make things easier for the Government, so why have we come to accept them as part of the totality? The possibility of carrying a Bill forward from one Session to another would apply only if there had been pre-legislative scrutiny. The addition of pre-legislative scrutiny inevitably lengthens the time between the beginning of the process and completion of consideration of a Bill. In those circumstances, the House should be prepared to consider carry-over on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para24"></a>There are three problems with Grand Committees. First, they may be seen as providing the Government with an opportunity to push through more measures in their legislative programme, by removing one of the restrictions available to opposition parties. We have been given assurances by the Leader of the House that such is not his intention. The proof of that pudding will be in the eating, which is why the two-year experimental period is of great importance. We have seen the number of ways in which the time saved will be used for other useful purposes.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para25"></a> The second serious objection for some is that there are no votes in Grand Committees. We on these Benches do not normally initiate votes in Committee, so we are not so worried about that aspect as others. The third objection stems from the negative view held <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in all parts of the House about the use of the Moses Room, in terms of its acoustics and ambience. The report has adopted as a possibility the particularly imaginative proposal made by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, that the Robing Room should be used. I realise the prerogative problems but I was interested to discover that the Robing Room was used on two occasions in the 1930s&#151;in 1931 and 1935&#151;for meetings of Joint Committees. The second was of a constitutional nature, although admittedly to do with the constitution of India rather than the future of this place.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para26"></a>Apart from procedural issues, the report raises significant problems in respect of resources. There are clearly staffing implications for the additional pre-legislative committees, Grand Committees and Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments. There will also be more demands made on Peers to serve on those Committees. We should not agree to the proposals without being aware of the resource implications.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para27"></a>Speaking for myself and having heard the noble Lord, Lord Denham, I hope that the House will consider the amendment but reject it if the noble Lord decides to press it to a vote&#151;and accept instead the Motion moved by the Leader of the House. That will give us the opportunity to try some important experiments in making our work more effective in holding the Government to account.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Craig of Radley: </B>   My Lords, as a member of the Leader's Group, I encourage your Lordships to take note of our report and to agree that its ideas and proposals be taken forward by the appropriate committees of the House before formal consideration by your Lordships. I acknowledge a departure from past practice in that the Leader arranged the terms of reference and the membership of his group, which he chaired, on his own authority. He rightly afforded the House the courtesy of informing your Lordships of his intentions in a Written Answer last July, before the committee began its work. Since then, there have been further references to the group and its work. The questionnaire that we circulated in January brought the group's existence and work to the personal attention of all noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para28"></a>Before we began our meetings, I inquired whether the Leader intended his group to follow up on the report of the group that had considered the House's committee structure and working practices. There are areas of overlap when considering the broad canvas of work in your Lordships' House but, after nine months and 16 sittings, I am personally grateful that the Leader decreed that that work was for the group working under the chairmanship of the Lord Chairman of Committees.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para29"></a>The Leader's Motion brings the result of our work to the early attention of the House. At first, we were not all agreed to whom we were reporting or the path that the report should take to seek the approval of the House. I made clear from the outset and throughout the course of our work my view that the Procedure <P>


<a name="column_659"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 659</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee and other appropriate committees must be involved&#151;not merely for the sake of form but because a number of practical matters had to be taken into account&#151;such as the need for more deputy chairmen, clerks, Hansard writers and other staff, not least in the Refreshment Department; and the impact on the upkeep of the palace and its rolling programme of works.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para30"></a>Moreover, in the case of issues that involve agreement with the other place and are not matters that can be fixed by government fiat, we should look to the Lord Chairman of Committees to take them forward. I do not underrate the task that we are setting the Lord Chairman and our House committees. It would greatly assist their work to know your Lordships' views, as expressed in this debate. I therefore endorsed the Leader's wish to table his Motion in the form in which it appears today.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para31"></a> While there is a view represented in the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Denham, that the Motion goes too far and is outwith the Companion in its prescriptive second part, that is not objectionable if we are to attempt to get our package of recommended changes in place by the start of the next Session. I hope that the noble Lord and those who may have been initially minded to support him will give the Leader's Motion a fair wind as it stands.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para32"></a>I attached great importance to achieving an agreed report. That was not an easy task, bearing in mind the different interests and perceptions of political parties and Cross-Benchers&#151;and the range of individual commitments in which many of your Lordships are engaged, additional to those in the House. However, for an issue that affects all Members of your Lordships' House, broad consensus is essential. It will rarely be possible to achieve unanimity, but if there is not to be continual and even heated debate about any changes, a large measure of acceptance is important. I hope that this will be made easier to achieve because the whole package is put before the House as a trial over two Sessions. It will be for the House to decide in the light of experience whether the package or any parts of it are to continue thereafter.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para33"></a>Part of the difficulty of identifying weaknesses in our working methods is that what is terrible for one is an essential tactical position for another. However, there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence, and responses to the questionnaire reinforces it, that there is genuine dissatisfaction with some of our working arrangements. The changes that we recommend will improve scrutiny, better use the time of Members of the House, and improve the quality of legislation, including secondary legislation. Too much legislation, despite our efforts, does not finish up as good law on the statute book.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para34"></a> Like so much of this type of study, it is not until one gets to the end that one is able to see the whole picture of ideas and proposals that have been discussed at some length individually. The amount of use of Grand Committees, for example, was an issue that caused us difficulty, although this was more a partisan one than one of pressing concern to Cross-Benchers. However, <P>


<a name="column_660"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 660</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for most of us, there was a worry that it would allow the government of the day additional opportunities to force even more legislation, perhaps inadequately considered, through this House. Eventually, with the commitment to limit late sitting times by Standing Order and to have lengthier short recesses, and with some magnanimous give and take on all sides, a packaged solution was devised in recommendation (g).
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para35"></a>I believe that there could be some confusion if we rely on the phrase Grand Committee to cover all sittings off the Floor of the House. I believe that the words Grand Committee should be confined to actual committee work. If an additional sitting takes place at the same time as one in this Chamber, it might be described as, for example, a Moses Room sitting. Parenthetically, I should say that I recognise and share the dislike that the acoustics and microphones of the Moses Room engender, which is why I proposed&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, mentioned&#151;that, until these are rectified, we should consider using the Robing Room as our equivalent to Westminster Hall for the other place.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para36"></a>The Robing Room was used during World War II for our sittings when the Commons was bombed and then moved into this Chamber. The Robing Room is rarely used except for State occasions, and it should be possible to arrange any sittings in it around such well-programmed events. Moreover, it is almost as adjacent to this Chamber as the Moses Room. Proximity is important if a Division is called here or to allow individual Peers&#151;and not all are so nimble on their feet as they may once have been&#151;who have an interest in both sittings to move easily from one location to the other.
<P>

<a name="20521-05_para37"></a>The Lord Privy Seal and earlier speakers have dealt in more detail with our recommendations and the reasons for them. All those recommendations have my full support, and I add my thanks and commendation for the work which the Clerks did in supporting our group. I commend the Leader's Motion to the House.

He said that he felt that these proposals, as they may eventually come forward, should be in place by the next Session. Given that some of our arrangements have been in place for very many hundreds of years, why is that necessary?

I must, of course, immediately declare an interest in that I was selected to be a member of the group, even though I am a relatively new Member of the House. I come to the subject as one of the many Peers appointed in 1997, and since, as a working Peer. I am <P>


<a name="column_661"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 661</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a Member of the Select Committee on the European Union as well as being chairman of one of its sub-committees. So, as one who attends regularly, I think that I have been here long enough to have begun to understand not only the accumulated wisdom of this House, but to develop a deep respect for the House.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para0"></a>I come from a background in which change has been a significant feature of the past two decades; namely, in the Civil Service and the trade unions. I know the difficulties that change brings in its wake, but I know, too, the advantages. I found it particularly interesting to hear Her Majesty's reply to the Loyal Addresses of both Houses, in Westminster Hall, when she said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Change has become a constant; managing it has become an expanding discipline. The way we embrace it defines our future".&#151;[Official Report, 30/4/02; col. 563.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-06_para1"></a>
I think that the last sentence has particular relevance for all of us at present.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para2"></a>We all know that change is a condition of life on this planet and that it can be for the better or for the worse. It is in the application of change that the hand of man and woman can affect the consequences. The problem often lies in trying to come to a nice judgement about what is better. But what is true is that our instincts, and the instincts of this House, are for pragmatic change, evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and that we must hold on to accumulated wisdom while trying to find a more effective way of using it.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para3"></a>This House has already seen some quite substantial recent changes, which many would argue were for the better. Indeed, just last week, no less a person than the Leader of the Opposition, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, referred to the House's successes since 1999. These have led to the House increasingly being seen to be at the heart of the legislative process.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para4"></a>Politicians recognise that it is even more important now than it was in the past to connect with the electorate. The electorate expects change, especially of those who, through legislation, expect change of them. It is in the House's own interests to demonstrate its willingness to change.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para5"></a>This report on working practices embodies, in my opinion, the virtues of the House. It represents a considered and cautious examination of the issues. This examination began as long ago as last summer with the aim of securing better, more effective scrutiny, and the more efficient use of the time of all Members of the House. It has not been an easy process. The Leader of the House is to be commended for his patience and desire to proceed by consensus and agreement. Concessions have had to be made by all.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para6"></a>Although the report is not all that I would have wished it to be, I am sure that it is more than others would wish it to be. I am sure that it does not meet all the aspirations of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who should be congratulated on and thanked for initiating this process quite some time ago by means of a Back-Bench debate in this Chamber. Noble Lords will recall his despair and frustration with the House's committee structure, which had consistently failed to deliver the changes that many Peers had been calling for over the <P>


<a name="column_662"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 662</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years. None the less, I believe that this report goes a long way towards meeting his and other Back-Benchers' aspirations.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para7"></a>I trust that the report's cohesiveness will not be undermined, nor its implementation delayed, in the Procedure Committee to which it will be referred. However, wherever we end up, I believe that fairness and the democracy of 2002 require that this Chamber should have the final say on what is implemented. Regrettably, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Denham, would prevent that. If it is taken to a vote&#151;I still hope that it will not be, particularly given the urging of the Leader of the Opposition&#151;I would hope that the House will reject it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Denham: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord will give way. He said that if my amendment were carried, it would be the end of the matter. But, all that I am asking for is the time limit on the Procedure Committee to be removed. It may do what it has to do within the time limit in any case. It is not a wrecking amendment by any means.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   My Lords, I would argue that if the time limit were lifted, we would have the problem that my noble friend Lord Peston referred to when he introduced his debate&#151;that the Procedure Committee never brings back issues and changes are never implemented. There is that possibility.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para8"></a>We were conscious that some of the changes might be seen as eroding some of the rights and powers of the opposition and that some proposals might be regarded as making it easier for the Government. But, that is not the case when viewed in the round. We should always remember that governments are in opposition some time, and if they have treated the opposition unfairly, they will suffer the consequences in due course.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para9"></a>The report also places many additional burdens and checks on government, as previous speakers have said. Indeed, it also places additional burdens on the staff of the House. I join others in commending the hard work that was undertaken by the Clerk and his assistant. The extension of legislative scrutiny to virtually all major government Bills as a matter of course is a significant change for all, which, it is to be hoped, will be ultimately beneficial to the public at large.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para10"></a>I am conscious of the Chief Whip's gentle pointer to the advice of the Companion on the length of speeches. We spent some time in the group discussing the Companion, how to get better compliance with it and how to avoid repetition. In recalling those discussions, your Lordships will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to go through all the recommendations in the report and tread in previous speakers' footsteps.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para11"></a>The area in which I have experience is in scrutinising legislation emanating from the European Union. As your Lordships undoubtedly know, the two Houses adopt quite different ways of attempting to scrutinise European legislation. The other place looks at all the documentation with an eye to its political and legal implications. This House has always added an element <P>


<a name="column_663"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 663</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of in-depth scrutiny which has found a faithful readership even in the European Commission. But it is an inescapable fact of life that the tide of paper increases in proportion to the numbers handling it. The European Union is on the threshold of quite dramatic enlargement. One consequence of that will be a further stimulus to the legislative output of Brussels. We must attempt to meet that challenge.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para12"></a>Apart from a quantitative increase, we are faced at the same time by the deepening of the Union where common practices and regulation now extend to areas of our national life to a far greater extent than they did when we joined nearly 30 years ago. The current convention that is examining how the European Union should organise itself to deal with enlargement and to reconnect with its electorate has identified scrutiny by the national Parliaments of member states as an important element in the future design of the Union.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para13"></a>I particularly believe that the time has come for us to consider some way of using the resources and skills of both Houses to deal with this tide of legislation. It has been growing apace, but the time that both Houses devote to it has not. It is a change which I feel the country would want to see.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para14"></a>This package of reform must be taken as a whole. The moment when we start to pick off particular items that we do not like in the package, it will inevitably start to unravel. In seeking minor change in one area, we risk losing the lot.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para15"></a>The electorate has a right to expect better of Parliament and of this House. If we do not embrace these sensible proposals, we cannot simply revert to the status quo. Change is inevitable and it is better that we have a hand in shaping it.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Trefgarne: </B>   My Lords, I shall try to be as brief. Three separate questions need to be addressed this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para16"></a>First, is there a need for improvement in our procedures, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, seems to think? I am not persuaded. Of course, it is well known that when the House sits late Chief Whips of all parties have difficulty in detaining some noble Lords, but that has been the position for as far back as I can remember. I believe that when my noble friend Lord Denham was a distinguished Government Chief Whip, he had as much difficulty then as I dare say the noble Lord, Lord Carter, has now in keeping his noble friends here late at night to vote.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para17"></a>That is part of the political process that has been inherent in our system for as far back as any of us can remember, and indeed a great deal further. The idea that we shall somehow improve our proceedings by avoiding the need to sit late is not necessarily self-evident. I do not think that that case has been made for the wholesale improvement in our procedures.
<P>


<a name="column_664"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 664</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para18"></a>I turn to the second question and the procedure by which so-called improvements will be arrived at. This is the second time in recent memory that we have had a Leader's Group to inquire into our affairs. Such groups are naturally staffed by eminent Members of your Lordships' House. The Leader of the House himself chaired this one and my noble friend Lord Strathclyde assisted him. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, the Leader of the Cross-Benchers and a very distinguished member of the Liberal Democrat Party, also sat on the committee. Such committees tend to develop a momentum of their own, and they come to the House with proposals that have been recommended from a high source. Perhaps slightly more respectful noble Lords than myself are bowled over by such recommendations and tend to nod them through. I am afraid that I am not prepared to do that, but it will be recognised at once that I was not well brought up and perhaps I should learn better manners.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para19"></a>Be that as it may, such committees are not formally constituted committees of the House. They are selected by the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House. I do not disagree with that, but let it be clear that they have no authority, save their own self-interest. Your Lordships should take their proposals on that basis.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para20"></a> I turn to the merits of the proposals. I shall not run through each one from (a) to (n), but they are all designed to facilitate the passage of government legislation. There is nothing wrong in the noble and learned Lord introducing proposals that will enable him to get his business through the House more quickly and easily, but your Lordships should see them for what they are. The noble and learned Lord is seeking to reduce the capacity of the House&#151;I suppose that that means the Opposition&#151;to question, delay, reform and revise, which is the role of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para21"></a>That would be a mistake. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will not seek to shackle the Procedure Committee, not least by asking it to steam through its consideration of his proposals and to make its recommendations as early as 8th July. I, therefore, support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Denham. I hope that the House will agree to it, and I hope that your Lordships will give careful scrutiny to the recommendations of the Procedure Committee when they eventually come before us.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_time2"></a><H5>4.28 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-06_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Birmingham: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief. I have only three comments to make.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para22"></a>First, there is a moral good in conducting our business effectively and also humanely. If the recommendations of the Leader's Group will help the House to do its work better, use its Members' time more effectively and help them to get to bed at a reasonable hour, they are to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para23"></a>Secondly, I note that the subject is the working practices of the House. These are a matter of housekeeping, not about building the kingdom of heaven. In such matters, we look for improvement, <P>


<a name="column_665"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 665</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not perfection. We know from experience that all reforms have unintended consequences. The only way to find out what those are, unless we can truly lay our hand on our heart and predict disaster, is to put the proposals to the test of practice, and then review them in the light of experience, as is proposed.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para24"></a>Thirdly, by standing back from the recommendations, I observe that they are one more sign of the increasing professionalisation of the work of the House.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para25"></a>There is an increasingly heavy load of work to be done, not least in the scrutiny of legislation and in the work of government. That work has to be done thoroughly by persons who have both the time and the competence to do it. I am not concerned to pass any judgment on that development; I simply note it. But I also note the consequence for people such as those of us who sit on these Benches. Our primary duties in life lie elsewhere. The more demanding the work of this House becomes in terms of time and attention, the harder it is for people like us to pull our weight and fully participate in the kind of work that has to be done. I note the fact. How does that lie with the benefit to this House of those who are not members of the political class and who bring with them their day-to-day experience of life and responsibilities that are exercised primarily elsewhere? I ask the question.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_time3"></a><H5>4.31 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I speak as chairman of your Lordships' European Union Select Committee. My comments will be confined solely to the contents of the paragraph under the heading, "Select Committees", in which the committee I chair is singled out for uniquely close attention. I am grateful to those noble Lords, including the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House, who have been kind enough to make kind references to the work of the committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para26"></a>In passing, I wonder why the work of the European Union Committee was the only one which the group decided to have a look at. I suspect that the reason may lie in the membership of the working group in the form of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, but there are, of course, other valuable Select Committees in your Lordships' House, including particularly the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which does such useful work on scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para27"></a>Turning back to the European Union Committee, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House, as chairman of the Leader's Group, wrote to me last December asking for comments from our committee on the working methods we follow and on some more general matters relating to the House's consideration of European business. The committee had the opportunity to consider the request in some detail and responded in January. That response is available in the Library. I should also add that the committee authorised me to appear before the Leader's Group to give evidence should I have been invited to do so, but no such invitation was in the event received.
<P>


<a name="column_666"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 666</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para28"></a>I turn to the recommendations of the report as they relate to European scrutiny. Your Lordships will note that there is a recommendation for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a review of the House's scrutiny of European legislation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-06_para29"></a>
I take that to be a review not only of the work of the European Union Committee but also of the House's scrutiny of European legislation in a more general sense. One area where this point is particularly relevant is the time allowed for debates on our reports. One of the key points made in the committee's submission to the group, and a matter on which the committee felt most strongly, was that there should be more time for debates on the Floor of the House for our committee's reports. We recognise that the usual channels do their level best to make quality time available, but we nevertheless concluded that better arrangements could and should be made. We accordingly proposed that Select Committee reports should usually be debated within 12 sitting weeks of publication, and earlier where necessary. That recommendation, unfortunately, does not appear to have been carried forward by the group.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para30"></a>I should add that, not knowing what the House will make of the other recommendations of the Leader's Group report, if one of the consequences of what is agreed is that there is more time on the Floor of the House for debates on committee reports in prime time, my committee would very much welcome that. I am encouraged by what the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House said on that issue in his opening remarks.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para31"></a>Tied up with the question of debates is the question of how seriously the Government take our scrutiny work. I have recently received a government response to a very thorough report by one of our sub-committees which can best be summarised in the phrase, "Thank you for your letter, the contents of which have been noted". I shall not name the department concerned&#151;it will by now have received a strongly worded letter from me making clear that that is not good enough and demanding a proper response&#151;but the case does illustrate that, in addition to the House having the responsibility to discharge its duty of scrutiny thoroughly, the Government have a duty to consider and respond in an equally thorough manner.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para32"></a>I turn now to the details of paragraph 30 of the report before us today. The suggestion made in the report for a review of European scrutiny includes a review of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the appropriate balance between the scrutiny of general policy and that of specific legislative proposals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-06_para33"></a>
I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, referred to that. That is an interesting distinction and one to which the committee is constantly alive. All the six sub-committees, which as your Lordships will know conduct most of the substantive scrutiny work, are aware of that distinction. There is also a related question: at what stage in the cycle of European policy making and legislation can the reports from your Lordships' committees have most impact on those formulating policy?
<P>


<a name="column_667"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 667</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para34"></a>There is a strongly argued case that your Lordships can have most impact at an early stage in the process. This is because the detailed scrutiny of European legislation by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers is not a process in which your Lordships' House, or any other national parliament, is directly involved in the same kind of detailed way as we are in passing United Kingdom legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para35"></a>The suggestion for a review also refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the desirability of a greater number of shorter and more focussed reports".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-06_para36"></a>
The committee will need to consider that suggestion most carefully. There is, of course, no necessary correlation between the shortness of a report and its focus. A quite substantial report can be neatly focused on a complex series of issues while a short report can present its arguments in a muddled and diffuse way, although of course none of ours ever does.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para37"></a>The report from the Leader's Group also refers back to the debate on our committee's report on the possibility of a second parliamentary chamber for Europe and cites the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Howell of Guildford, Lord Williamson of Horton and Lord Desai in that debate. Without asking why those noble Lords were singled out for particular mention, I am sure that the House will be pleased to learn that the committee has already taken steps to follow up many of the matters raised in the debate. For example, the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, proposed that more attention should be paid to scrutiny of the Commission's Annual Work Programme. We have already heard evidence from senior Commission officials on that topic and next week we shall see a senior official from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and we shall then produce a report on how we might take that matter forward.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para38"></a>I should also add that a number of points made in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, are not matters on which the committee can itself take a decision. For example, one of the suggestions was for the whole European scrutiny business to be made "mandatory and legal". I am not quite sure myself how such a development could be taken forward&#151;it would certainly require a resolution of the House and, indeed, possibly primary legislation. Neither of those are matters which the Select Committee itself can deliver, but it would be happy to give the House the benefit of its views should the House wish that. It would be in that spirit that I would invite the Select Committee to take forward the suggestion in the report and consider those matters.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para39"></a>The paragraph on Select Committees concludes with an invitation to the European Union Committee and the Procedure Committee to explore some of the suggestions made in the second chamber debate. As I have already said, we have already taken some steps in that direction. But if the House through this debate gives the green light to this recommendation in the Leader's Group report, I shall of course report back to the Select Committee and we shall begin work on those issues. We would need to consider taking evidence <P>


<a name="column_668"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 668</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from, among others, the party leaders in this House, other elements of the Government and, indeed, other national parliaments, to name but a few, to see how we could take our work forward constructively.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para40"></a>If such a review is to be done, it would, of course, need to be done properly. For that reason I am assuming that, whatever the result of the amendment tabled today by the noble Lord, Lord Denham, our committee need not feel under pressure to produce its report by 8th July.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para41"></a>To sum up: I shall invite my committee to take note of the recommendations of the Leader's Group report and in this debate and, if the Motion is carried today, to carry out a review along the lines suggested, building on the work we already do to keep our scrutiny procedures under review.

<A NAME="20521-06_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   My Lords, I should like to start by congratulating the Leader's Group on producing a unanimous report. I am sure that that is a fairly rare event. It is to the great credit of all the members of that group that they were able to use their skill and expertise to produce a unanimous report.

<a name="20521-06_para42"></a>In moving his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Denham, is clearly very suspicious of the recommendations contained in the report. I am equally suspicious that the motivation for the amendment is to prevent change, particularly as the ultimate decisions will not be taken today but will be presented to the Procedure Committee, which will have to report back to this House before the decisions are approved. I do not believe that it would be impossible for the Procedure Committee to consider those recommendations in the space of seven weeks. There is no reason to suggest that the process should be delayed. Having been a member of the Procedure Committee, I know that the proposals will be scrutinised in depth, not least taking into account the question of resources that has previously been raised.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para43"></a>During a similar debate almost exactly two years ago, introduced by my noble friend Lord Peston and referred to by my noble friend Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, it was suspected that the object of calling for change to our working practices was to make matters easier for the Government and to dilute our scrutiny of the executive. The expression then used was "to make the House more government friendly", about which we have heard a little more today. That is completely wrong. This package clearly does not do that&#151;quite the reverse. I would not support any changes unless they related to efficiency, to doing our job of scrutiny better, to making good law and to making the House more people friendly. These proposals are not about changing the ethos of the House or cloning the Commons; nor are they about diminishing the right of Back-Benchers or introducing timetables and guillotines. If that were the case, I would strongly oppose them. They are not merely about getting through government business, but improving that business.

<a name="20521-06_para44"></a>The measures presented to us today show that, with skill and thought, it is possible to restructure and reorganise our working practices, while at the same time increasing the ability of this Chamber to scrutinise in more depth and detail. We should not lose that opportunity.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para45"></a>It seems to me that the recommendations fall neatly into two, but interrelated categories: those relating to improving the level of scrutiny, which is not always done as well as we pretend, and those designed to provide more sensible working hours. I make no apology for specifically referring to a number of them and to the reasons that I support them.
<P>

<a name="20521-06_para46"></a>Whether or not we like it, the makeup of this House has changed, giving rise to changing expectations. There has been a significant drop in the average age of Members; the number of women has increased; more Members have young children or care responsibilities for the young and old; more Members have full-time occupations outside the House, and very differing work patterns.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness says that there has been a drop in the average age of this House. However, she will find that between the removal of the hereditary Peers and the formation of the new House post-1999, the average age of the House actually rose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   My Lords, although I am happy to be corrected by the noble Lord, my understanding is that the average age has dropped from 75 to 72; but we shall have to discuss that further. There is no doubt that Members have to balance their parliamentary duties with their outside responsibilities, which we have to recognise and respect.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para0"></a>I am sure that we all appreciate and thank the Chief Whip for the better planning of our time, for earlier notice of dates of Recesses and for earlier notice of business. Now is the opportunity to further improve the domestic management of this House and to some degree remove our unpredictable and unsociable hours. I am sure that we should all be very happy to have extended breaks at Christmas, Easter and Whitsun. However, those cannot be achieved without some other adjustments on time.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para1"></a>In addition, we sometimes forget that this House is a major employer. Changing the procedures, including sitting hours, would be of great benefit to the staff, who do an amazing job, working such ridiculous hours. Late hours do not equate to effectiveness, efficiency or adequate scrutiny. It is a myth that we earn respect from sitting into the early hours of the morning. That is, and is perceived to be, a nonsense. The proposals before us do not diminish the time taken on our deliberations&#151;rather the reverse. The fact that the Committee stage of more Bills will be held in Grand Committee will allow parallel sittings to take place and will make it feasible for us to end our Sessions at about the reasonably respectable hour of 10 p.m., after which time no new item of business could be raised.

<a name="20521-07_para2"></a>As my noble and learned friend the Lord Privy Seal said, there are other advantages of increasing our work in Grand Committee. It would allow for greater flexibility in the number of days spent in Committee and, consequently, for greater exploration of issues, more detailed debate and more detailed questioning of the Government as Bills are examined line by line. It certainly would improve the level of our scrutiny of legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para3"></a>When the idea of a morning sitting was previously considered, it was suggested that it would create a clash with Committee work. So far in this debate, that has not been suggested. Before it is, I would say that the argument is not relevant, as many Select Committees now sit in the afternoons and, to my knowledge, no one has suggested that the House should cease to sit in the afternoons in order to accommodate the Select Committees.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para4"></a>We all agree that any procedural change must increase our ability to check the Government, to make them pause and think again and to make good law. We have here a package of measures that would do exactly that, by providing more power of scrutiny to Back-Benchers. That could be achieved in important and cleverly constructed ways, by the extension of Question Time, and by enabling more detailed examination of the merits of every statutory instrument subject to Parliamentary scrutiny&#151;something that we do rather badly at the moment but which has a direct impact on the implementation of legislation and on people's lives.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para5"></a>Increasing the number of policy debates would be a valuable way of making the Government consider issues in detail&#151;not necessarily issues that they would have chosen to debate. A sharper focus on our many excellent Select Committees would ensure a greater government awareness of our views on topics of public importance, which often prepare the way for future legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para6"></a>Last week, the Constitution Committee of your Lordships' House, of which I am a member, as part of its work on devolution, visited the Scottish Parliament to take evidence. That included a consideration of its procedures for the pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills. Its exposure of Bills to public criticism and to non-parliamentary groups not only influences the shape and quality of Bills before they are finalised, but also the entire legislative process is perceived to be much more open and accessible than it is in Westminster&#151;a lesson from which we could learn. The clear advantages of pre-legislative scrutiny are set out in paragraph 7 of the document. I agree with them all. I particularly agree that if they create a less confrontational approach to the way in which we handle our legislation they must be good.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para7"></a> Although it is right that each item should be considered on a case-by-case basis, I believe that, whenever possible and appropriate, a Joint Committee of both Houses is the best course. That would not only provide more acceptable legislation to both Houses but would also assist the development of better relations between the two Houses.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para8"></a>It is also eminently sensible to link that proposal to the question of carry-over to subsequent Sessions. It is a waste of parliamentary time&#151;that is, our time&#151;and a little ludicrous that when we reach almost the final stage of a Bill at the end of a Session, we have to start it all over again in the next Session. That seems to me, and I am sure to many of the electorate, absolutely ridiculous.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para9"></a>In conclusion, the fact that we have functioned in a particular way for a long period&#151;I noted that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, spoke about the 17th century&#151;does not mean that we should always work in that way. It is clear that some people are opposed to and refuse to accept that change is absolutely necessary. The composition of this House has changed, expectations have changed, and we need to adapt accordingly. We need to evolve to suit the changed House. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, who is no longer in his place, I believe that there is a need for change. That was clearly illustrated in the debate introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, when Peers on all sides of the House called for changes to our procedures.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para10"></a>The proposals before us form a package of measures that gives your Lordships an opportunity to more effectively scrutinise the Government, to improve the quality of legislation and to make the House more people friendly. I hope that these proposals will gain the support of the House and that the amendment, which will prevent us doing that work more effectively, will be rejected.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I am sure the House will be relieved to know that I shall make an extremely short speech. That is because I wish only to make one proposal. If this report does go to the Procedure Committee, as I suspect it will, it is a suggestion that that committee might like to consider. It concerns the question of Bills going to a Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para11"></a>When I read the report soon after its publication, I scribbled in the margin against paragraph 23, the paragraph recommending greater use of the Grand Committee procedure, the question, "Why not split the Bill, cf. Finance Bills in the House of Commons?" I was involved in the huge arguments that took place on the Floor of the House of another place during 1966, 1967 and 1968, at the end of which it was initially decided that the whole of the Committee stage of the Finance Bill should go before a Standing Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para12"></a>However, in the end, that decision led to a procedure that has found favour under successive governments and oppositions of different parties. The procedure is quite simply this: when the Finance Bill is tabled, and after Second Reading, the opposition parties are given the opportunity to identify particular issues of great political or economic importance which they would like to take on the Floor of the House. Those debates are taken first. Thereafter, when those issues have been debated in Committee of the whole House, the rest of the Bill is remitted to a Committee upstairs.
<P>


<a name="column_672"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 672</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para13"></a>That process would enable us to overcome the difficulty referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Roper; namely, of there being no votes in Grand Committees in this House. Apart from anything else, I find the Moses Room an absolutely impossible place to hear what anyone is saying that I do not go there very often. If you have a good debate in the Moses Room during a Committee stage, I can well understand it being very frustrating if you cannot vote at the end of it. All I am asking at this stage is that the Procedure Committee should consider splitting the Bill as one of the ways of making the sending of Bills to a Grand Committee perhaps more acceptable to the House. If the Opposition have the chance of choosing certain issues in a Bill for debate in the full House before it goes upstairs, or wherever, that would seem to me an advantage.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para14"></a>On delving into the matter, I discovered that the other place does not now confine this procedure to Finance Bills; indeed, it has been applied to a number of Bills in recent years. I am told that it was applied to the Criminal Justice Bill 1989-90, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill 1989-90, the Sunday Trading Bill 1993-94, the Family Law Bill 1995-96, and the Firearms (Amendment) Bill 1996-97. In those cases, it was applied particularly to issues that might be described as "issues of conscience"&#151;in other words, issues on which there might be a free vote. However, if the Opposition, as in Finance Bills, is choosing the subject, that could equally apply to issues of considerable political consequence.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para15"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Strathclyde said that we should not,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"import procedures from the increasingly discredited House of Commons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-07_para16"></a>
In a sense, I should like to put the issue the other way round. As many of my honourable friends who are still Members of the other place have said, the processes of holding the Government to account these days have become a pale shadow of what they used to be. Indeed, how many times have I heard, "Patrick, it's awful, compared with when you, and others, were here". I believe that that increases the importance of this House being able to hold Her Majesty's Government to account and carry through our legislative functions as effectively as we can.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para17"></a>I am attracted by the parts of the package that involve sending Bills to a committee because of the advantage that it gives in providing more time on the Floor of the House for major debates. Perhaps I may plead a particular case. After an inquiry that I was privileged to chair, the Select Committee on Science and Technology produced a report a few years ago entitled, Science and Society. As those who follow such matters will know, since that report was published there has been an enormous amount of interest and activity, especially among the learned and scientific societies and other bodies, in recognition of the fact that the whole relationship between science and the public is changing, has changed, and, indeed, must change further.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20521-07_para18"></a>We had to debate that report on a Friday. Like other members of that committee, I tried very hard to get a debate in the middle of the week when the subject matter would have attracted more attention. We had a good debate, but it took place on a Friday and attracted no attention outside the House. There are other examples of Select Committee debates suffering a similar fate. If one of the consequences of this package is that such debates on Select Committee reports can be taken on the Floor of the House in prime time, I should be prepared to see more Bills going to a standing committee, subject, of course, to my caveat that we should adopt the procedure of the other place, which is not of recent origin&#151;it dates back 30 years&#151;of splitting the Bill and having the more controversial parts debated on the Floor of the House.
<P>

<a name="20521-07_para19"></a>I do not necessarily share the fear expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Roper, though I hope I get my Virgil right when I say:

<P>

"I fear the Greeks, even when [they are] bearing gifts". I do not believe that I need fear this particular noble and learned Greek sitting on the Front Bench opposite. I think that it is certainly right for the Procedure Committee to consider this package. However, perhaps I may also ask members of that committee to consider my suggestion of splitting the Committee stage.

<A NAME="20521-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord concludes, I wonder whether he could assist me. I remember well the occasion that he mentioned regarding the Finance Bill in the 1960s. I believe that it followed a very lengthy and contentious Finance Bill, which caused a good deal of alarm and dissension. I agree with the noble Lord as regards splitting the process. However, when the Finance Bill and other measures in the other place are remitted to a Committee upstairs, I seem to recall that votes are still taken. If that is so, I cannot see why votes should not be taken in our committees in the Moses Room, or wherever. Can the noble Lord say whether I am right in that generalised recollection?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   Yes, of course, my Lords. I do not want to weary the House, but in the other place Standing Committees consist of limited numbers. That is the difference. If any Member of this House is entitled to attend and speak at a meeting of a Grand Committee, I can well understand why votes cannot be taken at that stage. My suggestion of splitting the Bill would allow votes to be taken on the Floor of the House.

<A NAME="20521-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, it is very good to follow the very thoughtful speech of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, which I believe highlighted a number of useful points that some of us may want to take further. I well remember the excellent report on Science and Society. Two or three months after its publication I happened to be attending a seminar on that theme at Harvard. I suggested to the professor in <P>


<a name="column_674"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 674</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>charge that she might like a copy of the report. She replied, "Oh, I have already read it". Even if it was not debated properly in our House, the report was widely read by experts across the world.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para0"></a>I welcome the package before the House. I believe that we should accept it as such, even though some aspects of it may not be ideal. I am conscious that there is a divide within my own group between those who mainly work and live in London and those who work and live outside the capital. As I work in London but like to spend my weekends mainly outside the capital, I am torn on the Thursday issue because the attraction of taking the 19.25 evening plane to Florence, where my wife works, pushes me very strongly in favour of the experiment for the early Sitting. However, that is a personal view on the matter.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para1"></a>The point made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham is one about which we all need to think most carefully. It implies heavier time commitments for a greater number of Members of this House. We are a part-time House; many of us who were nominated to your Lordships' House still earn our salaries elsewhere. We hope that the expertise that we gain from our occupations elsewhere brings something to the House. However, the added strain that more Committee work will place on Members of the House raises questions about the future balance between part-timers and full-timers.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para2"></a>I would like to see an extension of the role of committees in the House. I am happy to hear that we have now got over the old argument that we could not have more committees because we could not possibly have more staff&#151;we used to hear that even four or five years ago. I should like to see not just pre-legislative scrutiny committees but also good, solid committees of inquiry&#151;sometimes Joint Committees, sometimes Committees of your Lordships' House&#151;which would fulfil the functions that were met, many years ago, by Royal Commissions. They would occasionally meet and take evidence outside London to promote a wider and more informed public debate.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para3"></a>My main point is about the Committee stage of Bills. It is high time that we took the Committee stage of more Bills off the Floor of the House. During the past nine months I have examined how many Members were in the Chamber during Committee stages. The noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House said that the average was 12; that matches my observations. There have been five-hour debates in Committee at which no more than seven Members have spoken. I say to those on the Conservative Benches that attendance has most often been thinnest on those Benches. To resist the idea that a Bill's Committee stage, when there is proper inquiry into the Bill's details, should take place in a Committee Room does not fit with Conservative Members' attendance at Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para4"></a>I have worked in Grand Committees. I do not find the Moses Room as difficult as some other Members. I well remember the first time that I was involved with a Bill in Committee, along with Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. It was, I believe, considering the <P>


<a name="column_675"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 675</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adoption into British law of a chemical convention protocol. We learnt a great deal in Committee and we tested the government, who could not answer all of our questions. It was a useful non-voting experience and it meant that when we reached the Report stage, we could get on with the business rather more effectively. Consideration in Committee has a different purpose from consideration on Report, at which votes should properly take place whenever the government have failed satisfactorily to provide answers to questions that were raised in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para5"></a>Resistance to the proposal comes from the old idea that Parliament involves a zero-sum game between two parties: the government struggle to get everything through unamended and the opposition attempt to block everything. That is a sort of Westminster wall game, for those who are familiar with that form of public school entertainment.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para6"></a>However, politics is not a game and the House of Lords is not the Oxford Union or the Eton College debating society; nor is it a club. It is a revising Chamber of a legislature. We should all take to heart the words of the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House&#151;that we have to be concerned with the reputation and proper role of Parliament and that we should demonstrate, as a revising Chamber, that we are fulfilling that proper role.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para7"></a>This Chamber benefits from the fact that no party now has a majority. It means that Ministers have to persuade and that compromise and dialogue are the preferred style. Incidentally, that is one of the arguments for multi-party politics as such&#151;it promotes a greater degree of accountability and responsibility. I therefore very much welcome the overall package. It will enable the House to fulfil a proper legislative function and a proper scrutiny function much more efficiently. I hope that we shall go ahead with the proposal.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, the committee did well to produce a unanimous report. However, knowing the standing of the people concerned, that does not surprise me unduly. It appears that implicitly it took account of the fact that the reputation of the House is actually increasing. It is up to us to maintain that improvement in our reputation through the work that we are yet to do.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para8"></a>I am all in favour of the experimental period. However, the decisions that we take today may not last for such a long time. Other things are happening. Any introduction of elected Peers will change the character of this House much more than any decisions that we take today, dividing the House not just between those who have an electorate and those who do not but between those who will be trying to satisfy their electorate and those who will not need to. Those elected Members will need office accommodation with secretaries and other facilities and they will have something of a payroll. At Question Time and in debate they will demand a greater presence because <P>


<a name="column_676"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 676</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their needs may be perceived as being more pressing. They have to satisfy their voters and obtain their support at any subsequent election. In reality, then, if elected Members join this House, all our efforts to improve the working of the House of Lords will not involve long-term measures. So my approach to the report is based on the assumption that the working practices that we are discussing do not take account of any such changes in our membership.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para9"></a>There are particular matters that concern me. The first is that major government Bills should, as a matter of course, be subject to draft pre-legislative scrutiny by Parliament. That is obviously desirable. However, I believe that the report is rather over-optimistic in assuming that so much extra examination of legislation can be slotted into the same timetable that we have at present. It is a worthy ambition but, in addition, Members would need to give much more time to that extra examination&#151;and such time would be extra. To have better prepared legislation will save some time in its later examination but not much. So the total time spent in examining legislation&#151;draft legislation as well as legislation at later stages&#151;will be increased. That is right and proper but such scrutiny can be applied only to a limited number of Bills.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para10"></a> I turn to the proposal to carry over legislation to the following Session. It is true that failure to carry over leads to distortion of the parliamentary year. It leads to the rush at the end of the year when all sorts of Bills are passed that should not be. There is no question about that. The proposal could involve two years of gestation. If a Bill is introduced in October and it carried through to September, nearly two years could be involved from Second Reading. That is far too long. I suggest that the carry over should be no more than 12 months after Second Reading. That is mainly because legislation needs to deal with changes that take place and ensuing further amendments. The process has to reach the end of the line at some stage.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para11"></a>I turn to the questions raised by Finance Bills. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, made a useful point about the way in which Finance Bills are divided. I remember very well, as will my noble friend Lord Barnett, those days back in 1968 when Iain Macleod led for the opposition. He complained for one and a half days that the temperature of the room was too hot. He thereby got the great concession of dividing the Bill, which has been of value to that House and which would be of value to this place as well. It is not the whole Bill that has to have such an examination. I agree with the greater use of committees, as the noble Lord suggested.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para12"></a>We should be careful with Finance Bills because they are rather special. They have technical aspects, which will obviously go to the Grand Committee. However, we should take account of the fact that such technical aspects are not easily distinguishable from the political aspects. I know full well the enormous volume of correspondence that one receives from lobbyists. If we go along that route, the House will have to endure&#151;and, possibly, accept&#151;sophisticated and expensive lobbying.
<P>


<a name="column_677"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 677</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para13"></a>We must also consider the proposal to examine the merits of statutory instruments. The House of Commons has many problems with statutory instruments. There are thousands of them; over 3,000, I believe. My noble friend mentioned the filtering that will be required. There is no question about that. It already happens in the House of Commons. The amount of filtering required may be so great that one has to place great trust in the people who carry it out. Therefore, statutory instruments will never be brought under the kind of control that I would dearly like to see. In a parliamentary democracy, I can see no way in which the elected Members or the Members of this House could obtain such a degree of control over all statutory instruments.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para14"></a>I am delighted with the proposal to have five oral Questions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I believe that one enormous advantage that this House has is that it is able to deal straightaway with topical matters that suddenly crop up. The House of Commons does not deal with topical questions in the way that we do here. However, there will be a consequence to the proposal. The gentlemanly behaviour whereby we concede the Floor to each other is becoming unworkable now. If we had elected Peers, it would become completely unworkable. It would not be possible to shut them up. They would have elections to fight and would be determined to put their questions. We should need to have a form of Speaker to decide objectively which person was to speak.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para15"></a>The proposal for Ministers to have one day off is right. Great pressure is placed on Ministers. They must frequently answer questions outside their main area of responsibility. The fact that Ministers know the details of each department and that they answer hostile questions on a range of subjects is a tribute to their ability and their work. Of course, that warrants this minor concession.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para16"></a>I turn to the question of additional Back-Bench debates on Wednesdays. The Wednesday debates are among the finest of almost any legislature in the world. Noble Lords do not fight cases from political viewpoints; they fight them because they want this House to take account of matters in which they believe. I consider that additional Back-Bench debates would be wholly valuable.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para17"></a> With regard to Thursday sittings, speaking personally, I do not believe that we should ape the House of Commons and create ever-extended weekends. After all, Friday used to be a full day. It then became a half-day and was then abolished. Now Thursday is coming near to being abolished. As we know, that is also happening in much of industry. When I was young, we used to work on Saturday mornings and finish at one o'clock. That was one's weekend. Of course, the generation before me worked all day on Saturday.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para18"></a>There is a limit to what we can do here. The ability to carry over legislation is valuable, and the next Session should not be so hectic an experience. September sittings could also be worthwhile so long as the dates <P>

<A NAME="20521-08_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, this is an important debate in so far as it may have far-reaching effects on the way in which your Lordships' House conducts itself and on the effect that this House has in scrutinising legislation. I can well understand the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House wishing to alter the methods by which the House operates. I believe that we all want to do that from time to time. But the noble and learned Lord seems to take the view that, if anything has stood the test of time tolerably well, it should be changed. That is called "modernising", which gives it a halo of respectability. The noble and learned Lord sometimes reminds me of Boadicea standing upright in her chariot, careering around the arena and ensuring that, if anything stands, it is felled by the knives on the end of the wheels.
<P>

<a name="20521-08_para19"></a>I can understand why the noble and learned Lord wants these changes but I cannot understand why he has set up a special committee. The members of it are, of course, all good men and true. But one becomes suspicious when the noble and learned Lord has co-opted the Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Democrat Chief Whip and the Convenor of the Cross Benches. It would be difficult for them not to take part. That would be unco-operative on their part and they would not know what was going on. On the other hand, if they all become involved and produce&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="20521-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. I did not choose who was to be on the committee. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, selected himself and the noble Lord, Lord Waddington. The Liberal Democrats chose the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and it was a matter entirely for the noble and gallant Lord to decide who would represent the interests of the Cross-Benchers. I chose only myself and my noble friend Lord Brooke.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord did decide on the total number of Peers who should sit on the committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-09_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for at least putting me right on that point. I admire his modesty and the fact that the only person whom he chose was himself.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para0"></a>The point is that he succeeded in getting all the chief chicks in his coop. One wonders whether a report which involves all these people does not sometimes look like a Front-Bench stitch-up, and some lesser mortals, such as myself, wonder what is going on and why. If the noble and learned Lord wants to change the procedures of the House, there is a perfectly good and authoritative body which can and should consider the matter; namely, the Procedure Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para1"></a>On principle, it is undesirable that a report of this nature should be made, considered by your Lordships and then passed to the Procedure Committee, with the <P>


<a name="column_679"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 679</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inference that virtually all the work on the subject has been done by this ad hoc committee and all that the Procedure Committee has to do is to rubber-stamp the proposals. The noble and learned Lord said that his committee had worked on the proposals for nine months. We all admire the assiduity with which the committee spent its time. But, under this Motion, the noble and learned Lord gives the Procedure Committee only six weeks. During his speech, he said that the report would go to the Procedure Committee with an instruction to give recommendations. However, he failed to say that the Procedure Committee's recommendations would relate to the implementation of the report.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para2"></a>To my mind, the method of going about this matter is all back to front. The Procedure Committee should have considered the problem first and given the House its views. The House could then amend, reject or approve its proposals. As we all know, the noble and learned Lord has the ability to argue any case, good or bad, with great skill&#151;so much so that he has hoist himself with his own petard. One never really knows whether the noble and learned Lord believes in what he is saying or whether he is simply arguing like a good advocate for a very bad case. Either way, it is enchanting to listen to.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para3"></a>I am bound to say that I find it difficult to equate the view, which the Government are always correctly expressing and which the noble and learned Lord expressed this afternoon and on television on Sunday in a characteristically polished performance, that it is the duty of Parliament to hold the executive to account and that ways must be found of improving that with the endless measures which the Government introduce, which have precisely the reverse effect.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para4"></a>Like school boys, we now have half-term to give us all a rest and to let us go back and spend more time with our families and children. Business on Thursdays should stop at 7 p.m. in order that we should spend more time with our families and children. The noble and learned Lord would like the House to sit in September and probably to rise earlier in July&#151;in order to let us spend more time with our families and children. That all follows the pattern of what is happening in the other place. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, that we do not want to ape the procedures of the other place.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para5"></a>The concept of spending time with families and children may be admirable, but this is all done at a time when the Members of another place have given themselves huge salary rises and when your Lordships' expenses have been greatly increased, too. The idea that all these changes will be implemented for the better scrutiny of Bills is, with respect, absolute nonsense. It is being done for two reasons. The first is to give Members of both Houses an easier time. But if they had wanted that, they should not have become involved in parliamentary business in the first place. The second is to allow Bills less scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para6"></a>All noble Lords know that, despite grandiose words about the authority of Parliament, the Prime Minister has an intense dislike of Parliament interfering with his <P>


<a name="column_680"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 680</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wishes. Early rising truncates business in another place; no voting takes place after 10 o'clock; the Chamber of another place is practically empty; and controversial Bills receive even less scrutiny. Many come to this House with huge tranches not even considered by another place, of which the Animal Health Bill was a good example, as not one amendment was made to it in another place. One merely has to look at the televised proceedings of another place to realise that the House is virtually dead.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para7"></a>The only place where there is any semblance of a check on the executive is here, as the noble and learned Lord has said. Now the Government want to change that. The idea that longer breaks away from Parliament for the convenience of Members of Parliament and Peers should be compensated for by taking more Bills off the Floor of the House and sending them to Grand Committees where no Divisions can take place is unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para8"></a>One of the great advantages of this place is that, unlike another place, any amendment can be, and has to be, considered. The Floor of the House is the right place for that. Grand Committees are good for various purposes, but they are not the same as the Chamber. They may have their place for specialised Bills, but if we take more Bills away from the Chamber, in effect we shall create two debating chambers. Although any noble Lord may take part in Grand Committees, one is less likely to make an effort to attend, whereas one naturally attends the Chamber. Anyhow, there is no voting in Grand Committees, which certainly makes them less effective.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para9"></a>I am not convinced, although I am prepared to be, that pre-legislative scrutiny is a good thing. As I understand it, it can become a long, drawn-out process, in which, among other things, every lobby group in creation can write in and even come and have its say. That may be fine, but the danger is that once a Bill has received its pre-legislative scrutiny, the Committee stage may be considered de minimis. I believe that that is what the Government want. If the noble and learned Lord and the Government want more of a check on the executive, how can that be achieved without having votes at Committee stage?
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para10"></a>It is the duty of Parliament&#151;not of lobby groups&#151;to go through the Bill line by line. In my view, cutting down on the Committee stage of Bills, taking the Committee stage off the Floor of the House and giving it to smaller Committees does not equate with the Government's expressed desire for Parliament to provide greater scrutiny of Bills and a greater check on the Government. In fact, it has the reverse effect.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para11"></a>The idea of Question Time being extended would be universally popular. Every noble Lord enjoys Question Time&#151;rather like schoolboys&#151;not necessarily to elicit the answer, but in order to trip up the master. So much of that is ruined because frequently our questions are too long and Ministers' replies are almost universally too long. At Question Time I once asked the noble and learned Lord&#151;he may remember the occasion&#151;during a somewhat <P>


<a name="column_681"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 681</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>truncated question, whether he thought that Question Time would be more fun if the questions and answers were shorter. As one may expect, his reply was a gem. "Yes", he said and sat down. That said it all; it was all good fun; and it was short, sharp and to the point. I just wish that the noble and learned Lord could persuade his fellow Ministers to follow suit.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para12"></a> Of course, practices will have to change over time, but I regard these proposals with great suspicion. I believe that they will have an effect on Parliament and on parliamentary scrutiny which will be way beyond that expected and that they will be deleterious both to Parliament and to the purpose of Parliament. I do not like the idea that we should give the ideas a whirl for two years to see what happens. That is the same argument as is used for imposing speed limits, but once they are imposed they are seldom taken away again.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, I warmly welcome the proposal for five Starred Questions, with eight minutes for each, on certain days of the week. That was not an option set out in the questionnaire sent to noble Lords, but I suggested it as a possible compromise that would not impose excessive burdens on the ministerial team of the day. It is gratifying that the working group evidently found the argument compelling. Of course, there are many other admirable aspects of the report, but, given the short time available, I want to concentrate upon two of the more contentious, starting with the proposal that the House should sit in September.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para13"></a>Most noble Lords have found that to be a bad idea and have disagreed with it as, significantly, the Officers of the House did by an even greater margin&#151;no less than two to one against. It is easy to see why. September has always been an excellent holiday month for the British. Most continentals are back at work or school&#151;la rentr&#233;e&#151;by the end of August. In September, beaches, mountains, lakes, villages, cities are all less crowded, low or shoulder-season prices are in force and with any luck discounted flights once again become available. For those who stalk, fish or shoot grouse, which I do not, September has other temptations to offer.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para14"></a>However, there is another reason. The noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Roper, talked of the House of Commons sitting in September, but we are not like that Chamber. The House of Commons works hardest in November, December, January, February, March and possibly April, after which it starts to relax a little. By contrast, this House, despite the best endeavours of successive Chief Whips and Ministers of all political persuasions, tends to twiddle its thumbs to some extent in late autumn and in winter and then works flat out in May, June and July. The fact that the other place is rising a full six days earlier than this House for the Jubilee holiday at the end of the month is evidence of that.
<P>


<a name="column_682"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 682</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para15"></a>I am sure that I am not alone in finding that I usually need to devote the first fortnight of every August to sorting out business matters that have had to be put on the back-burner during the frenetic days of June and July. I submit that, whatever may be the case for the Commons, in this House we need a long summer break. Moreover, a long break has some of the qualities of a sabbatical. As any good doctor will confirm, sabbaticals are good for one's health, especially if one is over 40, and I am afraid that most of us in this House fall within that age category.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para16"></a> The Leader of the House talked of a few extra days at Christmas and at Easter by way of compensation for September sittings, but one would have to scrabble for the few remaining holiday rooms, if they were available, at high-season prices and one would have to pay high-season fares if one could get on a plane or a ferry to get to one's destination. Unlike the situation in September, one would have to compete with millions of people.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para17"></a>One cannot help suspecting that the proposal for September sittings is not unconnected with the proposal that we should normally rise by 10 p.m. All other things being equal, of course we should welcome that, but all other things are not equal. If we start to rise by 10 p.m., that will have to be balanced by more Friday sittings or shorter holidays or both. It is a fallacy, of course, to imagine that late sittings are a recent phenomenon. Twenty-five or 26 years ago, when another Labour government were in power, it was common practice to sit well into the small hours. Indeed, Earl Grey made his maiden speech from the Liberal Benches at 3.15&#151;not 3.15 p.m., but 3.15 a.m. I remember that well as I had the privilege of being the first to congratulate him on his speech in October 1976. The noble Lord, Lord Mowbray and Stourton, may remember that too as he took part in the same debate, as did the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who temporarily is not in his place.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para18"></a> That was not considered a particularly newsworthy or unusual event. I am not suggesting for a moment that we should return to those days&#151;far from it. People's concentration wanders after midnight and far too much bad legislation slipped through then. Even midnight is somewhat on the late side. But I submit that 11 p.m., when public transport is still running, is not too late. I would guess that if Peers and Officers of the House were given a choice of opting for either a 10 p.m. finish, coupled with more Friday sittings and shorter holidays, or for finishing at 11 p.m. balanced by fewer Friday sittings and slightly longer holidays that they would opt for the latter.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para19"></a>I believe that we need more time to consider this matter and for that reason I shall support the noble Lord, Lord Denham, if he presses his Motion to a Division.

<A NAME="20521-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, my initial reaction on reading the report was one of disappointment. Just as the noble Lord, Lord Monson, was happy to see his write-in suggestion of <P>


<a name="column_683"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 683</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extra Starred Questions adopted, I found my write-in suggestion of a change to three consecutive legislative days dismissed in paragraph 27. Although it was acknowledged that many Members favoured the suggestion, the paragraph stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The House did not agree to proposals on these lines in 1999 and 2001 and we do not believe that it would be timely to invite the House to consider the matter again so soon".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-09_para20"></a>
If one considers that the margin in 2001 was 130 to 128, I think that with an extra little shove we would have achieved it.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para21"></a>I also feel slightly guilty because I did not intervene in the 2001 debate. My remarks in the 1999 debate have been misrepresented as being those of personal convenience since I was coming from Scotland. In fact, my substantive argument is that this House is in danger of overrating the amount of expertise it has within the Chamber. Nowadays, the shelf life of knowledge is very short. There are a good many areas where current experience is needed in order to make a valid contribution. In my view&#151;pace the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers&#151;if people are giving up four full days a week they cannot adequately be participating in any outside activity. I think that three full days a week is more than enough for an unsalaried post.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para22"></a>Having got over that disappointment I recognise that the Leader of the House has probably a much greater sense of what he has referred to in the report as "the balance of acceptability of proposals", than I have. So I then tried to read it dispassionately. The Leader of the House and the group went about things as fairly as they possibly could. They circulated a questionnaire. It is encouraging to notice that 362 Members and 26 members of staff responded to it. I pay particular attention to the views of members of staff because, as other noble Lords, such as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, have mentioned, the proposals will put an extra workload on staff. That must be recognised upfront and we must staff-up accordingly to make sure that the job is done properly.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para23"></a>The group is as representative as it can be. It may be dismissed by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, as putting all the chief chicks in one coop, but how else, other than having a committee or a group of the entire House, could one get a representative opinion without using leading figures in each political party and the Cross Benches? Truly, the Latin tag quot homines tot sententiae was coined for this place. Our very individuality means that no one Peer, even on the same side of the House, represents fully the views of another. That is a good thing. But if one is to have a small and workable group, this assembled one did that job admirably.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para24"></a>One of the report's main recommendations is pre-legislative scrutiny. I very much welcome that. Every government issues White Papers which are increasingly glossy and full of sentiments that we all agree with. Equally, the responses in the consultation period are for motherhood and against sin. It is only when one sees a draft Bill and realises that Schedule 2, <P>


<a name="column_684"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 684</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 4, subsection (2)(c) will put one out of business that one really responds to legislation. Seeing a draft Bill is an essential part of the legislative process.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para25"></a>That does not in any way inhibit the Committee stage of a Bill. The fact that there is scrutiny by a committee does not inhibit new scrutiny when the Bill is finally published. As an aside, perhaps I may say that I would favour a Joint Committee of both Houses wherever possible. It is absolutely appalling the way that the two Houses of the one Parliament live in total isolation from one another. It would help if we even had one common watering hole. I have that, I suppose, in the airport departure lounges at Glasgow. I can hear from MPs what they have been lobbied about and what pressures they are under. Equally, it sometimes comes as a surprise to them to realise what our attitudes are about matters. It would be ideal if we could enmesh both Houses and get them working closely together.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para26"></a>The Committee stage of a Bill should have a more collegiate atmosphere than a confrontational one. Votes are not necessary at that stage. A Committee stage can identify the points of principle on which legitimate differences of opinion are possible and, indeed, necessary. Those will be voted on and debated fully by the whole House at Third Reading. But a great deal of the rest of the work is removing the gremlins from a piece of legislation. Any government, however well intentioned, frequently finds that the actual legislation produces results other than they had intended. As that is best done in a more collegiate atmosphere, I endorse the idea of Grand Committees.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para27"></a>The new procedures for debating the Budget and Finance Bill are an important step forward and a belated recognition of the tremendous financial expertise in this House. With the number of former Chancellors, senior Treasury Ministers and officials in the Chamber, the idea that we do not talk about Finance Bills at all is, frankly, daft. That is a long overdue reform. But again it is increasing the amount of scrutiny given to government proposals. We have an Economic Affairs Committee and there should be a presumption that we use that body rather than create another committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para28"></a>With regard to statutory instruments, from the consumers' point of view they are as much legislation as a Bill, and therefore they should be subjected to as much scrutiny. I realise that the report says that they cannot be amended. I ask why not? I suppose that a Select Committee with the power to replace an instrument,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with an instrument cast in different terms",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-09_para29"></a>
is the equivalent to allowing amendments to be tabled.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para30"></a>I need not dwell on the Starred Questions issue. That proposal has been universally welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para31"></a>I turn to the 10 p.m. finish. Some people may think that they function better after midnight. I remind noble Lords about what Charlie Parker, the jazz musician said about drugs. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"They don't make you play better, they just make you think you play better".

<a name="column_685"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 685</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The problem is that our critical faculties to perform decline after midnight. So we may think that we are doing a good job, but frankly we are not. I abide by the advice given by my late mother as regards sleep&#151;an hour before midnight is worth two after.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para33"></a>The holding of Grand Committees in September is a first-class notion. I am quite happy to come back in September for Bills too if that will help the further scrutiny of legislation. Above all, for anyone who was unconvinced by the proposals, the idea that this is only a trial for two Sessions should surely convince the doubters. Then the House will have a chance to re-approve the whole situation.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para34"></a>As I mentioned, not everything that I wanted is in the Bill. That applies to quite a few other people. There will also be many proposals that Peers do not want. But there can be few Peers who would not recognise that the effect of the package, taken as a whole, will be to improve our procedures and our efficiency in scrutinising legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-09_para35"></a>In closing, I ask your Lordships to remember the words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham, when he said, "We are dealing with improvement, not perfection". I think that this package gives us an improvement. We should support it today.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dean of Harptree: </B>   My Lords, I welcome four of the recommendations in the report: first, the proposal to enable the knowledge and experience of finance in your Lordships' House to be used more effectively; secondly, the proposal for the new Select Committee to examine the merits of statutory instruments where we are clearly defective at the present moment; thirdly, the extension of starred questions; and. fourthly, more Wednesday debates. I have no time to elaborate in the time available on those four points.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para0"></a>I now turn to some criticisms. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal is noted for his vivid phrases. He told us at the beginning of the debate that he wanted this House to have a louder bark and sharper teeth. There are at least two recommendations in this report where the bark will be muted and the teeth blunt. The first criticism is the 10 o'clock cut off point where no new items of business could be taken after that time. That is the "office hours" mentality that has infected another place and which is wholly inappropriate to us. On occasion, the only effective weapon that the Opposition of the day have is talk. They must use powerful arguments and many voices to try to persuade the Government of the day that they are wrong and, if that fails, to try to defeat the Government. A 10 o'clock cut-off point would make it easier for the Government of the day and more difficult for the Opposition&#151;not provide a louder bark or sharper teeth.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para1"></a>My second criticism is of the carry-over of Bills from one Session to the next. That is a dangerous process on which to embark. The report says that that will apply <P>


<a name="column_686"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 686</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>only to Bills that have received pre-legislative scrutiny. But once that principle is conceded, the pass will have been sold and it will be but an easy step to extend it to all Bills. One of the fundamental facts of parliamentary life is that if the Government of the day cannot persuade both Houses of Parliament to pass their Bills by the end of the Session, they fall. That is a powerful discipline on any Government. It should make them think twice before they introduce too many Bills. Remove that discipline and more Bills will be brought forward. I think that most noble Lords would agree that we need fewer and better Bills.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para2"></a>So as well as making life easier for the Government, carry-over would deprive the Opposition of the day of one of their most powerful weapons. What about the implications for the Parliament Acts? That will take us into difficult and controversial territory. It will be handed to the Procedure Committee to advise us. That is difficult country, and I should hate to see us embarking on it. Good government needs a stronger, not a weaker Parliament. Again, as the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House said, we need a louder bark and sharper teeth.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para3"></a>I am sorry to be so critical of the report produced by noble Lords from all parts of the House who are highly respected in all parts of the House&#151;I hope that I can say that without appearing patronising&#151;including my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, the leader of the Conservative Party. I hope that he will still talk to me after this debate. But on occasions&#151;not too often, I hope&#151;the time comes when some of us on the Back Benches feel impelled to speak out. For me, this is such a time.

<A NAME="20521-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I have sat through the whole of the debate getting more and more depressed. Indeed, I was in a black mood until my noble friend Lady Gould of Potternewton spoke and told us what she believed was the average age of your Lordships' House&#151;72. That cheered me up enormously because it would have meant that I am still one of the younger Peers. However, I have since been informed that she got her facts slightly wrong and that the average age is 67, so I am no longer one of the younger Peers. I therefore revert to my gloom.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para4"></a>Anyone who has been a member of your Lordships' House for as long as I have&#151;many Peers have been here longer&#151;is aware of what I have called in my notes the slow pace of change. The correct expression is the zero pace of change. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, gave the game away rather beautifully when he said that we have had these ways of proceeding for hundreds of years and do not need any changes; we are perfectly all right. I am surprised at that.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para5"></a>I suppose that if the noble Lord had been around&#151;as he is an hereditary Peer, perhaps his father was around&#151;when that great man, Harold Macmillan, introduced the Life Peerages Act 1958, he would have said, "What? We do not need any life Peers; we are perfectly happy with hereditary Peers. What? A <P>


<a name="column_687"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 687</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Conservative Prime Minister is going to let lady Peers into the House? We have done perfectly well with men who have beards and wear silk hats". Incidentally, that demonstrates that if we want a revolutionary change, we should always choose a Conservative to do it. I imagine that when Macmillan also said that Peers who inherit through the female line could join the House, our predecessors had apoplexy.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para6"></a>The fact is that there are Peers who simply do not want any change. Some of my noble friends referred to the debate that I introduced on the subject. If I remember rightly, every single Peer who spoke proposed changes. No one said that it was all OK. One would have thought&#151;and here I follow the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, who also gave the game away&#151;that the Procedure Committee on which he is so keen would have met and said, "Well, there has been this debate in your Lordships' House in which everyone said that they wanted things to move forward. We are called the Procedure Committee, which means that we ought to give some thought to that and do something". I must tell noble Lords that at no point did any member of the Procedure Committee come to me to say, "I hear that you introduced this debate. How should we proceed?"
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para7"></a>The point is that to go down the route of the Procedure Committee is again to go down the road of no change. The great benefit of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Denham, which I hope that he will press to a vote, is that it will divide the House between those of us who want to move forward on the basis of rational change and those who want no change whatever. My noble and learned friend the Leader of the House has been far too generous. He is the Leader of the House, the Lord Privy Seal. In my judgment, despite some personal remarks that have been made about him, he carries great authority. I am staggered that instead of saying, "Do it!", he is merely saying, "Take note and let us give it to this ridiculous committee".
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para8"></a>I can hardly find any language in which to respond to the absurd notion that, after all these years&#151;I have been here 15 years&#151;we are steaming ahead by telling the committee that it might come back to us by 8th July. One knows why the Conservative Party is called the Conservative Party and why it is in the mess that it is if it thinks that this place is steaming ahead in some way or other.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para9"></a>We all have views on what changes we would like and what are our priorities. As your Lordships know, I could detain your Lordships for a long time with various ideas, but I hasten to add that I have no intention of doing so. Instead, my general position is that this is a remarkable report both because of its unanimity and because of its reasonable content. As I said, it provides nowhere near all that I would want, but I shall certainly vote in favour of it. In particular, it takes us towards our ultimate function&#151;which, I am convinced, is to be a dispassionate, genuine scrutinising Chamber based on a combination of <P>


<a name="column_688"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 688</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expertise, experience and good judgment. In my view, that is what the report will lead us towards and that is where our future lies.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para10"></a>One aspect of the report, however, amazes me. We have been told that the report is balanced between the various interests in your Lordships' House. I find that difficult to accept. There is a bias in the report, and it is a bias entirely in favour of the Opposition and against the Government. Indeed, I am amazed that my noble friend the Chief Whip, on being told of the contents of the report, did not simply storm in to my noble and learned friend and say, "You have got to be joking! You have simply made my job completely impossible."

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, how does my noble friend know that I did not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, the idea that the report makes life easier for the Government is incredible. The 10 o'clock finishing time means that the Government have to accept more amendments to get their business through. They must respond in an entirely reasonable way when confronted with reasonable arguments from the other side. My noble friend the Chief Whip cannot threaten those of us&#151;including, I regret to say, me&#151;who occasionally make trouble for the Government by saying, "You make any more trouble and I will keep you here all night". He will have to find more days on which we can all make trouble. I cannot see where noble Lords have got the idea that it is a way of strengthening the Government and weakening the Opposition.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para11"></a>I have one last comment to make. I hope that it is a correct interpretation of the substantive Motion to say that the Procedure Committee is not being asked to respond on substance. I interpret the Motion as asking the Procedure Committee to respond on the practicalities of anything in the report that looks good but, on reflection, poses difficulties. It is not part of the Procedure Committee's remit to come up with changes that differ totally from what is in the report. I would regard that&#151;to echo the remarks of, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Denham&#151;as the equivalent of a wrecking amendment. We all know the House's view of wrecking amendments.
<P>

<a name="20521-10_para12"></a>I shall give the House a purely hypothetical example of something that is within the committee's remit. I would not necessarily advocate this, but it is an example of what it can do. If the committee were to suggest that we should have prayers 10 minutes before the half-hour so that Questions could start on the half-hour, that would be a sensible, mechanical change that it might put forward in order to make better use of your Lordships' time. If, however, it suggested that, rather than 10 o'clock, the cut-off time should be 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock, I would regard that as a wrecking amendment that we should reject.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, might it be possible for somebody on the Government Benches to tell us what is right here? The noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, have both alleged that my noble friend's amendment is a wrecking amendment. That is a serious charge, but it could easily be answered. We are being asked by the Government Front Bench to tell the Procedure Committee that it cannot change anything.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend the Leader of the House will have the chance to reply and can tell us what he thinks.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para0"></a>I believe that it is a wrecking amendment on two bases. One is that the record of the Procedure Committee is one of doing nothing. Saying that it should be given more opportunities to do nothing is a way of wrecking the proposals. Secondly, giving it any chance of saying that it wants things changed in a major way is another way of doing nothing. Speaking for myself, I do not want it to have that chance. I have watched the committee do nothing for 15 years; I do not want to give it more than a few weeks to do nothing again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Lucas is right. We must nail this matter. Several noble Lords have accused my noble friend Lord Denham of putting down a wrecking amendment. It is not. His amendment removes the obligation on the Procedure Committee to report back by 8th July. That is a minor amendment. It is not a serious issue. It does not really matter whether the Procedure Committee reports by 8th July, 18th July or in September. The changes will not take effect until the new Session.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para1"></a>My second point is more important. There is the idea that the Motion obliges the Procedure Committee to report back on every aspect. It must be up to the Procedure Committee to decide what it brings forward and what it does not. The example given by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, was a good one. If the Procedure Committee recommends that the cut-off time should be midnight, that is what will come back to the House. It is then up to the House to decide whether to accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, suggesting that any points in the report with which the Procedure Committee disagrees fundamentally will not come back to the House for us to decide on?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, what did the noble Baroness think that the Procedure Committee was for? It is entirely right that that should happen if the committee decides that it should. Such are the powers <P>


<a name="column_690"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>that the House has given to the Procedure Committee. Nothing in the Motion or the amendment changes that position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I hate to come back once more. It is within our rules. The noble Lord is giving the game away. There is a distinction between change and no change. He wants the existing state of affairs to continue; some of us do not. It is as simple as that.

<A NAME="20521-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, it seems that, after that little interlude, the clock is about to start on my contribution.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para2"></a>This debate is of interest to all Members of the House and probably no one outside it. We are discussing the seemingly mundane, day-to-day operation of the parliamentary business of the House. With over 30 names on the speaking list and given the tradition that we must all be present to hear most, if not all, of the other speakers, it will be a long debate. Much has already been said, and there is little to add. I like and support some&#151;but not all&#151;of the recommendations. The way in which they are offered as a package is not to my taste; I would prefer to pick and mix. However, I understand that I do not have that choice. So, on the whole, I support the proposals.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para3"></a>The proposal for pre-legislative scrutiny is good, but I do not like the idea of allowing government Bills to extend over two parliamentary Sessions. I thought that my noble friend Lord Dean of Harptree made the point clearly that it would not be an improvement, only a convenience for the government of the day. It is a healthy thing for the government to be under pressure to get on with legislation within a parliament. Scrutiny of statutory instruments is not enough; it must be possible to amend them. The present situation&#151;all or nothing&#151;allows unsatisfactory statutory instruments to be passed.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para4"></a>I would like to see more topical Questions each week. Sometimes, a Question must be tabled so far ahead that it is out of date by the time that its turn comes. In any review of Questions, consideration should be given to allowing each Peer to have two topical Questions per term&#151;meaning between recesses&#151;rather than per parliament. I refer to the Questions selected by ballot.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para5"></a>Remembering late and all-night sittings, I am sure that the 10 o'clock finishing time would give us a more alert House. I favour that recommendation. I am a keen supporter of committees being Committees of the Whole House and believe that it is a hugely better system for considering the detail of Bills than exists in the other place. If we are to have Grand Committees, it is essential that they take place on the Principal Floor of the House rather than being tucked away upstairs. They must be open to all Members of the House, and I am pleased that the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House confirmed that they would.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para6"></a>I have a preference for sitting on Thursday morning and ending earlier, but I would hate to sit in September, and I am sorry to see that it has been <P>


<a name="column_691"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 691</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggested. For an Antipodean, it means either insufficient time to visit family down under if the recess is allocated in little bits through the year, or catching the wintertime in Australia if the recess is in July. That is a personal point and is unlikely to interest the House. More likely to appeal is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, that the recess is better when it does not match the dates of school holidays. Places are less crowded, and accommodation is easier to find and less costly.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para7"></a>The code of conduct, under the heading "Primacy of the public interest", says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Members of the House shall resolve any conflict between their personal interest and the public interest in favour of the public interest".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-11_para8"></a>
I must forget my wish to enjoy the Australian sunshine. However, it is in the public interest for Peers to have a relaxed holiday, as that respite enables them to do their work better when the House is sitting.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para9"></a>It adds insult to my September injury to say that Grand Committees may sit in September whether the House is sitting or not. Paragraph 29 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In practice the number of members involved will be comparatively small".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-11_para10"></a>
That is exactly the opposite of my view that the full House should be involved in committees. I know that the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House confirmed that the committees would be open to all Members, but that seems to conflict with the statement that, in practice, small numbers would be involved. I ask that particularly because in March your Lordships introduced a code of conduct for Members which stated that they should observe the seven general principles of conduct identified by the Committee on Standards in Public Life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. This is surely a time for those to apply.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para11"></a>Since I entered the House in 1981 I have often felt that there should be greater transparency. I appreciate that in party terms the usual channels are important and on the whole work well, but Members should receive honest, open answers to questions and have information available on how things work.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para12"></a>It took me almost 12 years to obtain a desk in the House. During that time I told my Chief Whip of a number of desks that I discovered were not in use. Each time I received the reply, "Thank you for telling me, I have someone else I shall give that to". No hope was ever held out of a desk coming my way.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para13"></a>I know that I was unpopular with the Chief Whip because when the toilet facilities became desperately short for the growing number of women Peers, I was asked to appear before the Offices Committee to fight for and win the battle to have a second loo allocated for our use. Unfortunately the very toilet Black Rod had decided would be ideal to convert for the ladies was the favourite of the then Chief Whip. When I went to see him to plead on the matter, his response was, "You women want everything. You want to take over this place!" If your Lordships look around you will see that that has not happened yet.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para14"></a>I shall never know why I waited so long for a desk, but it was a strange coincidence that in the first week of the new Chief Whip's appointment, I was called in to hear the long-awaited words, "I thought you might like a desk". Perhaps we have sufficient office space now and it is no longer an issue, but it would be better for noble Lords to know where they stand on any waiting list for House facilities. Everyone appreciates that there have to be priority cases, and provision could be made for them, but it would be encouraging to see one's place on a list and some sign of upward movement over the years. A degree of openness in those minor matters would be helpful and should be simple.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para15"></a>The procedures of the Committee of Selection are wrapped in mystery still, as I discovered when I put a Question recently in this Chamber to the Chairman of Committees. At an earlier date I had asked him who had the right to decide on how and when committee members should be changed and he said that he did. My view, expressed to him, was that people had a right to understand those procedures. His reply was that he was in the same position as the Prime Minister and had full power to make decisions. It was confirmed by the Clerk of the Parliaments, who added that noble Lords have never questioned those matters. Why not? It would be healthy if they did.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para16"></a>Whatever its outcome, I welcome the openness and inclusiveness of this debate on our working practices. I hope that we will benefit from wise procedural changes in accordance with the seven general principles of conduct and not find ourselves swept along to suit administrative convenience. If there is a vote, I shall support the original Motion.

<A NAME="20521-11_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, will be interested to know that on both occasions when I was admitted to this House I had to wait 18 months for a desk. Perhaps I behaved myself slightly better.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para17"></a>I am another Member from the periphery who applauds many of the report's recommendations. As someone who commutes to the House from central Scotland and stays overnight in the Farmers Club when necessary, I welcome the proposals for an end to business at 7 p.m. on Thursdays and the 10 p.m. rise of the House on other days. The Thursday 7 p.m. rise would allow the use of the last flights to central Scotland at 8.40 p.m. and 9 p.m., and hence the opportunity to be compos mentis the next day. The proposed 10 p.m. rise is reasonable at least for the Anglo-Scottish sleepers which leave Euston at 11.55 p.m. There would be no need to leave early before business was completed, as I have often had to do in the past.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para18"></a>It is reasonable to enable noble Lords from the peripheral areas, not only Scotland, to take a full part in the House's work and to recognise that they have other things to do in their home areas, including maintaining some connection with a career. Contributions in the House are made more worthwhile <P>


<a name="column_693"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 693</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>according to the Member's active outside interests in his or her home area. The House must accept that it is not possible to attend regularly and have a job unless it is in south-east England.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para19"></a>That said, I am pleased that pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills is recommended. That practice has been introduced successfully in the Scottish Parliament, where it is carried out before the equivalent of Second Reading. The merit is that Members can become well acquainted with the Bill's practicalities and engage fully with the legislation through its later stages.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para20"></a>I have long believed that the House goes about its scrutiny in an odd way, trying to alter Bills before gaining a good grasp of the central purpose. Current practice may have been suitable in the past when Bills were shorter and may have had only one central principle, but that is no longer the nature of most legislation. Many Bills have multiple purposes and many principles. The House will gather that I am in favour of a Select Committee inquiry style for pre-legislative scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para21"></a>On the subject of incorporating newcomers, I pay tribute to the Liberal Democrats Whip Office for showing me how and encouraging me in 1994 to take part in the somewhat unfathomable procedures of this House. I have long likened the process to a swimming pool: it is the deep end but they want you to learn how to swim. More needs to be done to enable newcomers to learn the ways of this House and for former Members of another place to convert to them.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para22"></a>I turn to the Grand Committee rooms. Despite all that is said of the Moses Room&#151;and yes, it needs to be improved&#151;at least there one has a desk to keep the Bill, Marshalled List, groupings, Explanatory Notes and one's speaking notes in order. I hope that other noble Lords will support the changes and that this House will move on from being an "afternoon tea" Parliament organised for those who live or work in the London area to one which values all its Members and their constituent parts of the United Kingdom.

<A NAME="20521-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, on the question of working on Thursdays I am reminded of an apocryphal story told by the noble Lord, Lord Scanlon. A shop steward reported to a mass meeting on what he described as the greatest agreement on working time reduction ever made. He negotiated a one-day week working on Thursdays. He then paused and asked for any questions. A hand went up: "Surely you don't mean we work every Thursday."
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para23"></a>I strongly support the main thrust of the report. It is a package deal which we should accept. I will concentrate on the section on statutory instruments in paragraphs 16 and 17. The principal recommendation is a Lords Select Committee to establish the merits of every statutory instrument subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I am member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. It had already occurred to me that there would need to be a good deal of flesh put on the bones of this particular proposal. Perhaps I may mention some of the considerations.
<P>


<a name="column_694"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 694</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para24"></a>At its meeting last week, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments&#151;I mentioned this point to the Leader of the House&#151;decided to write to the Leader of the Commons on the points that arose before the other place relating to this recommendation. The letter indicates that the Joint Committee would wish to establish good relations with any committee established for the purpose to ensure that the respective roles were complementary. But it was apparent that this could not be done in the absence of any certainty on the future shape of scrutiny of delegated legislation in the House of Commons. It was noted that our intention in this place would be to bring in the necessary Standing Orders by the beginning of next Session. I suggest that the time-scale for that may need to be in two bites: an agreement in principle, and possibly joint consideration about how we finalise the detail.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para25"></a>That raises some interesting points about the role of Joint Committees generally&#151;which might be described as a mild form of unicameralism, as well as providing flexibility for the two Houses to carry out work in different, but complementary, ways, having regard, however, to the fact that both horses eventually have to cross the same finishing line.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para26"></a>Among the issues discussed by the Joint Committee is the idea of periodically reviewing a group of generic instruments. I use the word "generic" to mean issues arising out of a particular field&#151;for example, agriculture or transport. So it is not merely a question of examining a particular statutory instrument before it comes into effect, but also of reviewing some of the experiences. Criteria for the consideration of those experiences could include how far the instruments are comprehensible not only to those who have to operate them, but also to those affected by them.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para27"></a>A different question arises as to whether there may be an overlap between the vires of a measure and the terms of its transposition.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para28"></a>Then there is the question of who will carry out all this work. I was interested in the point made by my noble friend Lord Sheldon. Perhaps I may make a parallel point. If Members of this House are to be elected, an issue will arise as to who will do the donkey work and who will be watching the television set in terms of receiving public recognition for the job that they do. That requires some thought.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para29"></a>Finally, if we stop the clock on a particular statutory instrument, how will that affect Civil Service planning dealing with expenditure on all the likely implementations of the statutory instruments? Will civil servants be told in good time to "stop the clock"? There is a wide range of territory where we could be stopping the clock.
<P>

<a name="20521-11_para30"></a>Those are some of the questions that arise from the proposals.

<a name="20521-12_para1"></a>
That is my principal motivation for being here.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para2"></a>It seems to me that there is an enormous consensus in favour of pre-legislative hearings. That is basic good practice. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, said that pre-legislative scrutiny is working well in the Scottish Parliament, and there is probably unanimity across the House that that would be a major advance.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para3"></a>However, there does not seem to be any linkage in legislative terms between the introduction of pre- legislative scrutiny and a trade-off. The House may have to agree to a hold-over. The two considerations are entirely separate. One is a matter of trying to improve the nature of legislation; the other is the length of time that it takes a Bill to complete its passage in this House. It is one of the pressures of Opposition to force the government of the day, who may ill-advisedly have chosen to introduce far too many major Bills, to choose which one to drop. But if all the Bills have received a pre-legislative hearing, they will all get through, and the pressure that the Opposition can apply will have been mitigated.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para4"></a>Parliament needs to go so far as to say to itself that the real problem is that no government have ever agreed to contain the number of major and minor Bills that they will bring forward in a Session. That should be attainable. It would not be for Parliament to determine the nature of those Bills, but the number of Bills should be agreed by all parties. Until that happens, the capacity of Parliament to legislate will remain constant, and there will always be a logjam. If agreement on pre-legislative hearings leads to an automatic carry-over, I for one shall not join that particular army of supporters.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para5"></a>I listened with great interest to the noble Lord who has just spoken, who is a member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which I had the privilege to chair many years ago. It is an invaluable <P>


<a name="column_696"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 696</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committee. Your Lordships may need reminding that some 4,000 statutory instruments go through in any one year. That is a huge number. The concept of a new committee of this House helping out is laudable and would represent progress, but it is not a gigantic leap forward. We as parliamentarians, must find a way of making sure that, first, we understand the contents of those statutory instruments and, secondly&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Lea, was absolutely right&#151;having understood them, and having found some wanting in terms of time, content or impact, Parliament must have the ability to control those elements. At present, although the Royal Commission made it clear that there should be change and that we should have the ability to amend statutory instruments, until such time as we have such an ability, these proposals are laudable but are only a tiny step forward. I hope that the knowledge of the noble Lord who is a member of the Joint Committee will be used when the Procedure Committee takes its further hurried evidence before 8th July.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para6"></a>On the question of September Sittings, such a proposal is highly questionable unless they take place towards the end of September. It seems to me quite wrong that everyone in the United Kingdom should have to take their vacation in August. That should be resisted.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para7"></a>In conclusion, perhaps I may put two questions to the Lord Privy Seal. He said in his opening remarks that the report is a package of measures. My first question is: will it come back from the Procedure Committee as a package of measures? If it does, that will be a major problem. If it comes back as a series of four or five recommendations, I believe that this House will want to vote on them. If only four get through, with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that will be progress.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para8"></a>Secondly&#151;the noble and learned Lord may be intending to refer to this point in his reply&#151;why is 8th July so precious? It is difficult to understand why that particular date is so precious as opposed to a date at the end of July or in September. I can understand why it is necessary for the Procedure Committee to present its proposals before the start of the new Session, but I am mystified as to why it must be by 8th July, unless the House is rising on 10th July.

<A NAME="20521-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, many of us want to express our gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Denham, for tabling his amendment&#151;for which I shall certainly vote. An admirable guardian of the conventions of your Lordships' House, the noble Lord spotted that the original Motion was out of order&#151;so much so that an uncharitably disposed person might even imagine that the leaders of the parties were trying to sneak through this House changes in working practices, the effects of some of which almost amount to constitutional change.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para9"></a>I well understand why the Leader of the House and the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, signed the report. Many of its recommendations would help <P>


<a name="column_697"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 697</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Government to push their legislation through Parliament, whatever they say. I cannot understand why anyone else signed. Perhaps the other party leaders were happily anticipating the day when they would be in government and wanting to push through legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para10"></a>I am hard pushed to find anything good to say about the report. I start with paragraph 4, concerning the trial period. We have all heard that one before. It reminds me of a nightmarish double roundabout at Barnton in Edinburgh, which was introduced about 25 years ago on an "experimental basis" and was one of the most difficult and dangerous hazards for a driver to negotiate that I have ever encountered. That experiment lasted about 20 years before minimal alterations were made, so I have little faith in trial periods ever coming to an end.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para11"></a>Pre-legislative scrutiny seems to be the flavour of the decade. It is used in the Scottish Parliament&#151;where, disastrously, it is deemed a fit substitute for a second Chamber. If the Government were not trying to produce more Bills than they have time to think through&#151;and the parliamentary draftsmen had time to draft properly&#151;pre-legislative scrutiny would be unnecessary. I have many misgivings. Not least is my dark suspicion that the next step might be the abolition of one of the latter stages of Bills hitherto taken by the whole House, not by a committee sitting in some upstairs room in the mornings.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para12"></a>Of all the report's thoroughly undesirable recommendations, the carry-over of Bills is much the worse. It is a blatant attempt to neutralise&#151;I would almost say, sterilise&#151;the Opposition. The noble Lord, Lord Dean of Harptree, expressed concern that carry-over would affect the operation of the Parliament Act&#151;which gives rise to constitutional implications.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para13"></a>I do not approve of Bills being committed to Grand Committees unless they can divide on amendments. I am horrified at the suggestion that the House or Grand Committees should sit in September and that Grand Committees should sit when the House is not sitting&#151;which virtually negates the right of any Peer to sit on a Grand Committee. As to either the House or committees sitting in September, I wonder what consultations took place with Black Rod or the superintendent of the Refreshment Department. It is curious that the report's signatories appear to have forgotten completely repairs and maintenance work on this palace&#151;for which it is absolutely necessary to have at least two clear months in August and September. Extra weeks at Christmas and Easter are no use at all. For serious structural work, it is necessary to have a long, unbroken period at a time when tradesmen are not on holiday. Scant thought appears to have been given to the security staff, catering staff, Doorkeepers and Clerks whose holidays would be affected. We all know how willingly they return for emergency debates, such as that following September 11 and the tributes to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother&#151;but that is no excuse for them to be imposed upon.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para14"></a>My list of unacceptable proposals includes sitting at 11 a.m. on Thursday. One reason that the House cannot sit in the mornings is that many Peers still have to earn their livings&#151;which they try to do in the mornings, coming here when they can get away from work. Attending morning sittings on Thursdays would not be possible for them. As one who lives in the north of Scotland, the latest that it is possible for me to leave the House and return home the same night is 6 o'clock&#151;and then I do not get home until after 11 p.m. If the House were to sit at 9 o'clock and rise by 4 p.m., that would be more helpful for getting home that night for those of us who live far away. Most of us just leave early unless we are involved with the business of the day. I think that is a better way. Morning sittings should wait until the House consists entirely of paid Members.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para15"></a>I could live with most of the other proposals reasonably happily and I agree with one&#151;the recommendation that the shortcomings of the Moses Room should be corrected. The acoustics are deplorable and the cold in winter can be such that, on one occasion, I had to leave a meeting to put on my overcoat. Proper heating would be welcome. That should be provided in any event, not be dependent on the implementation of the rest of the proposals.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para16"></a>There is one simple solution to the problems that the report's recommendations are intended to solve&#151;less legislation. Give the poor people of this country a break from endless new laws and regulations to fall foul of&#151;some unenforceable&#151;and from endless changes in the way that the health service, education and local government are run and justice is administered, which drive those responsible for implementing them dotty. Only the lawyers will weep. Then there might be time for the necessary scrutiny of the rules and regulations that pour out of Brussels, which must be properly examined. It would help if another place did its job better, by discussing all amendments to Bills as we do&#151;instead of wasting time on points of order&#151;and getting rid of the guillotine.

<A NAME="20521-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, that we need a common watering hole&#151;something about which I have spoken often to Chief Whips, Leaders of the House and others. Nothing has come of it yet. How can we seriously operate as a Parliament? I have been here 10 years and have yet to meet an MP socially. There is nowhere that I can run into Members of another place, unless I encounter them on business occasionally. I have no rights to go where MPs have a drink and they have no rights here. We cannot even meet to eat. It is ridiculous and something that we should address as a matter of urgency. I am delighted to enjoy support in all parts of the House and wish that there could be the same support from members of the Front Benches.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para17"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes that we need to consider the way that committee members are selected. We are giving significant new powers to those who select committees. <P>


<a name="column_699"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 699</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is to that extent natural for members of the Front Benches to think that they should choose. The time is coming for moving in the same direction as another place, by giving Back-Benchers a say in who gets on to committees. If we go down the road proposed, Members of the Front Benches will have the power to exclude the likes of myself and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, on the ground that we might disagree with Front Bench policy. That would be entirely undesirable, especially in respect of the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para18"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that this is a good report. I am delighted that the Leader of the House has produced, with typical energy and direction, something that for a long time our own procedures have failed to produce. It would have been nice if this had been done gradually over the past 20 years, but that has not happened.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para19"></a>I stand on my dignity as a Back-Bencher and say that this report is not an order to us but a request to us. It is for this House as a whole to consider. The report is very well put together, and I can see the arguments for treating it as a package. However, it is our privilege to decide whether to treat it as a package. There is nothing that this group, however august, can do to instruct us on what our procedures should be.
<P>

<a name="20521-12_para20"></a>I was disturbed by the brief discussion that I had with the noble Lord, Lord Peston, on the implications of the Lord Privy Seal's Motion. If the effect is to tell the Procedure Committee that it cannot consider substantive changes to the report and must implement it as it is, I would be very concerned. The report has been produced by Front-Benchers, but there are many Back-Bench aspects that should properly be taken into account.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I am not for one moment suggesting that, at some point&#151;I hope sooner rather than later&#151;noble Lords who so wish will not be able to move that this or that recommendation should be deleted. I entirely agree with the noble Lord that your Lordships will decide the matter. We may differ on what we may like to delete, but we do not differ on that. I have no doubt at all that this Chamber is sovereign.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that we agree on that. The authorities of the House should therefore take note that, if the report comes back in its current form, I shall have half a dozen to a dozen amendments to table to it. We should also ensure that we can debate the report in a sensible manner, committee style, rather than having to take all the amendments at the end of the debate. I am sure that the authorities of the House can find a sensible way of dealing with the matter if the report's rough edges are left unsmoothed.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para0"></a>The first specific proposal I shall deal with is pre-legislative scrutiny, a concept of which I thoroughly approve. The report, however, does not define pre-legislative scrutiny. On a previous occasion, the Government published a Bill which we had one month to consider. Two weeks later, they published the final Bill. That was considered pre-legislative scrutiny. <P>


<a name="column_700"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 700</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Does such a process justify carrying a Bill over to the next Session? We must have some rules on what constitutes proper pre-legislative scrutiny. In some cases with which I am familiar, the effect of pre-legislative scrutiny has been to fossilise Bills, making it much harder to amend legislation as it is considered by the House. There are so many conversations and deals with outside parties, and so much is agreed between civil servants and various pressure groups, that it becomes extremely difficult to make even small changes to legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para1"></a>It is very important that Back-Benchers who wish to be involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny process have the chance to do so. Under the proposals, it is possible that pre-legislative scrutiny will be done entirely by another place. However, if it is done by this place, those who take part in the process will be chosen by the Front-Benchers. As my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes said, that would be neither sensible nor acceptable.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para2"></a>We already effectively form ourselves into groupings in committees, which are composed of noble Lords who wish to participate and the Front-Benchers' choice of who should participate. We need a similar arrangement for the creation of such committees for pre-legislative scrutiny. Participation in the committees should be open to the whole House. If it is not so open, Back-Benchers may find themselves excluded entirely from the opportunity to influence the legislative detail, as everything may have been decided by those chosen by Front-Benchers at the pre-legislative stage.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para3"></a>As my noble friend Lord Dean of Harptree said, we need to consider details such as the interface with the Parliament Acts. Currently, those Acts seem to allow the Government to choose whether to use those powers when we have either taken more than one month to send carry-over legislation back to the other place or failed to do so by the end of the Session. We have to consider such details, and I would welcome it if we could get them right.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para4"></a>It is important that Back-Benchers should have a say on who is appointed to the committee that will consider the Finance Bill as it is going through another place. It does not seem right that Front-Benchers should choose the membership. If a Back-Bencher truly wishes to participate on the committee, why should he not be able to do so? Such a committee would surely not suffer from having one or two more members. It seems undesirable to put the matter within the gift of the Front-Benchers.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para5"></a>Front-Benchers would also exercise control under the proposals for a statutory instruments select committee. They would appoint that committee, which would be this House's only instrument to amend statutory instruments. If I as a Back-Bencher objected to a statutory instrument, I would not have the power to amend it; only the committee could do that. That might be a reasonable arrangement, but it would not be reasonable for the committee to be chosen exclusively by the Front-Benchers. The committee membership must be within the gift of the Back-Benchers. As I said, for very good reason, the other <P>


<a name="column_701"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 701</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>place is moving in that direction. If we accept the proposals, we shall be creating three more extremely powerful, very influential and very important committees that will make decisions that are crucial to the lives and effectiveness of Back-Benchers. Consequently, we Back-Benchers should have at least some say on who sits on the committees. Perhaps we should also be able to talk to the committees and influence their decisions, particularly in relation to statutory instruments. It would be ridiculous if I had no way of asking the statutory instruments committee to amend a statutory instrument about which I had specific knowledge.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para6"></a>If we are to have an amendment process, which I presume will be judiciously used, surely it should be a public process that takes place on the Floor of the House and not locked away in a committee. The committees would not have access to the specialist expertise of other noble Lords, but would consist of those chosen to sacrifice a very large part of their lives to look through an endless succession of statutory instruments. I think that the Procedure Committee should consider that point. If it does not, we shall certainly consider it when we again consider the report.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para7"></a>As for a 10 o'clock cut-off, I think that that should be a matter for the House as a whole to decide. I would favour an 11 o'clock cut-off. I think that if one is here for the night, one is here for the night, and there is nothing much that one can do at 10 o'clock except go home to bed. I do not know why I should be forced to sit up and watch television for an hour until my natural time for going to sleep. It should be a matter for the House. If one is down here from Scotland, one is down here from Scotland. Why should one have to spend more days coming down here from Scotland when one could sit through to 11 o'clock? We should be allowed a voice on such issues, which I do not think are crucial to the proposals. Moreover, if one had dinner from 7.30 to 8.30, there would be only an hour and a half of debate remaining, which is scarcely enough time to get into a good argument. One would have time to deal with only one or two groups of amendments, if they were at all serious. An additional hour would allow us to have a decent session in which momentum could be built up and a fair amount of business could be dealt with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, surely there are other things in life than sitting here in a debate after 10 o'clock or going to bed.

which I take again to be the Front-Benchers. There must be some way in which Back-Benchers can have a say in the matter. If we are dealing with an education issue, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and I should have some say in it. The decision should not be dictated solely by the fact that the Front-Benchers are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>night-owls or want to go home at 6 p.m. It should be a matter for noble Lords who wish to participate and not for the Front-Benchers.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para10"></a>The paragraph which I assume should be numbered 30 mentions nine specific suggestions by my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford. I cannot find those suggestions. I do not know where they are. They do not seem to be in the Printed Paper Office or in the Whips' Office. Perhaps I could have looked more extensively, but it seems that we are being asked to approve proposals that have not been included in the report and to which we have no access. Unless I have simply overlooked the suggestions, I do not think that our approval of the Motion can be taken as approval of those suggestions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Grenfell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for giving way. Perhaps I can enlighten him. The proposals were made by his noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford during the debate about a second chamber for the European Parliament.

We should look at the issue in its full form, and not merely by way of a footnote, which I cannot read.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I wish to make a brief contribution to the debate. It is clear that the report deserves serious reflection, and having reflected and listened to the debate, I believe that the report goes largely in the right direction. I am therefore 95 per cent in favour of the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para11"></a>However, at a time when we know that the composition of the House will be considered by a Joint Select Committee of both Houses, I believe that it would be wrong to change working practices on the basis that we have, or can have in the immediate future, full-time working Peers who are able to switch between morning and evening working. That is the assumption lying behind the decision to recommend that the House should sit at 11 a.m. and rise at 7 p.m. on Thursdays. I firmly believe, despite discussions with the Leader of the House, whom I thank for his courtesy, that this is the thin end of the wedge and will lead to morning sittings as a regular occurrence.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para12"></a>I and many other colleagues would find morning sittings even on one day a week a major problem. As an opposition Front-Bencher, it would be virtually impossible for me to fulfil my professional and political commitments if we sat on Thursday mornings. I only undertook my professional <P>


<a name="column_703"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 703</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commitments in the first place knowing that they were compatible with membership of the House. I do not believe that morning working is a reasonable expectation until we are an elected and remunerated House. I recognise that that proposal may suit the interests of those who live out of town, but catering for those interests means that we are moving towards a three-day week when we may only in reality call the Government to account on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, aptly described from his long experience the way in which the process has gone down a rather slippery slope. He emphasised that we should not ape another place. Indeed, we should recognise the impossibility of doing so, given the current make-up of this House.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para14"></a>The Leader of the House stressed the package aspect of the proposals. They stand or fall together. But the package has to be right in the first place. I hope that it will be a package in due course that can be backed by the majority of the House. I hope that the Leader of the House will therefore reconsider whether the Thursday morning working suggestion should really be part of the core package. The Leader of the House in the other place, Robin Cook, had to agree to delete elements of his original package. If the Leader in the other place, with its huge majority had to agree to that, why cannot we do that here, where the Government do not have a majority?
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para15"></a>My opposition to Thursday morning sittings is not just born out of my own circumstances and, I suspect, those of many other colleagues. It comes from considering whether the changes will add to or subtract from our ability to hold the Government to account, as we should. I believe that the morning sitting proposal will subtract from that. It will be easier for the Government to keep house; it will assist Ministers; and it will make it more difficult for the working opposition&#151;Front and Back-Benchers&#151;to attend. We shall therefore have less effective scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para16"></a>I should like to give the report a fair wind, but I cannot do so currently. I therefore hope that the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal and the Procedure Committee will have serious thoughts in the meantime about Thursday morning working before coming back to the House.

<A NAME="20521-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I fully accept that the working practices of this House are not the subject of passionate debate in the real world outside. I do not think that the man or woman on the Clapham omnibus gives the matter a thought.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para17"></a>Nevertheless, when people do consider what we are about, I suspect that most of them think that if we sit beyond 10 or 11 at night, we are plain silly. When I was in the Commons, my local party members used to say, "If you must sit all night and are daft enough not to change the system, don't blame us because you are tired the following day". The public, whom we are here to serve, cannot believe that legislation is scrutinised <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>better because we do it at midnight. Ministers are tired by then, so they will not do better, and opposition Front-Benchers will not do better; they have to work the following morning. All in all, we do not do ourselves much credit; nor do we provide the public with better scrutiny of legislation. It is plain silly, and in our heart of hearts we must admit that.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para18"></a>Some years ago, before I was a Member of this House, I was talking to a Member of the Canadian Senate who told me that they had embarked on a study of how hard various western legislative assemblies worked. On the basis of hours worked, number of sitting days, and so on, they concluded that the hardest-working legislative assembly in the western world was the House of Commons. Given that I am talking here, there are no prizes for guessing that the second hardest-working legislative assembly was this place. I do not know whether that is still true; perhaps we work harder than the Commons now. There are not many prizes for working the hardest. It is output which counts, not the number of hours spent getting there.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para19"></a>I make no bones about the fact that I am delighted with the report. I trust the six colleagues of all parties who produced it, and I believe that they have come up with a package that will make the House more modern and more in touch with the present century, without sacrificing the effectiveness of the House. I do not believe that the proposals are aimed at benefiting the Government; they provide a balance, and in some respects will make the task of government more difficult.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para20"></a>I could join other noble Lords in unpicking the package and saying that I have this or that idea. But it is best to let the package go to the Procedure Committee in its entirety, without the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Denham, as that would simply kick it into the long grass. We can then get it back and see what happens.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para21"></a>With regard to the amendment, I cannot think of any aspect of British life outside the Palace of Westminster where we would say that we want something, give it to a group of people to take it further, and then say that there was no deadline. Would anyone in business not set a deadline? Surely any self-respecting commercial business or public body would set a deadline for the plan to take the changes that they want further.
<P>

<a name="20521-13_para22"></a>Why not do that here? Why adopt standards that we would not expect any self-respecting business outside to adopt? I do not understand that.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Denham: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me, but never before has a deadline been set for the Procedure Committee. The long grass would not be that long by the time it reported. My amendment seeks to give it the amount of time that it usually has to discuss such matters, as a courtesy. It would help to ensure that the sometimes difficult to understand recommendations are gone through carefully. Surely that is a sensible way to proceed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord is confirming my point when he says that we have never <P>


<a name="column_705"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 705</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>set deadlines before. Why not set deadlines? Why make a virtue of inefficiency and incompetence? I do not understand that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Denham: </B>   My Lords, we normally keep them. That is why we have not set them before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that we have done that for several hundred years but I suggest that the world has to move on a little. I take my cue from business outside. If business feels that there is a way of moving forward and adopting deadlines as a way of expediting business and making a profit, why cannot we, without the profit motive, also adopt similar standards of efficiency? I am not against all traditions. There are some very important traditions in this House which I would defend to the last, but I do not think that this is one of them. This is an example of a tradition, practice or procedure which is not conducive to efficiency. That is my case but the noble Lord is obviously not persuaded by it.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para0"></a>I particularly welcome the idea of pre-legislative scrutiny. I give an example to set the mind of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, at rest. When I was in the Commons I took part in one of the first Special Standing Committees. I accept that that concerned one House only and I very much believe that pre-legislative scrutiny should now concern both Houses. In that committee about 20 years ago we discussed the Criminal Attempts Bill. The Law Commission gave evidence, at the end of which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, who was then Minister of State at the Home Office, announced to the committee that in the light of the Law Commission's evidence, he proposed to withdraw one particular part of the Bill and redraft it. That was a great success. It meant that we did not have to go through all the business of probing amendments and other such measures. The Minister said that in the spirit of pre-legislative scrutiny he would withdraw a whole section of the Bill and bring it back amended. When it returned amended, it did not require much debate in Committee as we had already made the relevant point. If the proposals are given effect in that spirit&#151;I trust that that will be the case&#151;and government Ministers regard them in that light, it will be a victory for common sense. I give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Lord. He reinforces my point when he says that the Bill did not require much scrutiny in Committee; in other words, the crucial part was the pre-legislative scrutiny. That is what Back-Benchers must have access to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to go into the minutiae of how one can establish the best structure for pre-legislative scrutiny. Clearly, one cannot have half the House doing it as that would not work. However, it does not preclude subsequent debate and scrutiny by Members of the House who were not part of the pre-legislative process. I rest my case.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para1"></a>I move on quickly. Carry-over is a long overdue procedure. At the moment we battle to get things finished by the end of the spill-over period. To my <P>


<a name="column_706"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 706</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mind that does not make much sense as a way of conducting business efficiently. I believe that the changes proposed for Starred Questions, particularly topical questions, will make life much tougher for Ministers. I believe that Questions in this House are tougher for Ministers anyway than they usually are in the other place as they are longer and are subject to scrutiny. The topical questions hit Ministers very quickly indeed. In the other place I never answered Questions; I only asked them. However, having answered Questions in this House, I am convinced that it is a tough procedure. The proposed increase in the number of Starred Questions and the additional topical questions will make life tougher for Ministers but better for Back-Benchers on both sides of the House as regards subjecting Ministers to scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para2"></a>I have already said my piece about the proposed 10 p.m. finish. We are daft to think that we can do anything sensible in a political sense late at night, although we may be able to deal with other matters. As regards September sittings, if the quid pro quo is that we get longer recesses at Christmas and Easter and do not have such long summer recesses, I believe that that is a sensible way of managing things.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para3"></a>I conclude by saying that we have a responsibility to the general public to conduct our business in a sensible, efficient and businesslike manner. That way we earn the respect of the public. If we sit late at night and into the morning, the public will think that we are not serious. I believe that we are serious and that these proposals will help us to demonstrate that.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   My Lords, as a relatively new Peer I am pleased to speak in the debate. I came to your Lordships' House exactly two years and one week ago today. Therefore, I am very new in comparison with many who are speaking in the debate. However, I can say that the past two years have been among the most enjoyable of my life. Not only have I encountered friendliness, courtesy and inclusiveness, and that from all sides of the House, but I have also been able to sit in this wonderful Chamber and hear experts in all fields speak. I can sit and learn about new topics.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para4"></a>I particularly enjoy Question Time. I enjoy the repartee and the quick thinking of both those who ask the questions and those who answer them. I try to attend Question Time whenever I can. However, being new to the House, I have found some of the ways of the Chamber rather strange. I refer, first, to the timing of sittings. When I first joined the House I found it very strange indeed to commence a sitting half-way through a normal working day and continue late into the evening.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para5"></a>I add to the comments made by my noble friend Lord Dubs among others. Not many people know what this House does. I have discovered that as I have been asked about it by family and friends and, indeed, by strangers, as I was this lunchtime at a reception. I was asked what exactly the House of Lords does. When one explains what it does in detail, they are quite <P>


<a name="column_707"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 707</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>impressed by the amount of time we devote to examining legislation, as many people consider that that is mainly the job of the Commons. But when one tells them about the timing of Sittings, they think we are mad. Not only do they think we are mad, they think, as I do, that it cannot possibly be in the best interests of our legislative procedures to work as late as we sometimes do. No one can perform at their best late at night, however long such traditions have continued. We need to consider them seriously, as, indeed, the members of the working group did.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para6"></a>When I first joined the House I also found it strange to be able to table amendments which comprised almost the same wording at three different stages of a Bill. I appreciate that that wording must be slightly different but it does not take anyone who has dealt with amendments for some years long to change a few words. Therefore, we are considering almost the same amendments at three different stages of a Bill. I realise that sometimes Ministers become worn down but that does not happen regularly. The working group has considered that matter in relation to Grand Committees. I welcome that consideration.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para7"></a>When the report was published I read it eagerly and thought that it comprised a very interesting package indeed. I congratulate all those who devoted so much time to it. I am also pleased that it is proposed to implement the recommendations for a trial period. I am a great believer in trial periods. When one is changing procedures which have been in place for many years, it is a good idea to do so for a trial period after which one can review the new procedures to determine whether they are exactly right.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para8"></a>I particularly welcome the proposal to increase the number of Starred Questions and to extend the time allotted to them. As I said earlier, I enjoy Question Time. It is also an occasion on which the Government can be held to account on the part of noble Lords on all sides of the House, as, indeed, is the case. Therefore, as I say, I welcome those proposals.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para9"></a>I am afraid that I am in total opposition to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who is not present at the moment. I welcome the proposal for an earlier start and a 7 p.m. finish on Thursdays. Indeed, I would be even more radical and suggest that we should follow that timing every day as they seem much more sensible working hours. Just as some of the noble Lord's colleagues agreed with his views on that matter, I know that some of my colleagues agree with my views.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para10"></a>I also welcome the proposal that the House should normally rise no later than 10 p.m. I have already explained why I welcome that proposal. I also welcome the proposal to increase the number of Grand Committees. Since I arrived in the House I have attended two Grand Committees. The first concerned the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill and took place in the Moses Room. I agree with all the comments that have been made about the acoustics in that room. The second concerned the Employment Bill which took place in Committee Room 4 on the committee corridor. Those experiences were very different. The Employment Bill sat for nine days in <P>


<a name="column_708"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 708</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Grand Committee. However, much understanding was reached during that time. Had that Committee taken place on the Floor of the Chamber, it would still have taken a long time.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para11"></a>The report is a good achievement. I hope that the Motion will be carried so that the Procedure Committee's work can begin.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, as the first two or three minutes of her speech comprised exactly the speech that I would have made. I have enjoyed myself&#151;I hope that I shall still do so&#151;in your Lordships' House. One of the first lessons that I learnt was not to bore your Lordships and to try to be brief. I shall attempt to do that.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para12"></a>The report is to my mind very interesting, legible and digestible. I was fascinated by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, who I believe was the first speaker today to touch on the composition of the House and on how the proposals in the fascinating report might affect a reconstituted House. Indeed, I believe that that was also mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para13"></a>If we have a recomposed House, I wonder whether we shall have two classes of Peer&#151;those who wish to appear on television and act as professional politicians and those who are here to give advice and act as we do. As it is, I try to explain to my colleagues, as clearly as the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, has explained&#151;I have to say to her that in the glens of Angus people think that this is about as far as the moon and regard me as very brave, coming here and going back every day&#151;that the bicameral system of Parliament is akin to the Wimbledon tennis championships for a fortnight in 1968. Those of your Lordships who, like me, are getting a little long in the tooth may remember that, until 1968, the Wimbledon tennis championships were open only to amateurs. Suddenly, in 1968, professionals were allowed to play, and Mr Rod Laver returned and showed us the talents that we had been missing for all those years. That is one way in which I try to explain the difference between your Lordships' House and the other place; namely, that although we play on one court, we are the amateurs and the other place is for the professionals. I hope that we do our duties in a professional way. But, of course, the Government always must and should get their legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para14"></a>I was very interested in what the noble Lords, Lord Wallace of Saltaire and Lord Clement-Jones, had to say&#151;that perhaps sitting in September might not suit some of the more professional of your Lordships; those who, prior to coming to your Lordships' House, had given commitments to do their duty to the very best of their abilities but had then found those commitments affected by the introduction of the proposed changes. But that is something that can be smoothed over and should not affect our consideration of the report before us today.
<P>


<a name="column_709"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 709</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para15"></a>I enjoyed the comments of my noble friend Earl Ferrers, who referred to the great and the good. He is certainly both. Much of what he said is relevant to the fairly stern and perhaps justified criticism of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, let alone others, about the Procedure Committee. Who does the noble Lord consider to be members of the committee? As far as I understand it, the committee consists of many of the great and good who sit on the Front Benches. I am delighted to see that the noble Lord agrees. I do not think they are all dinosaurs; I speak as a minor, long-legged dinosaur at the back of your Lordships' House. Be that as it may, the report certainly gives us a great glimpse of the powers that could be given to Back Benchers, which is why I shall be interested to hear what the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House has to say in reply to my noble friend Lord Lucas.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para16"></a>With regard to the content of the report, I note that the wonderful word "virtually" is used in paragraph 31(a). The noble Lords, Lord Blake and Lord McCarthy, both of whom formed my political knowledge all of 40 years ago at Oxford, let alone my alma mater, the chartered accountant of Scotland, would not give me particularly high marks for using the word "virtually". It seems to cover quite a lot. However, it may be clarified either by the noble and learned Lord today or on consideration of the entire report when it comes back from the Procedure Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para17"></a>I am not entirely happy with the recommendations in paragraphs 31(k), (l) and (m). If the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, believes that he can leave here at seven o'clock and still catch the last flight to Edinburgh, I shall be joining him on it. Like the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, who is not in her place, even if I manage to take that flight, I do not get home until 11 p.m. But it shows that there is a vast geographical and perhaps ability-spread in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para18"></a>I conclude by conveying my deepest compliments to the noble Lords, Lord Brabazon, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe and Lord Grenfell, three of the chairmen of the European scrutiny committees. Of all the work that we do&#151;surely we do the bread and butter work, the revision work, the catching up work, and perhaps some of the work that might have been missed in another place&#151;that of our European scrutiny committees and sub-committees is, in the words of that marvellous regimental motto of the Coldstream Guards, nulli secundus, which means "second to none"; not, as I put it in my recruit days, "no second helpings", for which I finished up in the guard room. The work done by the European scrutiny committees is a jewel in your Lordships' House and a jewel in British democracy, and I am given to understand that it is widely admired in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para19"></a>When the noble and learned Lord winds up, perhaps he will indicate what on earth is the significance of the date 8th July 2002. I have two little letters after my name: "CA" stands for chartered accountant; I could also use "CB", which has nothing to do with Companion (of the order) of the Bath, but "a cynical so and so". I wonder whether the noble and learned <P>


<a name="column_710"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Lord believes that England are going to win the World Cup, which may perhaps be a suitable day of triumph on which the Prime Minister and the Government could begin to settle and something might happen. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord will enlighten me on that, particularly in view of his great love for kicking the round ball.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Parekh: </B>   My Lords, I joined your Lordships' House just under two years ago. That is obviously a very short time in which to get to know the place well enough to feel entitled to speak in this debate. However, it also has its advantages, including perhaps a willingness to raise questions about some of our procedures that others occasionally tend to take for granted.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para20"></a>For those of us who live quite a distance from London and have to earn a living, our hours of work cause a few problems. Sitting well beyond 10 p.m. is neither family friendly nor particularly debate friendly. The attendance is almost invariably thin and sometimes limited to the Front Benches. Even the most determined among us cannot be sure of sustaining the high quality of debate that is the hallmark of your Lordships' House. Sitting late on Thursdays would mean that those of us who live outside London could not manage to get home until Friday afternoon, with only two days to recover and spend with our families before getting back on the train on Monday morning.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para21"></a>The hours of our business cannot be discussed in isolation from the kind of work that we do. They are made necessary by the facts that the Government want to get through their legislation and we want to scrutinise it as rigorously as we can. We cannot therefore radically tamper with our hours of business unless we ensure that Bills which come before us are carefully thought through, skilfully drafted and do not require probing amendments or extensive clarification. We also need to find ways of devolving the business of the House to Grand Committees, as well as better balancing our parliamentary year. In short, every part of our business is tied up with some other, and we cannot change one without making appropriate changes to the other.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para22"></a>It is in that context that I want to endorse most warmly the recommendations of the Leader's Group. They sensitively link different areas of our work and constitute a coherent package. They also represent a cross-party consensus, are unanimously arrived at, and are based on ample reflection, as well as the written and oral evidence of those who know your Lordships' House most intimately.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para23"></a>It makes a great deal of sense to meet on Thursdays at 11 a.m. and finish at approximately 7 p.m. The proposal that no new item of business, including a new group of amendments, should be entertained after 10 p.m. on any day of the week also has much to be said for it. In order to make that possible, the report rightly recommends that drafts of all major government Bills should be subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny and that more of the House's business should be conducted in <P>


<a name="column_711"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 711</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Grand Committee. If these and other proposals were to damage our ability to discharge our functions effectively, we may wish to reject them or radically revise them. But that is not at all the case.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para24"></a>Among many functions performed by your Lordships' House, three are particularly important: first, scrutiny of the executive; secondly, rigorous examination of legislative proposals; and, thirdly, debates on major issues, in which we can discuss important proposals and outline our views. The report's proposals will strengthen our ability to discharge all three functions. For example, it is proposed that the time for Starred Questions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays should be extended to 40 minutes, with the number of Questions being increased from four to five.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para25"></a>Similarly, the proposed greater use of the Grand Committee process and of pre-legislative scrutiny will enable us to scrutinise legislation far more effectively than previously. Moreover, the provision of three additional Wednesdays for Back-Bench debates in each Session, as well as holding more debates on Select Committee reports and on general topics in prime time on the Floor of the House, will also provide great opportunities for the kind of debates for which this House is rightly well known. Therefore, I am convinced that the report is a long-overdue step in the right direction. It deserves to be welcomed and tried out for the period of two Sessions, as proposed.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para26"></a>Your Lordships' House is, rightly, anxious to reform its composition. It would be odd, and even inconsistent, not to reform its procedures, because the two are closely connected. Further, not to accept the report would be to send out the wrong message to the country where there is widespread&#151;obviously mistaken&#151;prejudice that we are opposed to all kinds of change. I therefore suggest that the time for change has long been over due, and that we should grasp the nettle and accept the report's major proposals.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para27"></a>However, that is not to say that one is happy with all the proposals contained in the report. Indeed, many noble Lords have talked about the proposals for September. As an academic, I believe that some of us might find that month a little difficult to accommodate. But such difficulties are only to be expected. No package of proposals will be equally acceptable to all. Therefore, I warmly endorse the report, and commend it to the House.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I assume that this debate will be read by the members of the Procedure Committee. Therefore, I begin my remarks with a footnote. At this stage of the debate, I am sure that no one would wish me to speak on every item contained in the report. But silence does definitely not signify consent in every case. I should like to mention only four matters.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para28"></a>First, I was tempted to join in the mini-debate between the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and my noble friend Lord Denham by pointing out that we have it on <P>


<a name="column_712"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 712</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the authority of the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, that the committee of the Leader of the House was expecting to report by Christmas. It was not subject to a direction that it should report by a particular time; but, in fact, the report has only just arrived. I see from the expression on the noble and learned Lord's face that I may be slightly wrong, but perhaps he will put me right when he responds. It is unnecessary to have a direction to conclude proceedings at a particular time to ensure that those proceedings are so concluded, even when there is great difficulty in arriving at consensus. What we do in that respect will depend on what my noble friend says at the end of the debate.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para29"></a>Secondly, on a lesser point, it has been suggested that we should use the Robing Room for Grand Committees "and other business". When I was a young man, I well recall my father taking me on a tour of the House of Lords. He became quite sentimental in the Robing Room, and said, "This is where we sat when the House of Commons was bombed by Hitler"; in other words, those from another place had come here and we had moved to the Robing Room. He added, "By the time you had screened off a Lobby on either side, put railings in front of the Throne and a Bar for the Commons and the public at the bottom, you were left with something rather like a large drawing room in which it was impossible to make speeches. The result was an infinite benefit to legislation, because you could only talk to each other. The worst thing that happened was when we came back here". So perhaps we shall do better when we go there.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para30"></a>Thirdly, subject to the reservations expressed by my noble friend Lord Lucas, which I warmly share, I believe that pre-legislative scrutiny is very desirable. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Roper, says; namely, that it inevitably extends the time that legislation is in Parliament. However, I do not understand why it is necessary to accompany that with a carry-over at the end of a process. If it is extended by the length of the pre-legislative scrutiny, it seems to me that it should be possible to carry over Bills that have been so scrutinised into the next Session. But if they are only half-way through the process at the end of a Session, I do not believe that Bills should be exempted from the carry-over rule any more than any other legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para31"></a>I see doubt mirrored in the faces of many noble Lords sitting opposite me. However, I should remind them that, like it or not, the day will come when they are sitting here on this side of the Chamber and their only really significant means of keeping the government of the day to account will be by marshalling the expenditure of time. The threat of losing a Bill at the end of a Session gives an opposition considerable leverage over government which they would lose completely if two Sessions could be devoted to one piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para32"></a>Incidentally, I notice from the table in the report that, in one Session&#151;I shall draw a veil over which government were in office at the time&#151;no fewer than 86 Bills went through your Lordships' House. <P>


<a name="column_713"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 713</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, to extend the ability to put material through this House seems to me superfluous; it should not happen.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para33"></a>My final point relates to the question of when this House should sit. At the opening of his speech, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House said that our decisions today&#151;and, presumably those that flow from it&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may be critical for our future".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-14_para34"></a>
We should not take those words lightly; nor, indeed, those that were said two paragraphs later:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Procedural reform alone will not make ... [the House] more effective".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-14_para35"></a><P>

<a name="20521-14_para36"></a>I understand the temptation to make our hours match more closely the hours of the working world, but the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, hit the nail squarely on the head time and again in his remarks. It is not possible for some of us to play a useful role in this House if we are prevented from playing a useful role elsewhere of a morning&#151;in the noble Lord's case, one morning only in the week.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para37"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, mentioned how much she had been instructed by those who speak in this House. The reason they are able to instruct her more than others is that they are actually out there learning what they subsequently come here and say. The report makes much of the financial expertise of many noble Lords. That is not because some of us have held high office in the Treasury, and elsewhere, in the distant past; what matters is up-to-date knowledge.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para38"></a>I am sure the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House will not mind my recalling something that he said elsewhere yesterday. I hope this will be a quotation, not a paraphrase. I believe he said that Members of your Lordships' House must make up their minds between being effective parliamentarians and being "part-time Members". I must stress to your Lordships that there is no contradiction between being a part-time Member and an effective politician. Indeed, in this House it is necessary to be a part-time Member in order to be an effective politician, because you live in the wider world. That is becoming increasingly rare in another place. We are here to balance the other place. It is also self-evidently valuable in the debates that take place in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para39"></a>I am tempted to continue, but noble Lords will be relieved to hear that I shall put that temptation behind me. Many noble Lords have put the important points so well. I shall, therefore, sit down.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-14_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, and the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, I am a member of the class of May 2000; I have been here almost exactly two years. It has been interesting to listen to people who have been here for considerably longer, and to hear their different perspectives. Before we came here, we were obviously told many things about this place&#151;some of which have turned out to be what are known these days as "urban myths", while many have turned out to be true. <P>


<a name="column_714"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 714</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I should like to list three or four of those things that have turned out to be the truth and which, to my surprise, I have found to be very much "pluses".
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para40"></a>The first relates to legislation. Without your Lordships' House, I should hate to think of the state of much legislation. Much current legislation is still in great need of improvement, as many noble Lords have said. Without this House's role of revising and scrutinising legislation, that legislation would be a great deal worse.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para41"></a>Secondly, we have the occasional showdown with the other place. I remember one amazing occasion not too long ago when we were all singing in the Lobby&#151;or at least Members on these Benches were. Your Lordships probably all thought that we were mad, but you are not alone in that. This raises a useful function that this House performs. Occasionally&#151;it would be wrong if it were more frequent&#151;the Government are made to fight hard for their legislation and to defend their proposals. In many cases, they do so against arguments that are based on fundamental principles. It would be wrong if the House were deprived of the ability to do that.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para42"></a>My third point involves the debates that we have in this House, which several noble Lords have mentioned. There was a proposal that the arrangements for Wednesdays and Thursdays should be swapped. The suggestion was that arrangements for Wednesdays are not really terribly important because all we do is debate. Sometimes those of us who take part in such debates go away and think, "That was interesting and good for us. It was stimulating but, for the outside world, what was the point of it? Was it of any value?". Debates in this House are often rational and informed. They are one of the last bastions in this country of something that is important&#151;an affirmation of the value of rational, informed debate. So little of that now goes on outside. The serious newspapers have dumbed down in many ways, so that they are not very different from the Daily Express and the News Chronicle of 30 or 40 years ago. The way in which politics is debated out there on television involves instant opinions on little information, focus group manipulation, instant opinion polls and so on. It is vital to maintain the value and tradition of debate in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para43"></a>To my astonishment, I find that a great deal of what is debated here gets noticed out there and sometimes is brought up months after the debate took place. As a North of England person, I have an interest to get back home as soon as possible before a weekend but I am against changing the arrangements for Wednesdays and Thursdays for the reason that I have given. That change would result in the "new" Thursdays being regarded as the fag-end of the week.
<P>

<a name="20521-14_para44"></a>To my astonishment, I also find that your Lordships' House is one of the few remaining places in which the Government still have to defend their position on many issues. They are held accountable in the face of what I should call criticism from a broad liberal/Left standpoint. Perhaps we are the last bastion of that. I refer not only to these Benches but also to the <P>


<a name="column_715"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 715</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government Benches and the Cross Benches. Indeed, on occasion, the Conservative Front Bench turns out to be taking a more liberal and progressive view of legislation than the Government.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, I do not suggest that all Conservatives do so. I notice that my old friend, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is looking quizzically at me. I willingly except him from the accusation of being Left/liberal! Nevertheless, people have said that some on the Conservative Benches represent the last bastion of the old Liberal/Tory tradition. Long may it continue.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, said that we are interested in these matters but asked whether anybody out there was. These are vital matters because the detailed procedures of this House, as part of the British Parliament, involve the basic liberties and rights of Members of the British Parliament to hold the Government to account. I do not suggest that we should go as slowly as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said we had been going during the past 100 years; however, we should move carefully. I believe that the package is modest, evolutionary and reversible and therefore, as a package, I am very happy to support it.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para1"></a>I turn to Thursday morning sittings. I am with my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie and not with my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones in this regard. I was once described by David Steel, as he then was&#151;my noble friend now&#151;as being a "North of England nationalist". I said, "No, I am not. I am no more a nationalist than you are a Scottish nationalist. My view of the North of England is as your view of Scotland". I have spent my life arguing against people who believe that the institutions of this country should be organised only for those who live and work in London. I do not suggest that we should move Parliament to Harrogate&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, I do not suggest that for the moment; and I do not suggest that our arrangements should be only for those living in the North of England. We are simply asking for a bit of give and take.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Clement-Jones said that if he could not be here at 11 o'clock on a Thursday, scrutiny would be more difficult. However, it may be that towards the end of business on a Thursday, many Members from the North of England, Scotland, Cornwall or wherever who currently go home early and miss our proceedings will be present and able to scrutinise. Individual Members of this House&#151;myself, my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and anyone else&#151;do not necessarily have to be here; the important thing is that enough of us are here and that there is a balance. I am in favour of the proposals for Thursdays. I should go on later than 10 o'clock at night, which is <P>


<a name="column_716"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 716</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nowadays a bit early to finish. I should go on until 11 o'clock or midnight, but not later than that. However, that is a detail.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para3"></a>The package as a whole is a welcome step forward. As a "North of England non-nationalist but protagonist", I suggest that it is a small step towards a future in which this House is more representative not just of the people in the South East or London but of people from all the regions and nations of this country.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_time0"></a><H5>7.26 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Grenfell: </B>   My Lords, the hour is relatively late&#151;although possibly not as late as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would like&#151;and we have had a long debate, so I shall try to be brief.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para4"></a>I find this package eminently sensible. I also find the proposals, as my noble friend Lord Peston said, extremely reasonable. My noble and learned friend the Leader of the House made the case for the package eloquently and persuasively. There is little that I can add at this hour. Many other noble Lords, on all sides of the House, have made a similarly positive case.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para5"></a>There is no hidden agenda in the report. It is an honest attempt to improve our working practices to the benefit of the whole House and&#151;dare I say it&#151;Parliament as a whole. If there is any hidden agenda, I suggest that it is to be found not on these Benches but somewhere else.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para6"></a>We will have plenty of time to discuss all of the proposals in detail when, as I hope, the proposal is agreed and the Procedure Committee comes back at a later date. At this late stage of our debate, I shall say no more about the substance of the report except to express a certain relief and pleasure that among the excellent recommendations is the call for a thorough review of the House's scrutiny of European legislation. As the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, said, that is urgently needed; I totally agree with him.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para7"></a>As a next step, it strikes me as wholly logical and businesslike to remit the report as it stands to the Procedure Committee with an instruction to come up with detailed proposals by 8th July on the implementation of the package so that the House has an early opportunity to debate the proposals fully and to vote on them. Equally logical and businesslike is the proposed trial period of two Sessions. That means that changes in our working practices are not immediately set in stone but can be revisited in the light of two Sessions of practical experience. On that basis, any suggestion that the proposals are being rammed down the throats of noble Lords would be totally absurd.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para8"></a>I turn to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Denham&#151;a person for whom I have both respect and affection. The report's proposals comprise 14 points. As noble Lords may recall, some 85 years ago President Woodrow Wilson produced a rather more famous list of 14 points. Of them, Georges Clemenceau said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"They bore me. Even God Almighty had only ten".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-15_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20521-15_para10"></a>I should love to think that the noble Lord's amendment was motivated either by mere boredom <P>


<a name="column_717"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 717</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the recommendations or by a simple complaint that there are four too many. I am afraid that that is not the case. Like the noble Lord, Lord Denham, and, I believe, probably the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, and a number of others, I was brought up on Hymns Ancient and Modern. But I did not make a personal mantra of the famous line:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Change and decay in all around I see".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-15_para11"></a>
However, I am afraid that that is not the case in relation to some noble Lords in this House. Change is not to be equated with decay. Change is regeneration and it is life. That is what we are talking about: the regeneration and the life of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para12"></a>Agreement to the amendment would risk unnecessary delay, and that carries with it the risk that this House would be seen as delaying changes on the mere supposition that they might not work rather than putting them early to a practical test to see whether they can work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will be kind enough to give way for a moment. Can he explain how, if the House sits for less time, it can provide greater scrutiny?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Grenfell: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the whole purpose of the proposals is not that the House should sit for fewer hours; their purpose is simply to bring about a redistribution of the time in which we sit. I honestly believe that that was the intention of the recommendations, and I welcome them.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para13"></a>That, and particularly, if I may say so, the very negative line taken by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, hardly squares with what I perceive to be the prevailing consensus in this House; that is, that improvements in our practices are needed to enhance not only our efficiency but also the quality of our working life and that those improvements are long overdue.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para14"></a>Whatever the effect of the amendment, it certainly cannot lend impetus to the process of change, without which we shall remain hobbled by practices which simply do not match the demands of a House which is in the process of modernisation.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para15"></a>Herbert Samuel once, rather unfairly I believe, complained that with the Civil Service there was always,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a difficulty for every solution".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-15_para16"></a>
That could perhaps be more fairly applied today to those who would frustrate progress on this entirely sensible and timely set of proposals. If the noble Lord, Lord Denham, insists on dividing the House, I shall certainly vote against the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_time1"></a><H5>7.32 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I fear that the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House may have been painfully aware of the fact that, when I joined his committee, I did so in a somewhat gloomy and grumpy frame of mind. I had the gravest doubts as to whether a Leader's committee was the right body to consider change. I had the gravest doubts as to whether it was <P>


<a name="column_718"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 718</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the right time to consider change, when second stage reform was in the offing. And, looking at what had happened in the House of Commons, I believed that I had every reason to be suspicious when the Leader of the House seemed to think that change was necessary.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para17"></a>It is all very well for the noble Lord, Lord Peston, to mock those of us who are suspicious of change, but he should go down to the other end of this building to see what change has done there. In the Commons drastic change has taken place in the name of modernisation: change which has drastically curtailed debate; change which has made life easier for the Members and much easier for the Government; and change which has almost completely destroyed the effectiveness of the place. If anyone doubts that, they should ask themselves what would have happened if, when we took the terrorism legislation through this place, the same restrictions on debate had applied here as applied in the House of Commons. No proper consideration of that legislation would have taken place at all. The Commons have made complete fools of themselves and have allowed the Government to make fools of the people. And&#151;I must say this to the House&#151;I did not want us to make fools of ourselves.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para18"></a>But the committee met and we found that we were able to work together. We came to the conclusion that it was only common sense for us to try to find issues on which we could all agree. The result is a report which is a compromise. One proposal which might advantage the Government is balanced against another which might not. For example, carry-over would occur only if pre-legislative scrutiny took place, and there would be more use of Grand Committees, but not to give the Government even more time to introduce bad legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para19"></a>Perhaps I may deal with just four of the proposals. First, I turn to carry-over. I can tell noble Lords that I should never have agreed to carry-over had it not been linked to pre-legislative scrutiny. Almost every person today has said that pre-legislative scrutiny is a good idea. Here is an incentive to the Government to provide for it. It goes without saying that we were not agreeing to token pre-legislative scrutiny, with the committee setting a ridiculously tight timetable for reporting. Therefore, it will mean that several months will elapse from the publication of a consultative document on a draft Bill to the committee reporting, and the whole legislative process will be considerably extended. Therefore, it does not mean an easy ride for the Government. Indeed, I have my doubts as to whether, in reality, the Government will be able to proceed on the basis that virtually every Bill will have pre-legislative scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para20"></a>We tried to strike the same type of balance in relation to the use of Grand Committees. I want to emphasise to noble Lords that the report recommends a greater use of Grand Committees; it does not recommend that many more Bills go to Grand Committee. It does not recommend&#151;here I must correct the Leader of the House if I heard him aright in his opening speech&#151;that the type of Bill envisaged by Rippon should go to Grand Committee; it <P>


<a name="column_719"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 719</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recommends that additional Bills of the type envisaged by Rippon should go to Grand Committee. To me, that signifies "some" more Bills.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para21"></a>But, even with a 10 o'clock cut-off, it is clear that simply a few more Bills going to Grand Committee will mean that more time is available on the Floor of the House. That is not to be used for even more badly prepared legislation but for more debates&#151;debates on Select Committee reports and general debates.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para22"></a>As to the 10 o'clock cut-off, at no time did the committee envisage that that would mean less time for Bills taken on the Floor and less time for Bills which went to Grand Committee. At no time did anyone on the committee&#151;least of all the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House&#151;suggest that a 10 o'clock cut-off would imply some type of timetabling. Nothing of that kind is mentioned in the report, and I should never have agreed to a cut-off if there had been any such suggestion. The Government are honour bound&#151;I know that they will proceed on that basis&#151;to ensure that Bills receive the same time as they do now.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para23"></a>So far as concerns starting at 11 o'clock on Thursdays, I consider that to be a reasonable solution to a problem recognised on all sides. There was some unhappiness about the decision not to switch the business on Wednesdays and Thursdays. We all considered that it was far too early to readdress that issue. But this is a different way of approaching the very real feelings of those who, in particular, live a long way from London and have a hard time if there is important business on Thursday and the House sits until late in the evening.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para24"></a>With regard to recesses, I believe that recommendation 31(l) is a little unhappily worded. We did not discuss longer recesses at Christmas, Easter and Whitsun. However, we did agree that, if the House of Commons rose at the beginning of July and returned in September, we should be wise to follow suit. The same applied in relation to the other recesses.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para25"></a>I do not think much of the suggestion in paragraph (m). I went along with it because my understanding is that from 2003 the House of Commons will sit in September and, as a result of our other recommendations, this House will sit in September. Therefore, the situation of this House not sitting and a Committee sitting on Bills will not arise. That was the only basis on which I agreed with the suggestion that the Leader of the House wanted to put in the report, but which I could see was entirely irrelevant.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para26"></a>I support the recommendations in the report, but in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I say that the Motion before the House means precisely what it says. Clearly the Procedure Committee is entitled to recommend as it thinks fit: it can recommend that the report be implemented or that some parts of the report be implemented and not others. That is that.

<FONT SIZE=3>make what will be the shortest speech in this debate. I want to add a word about those orphans, consolidation Bills, that the Leader of the House told us in opening were securely locked in a cupboard and no doubt the key has been thrown away. Perhaps I may give your Lordships the figures. In the three Sessions, 1990 to 1993, no fewer than 28 consolidation Bills were enacted. In the three Sessions, 1998 to 2001, only one consolidation Bill was enacted. That information was kindly given to me in a Written Answer by the noble and learned Lord's predecessor. I hope that some working practice can be invented that will cope with the backlog of consolidation Bills.

It is in the report. Apart from that I believe that we are in entire agreement.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para29"></a>I believe that we all approached each other with a certain degree of caution, overlain with a certain degree of suspicion. At every meeting it was a pleasure to see how much closer we could get, with everyone having to give and take. I shall not respond to every point because I hope that we shall have an early opportunity to debate the matter and to come to our distinct conclusions. I shall deal with the substance, and then turn to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Denham.
<P>

<a name="20521-15_para30"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has just dealt with consolidated Bills. I respectfully disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. Consolidated Bills do not change the law in substance; they pull it together and they are not contentious. They are important. We could carry out useful work. Not every noble Lord would need to be present at a Grand Committee on a consolidation Bill or a Law Commission Bill. The key is that those who wish to be present in September&#151;if we use that opportunity&#151;could attend. There will be no disincentive, no discouragement for anyone else who simply wants to attend for the whole or part of the Session, whether he or she wants to contribute or not.

<a name="column_721"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 721</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, so how will we manage to steam anything through? The Liberal Democrats and the Cross-Benchers could vote against us; they have an iron grip on this House. For my part, I see no disadvantage in that. We have to accommodate each other's different views; we have to listen to other people's arguments; and sometimes in a democracy it is salutary that that should occur. It is not for me to say anything about the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para0"></a>I turn to one or two distinct contributions. I particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, for a graceful and informed speech about the problems of European legislation. I also thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham for his short contribution that reminded us that we are attending to housekeeping and not building the kingdom of God. It is a shame that this will be almost his last appearance; I believe that he is due to retire on 31st May. I shall miss his contributions as I know your Lordships will.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is sometimes said that this is a part-time House. It is not. It is a full-time House that depends significantly upon those who attend part time. We actually work very hard indeed. The Canadian sample, quoted by my noble friend Lord Dubs, is out of date. Compared with any other chamber in the world, the House of Lords is the busiest. Most of the time is spent to the benefit of the public.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para1"></a>I turn to my friend, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, who said that with sinking heart he is never quite sure whether I mean what I say. With even more of a sinking heart, I know that when the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, speaks he means what he says. Gently and politely as always, he chaffed me by saying that I had said on a number of occasions that our duty is to hold the executive to account. It is. It is absolutely critical to the health of a functioning democracy, particularly when any regime has a large majority in the other place, that someone attempts to hold the Government to account. It is a matter of pure indifference to me&#151;I cannot say this more strongly&#151;whether a strong government is headed by Mr Blair or by Mrs Thatcher. Any democracy requires the checks and the balances that are offered in this place. That does not mean that the way in which we have always worked over the centuries is productive or useful.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para2"></a>The noble Earl asked what was in the package to hold the executive to account. There is pre-legislative scrutiny and scrutiny of secondary legislation that we all agree is not carried out sufficiently well. I echo the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, that that will have to be approached with great subtlety and care, but we could carry out the work that presently lies undone. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, made observations about the scrutiny of European legislation. That may be holding to account an executive that may not necessarily be domestically based, but nevertheless the work needs to be done.

<a name="20521-16_para3"></a>It is not for me to say&#151;but I shall&#151;that Question Time offers a marvellous opportunity, particularly in relation to topical questions, to challenge Ministers, to bring them to account and occasionally to see whether or not they may be induced into an embarrassing pitfall.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para4"></a>On the matter of debates in prime time, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that the voice of Back-Benchers should be heard. The proposal is that there should be more prime-time debates for Back-Benchers on Wednesdays and that the committee reports that are so important should also be debated in prime time. That is my reply to my friend, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, who asked me where the material is upon which this House may further, more effectively, more diligently, challenge the executive and bring it to account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-16_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble and learned Lord can answer better the question that I asked his noble friend Lord Grenfell: how will the House of Lords provide better scrutiny if it finishes work earlier and sits fewer days?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, there are two answers to that question. I shall deal with each of them. First, a blunt calculation of what hours are spent in the Chamber or in committees is not a true indicator of the way we do our work.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para5"></a>Secondly, there is no contemplation&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is absolutely right&#151;that we should sit less. Indeed, if we sit in September and take longer holidays at other times of the year, the proposal is&#151;and it is plainly implied, if not explicit, in the report&#151;that we should sit the same amount of time. What we will be able to do is to go home at a sane hour, such as 10 o'clock, sit more sensible hours, such as 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. on Thursdays, and have the great advantage, with the disbenefits to governments if departments do not get their Bills in order, of pre-legislative scrutiny allied to Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is right. If pre-legislative scrutiny becomes the norm, then carry-over of Bills is linked to it. But he is right in saying that if there is no pre-legislative scrutiny there will not be the consequential understanding that carry-over will be available. I stress&#151;and it is worth looking at the text&#151;that carry-over will be available only if the House agrees. I repeat, my noble friend Lord Carter and I have 28 per cent of the vote. So if we were conspirators we should be in the unsuccessful class of Guy Fawkes rather than in the successful&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   My Lords, why are the two impenetrably linked? Pre-legislative assessment clearly has the support of all the parties in the House. Carry-over of Bills has almost nil support, unless there is a specific and agreed basis to go forward. The Lord Privy Seal said initially that the two were linked entirely. If he is now saying that it needs the unanimous agreement of all parties in the House, he has shifted his ground a little.
<P>


<a name="column_723"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I have not shifted my ground in the slightest. They are linked because if one has pre-legislative scrutiny, the legislative process for a particular Bill is much longer. In the nature of things, it must be. I have not shifted my ground in any particular. Paragraph 31(b) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"subject to the right of the House of Commons to determine its own procedures, bills that have received pre-legislative scrutiny in either House should, on a motion moved in the House in possession of the bill at the end of the session, be allowed to be carried over".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-16_para7"></a>
I repeat, if I were to move such a Motion and your Lordships were against me, that is the end of carry-over for that Bill. If we do not behave scrupulously and decently then your Lordships will not agree to carry-over. So they are linked, and they are linked in those particular ways.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para8"></a>Perhaps I may mention one matter in passing. With regard to the common watering hole, the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, has the matter well in hand. Someone in the People's Republic of China will read that and wonder what it means.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para9"></a>I now turn away from the debate, which has been an excellent debate with different nuances, to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Denham. The noble Lord must make his own decision. I hope that he does not press the amendment, but in case he does I must deal with his question. I shall deal with the matter in some detail because it may be that the matter troubles your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para10"></a>Originally, I had had set down a draft Motion for future business. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, both wrote to me&#151;and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, spoke to me&#151;saying that they were not happy with the original form. Accordingly I wrote to all three with copies to everyone in the group in these terms:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Further to your letter, I have given some careful thought to the exact form of the Motion to be tabled in my name for 21st May. I do see the points that you raise and I certainly have no wish to provoke hostility. We have come so far in a consensual way, I would like to proceed by consensus if at all possible. I have talked the matter over with the Clerk of the Parliaments and I would like to suggest a compromise wording which Michael Davies advises he would be content with. My suggestion is",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-16_para11"></a>
and then it is word for word the Motion here.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Michael thinks this is a reasonable timetable. I would not like to go on without the group agreeing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-16_para12"></a>
I hope that your Lordships think that that was appropriate. The original Motion may have been too harsh. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and the noble Lord, Lord Roper, asked me to rethink the matter. I took advice. The advice was that 8th July would give seven weeks. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, asked the question: Why did I not bring my report in on time before Christmas? I am expecting&#151;I hope that your Lordships expect&#151;the Procedure Committee to produce its report on time. The answer is plain. We were not working to a defined agenda; it was open-ended. The Procedure Committee is being asked to deal with certain particulars. Not all of these recommendations, I remind your Lordships, require any action by the Procedure Committee.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20521-16_para13"></a>I am not imputing bad motive to anyone. There was a suggestion that the group which I had the privilege to chair could be accused of trying to sneak something through. I am sorry that such words were used. In response I shall say no more than, "Please look at who was in the group before using words of that kind." I put that matter on one side.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para14"></a>We are not trying to sneak anything through. What we are saying is that we now have a decent momentum and dynamic for improvement. Much of that is additional burden on the Government. The noble Lord, Lord Dean of Harptree, was concerned about the carry-over of Bills. I listened, as I always do, with great care to what he said. But your Lordships will have noted on page 2 of the report that our House has already approved the principle of carry-over. The reference is given in footnote 7 on page 2. I shall not trouble the House by reading it out.
<P>

<a name="20521-16_para15"></a>I think that it is reasonable and proportionate and not, I hope, aggressive to ask the House to vote in the terms of my Motion. I recognise the concerns that some noble Lords have, but I believe that we have come a very long way in a spirit of amity and consensus achieved at the 16 meetings. I would ask your Lordships to trust the group and to support my Motion.

<A NAME="20521-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Denham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for what he has said. My main concern in this was seeing that the conventions of the House were not disturbed. The two that particularly worried me over this matter were: first, that a take note Motion had an instruction tacked on to it, which has never been done before and is certainly against the spirit of the Companion; and, secondly, it had never been done before and I thought it dangerous to do it on this occasion to set a time limit for the Procedure Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para1"></a>It has been a very friendly debate on the main topics of the report. I do not think that I managed to get a great deal of support among my noble friends and others who spoke to my particular worry over the time limit and the Procedure Committee. I think in that case it would probably be unwise for me to divide the House without support going across the debate. So, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath) </B>  rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 26th March be approved [25th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have returned time and time again in this Chamber to debate how to get the balance right between medical confidentiality and the need to conduct medical research and epidemiological studies. Striking a balance between individual rights and the interests of society more generally is an issue of the greatest importance.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para5"></a>There can be no doubt of the importance of patient confidentiality. We must also be clear that confidential patient information is currently used by the health service to support a wide range of purposes. Those extend well beyond the information sharing needed to support care and treatment. They certainly extend well beyond what patients understand to be the case. Without understanding, there cannot be consent.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para6"></a>The Government are committed to openness and to developing relationships between service providers and service users based on trust, partnership and informed consent. We must recognise that that represents a considerable challenge. For many years, the NHS has been run along paternalistic lines, with managers and clinicians making decisions about what is best for patients with little or no input from patients and their families.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para7"></a>Confidential medical records have been rightly seen as a valuable resource&#151;to be protected, yes, but also to be exploited for the wider public good. Indeed, much good has come from that. We need to bring services in line with the expectations of patients, with the requirements of law and with the high standards that we have set as our goals. We need to put in place systems and processes that support the scientific community and deliver a public good while respecting patients' rights and preferences.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para8"></a>But it is important to acknowledge that it will take time to implement those changes. We cannot simply stop medical research or clinical audit, abandon all the valuable work on cancer that is underway or leave aside our responsibilities to monitor and sustain public health while we take time out to build systems and devise ways of working that meet the standards that we now know should apply. We have yet to determine whether we can support every key activity through consent procedures or new anonymisation techniques. This may not be the case&#151;some very important work may always need the support that the regulations provide. I know that a number of noble Lords who work in medical research fields already believe that to be the case and would prefer stronger support than the regulations provide. But it is only right that every activity is robustly tested clearly to establish genuine need. That itself will take time.
<P>


<a name="column_726"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 726</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para9"></a>So we have to manage change in a way that supports essential activity while the building blocks for improvement are put in place. We cannot risk some of the most important health service work programmes grinding to a halt because they are unable at present to meet required standards. We also do not think it appropriate for NHS staff, who are working hard in the interests of us all, to bear the burden of knowing that they are working without a robust basis in law for what they do.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para10"></a>Those were the key reasons for including Section 60 in the Health and Social Care Act 2001. I remind your Lordships that Section 60 is intended largely as a transitional measure. It will allow essential NHS activities that rely on access to confidential patient-identifiable information to continue while the NHS devises procedures to satisfy the obligations of confidentiality&#151;obligations that we fully accept should apply. Section 60 is driven by health service requirements, with support being provided only to those who can demonstrate both justification and need.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para11"></a>It may be helpful if I summarise the requirements and safeguards introduced by the Health and Social Care Act 2001. They were as follows. Use of the power provided must be approved by Parliament through the affirmative procedure. The Data Protection Act 1998 continues to apply. The activity supported must be a medical purpose. The activity must aim to improve patient care or otherwise be in the public interest. There must be no reasonably practicable alternative way of achieving the medical purpose&#151;with this in mind, there must be an annual review of any regulations laid. An independent statutory watchdog must be created: the Patient Information Advisory Group.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para12"></a>It is important to bear in mind all those provisions, as the safeguards and requirements introduced through the regulations add to and complement those in the Act. The Patient Information Advisory Group, in particular, has proven to be a conscientious and demanding group, as noble Lords who have read its published advice will be aware. That is a good thing. The group will play an increasingly important and visible part in the work to set things right in respect of confidentiality and consent in the health service.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para13"></a>The group has considered six applications for Section 60 to date and, having also taken note of the responses generated by wider consultation, advised that support be offered to two of them. I shall turn to those in a moment. However, the group also advised the Secretary of State that an application on behalf of all disease registers was too broad in its application and that applications by the Health and Safety Executive, by a renal register and on behalf of a major research project were not clear on the issue of why consent could not be obtained. We have followed the group's advice and rejected those applications.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para14"></a>We are confident that the advisory group will not support any activity that has not been fully justified on the grounds that it is of benefit to patients and the public and that the support of Section 60 will be provided only where it is truly needed.
<P>


<a name="column_727"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 727</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para15"></a>I turn to the regulations. They are essentially in two parts. The first part outlines two specific areas of work that require access to patient-identifiable information where, through consultation and consideration by the independent Patient Information Advisory Group, it has been demonstrated that common law requirements for consent cannot currently be met. The two areas are: the work carried out by cancer registries to monitor the incidence of cancer and measure mortality and survival rates; and work to tackle risks to public health such as the communicable disease surveillance and prevention undertaken by the Public Health Laboratory Service and other contributing agencies.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para16"></a>I am sure that the House will agree that those are important activities that we should support. Reporting on the future of cancer research, the Science and Technology Select Committee in another place stated in March that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless legislation is put in place swiftly, medical research will be irretrievably damaged".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-17_para17"></a>
With regard to communicable disease surveillance, the Public Health Laboratory Service's work to monitor infections such as E.coli and new variant CJD is clearly in the public interest. Dr Diana Walford, Director of the Public Health Laboratory Service has stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These regulations are essential if we are to avoid compromising public health. If our current surveillance systems are damaged, then there is a real danger of unnecessary cases of infectious disease and even deaths".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-17_para18"></a>
Professor Sian Griffiths, President of the Faculty of Public Health Medicine, said that there is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a clear public health justification for the practice of effective communicable disease surveillance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-17_para19"></a><P>

<a name="20521-17_para20"></a>The second part of the regulations, usually referred to as class support, outlines a small number of potential justifications for limited access to confidential information where it is likely to be impractical to gain consent. The proposals were developed primarily by the Medical Research Council in relation to the needs of researchers and others of whom they have become increasingly aware. Class support is therefore intended to support medical research, but will also be of great value to those engaged in epidemiology and the audit of the care that the NHS provides. The need for such limited support is service-wide and each and every example could not realistically be brought before this House.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para21"></a>Instead, it is proposed that responsibility for approving class support should rest with the Secretary of State, guided appropriately by the independent Patient Information Advisory Group. I will say a little more about the approval process in a moment, because I know that it has been a cause of concern.
<P>

<a name="20521-17_para22"></a>Specifically, class support may enable staff to access records in order to remove names and addresses and other identifying details. In the near future, electronic records will be able to do that automatically, but that is not currently the case. The expertise to select <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-18_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred to the removal of addresses. One can see the argument for privacy. It is very strong. What about cases in which the research is into alleged cancer clusters? In that situation, is the address not a material circumstance to the research? How will that dilemma be resolved?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has raised an interesting question. There is no doubt that, in researching some issues, it would be important to consider precise geographical location. The noble Earl mentioned cancer clusters, but one might also want to examine the effects of living close to power lines or landfill sites, for which such information would be relevant.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para0"></a>There is a problem. Even if names and addresses are removed, a postcode might still serve to identify an individual in a rural area or with a rare condition. That is why one needs the kind of class support that is contained in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para1"></a>Where the only reason for processing strong identifiers is to enable information from separate sources to be linked&#151;for example, death registration details with health records&#151;or to enable staff to go back to source data to validate information, class support may be required. Where there is a need to monitor the quality of care and treatment, which is vitally important in the overall monitoring of clinical outcomes, the class support in the regulations might help. I stress that class support will be provided only if it is clear that common law obligations cannot be met and that a key aspect of providing such support is the regulation of supported activity, requiring adherence to the code introduced by the regulations. Without support, an activity&#151;whether it is the work of a cancer registry or a major MRC-sponsored research project&#151;may be unable to continue or get under way.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para2"></a>Consultation again resulted in broad support for the proposals, and the Patient Information Advisory Group has agreed to monitor and assist with the process of approving applications for class support. I briefly referred to the approval process a moment ago. The advisory group has been asked to devise the approvals process and will have a central role in it. There have been calls for the advisory group, a body with advisory functions, to be given decision-making powers. That would require primary legislation to achieve and would be unnecessary and undesirable. It would be unnecessary because the Secretary of State has, in effect, delegated considerable power to the group and has every intention of acting on its advice. It would be undesirable because accountability should remain with the Secretary of State. We reached a similar conclusion in our debates only 12 months ago about Section 60, with its careful balance between many different issues.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para3"></a>There has been a certain amount of speculation about what the regulations may permit. Much of it is based on a somewhat exaggerated interpretation of the <P>


<a name="column_729"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 729</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regulations, possibly because the safeguards in Section 60 have been overlooked. I shall take the opportunity of laying to rest some of the principal concerns. First, the regulations are driven by health service needs. The suggestion that Ministers may use the powers to snoop through health records is both offensive and untrue. A key requirement of the regulations is that only health professionals or those with equivalent obligations of confidentiality doing work for one of the medical purposes set out in the regulations are permitted access to confidential patient information. Ministers are not, nor are civil servants. It will be only health professionals or others bound by equivalent duties of confidence. That would almost certainly mean contractual obligations, tied closely to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para4"></a>The purposes that may be supported include work on cancer, work on risks to public health, work to make records anonymous, work to identify and contact people to gain their consent, the analysis of geographical data such as postcodes, record linkage and validation, clinical audit and monitoring of healthcare provision. It will happen only if it is not reasonably practicable to rely on consent or anonymous data, only if items of information that identify patients are kept to the minimum and only if appropriate standards of security, transparency and commitment to improvement are met.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para5"></a>The regulations replace common law obligations with a code that, although permissive&#151;or, in exceptional circumstances relating to cancer work or public health risks that may require disclosure of confidential information for supported purposes&#151;is more prescriptive than the common law. The substitution of a regulatory code for the common law is an important safeguard for patients. The Data Protection Act 1998 served to enforce the common law duty of confidence, and it will, when the regulations are in place, serve to enforce adherence to the code.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para6"></a>The regulatory code is more direct and includes a power to fine those who fail to adhere to its requirements. Suggestions that the power to fine might be directed at doctors asked to disclose information for supported purposes are wide of the mark. Requirements could be imposed to support cancer work or the tackling of communicable disease&#151;an epidemic&#151;but it is extremely unlikely that a doctor would hesitate to comply in such circumstances. Regulations requiring the notification of certain diseases and infections have been in place for many years, and I am unaware of any doctor raising objections. Nor is it likely that a fine would be the appropriate response to non-compliance in such circumstances. I suspect that it might be an issue of professional misconduct to be discussed and considered by the General Medical Council.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para7"></a>I recognise that there has been concern about potential conflict arising for doctors between ethics and the law. The first point that I would like to make is that doctors have been disclosing information for those purposes for years, recognising the importance of the work that they support. It is only recently that awareness of the law has changed matters. Secondly, I <P>


<a name="column_730"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 730</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will make it clear that, unless&#151;exceptionally&#151;a requirement to disclose is introduced, doctors are free to respect any objections that a patient may raise.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para8"></a>I shall be particularly interested to hear the reasons why the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has tabled his amendment. I have some concerns about the wording, particularly the use of the word "paramount", which is consistent with Section 60. However, I understand the need to get the balance right. I take seriously concerns about patient confidentiality, just as I take seriously the concerns of those who need access to patient information to do critically important health service work. Section 60 and the regulations get the balance right. They are for the good of the health service and, more importantly, serve the public interest. I commend the draft regulations to the House. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="20521-18_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, it is difficult to explain in a few minutes the full enormity of the regulations and to set out the long list of reasons why I tabled the amendment. However, I shall try my best.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para11"></a>With the warmest respect from those of us on these Benches, I say to the Minister that his speech puts a gloss on the statutory instrument that it does not deserve. Almost every argument that the Government have used to justify the provisions in the SI relies on part truth, wholesale omission and an absence of clarity on key points. My position can be summed up at the outset: I do not think that such an approach is satisfactory or acceptable for such a serious and sensitive matter. The least that Parliament is entitled to is clarity about what is in front of us. I hope that, when he comes to sum up, the Minister will comment fully on the points that I shall make.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para12"></a>I shall start with what, I hope, is a self-evident truth. The relationship between a doctor and his patient is founded on trust. A doctor cannot treat a patient properly unless he knows that he is being given all the material facts with complete frankness. Patients will be disposed towards such frankness only if they know that whatever is said in the doctor's surgery remains strictly confidential.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para13"></a>If there is a need for the doctor to disclose to a third party confidential information about the patient, there is one commonly accepted basis for him doing so: obtaining the patient's prior informed consent. Any proposals to deviate from the norm of strict doctor-patient confidentiality and informed patient consent require the tightest possible justification. In the <P>


<a name="column_731"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 731</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statutory instrument we are considering we are offered two such justifications above all others. The first is that there is an overriding need for named patient data to be made available to cancer registries. The second is that named patient data are required for the control of communicable diseases and certain types of essential research.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para14"></a>Cancer registries perform an important, indeed, essential public service. I do not contend that their work should be threatened or brought to an end. It is, however, possible to have a debate about whether they could function satisfactorily if they were restricted to collecting data released with the informed consent of cancer patients. Much as I believe that more could be done to minimise the need for data about cancer patients to be disclosed in the absence of consent, I do not intend to argue that issue today.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para15"></a>Nor do I intend to argue against the proposition that named patient data are a necessary prerequisite for the proper surveillance of communicable disease. We are likely to hear from distinguished noble Lords opposite how vital the regulations are for the continued work of the Public Health Laboratory Service. Let there be no argument between us about that. The argument between us centres on different issues. The Government assert that the regulations respect the principle of informed consent; that they are tightly drawn; that they conform with human rights and other legislation; and that they are in patients' interests. I intend to show that none of those assertions holds water.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para16"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum states&#151;and the Minister confirmed this today:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The regulations will apply where confidential patient information is processed . . . in circumstances where it is either not practicable at the present time, or not appropriate, to seek the consent of the patient to whom information relates."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-18_para17"></a>
Nothing in either the regulations or in the Health and Social Care Act 2001 draws that distinction. It is absolute bunk for the Government to assert that the regulations safeguard the principle of informed consent to the maximum possible extent: they ignore it.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para18"></a>Legally, neither a research ethics committee nor the Secretary of State is obliged to approve research applications only in circumstances where all efforts have been made to obtain patient consent or achieve anonymisation. No attempt is made in the regulations to make informed consent the preferred option for disclosures required for audit and analysis purposes.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para19"></a>The position is yet more open-ended, because not only is the patient's consent unnecessary, but also there is no need to notify the patient that identifiable data relating to him have been used in that way. In a speech to the King's Fund in January, the Secretary of State said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Above all else, for trust to thrive there has to be informed consent. Not a tick-in-the-box consent regime but consent that is based on discussion and dialogue. Where consent is actively sought and positively given".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para21"></a>To put it bluntly, that is merely a lot of words. The regulations, in keeping with the Cabinet Office proposals for information-sharing, run in the opposite direction. It is not as if the information, once released, is to be confined to health professionals. Regulation 3(3)(c) makes it clear that anyone,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"employed or engaged by a Government Department or other public authority in communicable disease surveillance",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-18_para22"></a>
may process&#151;that is to say, gain access to&#151;confidential patient information. That covers a huge range of people: public officials, statisticians, government employees, contractors and sub-contractors, none of whom need be health professionals. What information will they be entitled to? We do not know.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para23"></a>Regulation 3(1)(a) sets out one of the purposes of unconsented disclosure; namely, diagnosing communicable diseases. The sentence does not stop there; it continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and other risks to public health".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-18_para24"></a>
In other words, there is no limit to the type of confidential information that could be required. No wonder the RCN, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Patients Association, the National Association of Nurses for Contraception and Sexual Health and the Mental Aftercare Association&#151;to name only some&#151;have expressed extreme concern about the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para25"></a>If, for example, sexual and mental health services are seen by the public as having even the potential to throw patient confidentiality to the four winds, they will run the risk of collapse. Patients will not trust them; some will refrain from using them and in so doing put their health at risk. One has to ask why the Government have seen fit to create uncertainty and doubt where there need be neither. The phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"other risks to public health",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-18_para26"></a>
adds nothing to the power to monitor communicable diseases, but opens the provision to misuse in respect of other illnesses.
<P>

<a name="20521-18_para27"></a>Grave concern has also been expressed about the regulations' legality. Regulation 2(1)(e) provides for the processing of information for the purpose that it is required for the counselling and support of a person, yet section 60(5) of the Health and Social Care Act prohibits regulations on the processing of patient information.

<a name="column_733"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 733</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been the easy way round. It is not necessary to include a blanket phrase to catch every eventuality such as that in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para0"></a>Section 60(5) of the Health and Social Care Act prohibits regulations on the processing of patient information for determining the care and treatment to be given to individuals. Counselling and support are a form of care. The regulations appear therefore to be ultra vires.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para1"></a>Regulation 8 provides that a person who does not comply with a requirement under the regulations may be subject to a civil penalty. The Secretary of State determines non-compliance and the level of penalty. Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides a list of procedural safeguards which apply in criminal proceedings. "Criminal" has its own meaning in ECHR law and can include charges which in UK law are regarded as civil. Lawyers have expressed to me the opinion that if the civil penalty in Regulation 8 is criminal under European law, as they believe it to be, none of the Article 6 safeguards is provided for and the regulations do not therefore comply with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para2"></a>The primary reason for my amendment is not to give expression to legalistic doubts but to emphasise in the strongest possible terms the primacy of a key principle of medical ethics and practice. The principle of confidentiality between doctor and patient is upheld for a good reason; the good of the patient. That principle has now been lost sight of.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para3"></a>The breadth and generality of the powers in the order mean one thing; the dignity and privacy of the individual is being subordinated to the administrative convenience of the NHS. That convenience extends to giving the Secretary of State the power to instruct any health professional to divulge individual patient data, even against the express wishes of the patient. It also extends to giving the Secretary of State a power, without due process of law, to impose a substantial fine on those who do not comply with the terms of the order. The practice within the NHS of free and easy sharing of medical records without consent, far from being prohibited, is instead being sanctified and legalised. I deplore that.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para4"></a>At the moment, patients in Britain are legally entitled to decide on who may and who may not have access to their personal medical records. With the approval of this order, that entitlement is being transferred to the Secretary of State. I believe that we cannot allow that event to pass without making the most emphatic possible statement in defence of patient choice and patient confidentiality. That is why I have tabled my amendment and it is for that reason that I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para5"></a>Moved, as an amendment to the above Motion, at end to insert, "subject only to Her Majesty's Government undertaking that they will protect the continuing work of cancer registries and protect the public from communicable diseases with the minimum infringement of patient confidentiality and that in all other circumstances patient confidentiality should remain paramount".&#151;(Earl Howe.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   My Lords, Britain has had an outstanding record in clinical research since at least the 1920s and that has been based on the use of patient information on a scale not easily achievable in other countries. The assumption which doctors made before the war was that any information about their voluntary hospital patients or their local infirmary patients could be used for research purposes. It was the same assumption which ran through the assumption that out-patient facilities needed no curtains, screening one patient from another. That ethos carried on into the NHS and yet that approach has enabled the disease registries to grow up and public health surveillance to take place.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para6"></a>That ethos has changed. Post Alder Hey, one cannot make such assumptions. Somehow, we have to balance the needs of society as a whole in terms of public health and protect the rights of individual patients to confidentiality. The Government brought forward a measure in the Health and Social Care Bill 2001 to try to clarify matters. Our concern then was that the Secretary of State was taking too much power into his hands. We put forward the proposal of a Patient Information Advisory Group to advise the Secretary of State on this matter and to which the Secretary of State must pay attention.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para7"></a>With the support of this House we prevailed and the Patient Information Advisory Group was established. Slowly, with no apparent sense of urgency of the matter, months passed while PIAG was set up. Despite the fact that the Act passed in the spring, the members of PIAG were not agreed until Christmas. It has had time to meet only twice prior to now.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para8"></a>Despite that, it has already made its mark. As we have heard, it considered five applications for approval under Section 60 of the Act, approved that from the Public Health Laboratory Service&#151;I commend the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, on the sterling work of his service&#151;and that of the cancer registries. It turned down three others, including, I understand, one from the Department of Health itself as well as one from the Health and Safety Executive. Therefore, those who said to me last year that there was no point setting up the group because it would have no teeth have been proved wrong.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para9"></a>We seem to have given birth to a fine, flourishing bouncing baby which, like any other baby, shows every sign of having a major impact on those around it. And, continuing the metaphor, we must ensure that the baby is fed, watered and allowed to flourish because it has already played a vital part and must continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para10"></a>We must recognise that we are in a period of transition. We need to promote a change of culture in the health service, and here GPs will surely play a key part, asking patients early on for permission to use information which no doubt will usually be very straightforwardly given. Of course, we need to develop to anonymise and pseudonomise data.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20521-19_para11"></a>We do not yet know how the regulations will work out. Nevertheless, we know we need to move away from the paternalistic system which has held sway up to now. It was not some heavenly place where all was well. These regulations and the section of the Act which preceded them have been greeted with concern both from medical researchers, who feel fettered, distrusted and stymied in their research, and from those who are concerned about the rights and liberties of the individual and who feel that this trespasses on that. So perhaps a reasonable balance has been struck.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para12"></a>But let us look at their concerns. Medical researchers feel distrusted. They feel there is no certainty that the research they start can be continued if policy changes. They need stability, clarity and continuity. We should therefore keep open the possibility that there might in future need to be primary legislation to clarify this whole area. But of one thing I am certain: there would be no easy agreement on the shape of that legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para13"></a>Meanwhile, they feel very strongly that these regulations must go through. Thus the Association of Medical Research Charities argues that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"further delay by Parliament will lead to a loss of valuable data and research opportunities and have a negative effect on our efforts to improve human health".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-19_para14"></a>
The GMC states that it supports the regulations as a temporary measure. Noble Lords who remember last year's debates will remember that the GMC was not happy until the Patient Information Advisory Group was set up. Cancer Research UK argues that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Since September 2002 cancer registration in this country has been at risk following guidance from the General Medical Council issued to doctors. Cancer Research UK believes that these draft regulations will help solve the problem in the short term and allow for incidences of cancer to be reported to the registries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-19_para15"></a><P>

<a name="20521-19_para16"></a>We must pay attention to those views. We should and must bear in mind the enormous advances in understanding that have been promoted by researchers into medicine. We must also bear in mind that the past is not littered with court cases from aggrieved patients who have felt that their confidentiality has been abused. Far from it. We must remember that there is such a thing as society and that in some cases it is more important to look at society's needs than the apparent needs of an individual.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para17"></a>However, on the other side there are questions. The system has clearly been too lax in the past and those who have been concerned about the rights of the individual are surely right to be concerned about the release of any information without informed consent. A system based on consent has to be the way forward.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para18"></a>We were concerned last year at the Secretary of State's powers in this area. That is why we fought so hard for the Patient Information Advisory Group and that is why we are so pleased that in the end we prevailed. We remain concerned about the role of the Secretary of State. It would be nice for all concerned, not least for the Secretary of State, to take him out of the equation. The role of the Secretary of State must be scrutinised to try to ensure that the process is as independent as possible and seen to be so.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para19"></a>I stated last year when we proposed the establishment of a statutory advisory committee that it should not sit muzzled in the background. The Secretary of State should refer any proposed regulations to the committee and the committee must make recommendations on them. If, after receiving the report of the committee, the Secretary of State lays before Parliament any regulations, he must accompany these with a copy of the committee's report and a statement showing the extent to which he has given effect to the committee's recommendations. If in any respect he has not given effect to its recommendations, he should give the reasons for his actions.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para20"></a>We did not get quite all of that, but the Minister assured us that the advice would be published and that he would say to what extent he had taken that advice. Well, yes, the advice was published&#151;in a hard-to-find Department of Health website. Given that it would get out anyway, I do not see why it needed to be buried there. It is not adequate; it is not what we expected; and it is not what we expect in the future. I trust that the Minister can reassure us on the matter. His advice should be published in a more public form than simply on a Department of Health website, and should contain advice on what new regulations should be put forward and the reaction to government draft regulations, as well as to monitoring.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para21"></a>We also expect PIAG to meet with sufficient frequency to be able to give full consideration to applications and to form robust advice. Although the group has met only twice, it appears that it has managed to do that; however, we should like to know whether, having met only twice, the group felt that that was satisfactory.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para22"></a>We should like to know whether PIAG believes that the regulations are completely in keeping with its advice, and, if not, in what way.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para23"></a>I wish to be reassured that the expectation is that PIAG will continue to play a full and public part in this area. I am sympathetic to the idea that medical researchers need consistency, clarity and continuity if they are to undertake long-term projects. I ask that PIAG address that question to see if that too can be provided&#151;within the need to evolve a more consensual approach.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para24"></a>I should like PIAG to report on how matters have operated when we come to review them next year, and to publish its findings to inform our debates.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para25"></a>Given that the regulations are meant to be temporary, until more permanent solutions are devised, I should like to know how the initial experience is to be evaluated and I urge that PIAG should have a key role to play here.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para26"></a>On some more general points, I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on how the regulations and the Information Commissioner's newly published guidance on the use and disclosure of medical data fit with each other. I should also like to know what steps the NHS is taking to anonymise data. These regulations relate to the control of information within the National Health Service. Does the Minister believe that the data protection rules adequately cover <P>


<a name="column_737"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 737</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information generated outside the health service? Will he also explain how co-ordination will be pursued with the authorities of Scotland and Northern Ireland?
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para27"></a>Will the noble Lord comment on the status of Regulation 5 on the granting of generic dispensations by classes of research, given that such detail has been given to cancer registries and public health bodies? What will be the circumstances under which the Secretary of State approves research under this regulation? What advice does he take, and does PIAG come fully into play?
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para28"></a>Regulation 6 seems to imply that the Secretary of State has discretion to make, or not to make, an entry in the register. Please will the Minister clarify that? In addition, will the nation-wide clearing service data flows be applying for Section 60 permission?
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para29"></a>In conclusion, we do not support the amendment in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The cancer registries and public health are covered in the regulations. We do not believe that the amendment can be justified, given the whole range of useful research that could be swept aside if it were to be passed. I point again to the fact that the Data Protection Act, the Health and Social Care Act and the Patient Information Advisory Group form part of a tightening, not a loosening, of procedures. There is no golden age to return to, except perhaps for researchers to pursue their researches unfettered, as they did previously&#151;largely to the benefit of patients. We have to move forward and recognise the importance of research. We must not simply chuck out the baby with the bath-water as we seek to balance patients' rights and the public good.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para30"></a>For me, the Patient Information Advisory Group, approved by your Lordships last year and now in full operation, can help us through. The assurances that I seek from the Minister are mostly on the role that he anticipates it will play in the future.

<A NAME="20521-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Turnberg: </B>   My Lords, much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said resonates strongly with me&#151;especially her reference to babies! It seems that almost everyone agrees with the two propositions that important research has to be done and that patients' trust and confidentiality should be protected. But therein lies the difficulty. Section 60 recommendations are attacked on the one hand by those who believe that confidentiality will be betrayed, and on the other by those who, like me, believe that research will be inhibited.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para31"></a>I must declare a number of interests as chairman of the board of the Public Health Laboratory Service, as scientific adviser to the Association of Medical Research Charities, and as vice-president of the Academy of Medical Sciences. So I am up to my neck in this area.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para32"></a>Getting the balance right has not been easy, but a balance has to be struck. I argued during the debate on the Bill last year that Section 60 procedures involved such a tortuous and prolonged process, with so many hurdles aimed at safeguarding patients' rights, that it <P>


<a name="column_738"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 738</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>effectively inhibited the research that it was designed to allow. I still believe that it is heavy-handed and bureaucratic, but now, at long last, we have the opportunity to agree that at least the specific types of research described in the regulations can be allowed to continue.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para33"></a>These regulations have not suddenly been dreamt up by officials out of the blue. They come at the end of a long vetting process: first, the Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG), which has heavy legal, ethical and patient group representation on it and which has a keen interest in protecting patients' interests, has thoroughly reviewed the classes of research put to it. I understand that it turned down several proposals but accepted two which it thought so carefully constructed and safe that it could allow them to go to the next step of public consultation. The proposals were submitted to a long list of bodies and individuals for a period of consultation and, having survived that process, were recommended to the Secretary of State, and now to Parliament. It has taken eight months to arrive at this point&#151;eight months during which some research, of which I could give a number of examples, has been delayed and frustrated, and public health, I believe, placed in jeopardy.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para34"></a>We should place these regulations in perspective. They apply to a very limited set of circumstances. Despite much of what has appeared in the press about the lack of constraints on confidential information, the constraints are clear and considerable&#151;some might argue, too considerable.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para35"></a>The regulations do not apply to the vast majority of research where consent can and indeed has to be obtained&#151; there is no getting away from that&#151;or where data cannot be attributed to any individuals; that is, the patients are anonymous. Indeed, among the many criteria which applications to the PIAG have to fulfil is a full explanation of why consent cannot be obtained or why the data cannot be made anonymous. Both have to be fully justified. That is the base-line from which all else follows. So we have a very limited but very important sub-set of research activities to which the regulations apply; namely, research where consent or anonymity cannot be obtained or guaranteed.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para36"></a>The other constraints apply to the question of who can do the research, and how, and who can handle the data&#151;points to which I shall return. The particular classes of activity covered in the regulations are research depending on cancer registries and the work of the PHLS in tracing sources of outbreaks of infectious disease.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para37"></a>I shall give examples of the sort of work that would be covered by the regulations. The first relates to research on data derived from patients sometime in the past when it is no longer possible to locate those patients to seek their consent because they have moved or died. Even setting about finding those patients to obtain their consent is not possible because a researcher is not allowed access to names or addresses even to seek consent. The finding that cancer of the lung was associated with smoking would not have been <P>


<a name="column_739"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 739</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possible without Sir Richard Doll being able to refer back to patients with lung cancer to ask about their smoking habits.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para38"></a>If today researchers wanted to pursue the idea that patients with cancer of the colon ate certain foods that might have contributed to their cancer, they would only be able to do so if the regulations are passed. The researchers would also require the additional approval of a research ethics committee, as they have always had to do.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para39"></a>Another example is PHLS work, where workers have to trace the sources of outbreaks of infectious disease, where speed is of the essence. Laboratory staff detecting an infection should be able to alert the PHLS and consultants in communicable disease control immediately&#151;not be constrained by having to seek the consent of patients, who may not be easily reachable. Hitherto, no one in their right mind objected to the sharing of that type of information among professionals with strict codes of confidentiality. While as an individual patient, I am keen to make sure that my confidences are protected, I am equally clear as an individual member of the public that I want to be protected from infectious disease and I want safe, rapid and effective systems to be in place.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para40"></a>In the important field of post-immunisation surveillance, it may be suspected that a rare or unusual disease is attributable to some vaccine or other. Gulf War syndrome or autism and MMR always rear their head. It has been possible to exclude a causal relationship between them. There are several other examples of surveillance which are not research but which are threatened unless we pass the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para41"></a>Much has been made of the powers of the Secretary of State. I can leave it to my noble friend the Minister to defend the Secretary of State. Confidential information about patients cannot be demanded by the Secretary of State. Confidential data can only be handled by professionals with a duty of confidentiality&#151;and, in the context of research, only after research ethics committee approval. It seems unlikely that an ethics committee would give the Secretary of State approval. The thought of the Secretary of State demanding to see case notes beggars belief and would not be allowed under the regulations. Nor would any of his officials be permitted to see them.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para42"></a>Without the regulations, it would not even be possible to process information about patients so that they could no longer be identified&#151;to anonymise the data. If the regulations are not passed, that would have the perverse effect of inhibiting the process by which patients' identities could be protected.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para43"></a>Many of us have been sent papers warning of the dangers to patients of passing the regulations. Can anyone point to a patient or a member of the public who has ever been harmed in any way by researchers using data from cancer registries or the work of the PHLS in its efforts to detect sources of outbreaks? I doubt it. Such activities will undoubtedly be threatened if we do not agree to the instrument.

<a name="20521-19_para44"></a>Much as I dislike the bureaucratic path we had to take to reach this point, now that we are here it is vitally important to accept the proposals. I hope that we can make the process more workable. To reject the regulations would put a block on research by research ethics committees. Microbiology labs would be unwilling to report infections. The public would hardly be able to understand why we had compromised their safety.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para45"></a>The noble Earl's amendment would take us right back to where we were before debating Section 60 during the passage of the Bill. The amendment would immediately obviate the possibility of other epidemiological research on any data held in disease registries&#151;all of which would, under the current circumstances provided for in the regulations, have to be vetted by PIAG set up specifically for the purpose of examining such cases thoroughly, using the strict criteria previously discussed.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para46"></a>The possibility of linking Rey's syndrome&#151;a nasty and unusual disease in children&#151;with aspirin ingestion would have been made impossible. The prospect of finding a possible but as yet unknown environmental or infectious cause for rare childhood illnesses such as leucodystrophy would be obviated. There are many other examples.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para47"></a>Although Section 60 is tedious for researchers, it is a thorough process. Coupled with the need for research ethics committee approval, it provides strong safeguards for patients. It is difficult to know what could take its place as a more thorough process if we are to allow any such research to be undertaken. It would be a sad, bad day for medical research and patients if we took the route proposed in the amendment.

<A NAME="20521-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, has dealt most eloquently with the issues surrounding research, so I shall not revisit them. The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, dealt with the Patient Information Advisory Group. I shall confine my remarks to cancer intelligence and surveillance units and medical ethics.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para48"></a>It is important to note that the cancer registries that appear to be the focus of some of the debate have been desperate for a statutory instrument to be introduced. The problem that these units have faced in recent years is that they have not been able to obtain complete data. I am most grateful to Dr John Steward for providing me with the confidentiality policy of The Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. I declare an interest, as Dr Steward is employed by the same NHS trust as me&#151;which is the guardian of the cancer registry for Wales.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para49"></a>It is worth noting that no cancer registry has breached the confidentiality of the information entrusted to it. There is no history of irresponsible registries but of registries desperate to obtain data and validate them. In recent years, pathology laboratories became frightened of disclosing diagnostic data on specimens, fearing that they would be in breach of the <P>


<a name="column_741"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 741</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>law. Consequently, 5 to 10 per cent of data were lost to registries. In addition, the ability to quality assure the data that were being notified was also lost. There is a need to cross-check clinical data against the histological diagnosis from pathology laboratories. That quality control makes sure that the data held by the registries are as accurate as they can be. Without that accuracy, the information that flows from the registries potentially becomes less meaningful. Some information might almost be meaningless. Registries strive hard to obtain complete sets of data that are as accurate as possible. They need information such as postcode data to identify and track clusters.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para50"></a>Registries have several key roles. They are not just repositories of descriptive statistics. Registries are able to inform commissioning by providing comparable data between different parts of the country and varying patterns of disease occurrence. They are able also to monitor outcomes. Registries have a major role in public protection and patient care, directly and indirectly.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para51"></a>We have heard a lot about the focus on research. It is important to remember that cancer registries provided vital information for the entire revision of cancer services under the Calman-Hine report. I declare an interest, as I had the honour of serving on that group.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para52"></a>The legal safeguards are very tight. The data are subject to all the safeguards of personal health information that apply to medical records, including the moral and ethical responsibilities of health professionals, contractual obligations and legal requirements. All registry staff cover all of this at induction and sign an undertaking in their contracts of employment to protect the privacy of the record and abide by the policy. Any visiting academic staff must sign an honorary contract as well. Their ordinary NHS contracts are not adequate. They have to re-declare their commitment to confidentiality. The director and the deputy are registered medical practitioners, and the director is the Caldicott guardian as well as data custodian. It would be serious professional misconduct if there were even a hint of a breach of individual confidentiality in relation to a registry.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para53"></a>A principle of implied consent has been used to obtain data for the registry. It takes a lot of time for a patient to consent to any procedure, and patients who are struggling to come to terms with their diagnosis find it very difficult to take additional information on board. However, I am unaware of any patient's information being disclosed against their will when they have said they do not want that information disclosed to a registry. In the case of the trust, patients are informed that there is a registry in Wales. Moreover, printouts from the registry are not secret but are in the public domain. Patients who want to see the cancer statistics can see the ones published by their local registry. The statistics available to the profession and the commissioners are also available to the public.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para54"></a>There are direct benefits to patients in cancer registration. These relate to assuring and improving the quality of care and treatment, monitoring and protecting public health, managing and planning <P>


<a name="column_742"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 742</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services as well as the matters that we have already heard about in academic research and teaching. The cancer registry itself is a closed office, always under lock and key. The computerised database is secure and subject to the same security policy. Encryption would be welcomed, but the NHS number or other code which could be encrypted as a universal identifier to track and cross-reference data without directly linking it to the patient's name and address is not widely available. However, everyone expects that that will be available eventually.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para55"></a>Finally, I turn to the issue of ethics which has been alluded to by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. He is quite right to state that confidentiality and trust are paramount within the context of a consultation. However, trust does not relate only to the information disclosed by the patient to the doctor; it is based also on the patient's awareness that the doctor is working in the patient's best interests. Patients trust that they are receiving the best care available and in the competence of the professional they are seeing. They also trust that the professional will refer them to someone else if that person is better equipped or more competent to look after them.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para56"></a>There are five key principles within medical ethics, and confidentiality comes under the principle of autonomy. Other principles are beneficence and non-maleficence&#151;to do good and not to do harm&#151;which are joined and are self-explanatory. We should also consider the principle of justice, as there is a tension between justice in relation to the individual and the healthcare professional's duty to the whole population and to other patients and potential patients. The scope of a decision and its impact on others is another consideration.
<P>

<a name="20521-19_para57"></a>These regulations are called for by those who are trying desperately to maintain registries. Evidence from across the United Kingdom has already made it clear that, without such provision, data quality will continue to decline rather than improve, and the general principles of justice and scope will not be fulfilled. I therefore cannot support the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I rise reluctantly and briefly to support the regulations. I am reluctant to support the regulations because I have huge respect and admiration for the work and total integrity of my noble friend Lord Howe. Moreover, the debate has revealed the enormous professional knowledge of noble Lords who have spoken. I shall speak not so much as a rank outsider, but as someone who, like everyone else, is involved in health issues.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para0"></a>I believe that we are in danger of addressing this overall issue from the outlook of the 1950s and 1960s. Way back then, people were utterly reluctant even to mention the fact that they had TB in the family because it was regarded as a disease born of poverty, unsanitary conditions and bad nutrition. Similarly, cancer was rarely mentioned in the 1970s; it was the big C. My own mother contracted cancer in 1970 and, to her dying day in 1977, never acknowledged the fact. However, the world has moved on a little. I know from personal experience that those suffering from diseases <P>


<a name="column_743"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 743</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such as TB, cancer and stroke wish more than anything to share information with others so that others may benefit from their experience and from potentially helpful research. They also want to help in the search for a remedy to the disease afflicting them.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para1"></a>Anecdotally, I am one of those who is in the very fortunate position of being the only family member not, so far, to have been struck by cancer. After having four primary cancers in five years, my sister rather wryly said, "Detta, perhaps you ought to go and be tested for the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome which obviously is genetic in our family". I asked what good that would do me. Would I commit hari kari and take my own life, or get into a total depression? I was struck by my sister saying that she wanted people to know about her situation. The more people who know about the effects of the disease the better.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para2"></a>Closer to home was my late husband who suffered a massive stroke about 13 years ago and who died last year. I know that had he been able to contribute to the knowledge&#151;sadly, he could not as he was unable to speak since the stroke happened&#151;he would have been in the forefront of allowing any data about his condition to be made known, so that research could benefit.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para3"></a>We have tried to develop our intellectual attitude from the time when my mother would not say the word "cancer" through to the rest of my family. As I said, my remarks are very personal and anecdotal.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para4"></a>This is not declaring an interest, but I am chairman of our local surgery support group, which has nothing to do with supporting patients, but which is intended to support doctors so that they can assess the facilities available to enable them to conduct their business. I have not consulted them on this because I have come to the debate with my eyes, ears and mind open. They would be at the forefront in saying that we must do whatever we can do to advance the knowledge of those diseases and how they affect people genetically, in clusters, because of lifestyle, or whatever, and that we must give that information to the research bodies.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para5"></a>I declare an interest that I have been involved with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which is now subsumed into the new organisation, Cancer Research UK, which is headed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman. I am willing that organisation and anyone involved in it to succeed. We are becoming much more open.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para6"></a>Those of us who are not suffering from cancer at the moment, although I know that there are Members of this House who have done so, would be much more open. We would say, "I don't mind my medical record being available, but I am not too sure that I want it named". That is the issue. We should keep names from the information. There was a question earlier about postcodes, which are unnecessary. If local GPs and consultants can verify that there is a certain number of cases of prostate cancer, strokes, TB, and so on, that will help the people doing the research in the relevant agencies.

<A NAME="20521-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the regulations should be passed as they stand, benign though the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, appears to be, as always. Your Lordships will remember the debates that we had on what have became Sections 60 and 61 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 as the previous Parliament drew to a close.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para8"></a>The role of the of the Patient Information Advisory Group, or PIAG as it is now called, created by that Act is vital. Section 61 states that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State shall seek and have regard to the views of the Advisory Group".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-20_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20521-20_para10"></a>We have already heard that in three out of five cases, the Secretary of State has listened to its views and has not allowed certain projects to go ahead. Other noble Lords, especially my noble friend Lord Turnberg, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, described the need for patient information for cancer registration and for monitoring and controlling infectious diseases. The amendment would allow data to be used for those purposes, but, if it were carried, all other use of patient information for research would become largely unobtainable, even if it had the approval of PIAG.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para11"></a>The United Kingdom has an outstanding pioneering record in epidemiology, which depends largely on having the kind of patient information that would be permitted by the regulations, but denied by the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-20_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the point of that part of the amendment is that patient consent should be sought if such research were in prospect. It is not to deny research; but patients should consent to personal and identifiable information being disclosed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Turnberg explained how much information cannot be obtained because the patient may have died or moved to an unobtainable or unknown address. Information about them may still be vital to the completion of research. Much of that research, for instance, is now available from the reports of the Registrar General and/or the Office for National Statistics. I refer to mortality and morbidity data which provide such details as place of residence&#151;we have discussed whether that should be a house address or a postcode&#151;social status and occupation at the time of death or of the episode of illness of the patient concerned. If the regulations are rejected, some data collected in general practice and in other specific surveys would become unlawful to collect and use.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para12"></a>Epidemiology started as a tool for identifying and controlling infectious disease. It is now a vital method of determining the association of the chronic non-infectious diseases, which cause the majority of deaths and the greatest burden of morbidity in the community&#151;I am talking about heart disease, stroke, diabetes and hypertension&#151;with other variables which may be important in their causation, for <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>instance, their relation to smoking, social class and other factors such as residence and type of housing or district. Such associations increase our understanding of the aetiology of those diseases and their prevention. If the regulations are rejected, the record linkage mechanism first set up by Professor Donald Acheson in Oxford (which is vital in this kind of research) will be endangered.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para13"></a>The professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at St George's, Peter Whincop, says (in a letter to me):

<a name="20521-20_para15"></a>I understand that my college, the Royal College of General Practitioners, opposes the regulations. I can understand that because the college may feel that the role of the general practitioner is to be the guardian of individual patients' rights and confidentiality. However, I have the advantage, which I think that the chairman of council of the Royal College of General Practitioners does not have, of having worked both as an epidemiologist and as a GP. I submit that the gain to patients as a whole by continuing the research that the regulations will allow far outweighs any theoretical advantage which might be gained by individual patients by rejecting the regulations or by accepting the amendment.

<A NAME="20521-20_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that I shall surprise the Minister if I say that the Patient Information Advisory Group is of considerable importance to these Benches. The idea was based on the model of the Social Security Advisory Committee. That is something which I do know something about.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para16"></a>There are several essential qualities about the Social Security Advisory Committee. The first is its professional integrity and independence. I think we all agree that the Patient Information Advisory Group has cleared that hurdle with flying colours, to the universal applause, I believe, of all those concerned.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para17"></a>The other conditions concern the way in which the Government handle that body. The important matters as regards the Social Security Advisory Committee are, first, that all proposed regulations in the area that its remit covers are laid before it for consideration and consultation before they are laid before the House. The second is that its comments are submitted to the Secretary of State and that the regulations, if they appear, are published with the Social Security Advisory Committee's report and the Secretary of State's reply to it so that when we go into the Printed Paper Office, when a social security regulation within the relevant area is to be considered, we can pick up in one handful the regulation, the advisory committee's comments and the Secretary of State's reply.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para18"></a>That is what we understand by publication. Publication means that you have to be able to get it in the PPO. Publication on a website is really not good enough, first, because certain noble Lords&#151;I am perfectly proud to confess that I am one&#151;are incapable of getting access to anything on a website, <P>


<a name="column_746"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>and, secondly, when something is published on a website, so far as I know, there is no means of discovering that publication has taken place.
<P>

<a name="20521-20_para19"></a>I shall listen to the Minister's reply on precisely those points very carefully. It was said when the bishops were turned out of this House that they that hated the bishops hated them worse than the devil and that they that loved them loved them not so well as their dinner. I am more interested in the Minister's reply than I am in my dinner.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve: </B>   My Lords, the hour is late and I do not want to say much. However, the statutory instrument reminds me of the countryman leaning on the gate when the city slicker in his smart car came by and asked the way to the farm and, after much reflection and some chewing on the grass, the countryman replied, "If I were you, I would not start from here".
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para0"></a>We have here a statutory instrument which on the surface assigns great powers to the Secretary of State. I have listened with great care to this debate and have read the previous debate, and I can see that in many ways those powers are greatly circumscribed. I am also aware that in recent months many medical researchers have told me how uncertain they were about the data that they can use and transmit to others. I was, therefore, enormously tempted by the amendment proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It is simple, and that is tremendously appealing. It makes confidentiality the primary, paramount principle.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para1"></a>I want to say why, nevertheless, it is not an acceptable direction in which to go. It is not because of the cancer registries or communicable diseases, which the amendment addresses. The most fundamental reason is that I doubt whether informed consent can be a feasible general principle in public health. It is the fundamental principle in clinical ethics, in the clinical encounter. It never has been the fundamental principle in public health, where we have always had to look to other principles of legitimation. We cannot ask each individual whether he or she approves the current standards for water monitoring and for many other facilities. So public health has to be taken in a different way. I fear that an attempt to reintroduce informed consent as the crucial principle at every stage in matters of public health is likely to lead us back to the rather formulaic and inadequate conceptions of informed consent, or merely pro forma conceptions, that used to obtain.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para2"></a>What I greatly regret about this statutory instrument is that nowhere would one guess what are the two major public concerns in this area. I anticipate that they centre round the issues of linkage and leakage. After all, the linking of different kinds of data is what this is all about. That, of course, is why we cannot simply use the principle of informed consent at every stage. If we are to anonymise data, someone first has to look at them before they can be anonymised in the way that is required for a particular study. But data linkage raises legitimate public concern. Bioinfomatics develops rapidly all around us. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that we shall hear <P>


<a name="column_747"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 747</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from the advisory group what view it takes of different forms of data linkage in the health field, because they are important.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para3"></a>I turn to data leakage, by which I mean data percolating to those who are not properly privy to it, who have perhaps not signed the requisite confidentiality agreement. We should not fool ourselves that this is completely absent when data take the form of hand-written records in old manila files on hospital trolleys. But it is rather easier when they are recorded electronically. I therefore hope that we shall hear a great deal more about the way in which the advisory group will deal with data linkage and data leakage.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para4"></a>That is where we are. We are at that gate. We are not on the high road into the town in which the regulation of the use of health information is a totally clear matter. With some regret, I support this statutory instrument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak in favour of the need to advance surveillance and the epidemiology of infectious disease, especially when that pertains to public health and the betterment of the individual within the public health framework. My concern derives from the experience of the House of Lords' Select Committee on resistance to antibiotics, which I had the honour to chair. First, the committee reported that we had had an alarming experience in that investigation; and, secondly, we identified a lacuna in the public health service as regards the level of surveillance and epidemiological studies, pertaining to antibiotic resistance.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para5"></a>As a general statement, we believed that surveillance of disease provides the information on which basic policies are made, and by which those policies are assessed on their effectiveness. On antibiotic resistance, the committee emphasised that much of the evidence was not available at the time; namely, three years ago. I would be particularly concerned should there be any compromise of the present surveillance mechanisms in the United Kingdom that are largely in the province of the Public Health Laboratory Service. In fact, we strongly recommended in our report that the PHLS be funded more for that very purpose&#151;its surveillance capability&#151;and, in particular, to support the study of the distribution of disease associated with antibiotic resistance.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para6"></a>As has been mentioned by other noble Lords, we have a series of notifiable diseases reportable under a variety of Acts; for example, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988. Of course, we are not talking about that legislation tonight, but it means that reporting and surveillance is neither new nor unrealistic in the United Kingdom. I do not believe that anyone challenges that situation, or the fact that we need such measures. In all of these matters the PHLS works on a confidential and, I believe, an anonymised information basis. That is the way that it should be. To my mind, it would be a very serious compromise to the health control agencies in this <P>


<a name="column_748"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 748</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>country if additional hurdles were placed in the way of public health management. It is right that such information should not serve to undermine a patient's right to confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para7"></a>In the diagnosis of a patient's illness, we all realise that certain tests and laboratory diagnoses are necessary; indeed, they serve part of the patient's confidential clinical record. Either immediately&#151;or, some time later, after the episode of illness&#151;that information may prove valuable to certain areas of study. These often provide valuable input to the surveillance and control of various contagious diseases.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para8"></a>As has been mentioned, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to go back to each individual because that patient may have moved home, or may no longer exist. However, the study of information derived from that case could be particularly valuable. Indeed, there have been quite a number of instances where, had that been done, certain diseases that spread locally and then nationally could have been contained. I believe that much of this can be accomplished by what is known as "generic" permission from patients; namely, that, on clinical examination, his or her medical data could, under the normal conditions regarding a patient's right to confidentiality, be used to great effect. I believe that the vast majority of patients would willingly give their consent, based on the betterment of healthcare in general.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para9"></a>There is a point to be made about anonymity, although it can be over-stressed. It may be that complete anonymity may be detrimental to the acquisition of further knowledge. For example, anonymity with respect to territorial information may be detrimental to sorting out whether there is a local or general problem or to establishing whether an issue is associated with human behaviour, human location or human diet and so on. The issue of anonymity must be treated with care in view of the potential by which disease entities can be analysed and the intricacies of modern epidemiology laid forth. The issue becomes more complicated as we introduce molecular epidemiology, whereby samples that may have been gathered months or years previously may be brought into consideration to unravel the difficulties of understanding the relevant disease. The issue is somewhat complex and cannot be dealt with at the source of the original infection; namely, the patient who goes to his doctor or is in hospital. Informed consent is obviously important in relation to the use of information. However, a wider issue, such as that involving a generic agreement with the patient, is important.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para10"></a>Having said what I have said, it is with great regret that I cannot support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Howe.

I believe that they are proportionate and that the PIAG got it right in terms of what should go forward. Much of what the noble Earl said proceeded on that false premise. He suggested that processing confidential information does not need to be done by a medical professional. I refer him to Regulation 7(2), which makes it clear that the qualification is designed entirely to give "equivalent" protection.
<P>

<a name="20521-21_para12"></a>I hear the noble Earl's interpretation of the ultra vires nature of Regulation 2(1)(e)(ii), in relation to Section 60(5) of the principal Act. Anyone reading that Act, unless one was being mischievous, would find it very difficult to interpret it in the way that the opponents of the regulations have put forward. An enormous amount of folklore has sprung up around the regulations.

<A NAME="20521-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, the word "mischievous" is not right. I have obviously not discussed the allegation with my noble friend Lord Howe&#151;the noble Lord has only just made it&#151;but he is not one to be mischievous. Even I, reading the regulations, find them slightly difficult to understand. I am sure that my noble friend did not find them difficult, but I know, from his integrity, that he would not have sought to be mischievous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, of course I withdraw the word "mischievous" in those circumstances, and I understand the reason that the noble Baroness raised the issue. But, certainly, a plain reading of the regulations in relation to the Act does not produce the result that the noble Earl put forward in his opening speech.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para0"></a>A degree of folklore has surrounded this matter. I have found the debate extremely constructive. I believe that the contributions have been considerably more constructive than those in the debate in the other place. That debate was certainly not for the squeamish, as those who had the pleasure of reading Hansard will know.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para1"></a>Somehow the protection of personal information seems to have been set against the needs of medical research and public health, and so on. That seems to me to be an entirely false juxtaposition. The essence is to achieve a balance, and I believe that the regulations succeed in doing that.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para2"></a>My noble friend Lady Northover raised a number of issues for clarification by the Minister. I hope very much that he will give the assurances that have been sought. But the bottom line is that I do not consider that the regulations give what has been called "carte blanche" to the Minister.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para3"></a>As my noble friend pointed out, as the begetters of Section 60 of the principal Act in its current form, we start from the basis of Section 60 and the safeguards <P>


<a name="column_750"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 750</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that it provides. We have examined the regulations in detail and, subject to a number of key assurances which I hope the Minister will give, we are satisfied that the regulations are proportionate. We believe that the noble Earl's amendment will have a devastating effect on the regulations. Many uses of personal information other than for cancer disease registry purposes and communicable diseases are of crucial importance.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para4"></a>I am sure that, quite apart from hearing some of the wise words of well-qualified noble Lords during the course of the debate, many of your Lordships will have received the briefing from the MRC. People have worked through examples with me. For example, the Gulf War-related research and the research relating to leukaemia in the area of Sellafield could not have been carried out with purely anonymised data. There has also been recognition of new variant CJD and its relation to the BSE epidemic.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para5"></a>There are many other aspects: for example, ways of reducing cot deaths; identification of adverse drug reactions; and, as the MRC says, identification of the healthcare needs of special groups in society, such as the elderly. A great number of areas would not be covered by the regulations if the amendment were carried. It is important that Regulation 5, which gives the Secretary of State powers, subject to considerable restriction, is agreed to.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para6"></a>I very much hope that the Minister will give the assurances that are sought, particularly in relation to the role of the PIAG and the publication of its report and decisions and the advice given, and so on.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para7"></a>I believe that the Minister needs to address what he believes "other risks to public health" are. With regard to the ordinary meaning of those words, it seems to me out of the question for mental health conditions to be covered by that wording. It is also important that the Minister clarifies the circumstances in which he will approve research under Regulation 5 and that he clarifies what type of advice he will take within the Department of Health, quite apart from the PIAG.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para8"></a>Apart from the medical profession, who else will be subject to the contractual duty of confidentiality? What type of contract does the Minister envisage will be entered into by, for example, civil servants and those who act with the various agencies which may process that information? What review process for the regulations will be followed by the Secretary of State in 12 months' time? Will it be an open and transparent process? Will there be an opportunity for debate?
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para9"></a>There is also the very important issue of informing patients that their information has been processed. I believe that the Minister should spend some moments explaining how patients&#151;or, at least, doctors&#151;will be able to tag their medical notes in some shape or form so that it is clear that their information has been processed by researchers.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para10"></a>Finally, it is important that the Minister also gives an assurance about genetic information. It is important to know that there can be no question of genetic information being subject to the terms of these <P>


<a name="column_751"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 751</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regulations. Subject to those assurances, and to those sought by my noble friend Lady Northover, we on these Benches wholeheartedly support the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_time0"></a><H5>9.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, this has been a high level debate and recalls the long hours during which we debated Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act in the previous parliamentary Session. I can assure the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that I agree with him. The relationship between the patient and the doctor is of critical importance. No one can be in doubt about the importance of patient confidentiality. Nor can anyone be in doubt that the NHS has a long way to go to get the matter absolutely right.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, suggested that for many years the NHS had been run along somewhat paternalistic lines, in which managers and clinicians made decisions about what they thought was best for patients with little or no input from patients and their families. We have to change that culture. That is why we published a statutory instrument last December to reform the way in which the NHS uses patients' confidential information. The issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, of linkage and leakage is important in taking forward that strategy. Equally, we have to acknowledge that with the best will in the world, it will take time to implement those changes.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para12"></a>We simply cannot stop medical research or clinical audit or abandon all the valuable work on cancer that is taking place. We cannot forget or abstain from our responsibilities to monitor and to sustain public health, while we take the time that will be necessary to build systems and to devise ways of working that meet the standards that we now know should apply. In that context the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, made a persuasive point.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para13"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked about cancer registration, which I believe was answered by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. He made a most persuasive case as to why complete sets of data are needed. That is critically important to the work of registries and researchers.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, mentioned surveillance and epidemiological studies and the work that his Select Committee undertook into antibiotics. I acknowledge that vital work. It is clear from the evidence given by PHLS to the Patient Information Advisory Group that PHLS is making significant progress towards meeting the requirements of the Caldicott report, that it limits the use of patient identifiable data and that it uses pseudonymisation techniques wherever possible. It removes and destroys all patient identifiable information from its records after two to five years, with any departure from the norm justified in writing to the Caldicott guardian. I believe that it is right that we should acknowledge the progress being made by PHLS.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para15"></a>In his introductory remarks the noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to some of his concerns about regulations and the way in which they were drafted. <P>


<a name="column_752"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 752</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Perhaps I can echo a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It seems to me that in focusing on the regulations he overlooked the overriding requirement of Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para16"></a>Perhaps I may repeat myself. First, we are debating an affirmative order today. The Data Protection Act 1998 continues to apply. That activity has to be supported for a medical purpose. It must be to improve patient care or otherwise be in the public interest. Furthermore, there cannot be a reasonable practical alternative way of achieving the medical purpose. With that in mind there must be an annual review of any regulations laid. I believe that those are significant safeguards which need to be read alongside the regulations we are debating today.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para17"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of why the phrase "other public health risk" is used in the regulation. He implied that we needed a tighter definition. It is, as noble Lords have suggested, impossible to know in advance what may constitute a risk to public health. The risks that we may face in the future are often unknowable today. Those working to monitor and safeguard public health must be free to act quickly and effectively when a new risk is detected. The alternative is to provide a long list of possible risks that would inevitably fall behind what is needed.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para18"></a>Noble Lords know that I am not fond of lists. With regard to the issue of emergency powers, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggested that because there were emergency powers one did not need that regulation. I think that he was referring to the notifiable disease regulations rather than emergency powers. In those regulations there is an out-of-date list of diseases. It suggests to me the problem always of lists. That is why the PHLS sought the flexibility to react to future risks.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para19"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, also raised the question of whether counselling and support, as described in Regulation 2(1)(e)(ii) is consistent with Section 5 of the Act. I am advised that it is consistent. I am advised that both the Health and Social Care Act, and the Data Protection Act to which it closely relates, distinguish between a range of medical purposes, including diagnosis, preventive medicine and care and treatment. Analysis of risk for patients not yet diagnosed with a condition may support diagnosis and may lead to preventive medicine. Prior to a diagnosis being made, counselling and support are not the same as the care and treatment that may follow.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para20"></a>A person who has a number of relatives who have had cancer goes to see his doctor. As a result the doctor may contact the cancer registry. The registry may provide details of family history, normally after seeking consent but sometimes not when it is not practical. That person might receive counselling and support. But that would be before they had been possibly diagnosed and certainly before they had been treated. That is somewhat complicated. I should be happy to write in detail to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on the matter.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para21"></a>So far as concerns genetics, of course I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. He will know that the Human Genetics Commission <P>


<a name="column_753"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 753</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reported on a number of important matters on 21st May. It states that it intends to monitor the use of the Section 60 powers and seeks to work with the Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG) in relation to any application for personal genetic information. We very much support those discussions and would encourage PIAG to respond positively to the request for discussions from the Human Genetics Commission.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para22"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, also asked whether the power to fine people is in contravention of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I am advised that it is not, because the Secretary of State must proceed through the courts. Those fined have an opportunity to defend themselves in court. Therefore, it is my advice that that matter satisfies the ECHR requirements.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para23"></a>I was asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, how patients would know whether their confidential information had been used&#151;for instance, would it be recorded on their records? Of course, patients must in general terms be informed about the use of information and its disclosure to satisfy the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998. I can assure both noble Lords that guidance will be provided on how best to satisfy the requirements in relation to Section 60. NHS bodies will be advised to keep records of disclosures.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para24"></a>Turning to the questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, I can assure her that the regulations do not apply only to NHS data, but to all confidential patient information. The regulations do not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland, but we shall encourage officials to work with each other to encourage consistency of approach&#151;consistent, as ever, with the principles of devolution, which I know that noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches usually support to the full, except when it comes to teaching research in Wales.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, answered most effectively the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The noble Earl mentioned Regulation 3(3) relating to public health surveillance and whether the people allowed to process information would be engaged by government departments or other public bodies. Yes, the regulation does allow that, but the class of people who are allowed to process information is also limited by Regulation 7(2). That regulation ensures that confidential patient information can be processed only by those who are health professionals or under that a similar duty of confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para26"></a>I acknowledge to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, that the compromises and agreements that we reached after our debates about the establishment of a statutory advisory group have been well founded. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, spoke at every stage of the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 of the model of the Social Security Advisory Committee. He is right. The PIAG has shown professionalism and integrity. The Government have also shown their good faith by listening to the advice of the PIAG.
<P>


<a name="column_754"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 754</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para27"></a>I accept that we could do better in terms of ensuring that the work that they do and the advice that they give enters the public domain more effectively. I give an assurance to the House that I will discuss that with officials and the chair of the PIAG. It is in the interests of all those involved, whether they take the view that the regulations are draconian or that they are far too bureaucratic, that the advice of the PIAG is given the fullest publicity. I accept the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, that not only must the papers be as accessible as possible, we must ensure that the PIAG annual report is full and readable. Again, I will ensure that that matter is discussed with the chair of the advisory group.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para28"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Turnberg and the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, have made some telling points about the needs of the research community. I hope that they will be pleased about the certainty that the regulations will allow. I also understand that they feel that the time taken to approve the regulations has been too long and their worries about research blight. But I am convinced that the advisory group had to get it right. We took time to appoint the group, but we have appointed first-rate people as a result. Now that we have a proper framework and there is greater certainty, I hope that the research community will understand why it has taken so long to process the first applications.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para29"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, asked about the overlap between the regulations and the Information Commissioner's guidance. Officials have worked closely with the commissioner on the guidance and on other projects, including the confidentiality code of practice for the NHS. The commissioner's guidance makes numerous references to the regulations, explaining how they fit in with data protection provisions. That issue is covered.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para30"></a>I was asked by my noble friend Lord Turnberg and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, about how the Secretary of State would approve class support. I can reassure the House that the Secretary of State has asked the advisory group to determine the approval process for class support. The PIAG has agreed to an active role in establishing the criteria for determining whether support should be provided and, most importantly, has agreed to scrutinise directly, at least in the initial stages, applications for disclosure of information with class support. There may be other points to which I feel that I cannot respond. I shall follow them up by letter. Important matters of fact and principle have been raised.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para31"></a>I turn to the amendment proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. If the amendment were accepted, it would leave researchers, epidemiologists and those needed to monitor and audit the quality of care without support. I acknowledge that the noble Earl accepts the importance of work on cancer and communicable diseases, and I have no argument with him about that. However, the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve, made a telling point about the amendment. It attempts to rewrite the primary legislation that provides for the regulations by seeking an undertaking that patient confidentiality should be paramount in all <P>


<a name="column_755"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 755</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances other than in work on cancer and communicable diseases. The entire point of the legislation is to face up to the fact that much vital work cannot meet the standards of confidentiality that we know we must apply and about which we must do something. If the amendment were accepted, it would close the door on support of any other activity.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para32"></a>Section 60 provides a power to set aside the requirements of confidentiality in specific and controlled circumstances, replacing them with, essentially, a regulatory code. Undertaking in this context to treat patient confidentiality as paramount does not seem to me to be wise.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para33"></a>Anyone who takes the time to examine the regulations and to consider the work already undertaken by the advisory group will see the high standards and the commitment to improvement that are required when support is provided. I fear that if we were to accept the noble Earl's amendment, we would have confusion about the interpretation of common law, and those left out in the research community would be in a worse state than they are, even with a process that many of them consider to be rather complicated and bureaucratic.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para34"></a>I hope that in my response I have shown that I regard patient confidentiality as being of great importance and that the Government recognise, in the paper published in December, that the NHS must do more to ensure that it gets this right. In the mean time, we must allow work in important areas relating to cancer, public health and clinical audit to continue with the support and security that the regulations will allow, knowing that the work has been thoroughly vetted by an advisory group that has shown itself to be extremely robust, and which in its rejection of the majority of the applications that it has received, has shown itself to be no easy turnover. I often talk about balance. In relation to Section 60 and these regulations, I believe that we have achieved a balance that is sensible, workable and, above all, in the public interest.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-22_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, this has been a useful debate. I thank all noble Lords who have taken part and the Minister for his reply. I cannot claim that all my concerns have been allayed, but perhaps I may pick up one or two points.
<P>

<a name="20521-22_para35"></a>I turn to the limits of confidentiality. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, took issue with my assertion that the regulations permit non-health professionals to gain access to patient information. He cited Regulation 7(2). A short anecdote might illustrate my concern. I know of someone who was employed as a temp for &#163;5 per hour processing highly sensitive, fully identified patient records at a local firm. The relevant health authority employed him; I shall not say which one. There was no credible security or supervision over that individual. I ask whether such a situation is acceptable and what is in the regulations to prevent that happening again.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to prolong the debate, but such a situation cannot arise under the regulations. If it did, it would be a breach of the regulations under Regulation 7(2) and a breach of the Act. That is as plain as the writing on the paper.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, we shall have to agree to differ. That is not my interpretation and not the legal advice I have received.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Soulsby referred persuasively to the monitoring of communicable disease. I listened carefully to his remarks. The existing communicable disease legislation requires named data so that the occurrence and clusters of disease can be identified, investigated and controlled. It overrides the doctor's duty of confidence. My contention to the Minister and the tenor of my reply to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, was that that provision could be extended to conditions such as E.coli, MRSA and CJD, with any unforeseen additions made subsequently by order. I still do not see why that model is not possible.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para1"></a>The Minister referred to the PAIG. The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, wants to give it teeth; the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, placed great emphasis on it as a safeguard. I have nothing but the highest respect for its members. It is interesting to note that one of its key recommendations in relation to this measure was that the department should establish a publicly available register of all activities approved under the class support arrangements, yet under Regulation 6(4) the Secretary of State has the option to decide not to make public entries in the register.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para2"></a>The Government are clearly capable of a pick-and-mix approach to the PAIG's advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may place on the record that it is the Secretary of State's intention to publish all such approved applications in the register.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am pleased to hear that, but I do not understand why there is a provision in the regulations appearing to provide for exceptions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. My understanding is that the flexibility in the regulations is more about the amount of information which can be provided rather than the relevant information as regards the entries. The entries will be in the register, but the discretion relates to the amount of detail that is provided.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, again, I am grateful to the Minister. That comment is extremely helpful and reassuring.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para3"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, on the subject of cancer registries that the range of purposes for disclosure, detailed at Regulation 2(1), is very wide. It goes well beyond activities for which cancer registries may require information and covers practically every use which might be made of patient information. The effect of such widely drawn <P>


<a name="column_757"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 757</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provision is to remove patient rights in relation to storage and use of information about them in any NHS or similar data base. I believe that that is of concern.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para4"></a>I spoke of the wide scope of the regulations. The phrase "other risk to public health" is without constraint. There is a carte blanche element elsewhere. Section 4(a) coupled with Regulation 5(b) provides a general purpose for linking data from different sources identifiably for its own sake. I do not fully understand why that has been permitted.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para5"></a>Every so often there is a defining moment in the life of this House when it is right to stand up for basic principles. This is one such instance. I am proposing that we challenge the Government to abide by the precepts which their own Ministers repeatedly articulate. However, I have listened carefully to noble Lords, not least the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, my noble friend Lord Soulsby and all noble Lords who have spoken. I note with due seriousness what the Minister said about the wording of my amendment and in particular the last part of it.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para6"></a>Let there be no misunderstanding about the amendment. As it stands, it is not fatal to the regulations. It was not designed to be fatal. In tabling the amendment in such a form, my main hope was that it might commend itself to noble Lords generally and to the Government and that the Minister might feel able to give me the undertakings that I seek. As he will know, those matters are of immense importance to many people outside the House. It is no part of my purpose to frustrate the operation of the regulations. I am well aware of the immediate damage that would be done to cancer registries and to disease monitoring if the regulations were to be overturned.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para7"></a>It would be possible for us to go through the lobbies and vote on my amendment. However, I would rather reach a consensus with the Government. The Minister appeared to indicate that as regards the first part of my amendment he would have no difficulty about giving me the undertaking I am seeking. His difficulty lies in the second part of the amendment. I therefore have a proposal to put to him. If he will consent to give me an undertaking that the Government will protect the continuing work of cancer registries and protect the public from communicable diseases with the minimum infringement of patient confidentiality, and if furthermore he will undertake that in the early part of <P>


<a name="column_758"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column 758</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the next Session of Parliament he will take a suitable opportunity to report back to the House on the operation of the regulations, on the progress that the Government are making on their plans to minimise the need for unconsented disclosure in all areas of activity covered by the order, and on the whole issue of safeguarding patient confidentiality, I in turn undertake that I will not press my amendment to a vote.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl. Before responding to his invitation, perhaps I may say that the issue that he has raised makes a persuasive case for the regulations. They establish a clear framework in which the use of such information is very clearly set out.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para8"></a>We discussed the issue of civil proceedings. But the point of the regulations lies not only in the fact that they allow the use of such information under certain circumstances; they also lay down a clear set of rules under which such information can be used, and they go on to list an enforcement procedure under which proceedings can be taken against those who abuse their position and do not follow the rules.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para9"></a>The consultation paper that we produced in December on implementing the confidentiality strategy provides the right framework to take the NHS forward into a situation where we deal better with the issue of patient confidentiality. We are developing a code of practice for the NHS which it is our intention to publish during the summer. I am sure that all of us are united in wanting to make sure that the NHS conducts itself properly in these areas.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para10"></a>As regards the noble Earl's request that I report back to noble Lords on the operation of the regulations and on the progress being made in the area of patient consent, I am happy to agree. It would be extremely useful if, late this year and early in the next Session, we have a further debate on these issues. I am very happy to agree to that suggestion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brougham and Vaux): </B>  I remind your Lordships of what was read to you on the first day. We will go through the Bill clause by clause. Noble Lords will speak standing. It has been agreed that there will be no Divisions in Grand Committee. If there is a Division in the Chamber, we will adjourn for 10 minutes as soon as the bell starts.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para13"></a>Clause 3 [Claims]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-23_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 35, after "credit" insert "for the whole or part of a tax year"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-23_para14"></a><P>

<a name="20521-23_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 24, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 25 and 27. These amendments to Clause 3 are part of a larger package of technical amendments designed to clarify and rationalise the distinction between "award" of tax credits and "entitlement" to tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para16"></a>The new tax credits introduced by the Bill are designed to target support according to the current circumstances of claimants within the context of a system that bases entitlement to tax credits on annual income and can respond by adjusting support for claimants who experience a change in their level of income.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para17"></a>Because the credits are designed to ensure that support is delivered to claimants during the year, the Bill enables the Inland Revenue to make awards, and payments under those awards, during the year, and to adjust those awards and payments as claimants' circumstances change. But because the credits will also respond to changes in income, entitlement cannot finally be determined until after the end of the year, when current year income is known. In short, awards&#151;and any payments under those awards&#151;are simply the vehicle for delivering support during the year.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para18"></a>Entitlement is different. It depends on the underlying facts, some of which&#151;income&#151;cannot be determined until after the end of the year. But this distinction is not clearly drawn by the Bill as it stands, and this gives rise to a number of technical problems.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para19"></a>Most obviously, as drafted, the provisions in the Bill that ought to deal with the finalisation of entitlement after the end of the year&#151;in particular Clauses 17, l8 and 19&#151;focus on the finalisation of awards. So Clause 17 currently deals with decisions about the correctness <P>


<a name="column_CWH56"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of an award; Clause 18 deals with inquiries into awards; and Clause 19 deals with discoveries about awards. We shall discuss these provisions, and government amendments intended to clarify them, in more detail later.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para20"></a>However, the straightforward point is simply that some people may have more than one award in any given tax year&#151; for example, if they stop working and so stop receiving the working tax credit for a period before returning to work later in the year. At the moment, the end of year provisions I have mentioned would apply to each award separately. This means that the Inland Revenue could have separately to require information from claimants in respect of each award in the year, rather than being able to ask a claimant once for a single set of information and to finalise their entitlement for the whole year on the basis of that information.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para21"></a>In addition, there is a contradiction between Clause 5 and the decision-making provisions in Clauses 14 to 16. Clause 5(3) and (5) are actually aimed at making provision about claimants' entitlement. When a person ceases to meet the basic requirements necessary to qualify for one of the credits, it is sensible that their entitlement to that credit should stop. This is what Clause 5(5) is aimed at. And because couples will be jointly entitled to the new credits, it is axiomatic that the entitlement of a couple, as a couple, will stop if the partners break up. Similarly, the entitlement of a single person as an individual will stop if that person takes on a new partner. This is what Clause 5(3) is aimed at.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para22"></a>However, these provisions in Clause 5 are currently cast in terms of the effect on awards rather than entitlement. They therefore imply that awards will or will not end in particular circumstances. However, Clauses 14 to 16 make clear that the existence of awards is dependent on decisions made by the board. Thus, there is a conflict, and the Bill as it stands leaves unresolved the question of what should happen in a case where, under Clause 5, an award ought to end but no decision to bring it to an end has been made by the board under Clause 16, or vice versa.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para23"></a>I could go on. A number of technical amendments are required to straighten this out. It will be made clear in Clause 5 that awards run until the end of the tax year, and end during the year only if they are terminated by a decision of the board. These amendments make the first such necessary changes to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para24"></a>Amendment No. 24 makes clear that a claim to a tax credit is needed each year. The amendment is needed because once a proper distinction between awards and entitlement is drawn, the requirement for a new claim each year will no longer be implied by Clause 5(1) and (2), which provides that an award on a claim ends at the end of each tax year.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para25"></a>Amendment No. 25 inserts a new subsection (1A) into Clause 3 to make clear that, where the board decides not to make an award or to terminate an award, any subsequent entitlement is dependent on the <P>


<a name="column_CWH57"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>making of a new claim. This makes clear that the position for second and subsequent claims is the same as that for new claims.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para26"></a>Finally, I have already mentioned that Clause 5(3), which is intended to provide that entitlement ends when a couple splits up or a new couple forms, incorrectly refers to the effect of such a change on an award. It will be stripped out of Clause 5, re-cast in terms of entitlement and moved to Clause 3, where it more properly belongs, by Amendment No. 27.
<P>

<a name="20521-23_para27"></a>With that technical explanation of the re-drafting for clarification of the distinction between reward and entitlement, I hope that Members of the Committee will feel able to endorse these amendments. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I begin by congratulating the noble Baroness on a record for the course. It is almost impossible for anyone taking it at that speed to comprehend what was being said.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para0"></a>This is an extremely complicated matter. It is also the case that we are talking here of Clause 3, but the Minister referred to numerous other clauses at the same time. One could not possibly have switched back and forth from one clause to another to get any real sense. When we come to the later clauses, we will need to come back to the points which the noble Baroness has made at that stage.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para1"></a>I am not quite clear whether these amendments are what one might call part of the general restructuring of the Bill, about which we complained at the beginning of our proceedings last time, or whether they are normal amendments which might anyway have been necessary on reflection. In any event, these are matters which presumably could have been dealt with in another place. It would be helpful to know on what date the Government became aware that it would be necessary to make these particular changes because, increasingly, we seem to be getting into a situation where these matters are not scrutinised in the House of Commons and the House of Lords is then given the function of sorting out the matters after the Bill has been through the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para2"></a>Having said that, I wish to concentrate on Clause 3. No doubt we shall come in due course to the matters which arise on Clause 5 and later clauses. In essence, the Minister has said that it is important to make the distinction between awards and entitlements. However, I understand that part of the problem is that the entitlement may change during the year. No doubt the noble Baroness will correct me if I am wrong about that. If there is a fall in income during the year, then that is taken into account during the course of the year. I presume that is what she meant when she referred to entitlement. On the other hand, if the income rises by less than &#163;2,500, then no adjustment is made. If it rises by more than &#163;2,500, then an adjustment is made. I am not sure whether the whole of the increase of &#163;2,500 and above is taken into account, or only the marginal amount over &#163;2,500. Perhaps the noble Baroness could clarify that point.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH58"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, I am happy to give that clarification. It is only the marginal amount above &#163;2,500.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   This seems to be a very strange arrangement because it is not the kind of allowance&#151;if that is the right word&#151;which would be made by the Inland Revenue. If one's income suddenly rises by, say, &#163;2,700, it is not normally the practice of the Inland Revenue to say that they will only make a charge on the &#163;200. Since this whole matter is being transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Inland Revenue, it is important that some degree of consistency is achieved between one taxpayer/beneficiary and another. The Bill appears to create a situation where that is not the case. Taxpayers, who are nothing to do with the benefit system, are being treated somewhat more harshly than those on a tax credit. This is not very desirable. So much for entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para3"></a>I turn now to the issue of awards, which the noble Baroness has said needs to be kept distinct from entitlement. Presumably, the award is finalised only after the end of the year rather than during the course of the year. Again, if that is not so, perhaps the Minister could clarify that point. Or does the board make decisions on the award in the course of the year; at the beginning of it; on expectations about what is likely to happen about the individual circumstances; or at the end of the year when the information is available?
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para4"></a>Of course, there are some comparisons here with the tax system and the whole issue of self-assessment&#151;although I presume I am right in saying that, as far as the award is concerned, there is not anything comparable to self-assessment in the income tax system. So this is far from being a simple arrangement for those involved in it&#151;either for those who pay tax and get deductions or for those who are merely having a straight benefit paid by the state. We will no doubt give further consideration to this issue in due course.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para5"></a>Again, I am not clear whether the situation we mentioned with regard to changes in a person's circumstances apply equally whether they are receiving a benefit or receiving a tax deduction. So, as an initial run on the points the Minister has made, it would be helpful if the issue could at least be clarified to that extent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-24_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I thank the Minister for letting us have her speaking notes. As I had already read them several times and found them extremely clear, I am perfectly happy to overlook the speed with which the Minister delivered her speech. It was fairly familiar material. The Minister has, I am sure, read the CAB report by Janet Albeson entitled Benefits and Work. There is a whole chapter in that report which is devoted to the fact that the social security system rests on the premise that people are either in work or out of work. That premise is now very firmly and clearly out of date. Janet Albeson came to the bleak conclusion that there is no solution to that problem, like Hilaire Belloc's doctors who are called to attend Henry King.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para6"></a>Professionally, the Minister cannot of course take that view. I admire the imagination and the ingenuity with which the Minister attempted to tackle this issue. Whether we have the final answer I take leave to doubt. I am sure that the Minister shares those doubts and will be on the alert for any way in which we may not have done quite as much as anybody else. These are minor and technical amendments which are designed to make addressing that problem easier.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para7"></a>When I hear the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, speak about the treatment of an increase in income, I am again reminded that he was not in this House during the Parliament of 1992&#150;97, when we discussed the effects of poverty traps on the incentives to work. The Minister has an imaginative and practical&#151;and I very much hope successful&#151;way of tackling that. I have enough hope in it to be very willing indeed to give it a fair wind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I apologise for the speed at which I spoke. I had thought that my remarks were covered by the speech notes that I had sent in advance. There could be nothing more boring for the Committee than to hear me recite, very slowly, a speech about technical amendments, a copy or a version of which it already had in its hands. I was trying to save the Committee undesirable hardship. Perhaps in future I should expose the noble Lord to the full rigours of a very slow explanation of very technical amendments.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, are correct: these are all part of the group of technical amendments separating out award and entitlement. Broadly speaking, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, was right about the distinction between award and entitlement. Awards are what you get on an almost pay-as-you-go basis. Entitlement is the end of the year balancing of the accounts to see whether the sums are properly paid to you. Entitlement cannot therefore be settled until after the end of the year, but awards can be, and may need to be, adjusted during the year to reflect changes that claimants expect or receive in their annual income, both up and down. It is worth perhaps emphasising that, for the most part, awards would start off being based on the previous year's income&#151;hence the P60. Thus they go into the current year based on a previous year's income but, of course, if their income falls by any amount or, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, rightly identified, rises by more than &#163;2500, we would expect them to want to adjust their awards as they go rather than to wait for an end-of-year entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para9"></a>The second area that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins pressed me on was the asymmetry of the losses and rises in incomes. There are some very good reasons for that. It is clear that of the 5.5 million families to be helped through the new tax credits system, approximately 1.3 million increase their incomes by up to &#163;2000 in the course of a year, while a further 1.3 to 1.5 million will increase their incomes up to the &#163;2,500. Only about 0.7 million will reduce their incomes by a similar amount. Therefore a substantial proportion of people in receipt of tax credits will expect to see an increase in their incomes.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH60"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para10"></a>What we have done, and I believe this is wise, is to have a headspace so that we do not seek to claw back the adjustment at the end of the year. However, if the increase in income is substantial&#151;namely; more than &#163;2.500, perhaps because there has been a change of job or a second earner in the family has moved into the labour market&#151;then at the end of that year we will seek to adjust it and use the new income in total, including the increases below &#163;2,500 and increases over &#163;2,500, as the basis of the assessment for the forthcoming year.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para11"></a>I believe the asymmetry is extremely decent, generous and proper. It ensures that if the incomes or hours of work of, for example, a vulnerable man who may have problems with poor health or a lone parent whose childcare arrangements may collapse, suddenly decrease, we can pick them up and offer support without those people feeling the need to drop out of work altogether and go onto benefits in order to get a secure income. Equally, the asymmetry says to people, "If you are able to increase your income in the course of the year, we are not going to be interested in the small sums; we are delighted that you can, and we will use this current year's income in total as the basis for next year. Only if in this year you earn more than &#163;2,500 above your award will we seek to take it into account&#151;and we can do that at the end of the year". In my opinion, it is both decent and generous. It reflects the reality of the amount of income and job churning that goes on for people on low incomes, who very often are in part-time work, full-time work, or no work, according to the circumstances of the labour market.
<P>

<a name="20521-24_para12"></a>If I have missed any points then I shall be happy to write in more detail. With that explanation, I hope that both the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, will agree with me that behind the technical amendments is something really important to which we are giving all the support we can. We recognise that this is a grey area. People are not just in work or out of work for tidy periods of the year. They revolve and rotate in the labour market. We want to give them the support and financial security they need to encourage them to stay in the labour market. I believe that the asymmetry of these arrangements does precisely that.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   I appreciate what the Minister has said. What extra costs might be incurred in terms of Inland Revenue manpower in adjusting PAYE codes to take into account changes in circumstances during the year? There could be some extra work involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   We are grateful to the noble Baroness for her further explanation. Our objective on both sides of the Committee is to improve the legislation. To that end I have repeatedly thanked the Minister, and indeed do so again, for the help which she has given as far as that is concerned. It was helpful to be given some indication by way of the speaking notes. However, the speaking notes to which the noble Earl referred had only a few lines on this particular set of amendments; <P>


<a name="column_CWH61"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the rest of them were related to later clauses. Of course I accept that there is also a relationship between the two.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord. Before the Committee meets on Thursday, if it would help our proceedings, I shall circulate my speaking notes on the remainder of the technical amendments so that noble Lords can follow them as I speak.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   That is an interesting innovation and in some ways helpful. At the same time, however, it is important to put on the record all the various relevant arguments for the benefit of those who may subsequently read our proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para0"></a>Perhaps I may pursue one or two points. First, I am still not clear on what date it became apparent that these amendments were necessary. One of the reasons why I did not refer to her speaking notes was that, in some which she has circulated&#151;but did not read out today&#151;the views expressed on the original drafting of the clauses were perhaps a little critical.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para1"></a>On the substance of the matter, the noble Baroness refers to the proposals relating to increases and decreases in income of the individuals affected as "generous". Of course, that generosity is paid for by other taxpayers, so one needs to keep a balance on that. If we could all spend vast extra sums on people who are in relatively poor circumstances, that would be fine, but one has to take into account the fact that someone will have to pay for that generosity. One cannot simply say that this is something about which we can all be happy and generous.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para2"></a>I am not quite clear about the adjustments. The noble Baroness says that if there is a change in income it will be taken into account at the end of the year. I presume that does not mean it will be clawed back at that point. I presume there will be an adjustment for the next year, but if someone has gained from an increase of, say, &#163;1,800 in the year, that will remain as a gain for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   For that one year, the &#163;2,500 headspace will not be clawed back. In other words, it is headspace. Only money that someone earns over and beyond that &#163;2,500 will be clawed back the following year. However, the next year's income basement on which the award is made will include both the &#163;2,500 that has not been clawed back and any money beyond that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I understand that, but if someone continually, year after year, gets an increase of &#163;1,800, then each year they get the benefit of that. That is, no doubt, a highly desirable situation for them, but it is not the situation for income tax. We are treating people in receipt of tax credits in a quite different way.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para3"></a>I am also still not clear as to whether this generosity, as the noble Baroness called it, applies to those for whom the tax credit is a deduction against tax or simply to those who are receiving benefit. We now know that 90 per cent of the total spending will <P>


<a name="column_CWH62"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>effectively be benefits and only 10 per cent will be deductions against tax. Do the proposals affect both groups: those who are genuinely in receipt of a tax deduction or tax credit, and those who are in receipt not of a tax credit, but of a benefit payment? No doubt, as we go through these successive clauses, the situation will become a little clearer. We need to know at what stage the Government changed their mind on these proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On the substantive policy point, there will be a number of people who are on benefit or who stay in the same job with the same income and same hours, whose previous year's income and current year's income remain the same. Therefore, their award and their entitlement will not change. Those will be people on benefit or people with steady work&#151;perhaps a lone parent working 16 hours a week on the minimum wage. Their income and award entitlement will not change.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para4"></a>Secondly, there will be a group who will be in work and whose income will increase. We have gone through those figures. Up to &#163;2,500 will not be affected and money over &#163;2,500 will be clawed back. When they go on to the following year, they will start on their full income base of the previous year as the basis of the new assessment.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para5"></a>The third group are those who have run out of the working tax credit and the children's tax credit, who will get just the family premium, which at the moment we call the children's tax credit. That kicks in, according to family circumstances, between &#163;15,000 and &#163;20,000, depending on size of families, and will go up to about &#163;50,000, at which point it starts tapering out to &#163;58,000, when one is left with child benefit. Between that figure of about &#163;20,000 and about &#163;50,000, it does not matter what happens to a person's income, they still receive the same amount of money, because they get the children's tax credit&#151;now, of course, the family element&#151;as well as the child benefit. So we have people whose award and whose previous year and current year does not change; we have people whose award does not change, although their income has changed; and people whose incomes have changed substantially and therefore attract further changes. Finally, we have those at the upper end of the income scale who will be receiving the children's element and who, whatever happens to their income between the range of &#163;20,000 and &#163;50,000, it will not affect the award and therefore the entitlement that they will receive from the Government. I hope that that is acceptable to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para6"></a>It will depend on which of the awards one is receiving&#151;working tax credit and children's tax credit, or only the family element&#151;as to how much headspace there is and how much movement up and down the income there can be without it affecting one's award and entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, then asked me about the implications for staffing where payments are administered by the tax credit office. Claimants will be able to telephone the Inland Revenue and changes can <P>


<a name="column_CWH63"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be put into effect. The Inland Revenue will be expanding the network of advice and contact centres to deal with any changes of circumstances in tax credits. However, I cannot tell the noble Lord how many extra staff are to be employed. I will write to him with that information if I obtain it.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para8"></a>Finally, the noble Lord pressed me on when we found out that we needed to change these amendments. It became clear that some amendments would be needed to correct technical problems with the end-of-year provision after the Bill had finished its passage through another place. The noble Lord&#151;who, I think I am right in saying, may be the only Member on the Front Bench who has spent time in the other place&#151;is thus uniquely positioned to criticise the other place for its possible lack of scrutiny to that effect. The rest of us have no such authority to comment.

<A NAME="20521-25_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord. He has had a very distinguished Front Bench career. However, the amendments required to resolve this problem were complex and all of a piece. Because they hinged on changes to Clause 17, it took some time to prepare them. The amendments are inter-related and had to be worked on as a whole. There has been no change of mind here, merely that these were complex amendments. I have apologised for their late arrival but, if it would be of help to give Members of the Committee my speaking notes&#151;as re-cast, now that we have re-grouped these amendments&#151;I shall be very happy to do so. It is important that the Bill is as transparent, accurate and clean in its drafting as Members of the Committee can help it to become.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I should like to make a very small point. Am I right in saying that criticising another place is not open even to those of us who have been Members there, or Members of Front Benches in another place? When there is a quarrel between the Houses, no authority can adjudicate upon it since both Houses are sovereign over their own procedure.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para9"></a>Finally, am I summarising the Minister's underlying premise correctly if I say that she is arguing that incentives matter to the poor as well as to the rich?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   There has been a slight misunderstanding on the issue of the relationship with the House of Commons. In no way did I seek to criticise the House of Commons, but it appears that the Government have raised this matter only at a very late stage. I sought merely to establish the Government's position, not what happened in the House of Commons. That is a legitimate point to make.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   For the benefit of good order, there is no objection whatever to criticising the House of Commons in this House. Adverse personal criticism of an individual is undesirable, but anything else is fair game.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-25_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   That will worry the noble Earl, Lord Russell, more than it worries me.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para10"></a>I should like to raise two points. First, so far as concerns the relief&#151;that may be the best way of putting it&#151;for increases below &#163;2,500, am I right in thinking that, if children are left totally on one side, this may benefit those with incomes up to a very substantial level; that is, over &#163;50,000? The noble Baroness will tell me if I am wrong.
<P>

<a name="20521-25_para11"></a>Secondly, she mentioned it will be possible to telephone the Inland Revenue for a very rapid adjustment. I am concerned throughout these deliberations about the fairness between a person receiving a tax credit and a taxpayer not in receipt of a tax credit. If one fills in a self-assessment form and one's income changes during the year, can one telephone the Revenue and say, "I am sorry, my self-assessment was wrong. Can you make an immediate adjustment to my payslip next week?". That appears to possible with a tax credit. However, I do not think that that is the case with regard to income tax.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am sorry that I have failed to make clear the position with regard to the bands of income. As this goes to the core of the Bill, it is important that we share the information now.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para0"></a>The &#163;2,500 applies to those people who are getting the new tax credits, but clearly&#151;given that only those getting working tax credit and children's tax credit normally will be getting high value tax credits&#151;that is where the benefit of the &#163;2,500 incentive comes into play. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, was absolutely right to use that phrase. It applies to all claimants, but those on higher incomes are likely only to be receiving the family element of child tax credit, so in practice they are unlikely to benefit because that element is the relatively modest one.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para1"></a>It most helps those who are on the taper with working tax credit and children's tax credit. Thereafter, it tapers and then flattens for those receiving only the children's element&#151;from &#163;20,000 to &#163;50,000. Then a smaller, final, gentle taper of about seven pence in the pound is available for those coming off the family element before they come on to child benefit. The main groups of people who will benefit from the asymmetry are those on modest incomes, those who may be going up from &#163;10,000 to &#163;12,000, or from &#163;12,000 to &#163;14,000. Over that three or four year period, if they receive regular increases of that kind, they will in any event move out of that taper and be on the family element alone.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para2"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, would like me to write him a more detailed explanation of how these bands are to work, he might find that helpful before we return to this issue at Report stage. I shall be happy to copy that letter to the noble Earl, Lord Russell.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Is it your Lordships' pleasure that this amendment shall be agreed to?

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Can I seek clarification? I thought we were withdrawing all amendments in the course of this, not moving them and accepting them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Obviously I will defer to the Chairman. I understand that, provided that there is no dissent, government amendments can be accepted by the Committee and incorporated into the Bill. If there is dissent, that does not happen and we would revisit the issue on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   This circumstance did not arise at our sitting the other day. I think I am right in saying that we went through the entire sitting with all the amendments being withdrawn. Given the scale of government amendments to the Bill, I do not think I would wish to agree them. We may well wish to return to the matter on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There must be some misunderstanding. Historically, Grand Committees have always been used for the specific purpose of carrying government amendments. We once had a Grand Committee which did nothing else but consider government amendments in order that the Bill could be produced, as it came out of Committee, in the form in which it was intended it should go forward for Report. It would be very undesirable indeed if we were to start opposing government amendments in Grand Committee because we would end up with a Report stage which was unduly delayed and based on a false impression of the Government's intentions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again on Report when, if necessary, Divisions may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not say that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins is not within his rights to oppose the amendment. However, I do say that this is not the understanding between the usual channels about Grand Committees. We have found it helpful for government amendments to be carried so that the Bill can be considered better on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am inexperienced in these matters, as indeed is the noble Baroness. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is of course very experienced in these matters and it is helpful to have his views.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para3"></a>However, this amendment raises matters of considerable complexity which we shall wish to debate on Report. That is true of a great many of the amendments for reasons we well know; namely, that so many amendments have turned up at the last minute and have not been discussed by the Commons at all. If we were to agree to it, it would then become part of the Bill, and if we wanted to raise the matter again on Report, we would have to table an amendment to change that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Certainly.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   In that situation we would end up with a huge list of Opposition amendments. Clearly our sole objective&#151;there is no partisan point in any of this&#151;is to improve the structure of the Bill. However, if we go along with what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, suggests is normal practice&#151;we are in a somewhat unusual situation on this Bill because of the vast mass of government amendments&#151;then we would end up with the onus of moving amendments on the Opposition side rather than on the Government side, though in fact the Bill is being amended by the Government.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para4"></a>A real problem arises here. The circumstances are not entirely normal but, in any case, unless there is general assent to the amendments&#151;and those we have just been discussing raise considerable questions with regard to equity between those people receiving tax credits and those not receiving tax credits&#151;we need to consider how best to proceed. If, however, the Government are proposing that this whole wodge of amendments, which have not been considered at all by the Commons and which we are now having put before us, should simply go into the Bill leaving the Opposition to table an equally long stream of amendments to knock them out, that is not a very satisfactory way of proceeding in the scrutiny of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps I can make a substantive point and then leave the process point to the noble Lord. It is simply this: some government amendments arise later which are based on shared care. They were propelled into the domain absolutely rightly by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and do have a policy implication. I can understand the noble Lord having reservations; a lot of amendments were indeed tabled late. But in practice it is now seven or eight days after those amendments were tabled and, had we been on the Floor of the House, I would have been amazed had there been any suggestion that government amendments of a technical and drafting sort&#151;even if they were quite numerous because they were repetitive&#151;should be resisted by the Opposition. All that does is make a distinction between awards and entitlements.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para5"></a>This is not a policy point; it is a drafting point. Naturally I expect Members to come back on Report to push me on whether &#163;2,500 is the appropriate cap or &#163;1,500, or whether asymmetry was a proper principle to pursue. Unless we have the Bill in a shape to which those amendments can be added, we shall have a double problem on Report. On the one hand I am moving technical amendments while on the other the noble Lord is trying to move amendments to my technical amendments which address the policy substance. I should have thought it would have been for the greater convenience of the Committee if we got the technical drafting out of the way. That would allow us to revisit on Report the policy issues over asymmetry in rises and falls in income.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   As the Minister knows, these amendments cause no trouble to these Benches. I agree with the Minister's assessment of the convenience of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Committee, but if the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, does not consent to these amendments he is within his rights. I suggest therefore that, rather than consuming more time on this matter, we proceed to the next business. I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, only that the exercise of one's rights is something which is capable of becoming addictive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Perhaps I can help.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The noble Lord is being extremely helpful. Can I be clear about this? Our objectives are all the same. It is merely a question of procedure. The House of Commons has not considered these amendments at all. They have all been tabled after the Bill has arrived here. If we go along with the procedure that the noble Baroness is suggesting and put them in the Bill, will the House of Commons consider those amendments when the Bill goes back there?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   As amendments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Rather than simply being part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The House of Commons has to agree any changes to the Bill made by your Lordships, whether from the Government or the Opposition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Thank you.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-26_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I wanted to confirm that the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is right. Unless an amendment achieves universal consent, it cannot be made in Grand Committee. However, from the beginning, one of the purposes of Grand Committee has been explicitly that government amendments can be made, and when the Bill goes from Grand Committee to the whole House on Report, noble Lords can see the Bill as the Government wish it to be presented on Report.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para6"></a>On one occasion&#151;perhaps the Clerks will remind me; it may have been the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill&#151;there were so many government amendments that a whole session of Grand Committee was devoted entirely to doing nothing else but passing government amendments. Government amendments have been agreed to on virtually every Bill that has gone before a Grand Committee since the procedure was adopted.
<P>

<a name="20521-26_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right. This is not a partisan point at all. It has been found to be helpful if the House on Report can consider the Bill as the Government would wish it to be presented. There is still the opportunity for the Opposition or anybody else to propose amendments to those matters which have been inserted into the Bill in Grand Committee. My noble friend Lady Hollis is right in saying that any amendment, whether it is made in Grand Committee or on Report, goes back to the House of Commons <P>


<a name="column_CWH68"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   Are there any unofficial rules on whether the lateness of the tabling of amendments affects how they are treated in Grand Committee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That matter has been raised. It was debated at our last meeting. As my noble friend Lady Hollis says, it is seven or eight days since the amendments were tabled. They have not been seen by the House of Commons, and it is clearly undesirable that government amendments should be considered less than seven days after they are tabled. However, they are being considered more than seven days after they have been tabled and additional support has been provided in the form of the speaking notes. That cannot be considered an objection. However, we are on the hands of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I defer, of course, to the greater experience of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, but I had always understood that one of the pillars on which scrutiny in Grand Committee was based was a lack of controversy on the Bill. The fact that, inadvertently, we have ended up with some controversy bubbling up because of the late tabling of amendments makes it much more difficult for us to deal with these issues than might have otherwise been the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, cannot have been at the Employment Bill Grand Committee. Controversy is of the essence of consideration of legislation, whether in Grand Committee or on the Floor of the House. Nobody is trying to avoid controversy; we are trying to avoid the time of the House being taken up in repetitive consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I should have said "non-contentious".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Speaking of time being taken up, may I ask that we proceed to the next group of amendments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Before we do so, does the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, recognise, on reflection, that the amendments simply make a distinction, which nobody has criticised, between awards and entitlement? That is all that they do. On Report, everybody, including the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will be able to see the Government's intent. As a result, they will be able to move any substantive amendments of policy then. Given that, I wonder whether the noble Lord is happy to see these amendments put into the Bill.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="20521-27_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The Front Bench on this side of the House finds itself having to make instant decisions on a matter that they had not previously contemplated. I still have some cause for concern, because noble Baroness' explanation gives rise a number of genuine points of principle, in particular the relationship between taxpayers on the one hand and people in receipt of tax credits on the other.
<P>

<a name="20521-27_para0"></a>We will wish to table an amendment on Report. The procedure merely changes the onus of proof one way rather than the other. Since it is clear that we will need to table such amendments, we will do so, but it seems to put an undue burden on the Opposition, rather than letting the Government move their own amendments and defend them on the Floor of the House.

We would be grateful if the noble Baroness would give us a little more information on how the Government would know the likelihood of the permanence of separation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I may need the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi to help me a little more. When people are separated is well established in social security law. The judgment of that is that they maintain separate households, although it is possible to have separation within the same household. The normal tests would be whether there is a separate household, whether there is a sexual relationship, whether there are children, whether the relationship is stable and whether there is a financial sharing of resource. Those are the tests of whether two people are operating as a heterosexual couple for social security purposes. Separation is normally where people have separate households, although it is possible to be separated within a house if those tests of a sexual relationship, a financial relationship and the stable relationship are not in play. I do not know if there is anything further I can tell the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="20521-27_para10"></a>Obviously there is a lot of debate sometimes from lone parents as to whether a boyfriend is a cohabitee. We are not establishing any new principle from that already in place in social security. The Inland Revenue already has experience of that with the existing tax credits. If we do not have such a rule, a cohabiting couple will be treated more favourably than a married couple. I am not sure the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, would wish to advocate such a position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   If it is any help, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, who used to be President of the Family Division of the High Court, once rehearsed the answer to precisely this question. His answer was identical to the Minister's. This, like weather forecasting, is an uncertain art, but nobody, so far as I know, proposes that either of them should stop.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I am most grateful for that description. It prompts me to ask how the characteristics of the separated couple, or the couple deemed to be permanently separated, are elicited from them. How do they answer those questions about the nature of the relationship and so on?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   There is a very simple answer to that&#151;if it is not the one the noble Lord is seeking, perhaps he will press me further&#151;which is that the working tax credit and child tax credit forms are jointly signed. Therefore, if they are jointly signed, the presumption is that those two are acting as a couple. If it is not jointly signed, then we are possibly dealing with a lone parent and a non-resident parent or maybe a child in two separate households. The fact that it is a joint claim should overcome the noble Lord's concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-27_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I am grateful for that response. However, notwithstanding what the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said, with 50 per cent of marriages now ending in divorce the transition period between the first stage <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of separation and divorce must be a long and complicated one, affecting a great many people. I am slightly puzzled, therefore, as to how the Government extract the information that they require. However, I shall not press the point and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20521-27_para13"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 30 is grouped with Amendment No. 29, so for the convenience of the Committee I shall speak also to that.
<P>

<a name="20521-27_para14"></a>Amendment No. 29 is based on the premise that individuals in receipt of British non-contributory benefits or tax credits should ordinarily be physically in the United Kingdom. As my noble friend Lord Higgins observed, the benefits and supports so conserved are a direct product of the generosity of the British taxpayer. It is therefore unreasonable that persons in receipt of such payments should be overseas except on one ground only: that is, limited periods of absence from our shores.
<P>

<a name="20521-27_para15"></a>Accordingly, Amendment No. 29 is designed to limit the exceptions. Excuses of having to deal with family affairs overseas will in many cases be plausible but would be impossible to police. Logically, therefore, the only fair and practical rule is to exclude any exception, save for reasons defined by short periods of absence. The amendment leaves it open to the Government to prescribe the period but, by limiting the grounds of exception to a period only, it prevents the construction in regulations of complex arrangements which make exceptions for all manner of reasons. That would replicate the horrifically complicated and almost impossible-to-regulate provisions of Regulation 4 of the Income Support General Regulations 1987 as amended. Bluntly, is it too churlish to suggest that the system of tax credits is already complicated enough without adding to its complexity?
<P>

<a name="20521-27_para16"></a>I have one final thought in this context. The Minister, during our debates last week, defined the tax credit system as a structural reorganisation and moved away from separate chimneys to a horizontal arrangement. Fair enough. But as my noble friend Lord Higgins intimated, it will take some time for us to assimilate the full implications of this. Within this reorganisation there has to be an explicit aspiration that over time and in order to deliver the Government's policy of encouraging people into employment, more and more people will be in work. That, together with poverty reduction, is the primary thrust of the Government's policy. The Minister emphasised that point again today. In such circumstances, there is every reason to assume that they should ordinarily be in the United Kingdom.

<a name="20521-27_para17"></a>Amendment No. 30 merely seeks to probe whether the provision in subsection (5) is intended to apply equally to couples, whether or not married, submitting claims for tax credits as to individual claimants. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020521/text/20521-28.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-28_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I think this is the appropriate place to raise what is a fairly major question, of which I have given the Minister notice; that is, whether this Bill is in accord with the provisions of European law. Within the terms of this Bill, nationals of other European Union countries working in this country are eligible for the tax credit but British subjects working elsewhere in the European Union are not eligible for the tax credit. The Minister will I hope, before we go further, confirm that that is the correct understanding of what the Bill does.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para0"></a>I understand why the Government may have wished to do it in this way. The question is whether the Treaty of Rome actually permits it to be so done. I have been looking first at Article 7 of the Treaty, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Within the scope of application of this Treaty, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-28_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20521-28_para2"></a>One may say that this is a discrimination on grounds of location and not on those of nationality.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para3"></a>I looked then at the section on freedom of movement. At Article 48.2 of the Treaty it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-28_para4"></a>
So, if I have read that correctly, it means that it is not legal to pay the tax credit to EU nationals working here and not to British subjects working elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para5"></a>Article 51 of the Treaty also bears on this point. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, adopt such measures in the field of social security as are necessary to provide freedom of movement for workers; to this end, it shall make arrangements to secure for migrant workers and their dependants:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-28_para6"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) aggregation, for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the right to benefit and of calculating the amount of benefit, of all periods taken into account under the laws of the several countries;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-28_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) payment of benefits to persons resident in the territories of Member States".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-28_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20521-28_para9"></a>Article 51(b), in particular, seems to bear very directly and explicitly on the provisions in the Bill to ensure the payment of benefits to persons resident in the territories of Member States.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para10"></a>When one thinks about the constitution of the labour market within the EU at the moment, it is very difficult to divide it according to the old traditional national categories. Most people in today's labour market are not merely neither regularly in work nor regularly out of work; they are also neither regularly working in one country nor regularly working in another.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para11"></a>Consider, for example, someone who is employed by one of the holiday tour firms. They may be regarded as resident in this country if they come home for the winter, but every now and then these tour firms need <P>


<a name="column_CWH73"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>someone to stay over the winter in the holiday place abroad to oversee building work, repair work, furnishing work and so on. If such a period of absence should be over 12 months, as it may well be, then some difficult questions may arise under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para12"></a>If one considers the Tower of Babel that was the rebuilding of Berlin, which gave rise to a great many cases under the habitual residence test&#151;which members of the department may well remember&#151;there again, saying that someone was a national of one country and therefore working in that country tended to lead one very much astray.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para13"></a>One only needs to look at those who are working in the Gatwick Airport Hotel, to take an example that comes into my mind at random, to realise that globalisation has, to a very large extent, come to the labour force as well as to capital. In fact, looking at the situation, I am beginning to wonder whether the national state is as out of date as the forum for fixing laws on these matters&#151;and, indeed, for the management of economic policy&#151;as the parish now is for the operation of poor relief. It may indeed have been out of date by 1601, but the Minister and I can keep that to discuss in private.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para14"></a>I like the Bill. This is a serious question and I should like to see it answered. But I do not at present see, other than by agreeing to pay the tax credit to British subjects working elsewhere in the EU, how it could be answered to the satisfaction of the European Court of Justice.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I wonder whether I would be answering the question of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, first if I were to say that it will; that Clause 3 provides that to claim tax credits a person must be in the UK&#151;in other words, ordinarily resident. That is the first point.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para15"></a>The second point was about couples. The situation depends whether we are talking about someone under immigration control. A partner who is not subject to immigration control can make a claim, but no second adult element is available in respect of the partner. However, income from both partners is taken into account. I hope that addresses the two specific points that the noble Lord raised. If not, I shall come back on that.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para16"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, was kind enough to give me notice of his concerns relating to the Treaty of Rome. I am not sure that I am using the appropriate Home Office language&#151;I hope Members of the Committee will forgive me if I am not&#151;but we are talking about three categories of person: British nationals resident in this country; EU nationals working in this country; and people who are subject to immigration control who are working in this country. Those are our three starting categories.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para17"></a>A claimant, of whatever nationality, who is an EU national and is resident and working in the United Kingdom will be eligible for child tax credits at the moment, on the grounds that it is a family benefit <P>


<a name="column_CWH74"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under EC Regulation 1408/721. That is what we presume, although it is still being consulted on and my comments should have a lot of health warnings attached. Working tax credit is outside the scope of Regulation 1408/721, but we believe that it may be within the scope of Regulation 1612/68, which protects the rights of migrant workers. Our regulation will co-exist with these rules. I do not know whether that is helpful to the noble Earl.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para18"></a>Insofar as there is a family benefit involved, EU nationals are treated in exactly the same way as British nationals. Equally, if someone is subject to immigration control at the moment and working in this country, there is no expectation. They may be seeking asylum or they may be from a country such as Australia and be working here with a work permit and have come here on the grounds that they will not have any recourse to public funds. At the moment they are not eligible to WFTC or DPTC. I expect that situation to continue. I do not know whether that addresses the points raised by the noble Earls, Lord Russell and Lord Northesk, but I shall come back on that if necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   Would there be any advantage in using the words "resident" or "ordinarily resident" in the United Kingdom, which I understand to be income tax jargon? Would that be of any help?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That would be different. This system uses the phrase "habitually resident", and the tax system, I understand, uses "ordinarily resident". Although in practice the two are virtually the same, habitual residence assumes that someone was here at the point at which the investigation was made. "Ordinarily resident" might cover some of the examples that the noble Earl, Lord Russell gave&#151;that, at that point of inquiry, they might not have been habitually resident for the previous six weeks, but there is no doubt that this is their ordinary home.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-28_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The Minister has taken us a little further forward, but the odd man out in the Minister's three categories is the British subject working in other EU countries. That person's freedom of movement within the EU is undoubtedly being discouraged by the fact that he will lose the tax credit on going abroad. The Minister cannot very well deny that if she regards the tax credit as an incentive to work within this country, which is, after all, the basic purpose of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para19"></a>Time has not permitted me to follow the Treaty of Rome down into the provisions of the Single European Act. This is the examining season as well as the Bill season. However, I have no doubt that, were I to look at the Single European Act, I would find a whole range of material intended to discourage people from discouraging people from working as migrant workers within the EU. One must not discourage the free movement of labour within the Community.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para20"></a>Because this Bill is currently very likely indeed to have the effect of discouraging the free movement of labour within the Community, I hope the Government <P>


<a name="column_CWH75"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH75</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will take the maximum possible amount of advice on European law before letting the Bill go ahead. I wish the Bill to succeed and I do not want it to crash down in flames in the European Court of Justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We have taken quite considerable advice on this. The test for what I call the high value benefit&#151;child tax credit&#151;is residence in the UK, not nationality within the EU. That is why we avoid discrimination; we are treating like for like. So an EU national working in the UK is treated in the same way as a UK citizen. If a UK citizen is abroad for more than a temporary period&#151;obviously that has to be determined following consultation and guidance; we are not trying to get at somebody who is away for a matter of a few weeks&#151;we would treat them as a national of another country working in their own home. That is the basis. It is residence and not nationality.
<P>

<a name="20521-28_para21"></a>I am advised that that is what the Treaty of Rome provides for; that a worker moving abroad will be entitled to support from the host state on the same basis as a national of that host state. It is residence and not nationality that counts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-29_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   If the Minister has avoided Scylla, has she not charged straight into Charybdis? If she avoids discrimination, is she not therefore, by the very act which avoids discrimination, taking herself straight into the face of the charge that she is discouraging freedom of movement of workers within the EU? Those are both legitimate objectives in European law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I suspect&#151;though I may well be wrong&#151;that the logic of the noble Earl's position is that if tax credits were to follow a British citizen to a long-term placement in Germany or France, we would have no grounds to stop us paying to German and French citizens the same tax credits, otherwise we would be distinguishing in favour of British citizens working in Germany. I do not think the noble Earl wants to take us down that route.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-29_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I hope that the Minister will take further advice on this. I cannot see that the present position will stand up to legal scrutiny. I should like to see the Bill drafted in a way that does. I am not capable of doing that entirely on my own; I doubt if the Minister is either. I hope we will discuss this matter further. Meanwhile, I have taken it as far as I can at present, and I am content to leave it there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I shall write to the noble Earl.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-29_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I am grateful for the two specific answers given by the Minister. Perhaps I can press her a little further on one specific point. Is it the intention that the circumstances in subsection (5) are to be horrendously complicated or relatively simple? Perhaps she would clarify that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-29_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am sure the intention is that they should be relatively simple. The noble Earl would not expect me to give any other answer. This is <P>

This is rather technical and I should like to follow it up by writing to the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. Again, if he feels that my answer is not full enough, or if he feels that there are still obscurities, I invite him to probe it on Report.

<P>

<a name="20521-29_para4"></a><P>

<a name="20521-29_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: I should begin by acknowledging that Amendment No. 237 in the name of my noble friend Lord Freeman in this grouping achieves my intended purpose far more effectively and elegantly than Amendment No. 31. Nonetheless, there are issues here of underlying principle that I hope the Minister will comment upon in due course.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para6"></a>Self-evidently, the purpose of the amendment is to make allowance for a claimant, or someone acting for him, to meet an official to provide necessary information to establish a claim. It would, of course, be inappropriate to commit officials to having to conduct face-to-face interviews in all cases. Nonetheless, there are a number of reasons why it is important that the lines of communication between claimants and officials need to be buttressed.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para7"></a>I start with Clause 3(1) of the Bill, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Entitlement to a tax credit is dependent on the making of a claim for it."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-29_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20521-29_para9"></a>The logical inference of this is that, notwithstanding the increased use of means testing, the Government could be said to be moving towards a system of self-assessment of benefit entitlement. The responsibility and onus of proving a right to and obtaining a tax credit is, in the main, imposed on the individual claimant. No doubt the Inland Revenue will be proactive in offering assistance to those seeking to submit their claims. Indeed, the assurances offered in this respect by the Paymaster General and the Financial Secretary in another place afford some comfort. It is a source of anxiety, however, that there is little enough on the face of the Bill to this effect. Here we should not lose sight of the Government's stated determination to instil a greater focus on customer service and satisfaction, as delineated in the Performance and Innovation Unit's report, Reforming the Public Services: Principles into Practice, which states on page 11 that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The starting point must be that the public has a right . . . to income support, and that it is the duty of the Government to secure these rights on their behalf".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-29_para10"></a><P>


<a name="column_CWH77"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Taken at face value, therefore, the Revenue has a "duty" to do as much as it can to facilitate the delivery of tax credits to those who qualify&#151;a duty that is magnified by the Government's proposal to integrate benefits and tax. The Revenue will, in effect, be delivering an essential public service that, according to the Government's thinking, needs to be focused towards customer satisfaction.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para11"></a>Of course, the logic of face-to-face interviews is underpinned by the two important issues of take-up and fraud. The system of tax credits introduced by the Bill is undeniably complex, especially for the client groups at whom it is aimed. Of itself, this argues in favour of proactive involvement by the Revenue to enhance take-up. Here the significance of the Government's proposition to integrate benefits with the tax system should not be under-estimated. It opens up the possibility of deploying the supposed boon of data matching and the myriad other analytical tools that are now possible, provided of course that the relevant software is programmed and written properly. In passing, I merely make the point that at the same time it introduces the potential bane of infringement of rights to privacy. It is intriguing that the Government feel able to cite figures on the take-up of tax credits with relative precision, however they may be calculated. Indeed, as the Minister observed last week:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We know already who many of the recipients will be. They are families who are currently claiming WFTC, DPTC and the child tax credit. Those families will be sent a form directly later this year. We also know, obviously, the families on IS and JSA who will be eligible. So there is a lot of automaticity in the process". [Official Report, 16/5/02; col. CWH51]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-29_para12"></a>
In other words, it could be inferred that one of the potential rewards of integration is that it opens up the Orwellian possibility of the Government being able, via data matching techniques and so on, to identify claimants almost on an individual basis. That being so, the Revenue could and perhaps should be more actively involved in enlightening potential claimants of their entitlement, thereby improving levels of take-up. Equally, the Revenue could&#151;and again, perhaps should&#151;be using the data available to it to identify instances where claims are likely to be on the cusp of entitlement or potentially fraudulent. Insofar as this analysis is accurate, it is all the more extraordinary that the Government have been so reticent in providing information about the levels of fraud that have been identified in the working families' tax credit&#151;a matter to which I alluded last week. After all, despite indicating that their investigation into a benchmarking exercise on this would be available in September 2001, here we are eight months later still faced with an uneasy silence.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para13"></a>Be that as it may, there is legitimacy in the argument that against this background, face-to-face interviews would work to the benefit of both claimants and the Revenue. It would empower claimants who are uncertain or confused as to their eligibility and would afford the Revenue a valuable filter to establish the legitimacy of claims. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20521-29_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 237, standing in my name. As this is the first amendment that I am speaking to, I refer the Committee to my declaration of interests already registered, although none is pertinent to this debate. What is relevant is the fact that I salute and march alongside in sympathy with the views of the low incomes tax relief group, from which I have sought guidance and advice on this Bill and, as the Minister will recall, on the working families' tax credit Bill two years ago.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para14"></a>I very much agree with what my noble friend has said about Amendment No. 31. My amendment deals in part only with what my noble friend said, but it is a matter of principle, not procedure. It may look like procedure but underlying it is an important point.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para15"></a>The background to the point is that a great number of additional claimants&#151;and this is most welcome&#151;are being drawn into the right to claim these tax credits. An even larger number of claimants will need their rights re-assessed because they are already claiming one of the predecessor tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para16"></a>We are dealing with a large number of people and a matter that is quite complex, as the proceedings of the Committee have already borne out. Where one has a large number of people&#151;and therefore a lot of money and complication&#151;there lies the seeds not only of misdirection by the claimants but of inequity.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para17"></a>I raised a number of issues prior to and during Second Reading and the Minister kindly wrote to me on 8th May. In her letter the Minister referred specifically to the subject matter of the amendment. She stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As well as the comprehensive guidance notes that will be supplied with the form, help in filling it in will be available over the phone or on-line"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-29_para18"></a>
I assume that means by reference to the website&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Claimants will also be able to get help at their local Inland Revenue Office."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-29_para19"></a><P>

<a name="20521-29_para20"></a>That is not enough with legislation of this complexity. It is directly at odds with the system that prevails in the social security offices that I have to deal with for my former constituents where there is, de facto, a right of audience with an official. Indeed, those who served in another place will remember going with constituents to help them in their discussions&#151;and, indeed, negotiations&#151;with officials.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para21"></a>That is not the case with Inland Revenue offices. I refer to an earlier answer given by the Minister to my noble friend Lord Northbrook. She said that there will be an extension of the network of local Inland Revenue offices, but I wonder whether we are doing the claimants proper justice by not giving them an absolute right to a face-to-face interview to answer some or all of the points that I have put in my amendment. There is a big difference between the procedure which we are now abandoning and the system to be administered by the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="20521-29_para22"></a>I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Russell, will help me. I cannot conclude my brief contribution without seeking to emulate him, very badly, with a quote. I suggest that we should move from the situation&#151;I <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Again, I can give a full reply, but I wonder whether we are making somewhat heavy weather of this. Most of those coming over to the new benefits will either be existing recipients of benefits, as the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, identified when he talked about automaticity, or will be currently claiming WFTC or DPTC, and therefore we will be able to help them. We will also know of course the case load for children's tax credit. Given that, we will be able to send claims forms to all of those households. The number of new and additional families which are currently unknown by the system will be relatively modest. If I can help your Lordships with the stats on that, I will do so.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para0"></a>Alongside that, we will also be running a publicity campaign. Once that is in place, people will be able to make their claims on line, over the phone or, at their request, in an interview at either a DWP job centre office or an Inland Revenue office. It does not seem sensible to impose an interview on people who do not want it. What is important is that anyone who wants it has access to it. When they fill in their forms&#151;particularly if they make inquiries over the telephone&#151;if it is clear that they would find a face-to-face interview helpful, then that will be made available to them.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para1"></a>Do I need to go on much beyond that? If I do, I shall happily come back to it. I am thinking about the procedures of the House and trying to expedite matters if I can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. There is a difference between what the Minister explained, which is that there is a panoply of ways in which the rights of a claimant can be explained, and Amendment No. 237 which says that every claimant who wishes it has the right to a face-to-face interview with officials from the Inland Revenue. That is different.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Anybody who wishes an interview&#151;either with the Inland Revenue or, if it is more appropriate, at the job centre club&#151;will be encouraged to have an interview. I do not see that there is a problem here. It is not the sort of thing we put on the face of a Bill but whether it takes place with the DWP or with the Inland Revenue depends where they are coming from.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para2"></a>Going back to the automaticity, it is indeed as I suspected. The only two groups for whom we will not have some information already are those who are newly eligible for child tax credit, because they are single earners over about &#163;41,000&#151;there are not many of those&#151;or indeed those receiving just WFTC, the single adults or the childless couples, of whom there are some 300,000. Given that we can get information to well over 5 million or so of the 5.7 million who will be eligible for child tax credits automatically; given that we have an extensive publicity campaign; given <P>


<a name="column_CWH80"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that people can fill in their forms online, over the telephone or in an interview; and given that there will be a helpline that people can call which will certainly make it clear that they can come in for an interview, I wonder whether the noble Lord will agree that there is abundant information and help for potential claimants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I am sorry to labour the point. If the Minister is saying that every claimant does have the right to a face-to-face interview with an official from the Inland Revenue, that takes us a long way forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The proviso I made there was DWP. Many people will currently be receiving benefits and their natural home will be the Job Centre Plus rather than the Inland Revenue. Without exception, anyone who seeks an interview will, I am assured, be offered one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   With whichever department they prefer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   With whichever one is appropriate. If somebody is on benefit and will be receiving the child tax credit because they are on income support, and they are not a taxpayer and have no dealings with the Inland Revenue, it would not be particularly sensible to suggest that they went along to the local tax office. Their natural point of contact would be DWP. However, if there were some peculiar circumstances in which they felt it was more appropriate, I do not see why that would be a problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. That assurance is extremely useful. The substantive point I was trying to tease out with my amendment is that my perception of the structure of the Bill is that it is weighted very much in favour of the Revenue, rather than understanding that the Revenue sits there with a duty of care, almost, to claimants. That was the substantive point I was trying to get at. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Saatchi </B>   moved Amendment No. 32:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 13, at end insert ", provided that no tax credit claim form shall exceed a single page of A4 paper"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-30_para4"></a><P>

<a name="20521-30_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 32 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 33 and 236. These amendments, and particularly Amendment No. 32, lie at the heart of our concerns about the Bill. I shall give a moment's background to the amendments if I may.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para6"></a>Amendment No. 32 obviously seeks to replace the present formidably complex claims systems with something simpler. Amendment No. 33 seeks the Minister's thoughts on the fact that BUPA and many other insurers have abandoned the old-style claim form approach and replaced it with making claims by speaking to an operator with a computer, who asks them the necessary questions and inputs only the necessary answers. The modern approach of large insurers involves having someone of experience and <P>


<a name="column_CWH81"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>knowledge asking only the relevant questions and directly putting the answers onto the computer system. The Government could do this by providing either an interview with an official, as my noble friend suggested in a previous amendment, by telephone or by e-mail. Ultimately the savings to the Government could be great if they can make their computer systems live up to their promise.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para7"></a>Our main point, also made by my noble friend on the previous amendment, is that this procedure would help the applicant. Amendment No. 33 seeks a response from the Government and asks what is the stumbling block to the introduction of such a system for tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para8"></a>I would like to dwell for a moment on Amendment No. 32 in order to put it into context. Although the amendment concerns simplicity, I am afraid I shall have to speak to it at some length. I am embarrassed about that. My only comment in defence of the length of what I am going to say is to repeat a line Winston Churchill liked to quote from Mark Twain's letter to a friend:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I wanted to write a short letter, but I didn't have time".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-30_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20521-30_para10"></a>Perhaps I may try to put Amendment No. 32 into context. Most people believe that the tax system now takes around 39 per cent of GDP, but that is just the end result of the system. The total system collects a staggering total of 53 per cent of GDP. The citizen is then obliged to claim back 14 per cent of GDP, around &#163;143 billion, by navigating a mass of over 250 complex tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions, credits&#151;the subject of the Bill&#151;tapers, indexations, disregards and so forth. I have details of some of the means by which the citizen makes those claims. I have here a pile of the claim forms used by the Department for Work and Pensions, amounting to a total of 1,158 pages.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para11"></a>The charm of such a complicated tax system, from the point of view of the Government, is the scope it allows for hidden tax increases via reduced allowances or, in the case of the Bill, the reduced value of tax credits. Under this structure the Chancellor can increase the tax burden without ever announcing a tax rise. People simply wake up and find they are in a higher tax bracket, with the result that tax as a percentage of national income creeps up invisibly.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para12"></a>Economists call this "fiscal drag", and it is part of the reason why, over the past three years, the Government's tax revenues have risen three times faster than average earnings. The basic tax allowance of &#163;4,365 should now be &#163;10,000 to keep pace with earnings growth. We have to remember that this is no longer a problem affecting only a small minority of people. As my noble friend Lord Freeman said a moment ago, it affects a very large number of people and concerns a very large sum of money.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para13"></a>The Bill will ensure that around 40 per cent of all families in this country will be on means-tested benefits of some kind. Tax credits will go to 56 per cent of those in retirement. The introduction of the pension credit will further extend means testing amongst pensioners. By 2025 it will increase the proportion of people being <P>


<a name="column_CWH82"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>means tested to approximately 65 per cent of single pensioners and 51 per cent of couples. In fact, 90 per cent of all households in the country are now eligible for a credit or benefit of some kind.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para14"></a>Let us consider pensioners for a moment. In response to the Government's pension credit proposals, this is what Age Concern had to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The good intentions behind the pensioner credit could yet be thwarted by its complexity . . . Older people already feel lost in the means-tested maze, resulting in up to three-quarters of a million families failing to claim their income support. Unless people feel encouraged to claim it will simply not reach those it is designed to help. It is far too complex and over-elaborate. We need a system which is simple, understandable and which accords a proper dignity to pensioners".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-30_para15"></a><P>

<a name="20521-30_para16"></a>The difficulty that Age Concern describes about its pensioners is not an aberration, and it is not a condition which applies only to the pensioner credit. The problems that it describes are central to the system with which the Bill deals. That is because the requirements for income tax have never reached so far down the income scale. So today people suffer not just because their incomes are too low, but because even people on low incomes have their already low income further reduced by tax.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para17"></a>Under the present system, the Government first taxes people on their income; then it means tests their income; then it offers them a 40-page application form to claim credits or benefits. Yet every year billions of pounds&#151;that is the point of this amendment&#151;of budgeted expenditure on tax credits go unclaimed by millions of citizens who cannot fathom out how to claim them.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para18"></a>We should remember that the working families' tax credit had a take-up of 62 per cent. Only 72 per cent of entitled families with children had claimed the children's tax credit by December 2001. This year it is estimated that &#163;2.6 billion of budgeted expenditure on tax credits will go unclaimed.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para19"></a>That is why we believe it is incumbent on us here in Parliament to simplify the procedure wherever we can. We all know about stealth tax. That is a tax charge which is unknown or incomprehensible to its victim. I put it to the Committee that without Amendment No. 32 or something like it, the Bill is in danger of introducing us to a new and even more insidious form of tax raising; that is, the non-payment of a tax relief or tax credit. One might call it a stealth credit or tax relief which, by accident or design, are unknown or incomprehensible to their beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para20"></a>There is one crucial difference between a stealth tax and a stealth credit which I should like to draw to the attention of the Committee. The stealth tax is unerring in its reach. It achieves 100 per cent "take-up". The stealth credit, on the other hand, reaches only 60 per cent of its beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para21"></a>The table on page 154 of the Red Book illustrates to the Committee the importance of this point. This table shows, very helpfully, the impact of Budget changes. It shows a &#163;4.6 billion tax rise&#151;namely, national insurance contribution increases and personal tax rises&#151;and a &#163;4.6 billion tax reduction in the form of tax credit. The problem is that, unless the take-up of <P>


<a name="column_CWH83"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the tax credit is as high as the take-up of the tax payment, the &#163;4.6 billion of tax rise in the last Budget from NICs will be paid to the Government. However, our fear is that the &#163;4.6 billion of tax reductions from tax credits will not be paid by the Government. That is unfair, and this amendment will help to correct that injustice.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para22"></a>Perhaps I may continue for a moment on what we believe to be the crucial nature of the direction of this amendment. The Government, I am sure, do not wish to be accused of taking advantage of the poorest and neediest people in our society and there is no need for them to put themselves in that position. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, said&#151;I am sure the noble Baroness has said this also&#151;that child and pensioner poverty is an obscenity in the 21st century, especially in a country like ours with the fourth largest economy in the world. I do not need to labour the point.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para23"></a>The Government are right to put poverty at the centre of their social and fiscal policies and I can see that tax credit legislation like this can be an important tool to achieve that end. However, if the Government are sincere in that wish, they should heed perhaps not the words of the Opposition Front Bench on this amendment, but their own Members in another place. For example, the Member for Hampstead and Highgate, Glenda Jackson, said in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a gap in people's understanding of the working families' tax credit, how they can apply for it and the benefits that it can bring."&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 12/2/02; col. 31WH.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-30_para24"></a><P>

<a name="20521-30_para25"></a>Diane Abbott, the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, the constituency with the highest number of single parents in the country, commented in another place that as an Inner London MP she found that the working families' tax credit had not had the impact on her constituents that she would have liked. She went on to draw attention to the disparity between what the Government had said about the new schemes and the experience of her poorest constituents:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There was a mismatch between the bulging files of press releases announcing new Government initiatives in my office and people's perception of what was being delivered".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 12/2/02; col. 34WH.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-30_para26"></a><P>

<a name="20521-30_para27"></a>I know the Minister will say that she and the Government are looking at the problem of take-up, that they are very conscious of it and are consulting various stakeholders. I gather that the Government are carrying out a wide-ranging evaluation programme on the problem of take-up. Perhaps she will confirm that point. No doubt her officials will continue their dialogue with key groups which can help. I hope that she will tell us about the status of that work so that we can learn from the results. We would very much like to know the views of the Minister on how to tackle the problem of take-up, if not via this amendment, then something like it.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para28"></a>In closing, I offer an area that she might want to address in her response. Many Members of another place said that in their constituencies, when they spoke to people about tax credits, they found that there was profound ignorance, for example, of the WFTC. People simply did not know whether they were eligible <P>


<a name="column_CWH84"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for it. The quality of advice given in employment offices was often variable, and not many people went to the Employment Service or other agencies to receive better assessments. They simply did not have the figures to show them whether they would be better off with the credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para29"></a>This point was underlined by the publication of the latest Government statistics on benefit take-up. As other noble Lords have done in our debates, it drew attention to the root problem of complexity. For example, the report entitled Income Related Benefits: Estimates of Take-up in 1999/2000 showed that the take-up of income support was lowest for pensioners at between 64 per cent and 78 per cent by caseload, and between 74 per cent and 86 per cent by expenditure. There was also evidence that the percentage of entitled pensioners taking up income support fell between 1999 and 2000.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para30"></a>The report also showed that last year, 500,000 eligible pensioners were not receiving income support; this year, the figure has risen to 580,000. Last year, 150,000 eligible pensioners were not receiving housing benefit; this year, that figure has grown to 210,000. Last year, there were 1,070,000 eligible pensioners not receiving council tax benefit; this year the figure is 1,215,000.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para31"></a>I apologise again for the length of this introduction to the amendment. Our starting point for Amendment No. 32 is a tax system of "paralysing complexity" according to the editor of the Financial Times. "A monstrous thing" says the editor of the Economist. In our opinion, simplicity, such as the simplicity we seek in a claim form, is the outcome of technical subtlety. It is the goal, not the starting point. It requires what I believe the noble Earl, Lord Russell's father called,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the painful necessity of thought"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-30_para32"></a>
to make it simple. The Government like to say that the Bill is a simplifying measure. We would very much like them to prove it by accepting the amendment. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_time0"></a><H5>5 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-30_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 236, which has been grouped with Amendment No. 32 and with which I am in full agreement. I shall take up the point made by my noble friend about the degree to which individual citizens with rights properly claim them and take them up. I suspect I might be pushing at an open door here, but I invite the noble Baroness to look through the other end of the telescope at the semantics used by the claimant, the individual.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para33"></a>There is a difference between an "application",&#151;a word used in the draft forms from the Inland Revenue, which I am sure she has read and on which her officials will have briefed her&#151;referring to an application form, which implies discretion, and a claim, which is on the face of the Bill, which implies not a discretionary matter, but an absolute right.
<P>

<a name="20521-30_para34"></a>It seems to me that all the literature that will emanate from this legislation when it becomes an Act&#151;as I hope it will after proper reform of the Bill&#151;will refer to the "right" to a claim and not to an <P>


<a name="column_CWH85"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>"application". Perhaps I should remind the Members of the Committee that when you draft&#151;or when your accountant drafts&#151;your tax refund form, you are not making an application but an absolute claim. I believe that that is the word we should use.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   In tabling Amendment No. 32, the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, has been too trusting. It reminds me of a Bill which was tabled in another place in 1606. Clerks then used to be paid by the line. Some of them attempted, unilaterally and arbitrarily, to increase the rate per line at which they were paid. A Member tabled a Bill to restrict them to a specific number of pence per line. Another Back-Bencher got up and said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Watch out. If you pass this Bill, all they'll do is have fewer words in each line!"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-31_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20521-31_para1"></a>If the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, is agreed to, all we will get is very much smaller print&#151; which I, for one, will find very difficult to read. The Bill was withdrawn; I hope that the amendment will be also.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My experience on other Bills suggests the contrary. We will get a one page sheet to fill in and a 200-page explanatory memorandum.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   All of these propositions are tempting. Again I shall be very brief. I am sure that the Committee will understand if I stay with the amendment that is on the Marshalled List rather than be tempted into the broader issues of the fiscal drag and so on raised by the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, which he argued very eloquently at Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para2"></a>If there is a particular concern about take-up it might be valuable if the noble Lord could bring forward an appropriate amendment to open-up this issue at Report stage, when I will come back very specifically on take-up. If I can give him any particular information in regard to our assumptions on take-up and how we seek to overcome any problems, I will be happy to do so.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para3"></a>Taking the amendments back to front, the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, is probably right in regard to Amendment No. 236. However, given that the words "application form" and so on have been used by the Inland Revenue, I should like to ask the officials to discuss this with the appropriate voluntary groups with whom we are consulting in order to discover what terminology is preferred by their clients. I will then come back to the noble Lord on the outcome of those discussions. He may well be right, but let us look to see what we end up with in terms of consistency with existing tax practices as opposed to the outcome of consultations with the group.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para4"></a>The first two amendments&#151;I have dealt with the third, I hope&#151;would restrict the length of any claim form to one page of A4. They would provide that a claim may be made by means of an interview, conducted in person, over the phone or by electronic means. The noble Lord did not say very much about that.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH86"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para5"></a>As to the point about the one page, I have here a draft, a mock-up of what the claim form may look like, which consists of some 12 pages of print. Even with my poor eyesight, it is big enough to read. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, is quite right: a one page A4 form would allow you to list, in fairly small font, your name, your partner's name, address, nationality and phone number. If you had only one child he or she would be included on page one, but any more would be left off altogether, I suspect.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para6"></a>It would have to exclude all reference to disability, hours, wages and employer; it would have to exclude all questions about any other income and savings; it would have to exclude all reference to preferred method of payment; and it would have to exclude all reference to childcare. There is no conceivable way that that could be put on such a form.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, will help me, but I think it was the Victorians who used to be rather good at producing a Bible on rice paper measuring about an inch and a half by an inch and giving a magnifying glass with which to read it. On the substance of the amendment, I hope the noble Earl will realise we cannot do as he asks.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para8"></a>Having said that, just as the MIG forms were rightly reduced from 40 or 50 pages&#151;with questions on subjects from pregnancy to pensions&#151;to 10 or 12 pages, partly as a result of pressure from your Lordship's House, so this form is a model of clarity and simplicity. I would be happy to circulate draft copies to your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para9"></a>We have taken up the point about interviews being available if people want them, but it is sensible that people start by filling in a claim form&#151;unless they expressly do not wish to do so&#151;and then follow that by going through to a help line and an interview on any parts that they may find difficult. If we say that all claim forms have to be filled in at an interview, we can be sure as little kittens that the applicant's capacious shopping bags&#151;or my capacious shopping bag or the capacious shopping bag of the noble Earl, Lord Russell&#151;will not have all the papers and other things that they need for the interview. A simple form such as this&#151;which is simpler than the housing benefit form that most pensioners fill in, infinitely simpler than the JSA form introduced by a previous administration and about as simple as the new MIG forms that underpin pension credit&#151;is the way forward, with the further option of either a helpline or interview for those parts that people need further help on, such as what counts as income or what level of savings should be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para10"></a>I hope that your Lordships agree that we are going the right way on this. It is a very simple form with plenty of back-up and plenty of publicity. I would be very disappointed if the amendments were not withdrawn. These benefits are remarkable in terms of their decency and their problem-solving ability in helping those who are poor without reducing the incentive to go into the labour market. We have come up with some extraordinarily effective solutions, such <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The draft will come with a health warning, because obviously the final draft is determined in consultation with user groups and voluntary organisations, but if it would be helpful to your Lordships, I will do my best to get it circulated.

I have been most deeply impressed by her radiant sincerity about the merits of the Bill and her passionate belief in what it is trying to do. However, I am surprised that she does not find it completely unacceptable that 40 per cent of the people who have a right to these credits do not receive them on the grounds of complexity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I do not know where the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, is getting his stats from. It is certainly true that the original survey, conducted about nine months after WFTC had been introduced, showed that there was a 62 per cent take-up. The latest figures we have, which I gave on Second Reading, show a further 14 to 16 per cent increase on those figures. That is why I am baffled by the noble Lord's stance. We are talking about a cash take-up of over 80 per cent and a case take-up of something like 76 per cent. From our research, we also know that those people not claiming are those who are due very small sums, perhaps &#163;1 or &#163;2.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para12"></a>I also said that approximately 25 per cent of those who were entitled to family credit but did not claim it went on to claim WFTC.
<P>

<a name="20521-31_para13"></a>I also argue that it takes time to build up but we expect 85 per cent plus take-up at the very least of the new tax credits for those who will be claiming both working tax credit and children's tax credit. What we cannot give is a figure for the 300,000 who will be eligible only for the working tax credit simply because we do not have any experience of targeting this benefit at that group. If, however, we fail to reach those figures, then the noble Lord is absolutely right and I shall certainly be one of the most disappointed and distressed parliamentarians in your Lordships' <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Chamber. However, I have no reason to think&#151;from the degree of automaticity and the fact that almost all of those who will come within reach are already within either the tax revenue system or the DWP system&#151;that we will not meet those figures and, I hope, overtake them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I am grateful to be brought up to date on the figures. Would the Minister be able to bring me up to date on the latest view of the amount of money involved in tax credits not taken up? In my remarks I used what I believed to be the current figure, which is that the Government will save &#163;2.6 billion by not paying tax credits to those who are eligible to receive them. Could the Minister confirm that figure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-31_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I cannot confirm that figure because I do not have it in the form I have been talking about. What is put in the accounts is not actually a statement of the cost of 100 per cent take-up; it is based on the previous year's estimate with possibly a little head space to manage the expected expenditure pattern. We would have to do some work on that. If I can obtain that figure, I shall certainly give it to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Will the Minister say what is the take-up assumption behind the &#163;4.6 billion cost of tax credits in the Red Book?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am sorry, I thought I had given the noble Lord that just now. We were expecting to see 85 per cent take-up of tax credit. The figure is not higher than that because there are 300,000 people who live in childless families&#151;either single adults or couples&#151;who currently are not eligible for any financial support. We do not know how many of those we shall be able to reach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Were there to be a shortfall on the 85 per cent figure, can the Minister say whether there is a mechanism by which those who are eligible and have the right to those tax credits, but who have not taken them up and therefore are not part of the 85 per cent, could receive them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We shall come later to an amendment about back-dating&#151;the noble Lord will understand the provisions of back-dating the Bill&#151;and we can discuss it then. At the moment our intention is that back-dating applies for about three months for those who have failed to claim. For those who have over-claimed, it would go back to the point at which the claim was started.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   The reason for my disappointment with the Minister's response is that I believe that the Prime Minister likes to say that we all have rights and responsibilities. As my learned friend said, it has been determined that the citizens, the people, have the right to these tax credits. The responsibility falls on the Government to make sure that they receive them. I did not have the impression from the Minister's remarks that she really takes the point that the claim forms are <P>

Amendment No. 34 leaves out paragraph (f) of Clause 4(1).

<P>

<a name="20521-32_para4"></a>Amendment No. 35 seeks to ensure that the Revenue satisfies itself as to the identity of a person making a claim on behalf of another, and that that person is acting genuinely in that capacity.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-32_para6"></a><P>

<a name="20521-32_para7"></a>What interests me is the extent of this part of the Bill. As drafted, it is of pretty unlimited potential application. The amendment I have tabled&#151;I assure Members of the Committee that I would have no intention of pressing it, even if we were not in Grand Committee&#151;is that,
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-32_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20521-32_para9"></a>The question is, of course, how far anybody has the right to refuse to allow another person to act for them. I can think of circumstances dealing with couples who have separated perhaps during the tax year and perhaps under highly contentious circumstances, or even under potentially dangerous circumstances, where they would not in the least wish to have anyone else acting for them. Because of the use of the word "may" about communicating information, I need not ask for any further amendment of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para10"></a>I merely want to ask the Minister, first, what is actually intended with this power. Secondly, is there any way in which it could be drafted it to make the vires a little less unlimited in their extent, to restrict their intention, which I am sure is a good one, to something a little closer to the words of the Bill so that it does not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>authorise a whole mass of actions which it does not really want to authorise? I await the Minister's reply with interest and with a certain degree of optimism.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-32_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, asked about the nature and scale of the issue. It may be helpful if I can give him some information. Currently, working families' tax credit and disabled person's tax credit claims may be made on behalf of a person unable to act by themselves by an "appointee". An appointee is someone appointed as a receiver by the Court of Protection or as a guardian, tutor or curator by another court of law, or someone who has been specifically appointed by a Secretary of State or Board of Inland Revenue to act on behalf of that person for the purposes of claims for benefits or tax credits. Regulation 33 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 sets this out in detail. The provision is of particular benefit to those with severe disabilities or learning difficulties who may not be able physically to complete a claim form, but who may be eligible.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para11"></a>At this point I may be able to give the noble Earl some further information. My understanding is that around 1,000 DPTCs&#151;disability awards&#151;are currently made in cases where an appointee acts on the claimant's behalf. That is quite a small proportion, only about 3 per cent of the total, with three-quarters of those being appointee cases made by the Secretary of State or Board of the Inland Revenue. The rest are court order appointments. Around 20 per cent, 200 of those cases, are spouses appointed on their partners' behalf, but those cases are all investigations considered to be cases where the claimant is genuinely unable to act.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para12"></a>I have checked and none of the staff in our unit can recall a case where a spouse was appointed when the other spouse could have acted on their own behalf. We have no evidence at all, therefore, to suggest that the issue of appointment and appointees has at any stage been abused. The numbers are so small and the procedure so rigorous that that has not occurred.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para13"></a>If the noble Earl has any evidence to the contrary, then he should let me know. However, I have pursued the matter in some detail because it seemed very important. I was concerned about undue pressure, given that these are high value benefits. Given the procedure, we have no evidence that this has occurred under the existing benefit claims, except entirely to the advantage of the claimant. I hope he will agree that we do not need to elaborate on the procedures we already have, because they seem to be working. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, asks us to introduce a safeguard into the provisions. In this case it is where an appointee is responding to an end-of-year notice under Clause 17. I stress that no appointee would be appointed by the Board of Inland Revenue if it is not in the best interests of the claimant to do so.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para14"></a>Amendment No. 100 would not allow appointees to act on a person's behalf in response to a Clause 17 notice if the person was fit and of sound mind, unless the person consented. I do not think that provision is necessary, because it is already the case. I shall check <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20521-32_para18"></a>The noble Earl said: It is addictive, it has happened a second time: I am actually moving another amendment. This deals with the time in which claims for tax credits can be made. They are to be made in a prescribed manner and within a prescribed time.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para19"></a>Some of your Lordships may remember a Bill that was drafted by the Law Commission and raised at Question Time in the Chamber and discussed in various other ways about a year or so ago. It was a Bill to repeal the clause in the Statute of Gloucester of 1278, which said that a case cannot be counted as murder if death should happen more than a year and a day after the original injury was inflicted. Life support machines have made that out of date.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para20"></a>That serves to remind us that even the most carefully and generously thought-out time limit may occasionally turn out to be irrelevant to the facts of the case. There may be cases in which people do not make a claim because they are on a life support machine and are not capable of reasoning, hearing or working out anything for themselves. Mental illness can also create such a condition. It is unfair that such serious disadvantages should also prevent those who suffer from them putting in a claim for a tax credit to which they might be entitled.
<P>

<a name="20521-32_para21"></a>I put down an amendment along roughly these lines to the Child Support Act 1991. I did not move it because it would have come up at 2 a.m. I found to my intense surprise that for the next stage of the Bill the amendment was down in the name of the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor. I was not quite as fortunate in 1995. On the other hand, the principle was accepted in the regulations that we discussed last Tuesday, which were, happily, passed. As a general principle it has been accepted twice by government. Doing the hat-trick is rather nice. I hope it might happen this time. I beg to move.

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particular circumstances, such as the claimant having been ill or other circumstances outside the claimant's control. Of course, the Secretary of State does not have authority over tax credits, which will be under the care and management of the Board of Inland Revenue. Nevertheless, the principle of the amendment is clear.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para0"></a>I am not sure whether the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is pressing me on the issue of time limits or whether he envisages other categories of need that are not covered by the existing wording of Clause 4, which provides,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that a claim for a tax credit is to be treated as made by a person or persons in such other circumstances as may be prescribed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-33_para1"></a>
That prescription includes physical or mental illness.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para2"></a>I wonder to what extent the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is seeking to push me on time limits, or whether he is seeking to push me on circumstances that he thinks would not be covered by mental or physical illness. Perhaps he can help me on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-33_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I was thinking of circumstances that might not be covered. One of the commonest delayed claims that I have to put in is failure of my P60 to appear when it should, and that sort of thing may delay a claim for reasons which are in no way the fault of the person who is making the claim. Is it possible to give any consideration to that type of case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes. I have a comment on the life-support machine. It would be difficult to conceive of circumstances in which that would come into play. That individual would not be responsible for a child and would not be working, and therefore would not be eligible for tax credits in that particular situation. They may be one of a couple, and in those circumstances the other partner would claim on behalf of both of them; in other words, we get back to the "appointee" discussion we have just had.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para3"></a>The noble Earl was concerned about forms which go astray. At present, for the most part, under the general rules for income support, JSA, and so on, claims take effect the day they are made, and they can, in very limited circumstances, be back-dated for up to three months for severe illnesses. Currently, in other limited circumstances the claim may be back-dated for one month; for example, in cases of transport or postal difficulties.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para4"></a>These provisions introduce three-months backdating, which is considerably more generous. It is also the case that if, for example, claimants find their entitlement curtailed, despite the fact that they have done their best to comply with the rules&#151;perhaps for technical reasons because one benefit hinged on another&#151;we would treat the claim as made on the date earlier than the date on which it was actually made in order to prevent claimants losing out on a technicality. For example, eligibility for WPTC depends on a qualifying benefit, and if that was delayed someone might lose out on the timing of their eligibility for WPTC. We now handle that.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para5"></a>It is very hard to envisage postal and such delays going on beyond three-months. I am floundering slightly because I cannot think of a circumstance that the noble Earl's case would cover. The life-support <P>


<a name="column_CWH93"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>machine was dealt with; postal delays would surely be caught by the three-months limit. If a benefit depends on another benefit and is delayed due to that, then the regulations would cover that situation as they do now. Can the noble Earl, Lord Russell, give me some other help that physical or mental disabilities would not cover?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-33_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister. On the matter of post I can quote the case of three envelopes which were posted to me at the Huntington library and reached me three years later. I take the point that the person on the life-support machine is not going to be caring for a child at the time, but they might have tax credits due to them at the time when they went onto the life-support machine.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para6"></a>Basically the Minister is relying here on Humpty Dumpty, who has ridden gallantly to the Minister's rescue. I wonder whether she might rely on that Humpty Dumpty case about treating a claim as being made at a time other than when it was actually made. I am sure she has very much enjoyed making me admit the virtue of the Humpty Dumpty clause. If so, she is entitled to. I believe she has given me about as much as I am entitled to ask for, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20521-33_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20521-33_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I live in hope and expectation that the Minister will accept this amendment for two reasons. First, it is not mandatory. It is an empowerment for the Inland Revenue to offer advice on passported benefits that are linked to the claim for tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para10"></a>Secondly, it is very much in line with the present Government's thinking about joined-up government. We have a situation where the Inland Revenue offices, using modern IT, have to link both to local government and to the offices of the Department for Work and Pensions, in order not only properly to assess any claim but, through the means of this amendment, to provide information about other benefits.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para11"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her response sent on 8th May to my question about the IT systems to be used by the Inland Revenue. Perhaps I may read for the record the two relevant sentences:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, has so clearly explained, the amendment would require the Inland Revenue to provide claimants with details of other benefits they may become entitled to by reason of their entitlement to tax credits. By that I mean entitlement to the so-called passported benefits. I believe that those are what the noble Lord has primarily in mind.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para14"></a>I would suggest to the noble Lord that the amendment is not necessary. That may be good news, but the bad news may be that the amendment would not do what he hopes. Let me begin by seeking to assure Members of the Committee that the Revenue will be doing what it can to help people with the issue of the passported benefits. The aim is to provide basic advice on them through the tax credit helpline, and to direct claimants to where they can obtain more information. The Inland Revenue, however, cannot advise claimants on whether they will be entitled to passported benefits.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para15"></a>As the noble Lord knows very well, passported benefits are the responsibility of a variety of government departments or organisations, each of which sets its own entitlement criteria. Using entitlement to certain benefits and tax credits as a trigger is merely a way of cutting down on administration by using a ready-made income test to target those benefits, such as free school meals or free prescriptions. But they also include benefits not provided by government departments, such as reduced charges for utility services.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para16"></a>Because this is a complex area, the Treasury and the Inland Revenue have been discussing their needs for information from the tax credit system with the departments and organisations responsible. Claimants need to be able to access advice about passported benefits, but that advice must be the best and most reliable advice available. In that case, it must come mostly from the department or organisation directly responsible for the benefit. To support that, the Revenue will be looking to see how it can facilitate wider access to advice for claimants and how it can support the departments responsible for the benefits with the information they need to target those who are eligible.
<P>

<a name="20521-33_para17"></a>I hope the noble Lord is reassured that we are taking what steps we can within the constraints of what is practicable. We cannot expressly provide entitlement to passported benefits in this Bill because it is not for us to determine entitlement to them. However, we are doing all we can to facilitate access to information about the benefits and to work with other departments to provide the relevant information. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will think that we are at least at one with the push of his amendment, if not with the wording.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am slightly surprised by that reply. The amendment refers not to entitlement, but whether <P>


<a name="column_CWH95"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people may have access to particular benefits. It refers specifically to government departments and not to benefits outside government departments, to which the Minister appeared to refer. One cannot help but feel that the Revenue, perhaps unlike the Department for Work and Pensions, is not enthusiastic about the broader aspects of giving information on passported benefits to those individuals who may be entitled to them.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   This amendment is worthwhile because, according to the Office for National Statistics, the take-up of means-tested benefit has been declining. Looking at the figures produced between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000, the total of unclaimed means-tested benefits was &#163;2.5 billion. As I understand it, that has increased to &#163;3 billion. The amendment would help people's understanding of the system and encourage them to take up benefits of which they may currently not be aware.

<A NAME="20521-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We cannot turn the Inland Revenue into a welfare rights organisation taking legal responsibility for the advice that it gives when those benefits&#151;free school dinners and so on&#151;are run and handled by other departments. That seems inadvisable. Providing power to disclose information on passported benefits adds nothing to what is already in the Bill. I have made it clear that the Revenue is working with other departments on the mechanics of passporting. It will also provide basic information and direct people to the source of more detailed information. It would not be reasonable to expect the Inland Revenue to express a view on entitlement to passported benefits. That is a matter for the departments responsible for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The amendment does not say "entitlement".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The amendment states:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Thank you. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, will accept that the Inland Revenue cannot take responsibility for determining or giving information about an entitlement to a benefit which is run by another department. It can try to make sure that people have the relevant information through an advice line and a referral-on, where appropriate, and obviously this will be backed by relevant literature, but, ultimately, it is a question of functional responsibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I am disappointed but not surprised by the response, which is more in keeping with the <P>


<a name="column_CWH96"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>language and attitude of the Inland Revenue than of the Minister's distinguished self, and perhaps even of the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Higgins put his finger on the point. This is not about the determination of entitlement or even the payment of other benefits. The amendment seeks to provide that the board may distribute information about other passported benefits. A mere telephone number&#151;which I think the Minister suggested might be available&#151;does not seem to be in the spirit of joined-up government.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para1"></a>This relates to an amendment to which I spoke earlier. I did not move it because it was not in sequence. I will have an opportunity to move it later in the proceedings. That amendment concerned better-off calculations, which is the obverse of what I am suggesting here because you may lose some passported benefits and certain other payments through being entitled to claim, and receiving, tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para2"></a>It is a very modest amendment. I hope that we will return to it, although not necessarily in this form.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws the amendment, the Minister said earlier that she did not have to hand the figure for none take-up of tax credits. Can the Minister confirm that the correct figures for none take-up of income support, housing benefit, council tax benefit and jobseeker's allowance are as shown in the ONS document&#151;in other words, that the correct figure for the money saved by the none take-up of those four benefits is &#163;3.015 billion in 2000.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I do not want to be unhelpful but I do not think that it is appropriate to go back and revisit an amendment that has already been disposed of. I am very happy to respond in writing to any queries the noble Lord may have, but we have moved on from that group of amendments to the current one, which is about passported benefits and the Inland Revenue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   The noble Baroness said that the amendment placed a legal obligation on the Inland Revenue, but it did not seem to me to be couched in such direct terms. It was about passing on information, but not creating legal obligations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-34_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   Technically, it is my duty to ask leave to withdraw, bearing in mind that I would like to return to the issue at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw.

"(3) Notwithstanding the generality of subsection (2), the Board may supply to a person in receipt of a tax credit (whether or not jointly with another)&#151;
<br>
(a) any information relating to the claim, to an award made on the claim or to any change of circumstances relevant to the claim or such an award,
<br>
(b) any communication made or received relating to such an award or any such change of circumstances, and

<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(c) any other information which is relevant to any entitlement to tax credits pursuant to the claim or any such change of circumstances,
<br>
in the form of an annual statement to the relevant claimant at the end of each tax year."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20521-34_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: I hope that the purpose of the amendment is straightforward. It would empower the Revenue to issue annual statements of tax credit entitlement, changes of circumstance and payment to individual claimants, if it so wished. Of course, this returns us to territory covered in previous amendments, in particular the duty of the Revenue to secure people's rights to benefits and tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para6"></a>I begin with what I hope is an obvious point. It is likely that a number of individuals who operate under self-assessment of their tax liability could also be entitled to tax credits. The Revenue already issues annual statements to these individuals. It should follow that their annual statements will include, whenever relevant, the effect of tax credits. This is an inevitable consequence of the integration of the benefit and tax systems. To this extent, it is reasonable to suppose that the purpose of the amendment would be achieved quite naturally within the system.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para7"></a>However, there are more telling reasons as to why the issuing of annual tax credit statements would be useful. Once again, this relates to issues of take-up, fraud and the complexity of the system.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para8"></a>The Paymaster General commented on Third Reading in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The annual nature of the credits will simplify the income assessment process".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 7/2/02; col. 1115]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-34_para9"></a>
Would that it were that easy. There is a contrary view, expressed by, among others, Andrew Dilnot of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who has said that year-end adjustment
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reduces certainty and increases complexity for all".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-34_para10"></a>
It may make it somewhat easier administratively for the Revenue, but particularly insofar as we may be moving towards a system of self-assessment for tax credit entitlement, there are serious doubts that it will make life easier for claimants. There are a host of potential problems here. As my honourable friend Howard Flight observed,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"at the heart of the issues are our concerns about the complexities of the arrangements and our anxiety that the need for claimants to keep detailed records and monitor the number of hours worked, the amount of income earned and child care costs will lead to a much-increased risk of non-compliance".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 7/2/02; col. 1119.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-34_para11"></a><P>

<a name="20521-34_para12"></a>That leaves aside Liberal Democrat concerns&#151;and our own&#151;in respect of over-payment problems. In other words, it is reasonable to suppose that the end of any given tax year is likely to prove a particular sticking-point, even in a period of anxiety and worry, for many claimants.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para13"></a>Surely it makes sense to use the occasion to inform claimants of the immediate history of their entitlement and those sets of circumstances that may impact on the levels of their entitlement. Based on the dual assumptions that the system of reporting envisaged in the Bill works and that the Revenue is intending to use <P>


<a name="column_CWH98"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>data analysis tools actively, it should be possible to target specific categories of claimant. In turn, this should make it possible, via the expedient of selective use of annual statements, to impact beneficially on the accuracy of claims in the interests of claimants and the Revenue. Claimants would be in a position to assess whether their past entitlement had been accurate and what their likely entitlement would be for the coming year, as well as, if necessary, volunteering information about over-payment or changes in circumstances that might have had an effect on their previous entitlement. They would also be able to assess what sort of future changes in their circumstances would have an effect.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para14"></a>The Revenue for its part would be assured that all claimants in the client group had received a statement of account&#151;a baseline from which the legitimacy of claims could be measured and against which future claims could be error-checked. Moreover, insofar as the Revenue would be able to use them to demonstrate detailed knowledge of the entitlement of individual claimants, such annual statements could potentially have a deterrent effect on those seeking to defraud the system.
<P>

<a name="20521-34_para15"></a>There is also the issue of record-keeping. As a generality, for reasons of which we are all painfully aware, those in receipt of tax credits will tend not to be too focused on the management of their finances. Accordingly, the service the revenue could provide by issuing annual statements should not be underestimated. It would afford claimants a simple and straightforward means of having access to some measure of financial record of their circumstances. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-35_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I want to raise one point which is perhaps oblique to this amendment but which I think comes within its purposes. The amendment concerns itself with the supply of information. What concerns me is that information should not be distributed where it is to the detriment of a woman who is in danger of facing domestic violence. That is a situation probably a good deal more common than most of us know and certainly serious enough when it happens. I have not felt the need to table any separate amendment because of the presence of the word "may", which occurs, first, in the opening section of Clause 4(2), page 3, line 32 and, secondly, at the beginning of the noble Earl's own amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para0"></a>To do what I am asking the Government to do probably does not require any changes in the wording of the Bill. I am simply asking for assurances that information about the whereabouts of the woman who is or has been in danger will not be communicated in ways in which it may reach the man from whom the danger arises. Such ways are more numerous and often more devious than many of us allow for. I have known it passed quite unwittingly and in all innocence through friends and relations of the man concerned in the local police station. They had no idea they were being accomplices to any such thing, and the cunning which goes into pursuit when exercised by men of property with their minds on the job can be quite fiercesome.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para1"></a>Clearly there is a vast apparatus here for the communication of information. The problem we have is that it is a need recognised by all people of goodwill but that a big cultural change is needed to make most of us think of it at the top of our minds at the moment when it is needed. I know that the Minister and I have been over this on a great many occasions. She probably understands the problem as well as anybody in the country does and certainly as well as anyone in politics does. All I am really asking is for her to try to communicate that awareness, probably in the form of guidance, to those who will be working on this Bill on the provision of information to make sure that they stop to ask the question. I await the answer with optimism.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I hope that I shall be able to make the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, happy tonight, even if I cannot make other members of his Front Bench team happy. What we are proposing under Clause 17 does almost exactly what he is proposing. In other words, his amendment is similar to the annual notice that we will be providing for every case under Clause 17. It may be worth stating what that does and then, if the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, feels that it does not do enough we can come back to it.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para2"></a>Under Clause 17, the Inland Revenue must send a notice to each claimant, and in a joint claim to both claimants, at the end of the tax year. That notice will specify the circumstances upon which the award was based and the income upon which it was based. When circumstances have changed, the notice shall cover all the relevant circumstances that have applied over the course of the award&#151;this is covered in Clause 17 itself. The claimant must then confirm the details in the notice or amend them if they are incorrect&#151;this is his point about fraud&#151;as the award is finalised. This is also treated as the basis of the claim for the subsequent year. Clearly, the notice will also state how much tax credit has been paid over the year.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para3"></a>Thus the process ensures that claimants will get a clear statement of the basis of their award at the end of the year. It also further simplifies things for the claimant because their claim for the following year does not start from scratch; the revenue produces or re-uses the notice with all the information it contains on the claimant. I hope the noble Earl will agree that we have covered the points he raised. He was concerned about the other side of this matter, when there are possibilities of domestic violence and the way that, by going back to a couple, information may be given to a violent or former partner that could be used to endanger his former partner.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para4"></a>While Clause 4(2) allows information on a claim to be given to either partner, there is no question of supplying new information to a former partner. When a couple split up, the entitlement of that couple as a couple ceases. From that point on, anything that happens to one partner is irrelevant to the other and there is no question of supplying information to a former partner which goes beyond information relating to the claim made by the couple when they were living together as a couple. For example, <P>


<a name="column_CWH100"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information on the working hours of one partner at the time when they were a couple may be relevant, but employment details since the couple split up are not relevant.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para5"></a>What would happen if one partner is in a refuge, for example? What protection would she receive in those circumstances? Clearly, she would need to tell the Inland Revenue or DWP her new address in order that she could continue to be eligible. The Inland Revenue will want to help her to put a new claim in place, but information about her whereabouts will not be disclosed. There will be separate communications.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para6"></a>I am very happy to look at the noble Earl's suggestion to ensure that our guidance about the handling of such information takes into account the concerns he has raised today. If I am not satisfied, I will seek to ensure that it covers the points he has raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-35_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am not at all surprised to find that the Minister has already thought through the problem. I am extremely grateful to her for her answers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-35_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I, too, am extremely grateful for the Minister's response. I shall re-read the provisions in the Bill to see precisely what Clause 17 does.

<A NAME="20521-35_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 40:

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20521-35_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments tabled by noble Lords opposite seek to remove subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 5. As I mentioned when we considered the government amendment to Clause 3, the Government have reached a similar conclusion. As part of the package of technical changes needed properly to distinguish between entitlement and award, government Amendment No. 40 removes those subsections. It would also remove subsection (3).
<P>


<a name="column_CWH101"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para12"></a>As I explained when we were considering Clause 3, we do not want claimants to have to make a new claim whenever their circumstances change. That would defeat one of the main purposes of moving to an annual system. That is why Clause 5(4) states that awards do not end when there is a change which may affect the rate of entitlement. On the other hand, when a person ceases to fulfil the basic qualifying conditions for the credits&#151;where a person claiming working tax credits stops working, for example&#151;it is sensible that their entitlement should stop. That is why Clause 5(5) currently states that an award ends if entitlement ceases because of a change of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para13"></a>I have already explained the fact that these provisions refer incorrectly to awards and are inconsistent with the provisions later in the Bill about decision-making. They are therefore removed. Subsection (3) is moved to Clause 3 and subsections (4) and (5) are replaced by the provision which makes clear that an award is brought to an end during the year only by a decision made by the Board to end it, subject to a right of appeal. Thus, by virtue of this amendment, Clause 5 will be properly confined to making provision about the period for which awards last. It would no longer trespass onto entitlement, nor would it any longer be inconsistent with Clauses 14 to 16.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para14"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that Amendment No. 40 makes a technical but important change that will improve the Bill, and will feel able to support it. If that is the case, then Opposition Amendments Nos. 41 and 42, with which we otherwise would have sympathy, become unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para15"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 43 deals with the making of notifications of changes in circumstances in advance of the changes actually occurring. Subsection (2)(c) provides for regulations to be made allowing for advance notifications in prescribed circumstances. This amendment would prevent advance notification from being allowed. It may be helpful if I gave an example to make sense of this.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para16"></a>The regulations will follow the approach taken by the regulations made under Clause 4(1)(d), which deals with advance claims. We intend, for example, to allow someone taking up a new job to make a claim for working tax credit up to seven days in advance of starting that job. The claim would take effect from the date the job was taken up and would, of course, be contingent on that job being taken up. This provision is to ensure that those who do take up a new job see the full benefit of that job&#151;that is, the wage plus the top-up from the working tax credit&#151;straight away.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para17"></a>Regulations under subsection (2)(c) of Clause 6 will follow that approach for changes of circumstances that are related to taking up a new job or increasing hours where the claimants are already eligible for working tax credit by working the requisite minimum number of hours.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH102"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para18"></a>The specific circumstances that these regulations will relate to are, for example, where one person in a couple is already working, and therefore an increase in hours to 30 or more per week means that they receive a higher rate of WTC. Or where, for example, a second earner starts to work at least 16 hours per week, which may entitle the couple to the 30-hour element if they add their hours together, or it may entitle them to the childcare element of WTC. Or, again, for a single person, an increase in hours to at least 30 hours per week would mean that they were eligible for the 30-hour element.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para19"></a>All of those changes may be related to a person starting a new job, and it is right that the person can see the benefit of taking that job from the outset. Therefore the regulations will allow notification of those changes to be made up to seven days in advance but will be subject to the change actually taking place. The change would have effect from the date it actually happened rather than the date of notification. We want to encourage people to tell us about changes as soon as practicable so that they can get the right amount of support when they need it.
<P>

<a name="20521-35_para20"></a>I hope with that explanation your Lordships will be happy to accept the Government's amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I shall say something later on about the very helpful attitude the noble Baroness has adopted as far as regulations are concerned. Of course it is right, as she said, that a number of the points which arise on these amendments have already been discussed in considerable detail on earlier amendments and I certainly do not wish to detain the Committee unnecessarily.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para0"></a>Having said that, these are not technical or drafting amendments in the normal sense. They are fundamentally restructuring the Bill. As the noble Baroness rightly pointed out, as the Bill stands at the moment there are contradictions between Clause 5 and some of the later provisions of the Bill; for example, Clauses 14 and 16. It is quite extraordinary that what is fairly apparent if one looks at the Bill did not become apparent earlier. I must ask the noble Baroness again at what stage it was apparent to the draftsman that the way in which the Bill had been structured involved a clear internal contradiction. We have been over the ground quite a bit already, but it is not a satisfactory situation and, as I suggested earlier, we obviously need to have a clearer investigation as to what happened.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para1"></a>I make one additional point. I am not clear&#151;alas, I do not have the relevant document to my hands at the moment&#151;to what extent, when the Bill returns to the Commons, it will be time-constrained. The Commons now has a passion for programming measures, and some of that programming involves the amount of time which may be spent on your Lordship's amendments. Can the noble Baroness give us absolute assurance, in the light of all that has happened on the various government amendments, that restraints will <P>


<a name="column_CWH103"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be put on the amount of time which the House of Commons may spend on considering government amendments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I again defer to people who have more experience of the House of Commons than I have, but it seems to me that the timetabling of these matters is organised through the usual channels and it would be quite impertinent if the House of Lords tried to determine how much time the House of Commons should take to discuss their Lordships' amendments. I have every confidence that the House of Commons will decide for itself an appropriate amount of time for consideration of Lords amendments, given the number that I hope the Bill will receive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Have any restraints already been imposed on the amount of time that the Commons will spend on the amendments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-36_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No. At this stage I am not certain. We have an understanding between the usual channels about when the two Report days will be. I certainly have no knowledge of when a Third Reading may take place. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has the say on the timetabling of these things. He may be able to tell me when the Third Reading of the Bill is going to take place. Therefore, I do not know when it is going to another place. I am sure that the business managers cannot possibly have done any timetabling on how long the discussions may take. My understanding is that these things are arranged through the usual channels and I cannot be more helpful to the noble Lord than that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Alas, that is no longer so. It used to be so, but, with their huge majority, the Government now impose programme Motions in another place, which curtail the amount of time available for discussing Lords amendments. That happens, not infrequently, against the will of the Opposition, against the usual channels' normal decisions and on a Vote. The noble Baroness can assure us in due course what the Government's policy is on these matters. Given how much time is inevitably going to be taken up in discussing the government amendments, it is important that there should be adequate time in another place in due course for the amendments to be discussed.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para2"></a>I am desperately concerned about the way in which, over the past few years, the programme and so-called modernisation process has resulted in the amount of time that the Opposition have to debate these matters being constrained.

If the noble Lord, Lord Higgins wishes to pursue it, the press is an appropriate place to do so. I would join him in doing that, as long as he would be prepared to make clear that our complaint is of government and not of government of any one particular party. Meanwhile, it is not our business here and we might for the time being leave it where it is, but with recognition of its due seriousness.

<a name="20521-36_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall be exceedingly brief. This is a drafting amendment, needed in consequence of the changes to Clauses 3 and 5 made by government amendments that we discussed earlier. Clause 6(3)(a) refers to Clause 5(3), which says that an award ends when a couple breaks up or a new couple forms. It allows regulations to be made requiring that such a change be notified to the Inland Revenue. The provision made by Clause 5(3) is to be moved to Clause 3 and recast in terms of entitlement. Because the equivalent provision in Clause 3 will refer to entitlement rather than to the ending of an award, it will be covered by the power to make regulations covered by Clause 6(3)(b). Paragraph (a) is therefore redundant and is removed by this amendment. I hope that the Committee will be happy to accept it. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="20521-36_para14"></a><P>

<a name="20521-36_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 45 stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Saatchi. Clause 7 is concerned with the so-called income test, and subsection (2), which this amendment seeks to discuss, is concerned with the way in which income is <P>


<a name="column_CWH105"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determined in relation to people who are entitled to any social security benefit which is prescribed for the purpose of this subsection.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para16"></a>Effectively, as I understand it, the purpose of this subsection is that in calculating income account should be taken of other social security benefits. What I am not clear about as the Bill now stands is the extent to which it is intended that these benefits shall be taken into account and which benefits should not be taken into account. We would be grateful if the Minister could explain this to us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-36_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I shall do my best. This amendment would remove the provision for regulations to effectively suspend the tax credits income test for families in receipt of income support or income-based JSA.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para17"></a>Let me explain how the regulations will work. Clause 7 establishes the important principle that tax credits are based on the income of a tax year. This provides a fairer measure of income and is less prone to manipulation and fluctuation than the existing one for WFTC, which is every six months. It is also more closely aligned with income tax, enabling people to use the information which they already get or provide for tax purposes to be used for their tax credits claims.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para18"></a>For most families this provides the straightforward way of assessing entitlement to tax credits and targeting support according to need. However, we recognise that for the poorest families there needs to be a safety net. Currently that safety net is provided by IS or income-based JSA and both benefits include elements for children in the household.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para19"></a>From 2004, when existing IS and JSA claimants with children will be transferred to the child tax credit, the child-related elements of those benefits will cease. Families on IS and JSA will be brought into the single seamless system of support provided by the child tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para20"></a>However, the Government want to ensure that those families continue to receive at least the same levels of overall support as they do now. If these families were subjected to a test of their annual income while claiming IS or JSA, it is possible, although unlikely, that they would not receive the maximum CTC due to their income across the whole year, including periods when they may not have been claiming IS or JSA, being more than the &#163;5060 income threshold announced in the Budget.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para21"></a>Therefore, regulations under subsection (2), in conjunction with Clause 13(1), will make clear that for any period of entitlement to income support or income-based JSA, entitlement to tax credits will be at the maximum rate and shall not be subject to a test of annual income. This will ensure that the poorest families continue to receive the appropriate safety net support on a weekly basis. For any other period in the same tax year where the family is not claiming IS or JSA, entitlement to tax credits will be based on annual income as usual.
<P>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para22"></a>This is what the regulations to be made under subsection (2) shall achieve. I am sure the Committee can appreciate the importance of this provision in ensuring that weekly support for the poorest families continues to be provided at the right level. I should point out that the subsection does not itself specify IS and income-based JSA because flexibility is needed for the regulations to include any other safety net benefits. For example, the safety net for pensioners is provided by the minimum income guarantee. In future that same purpose will be served by the pension credit but it is not listed as a possible renaming.
<P>

<a name="20521-36_para23"></a>I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Lord will not press the amendment further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I fear that we are&#151;at least I am&#151; again suffering a little from the speed of delivery of the Minister. I am not at all sure that I now understand this particular section. That may be compounded by the constant use of initials rather than referring to the individual benefits involved.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para0"></a>I am particularly puzzled&#151;I look with increasing suspicion at the drafting of this Bill&#151;as where the regulations referred to in this section appear in the Bill. The Minister has been extremely generous in providing us with regulations on a number of other aspects of the Bill and I pay tribute to her for that. I cannot recall any previous occasion where a Government Minister has provided regulations in such a way. It will be of great help not only to us, but also to those in another place when they come to look at how the Bill has been drafted. It is remarkable that the noble Baroness has been so helpful in this. She attempted to do so on previous Bills, but she has never actually succeeded in providing us with the regulations before the Bill had completed its passage through this House. Nevertheless, she has succeeded in this case.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para1"></a>Despite that, however, I still do not understand where the regulations which govern Clause 7 appear. In the subsection we seek to amend it states that persons,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"entitled to any social security benefit prescribed for the purposes of this subsection".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-37_para2"></a>
However, I am not clear where the power to prescribe arises in the Bill or, more particularly, in this clause. It is of course true that in the previous clause endless regulations may be used either for this purpose or another, but this clause does not seem to include regulation-making powers. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that and then I shall come back to the point of substance, which concerns what is to be prescribed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Before we go any further, perhaps I may associate myself with the thanks that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has offered the noble Baroness for making these regulations available. It is very welcome indeed. I must confess that I have not yet finished reading them but, on the progress that I have made so far, I am encouraged and grateful for the content as well as for their availability. In either case, it is a very welcome precedent indeed.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am not sure whether I can respond precisely to the noble Lord. I turn to Clause 60, entitled "Regulations, orders and schemes", in Part 3. Subsection (1) states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any power to make regulations under sections 3, 7 to 13, 38 and 39, and any power to make regulations under this Act prescribing a rate of interest, is exercisable by the Treasury".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-37_para3"></a>
That is where the power to make regulations comes from. In Clause 62, on page 34, line 5 states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>'prescribed' means prescribed by regulations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-37_para4"></a>
Those two provisions are put together and brought to bear on Clause 7(6), (7) and (8).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I still do not understand what the draftsman is playing at. In Clause 6, for example, it states that, "Regulations may provide" and so forth, but when we come to Clause 7, it is buried in Clause 60, stating that powers,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to make regulations under sections 3, 7 to 13, 38 and 39",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-37_para5"></a>
may be this, that or the other. Why is a totally different drafting technique applied in the case of Clause 6 as against Clause 7?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I have not taken advice on this, but my immediate response would almost certainly be that, at the moment, we are moving from DWP to Inland Revenue and the powers therefore need to be exercised by the Treasury. At the moment, the Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions has powers to make regulations affecting social security benefits and we would not need to change that, whereas if we were making those the responsibility of the Inland Revenue, we would. Thus power to make the regulations the noble Lord is inquiring about is informed by Clause 7(2) itself because it says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prescribed for the purposes of the subsection".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-37_para6"></a>
Thus the power resides with the Treasury in Clause 60(2), and it affects Clause 7(2) which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prescribed for the purposes of this subsection".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-37_para7"></a>
It then goes on to say what it does. I am not sure what the noble Lord is worried about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   It is a simple point. The way in which regulations are introduced into the Bill is quite different in Clause 6 than it is in Clause 7. The department which makes the regulations simply says, "regulations may provide", and so on. Then, when we come to Clause 7, it is covered by Clause 60. I do not understand why that is so. We shall need to give some further thought to it.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para8"></a>Having said that, let me come back to the point of substance. Subsection (2), which we are now discussing, says that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the entitlement of a person or persons to a tax credit for so long as the person, or either of the persons, is entitled to any social security benefit prescribed".

<FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Baroness has not provided us with those regulations. We do not know what social security benefits are going to be prescribed for this section.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I provided them in my reply to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am not clear why these particular benefits are prescribed. Perhaps I can deal with this on a simple basis. Are we saying that the entitlement of persons of any description to a tax credit is dependent on the relevant income? But are we also saying that none of the social security benefits to which the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, referred are relevant income? Is that what we are saying?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   There are moments when the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, reminds me of the literal Vicar of Hurst, who said that,

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="20521-37_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   What social security benefits are going to continue to be paid even though someone is getting a tax credit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that those who are in receipt of one of those weekly means-tested benefits&#151;at the moment the ones we are contemplating are income support and income-based JSA, but those could be re-labelled in some future Utopia&#151;continue to receive support. That is why they are not listed as such on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para13"></a>The importance of the subsection is to ensure that those in receipt of one of those benefits continue to receive maximum support for their children. Suspending the income test, which is what the amendment would do, while the claimant is entitled to IS or JSAIB, means that the claimant can get maximum CTC for that period regardless of their annual income. If the annual income was relied on at all times, it may be possible for a person on IS or JSAIB to receive less than the full CTC due to the amount of annual income they had, possibly because they earned extra money in a different period. It is to try to ensure that when they fall back on to IS or JSA, the fact that they have so far had income possibly in work or through other forms of saving does not destroy their capacity to obtain support for their children while on the basic benefit.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para14"></a>We suspend the income tax as a key feature as an adult on income support or JSA automatically gets full CTC for their children without a further income test.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para15"></a>I do not believe that I can help the noble Lord any further. It seems fairly straightforward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-37_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I will study what the noble Baroness has said when it is apparent in writing. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20521-37_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20521-37_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 are needed as a consequence of government amendments to later clauses, in particular to Clause 17 and the arrangements for finalising claimants' entitlements to tax credits after the end of the year when details of current year incomes will be known. I do not want to go too deeply now into an explanation of Clause 17 and I shall write to the Committee on that because I recognise that it is not easy receiving quite detailed, technical information at some speed. However, I hope that you will allow me to look forward to that clause for a moment.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para20"></a>Clause 17 provides for the Inland Revenue to issue a statement of information to claimants at the end of the year, setting out the basis on which an award was (or awards were) made during the year. Claimants will either then confirm that their circumstances and income were as set out by the board on that notice or correct that information. They will also provide details of the income for the year just ended. The Inland Revenue will use that information to finalise their entitlement for that year on the correct basis and make any necessary adjustments. It will also use that information to establish the correct amount of their award for the coming year.
<P>

<a name="20521-37_para21"></a>At the moment, Clause 17 requires the board to ask claimants&#151;

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Because Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 have implications or are a consequence of the changes in Clause 17. They are part of the refining of the notion of relevant income and splitting it between current year income and previous year income, which has a meaning beyond Clause 7, to which they are currently confined.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am under the impression&#151;I may be quite wrong&#151;that we are actually discussing Clause 7,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Page 5, line 29, at beginning insert 'In this Part'",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-38_para0"></a>
and I am not the least bit clear what that has to do with Clause 17.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Originally, in this part, Amendments Nos. 47 and 48, were a large group of government amendments which I understand were degrouped presumably in part as a result of discussions. There was a large group of government amendments so they were ungrouped. The current year income and previous year income are defined in Clause 7 but currently they are defined only for the purposes of that clause. The proposed changes to Clause 17 mean that those terms will also now be used in Clause 17. For this reason, Amendments Nos. 47 <P>


<a name="column_CWH110"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and 48 make clear that the definition of those terms is applied for the purposes of Part 1, rather than being confined to Clause 7. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Clause 7 is in this part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps I can help the noble Lord. At the moment Clause 17 relates to relevant income. Relevant income is confusing because, for the claimant, it could mean either the current year income or the previous year income. We are disentangling the two. Therefore we have to make consequential adjustments and this is part of those adjustments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   So in other parts, does "current income" mean something else?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No. I am trying to refine the words "relevant income" as opposed to "current year income". At the moment, relevant income can be used in situations where it can appear to imply both current year and previous year.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para1"></a>Let us step back a little. Each year there will be an assumption that the previous year's income will be the base as notified for the forthcoming year&#151;that is, the current year that people are going into&#151;although there will obviously be a few weeks of overlap time. Therefore, the words "relevant income" appear to cover both those sets of information: a person's previous year's income, on which they expect to claim in the future year, and their expectation of what their current year's income may be. Separating that out makes it easier for the claimant.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para2"></a>The terms "current year income" and "previous year income" need to be defined for the purposes of Part 1 because of the changes to Clause 17. Hence, in this part, as inserted, at the moment these terms are defined only in Clause 7. We need to be able to extend it to Clause 17. The reason is to split the words "relevant income" and make it clearer so that people understand whether we are talking about current year or previous year's income. At the moment we use "relevant income" to cover both those, which can be confusing for the claimant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The amendment would insert "In this Part" at the beginning of line 29 on page 5. Subsection (4) would then read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In this Part the "current year income" means&#151;
<P>

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) in relation to persons",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-38_para4"></a>
and so on. I repeat, if that is the definition in this part, is there a corresponding and different definition in another part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No, there is not. Part 1 is bigger than Clause 7. Without "In this Part" the definitions refer only to Clause 7. By saying "In this Part", we refer to Part 1 of the Bill. In answer to the noble Lord's query, there is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I begin to understand what the draftsman is seeking to do. He is seeking to say that this definition will apply in the whole of Part 1 and there is no corresponding definition in Part 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No, not quite. To go back a step, we are seeking to insert two main drafting amendments, with the consent of your Lordships. The first, which we discussed earlier, makes a distinction between awards and entitlements. The second disaggregates the concept of relevant income into current year and previous year's income. That is required by the changes in Clause 17. At the moment we have that distinction in Clause 7, but it does not apply to the rest of Part 1. Inserting "In this Part" ensures that the definitions in Clause 7 apply to the whole of Part 1. That is needed in order to make sense of the amendments to Clause 17.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   We will have to return to this on Report. I hesitate to think how we are going to try and sort the matter out on the Floor of the House.

<a name="20521-38_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are still on the same theme. Clause 7 is an important part of the Bill. It provides that entitlement to tax credits will depend on the income of the claimant or claimants. In particular, entitlement will be based on the income of a tax year. This group of amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 49, 50, 52, 53, 54 and Amendment No. 158, which concerns Clause 24&#151;is concerned with Clause 7(6), (7) and (8), and relates to the computation of income: the period in which income is taken into account, what counts as income and when the Inland Revenue can treat a person as having income or not, as the case may be.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 are short technical amendments which are intended to clarify the scope of the Inland Revenue's regulation-making powers under <P>


<a name="column_CWH112"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 7(6) and (7). These subsections allow regulations to be made about how income is to be allocated between particular tax years. The regulations may provide that income of a particular type from the last year but one is to be treated as previous year income of that type instead of actual income of that description for that year.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para11"></a>Subsections (6) and (7) both refer to "prescribed circumstances". However, regulations under these provisions are more likely to be concerned with the calculation of income and an allocation between years. As such, the references to "prescribed circumstances" are inappropriate and should be removed. This is achieved by these amendments, which I commend to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para12"></a>Amendment No. 52 has not yet been moved. Perhaps I should stay for the moment with Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 and allow the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to move his amendment No. 52. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew15"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   This group includes Amendment No. 158, which stands in my name. That amendment provides that for the purposes of the Bill student loans should not be counted as income. The case for that is perfectly simple&#151;they are not. You have to pay them back again. When Tennyson was once introduced to the Fellows of King's Cambridge, he was introduced to Oscar Browning, who came forward and said, "I'm Browning". Tennyson, knowing another Browning, looked at him and said, "You're not". That is the case for that amendment. It is a simple one.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para13"></a>I would rather not be led into a discussion of student finance as a whole. It is a subject on which I find it increasingly difficult to express myself with that moderation appropriate to parliamentary debate and I would rather not spoil the atmosphere of the day. I shall therefore let the case stand as it is, in isolation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-38_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The noble Baroness invites me to move Amendment No. 52. I am happy to speak to it but I may or may not move it at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="20521-38_para14"></a>Amendment No. 52 suggests that we should leave out subsection (8). Any views I may have had on the draftsmen up to now are not greatly improved by subsection (8), which states:

<P>
<A NAME="20521-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 54 in the anticipation that it will not take out of sequence the thoughts in the Minister's mind.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para0"></a>Perhaps I may follow on directly from my noble friend Lord Higgins who essentially has dealt with the point. Amendment No. 54 rests on the principle that income for tax credits should be calculated in the same way as income for revenue purposes, or, perhaps more accurately, the other way round. Again this is an example of moving responsibility for administration, assessment and payment from the organs of social security to the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para1"></a>I have one specific concern on subsection (8) in Clause 7. It is drafted in too broad a fashion. My amendment would ensure that the regulations, when issued and passed, would be based on Inland Revenue rules. I shall give noble Lords one practical example of subsection (8)(a); that is to say, making sure that the assessment for the purposes of income tax&#151;income which he does not in fact have&#151;could relate to benefits in kind.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para2"></a>The principle behind the amendment is to ensure that we do not allow the regulations to be drafted too generally. I would welcome the comments of the Minister on this. It may be that in subsequent parts of the Bill there is delineation and therefore I might be prepared to accept that argument. However, this clause looks too broad and we ought to ensure that Inland Revenue rules are used to calculate the basis for payment of tax credit in the same way as income.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am grateful to those noble Lords who have spoken to the amendment. Let me start with Amendment No. 158, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I understand the thrust of his argument. At the moment it is the case, as he stated, that under the current WFTC and DPTC schemes, student support in the form of loans and grants is taken into account as income with limited disregard for the cost of books, equipment and travel, on the basis that primarily the education system, not the social security system, helps students. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, refrained from going down that path, and I believe that I should do likewise.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para3"></a>The consultation paper issued on tax credits last summer invited views on whether to continue this approach. We have considered the issue and taken account of the views of colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills. As a result of part of a wider alignment of tax credits with the income tax system, we have decided that, in principle, student support such as loans, grants paid to meet the cost of tuition fees and income-related bursaries should be disregarded from income for new tax credits. This was set out in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the draft regulations on income which we published recently. <P>


<a name="column_CWH114"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The draft regulations will be amended to reflect this decision, which I am sure will be greatly welcomed by the noble Earl.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para4"></a>I should also highlight the fact that student nurses will in principle be able to claim the child tax credit. The Inland Revenue will be in touch with the Department of Health shortly to determine the extent to which bursaries received by student nurses should be taken into account as income for new tax credits. This will also apply to other students in similar situations; namely, those who are in work but with children. Having the disregard of student support in secondary rather than primary legislation will give the Inland Revenue flexibility to respond quickly to any changes in student support. Given that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will not feel it necessary to press his amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para5"></a>Perhaps I may return to Amendment No. 52. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, for explaining his purpose here. Basically, in all such Bills, one needs what we call Humpty Dumpty clauses: when income should be deemed to be capital, capital deemed to be income, or income that should be treated as not being income when under other circumstances it may be. We have made it clear that the definition of income will be based broadly on annual income, taking into account income tax and therefore including earnings from employment or self-employment, certain social security benefits and pensions, and any other income from savings, property, trusts and overseas sources.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para6"></a>If accepted, the amendment would do much to weaken the Inland Revenue's paths not only to find income in connection with claims to tax credits, but to counter potential attempts by some claimants to manipulate that definition to their advantage. Perhaps I may develop that point. Sub-paragraph (a) is an anti-avoidance provision, which also appears in the rules for WFTC and DPTC&#151;in fact I remember us debating those&#151;and before that it was also in the rules for family credit and disability working allowance, as introduced by the previous Conservative government. Sub-paragraph (a) provides for the regulations defining income to identify when a claimant may be deemed to have income which at first sight he or she may not possess&#151;those Humpty Dumpty clauses. They come into play if the Inland Revenue finds that a claimant has deliberately deprived himself or herself of income in order to claim or increase their entitlement to an award, for example, by transferring an interest-bearing savings account to a child or to someone outside their household when the claimant is still treated as receiving that income. There are equivalent provisions for tax to prevent people diverting their income through trusts or settlement to someone who pays income tax at a lower rate.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para7"></a>Alternatively, if a claimant fails to apply for income to which he or she is entitled, then apart from certain exceptions, he or she is treated as having received that income from the date on which he or she could have obtained it.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para8"></a>Sub-paragraph (b) serves a different purpose. As under the current rules, it will allow the regulations defining income to accept certain types of income, <P>


<a name="column_CWH115"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>either in whole or in part, when assessing awards of tax credit. This is subject to continuing discussion with the interested parties, following publication of the draft regulations. However, in order to align the definition of income for tax credits as closely as possible with the tax system, we propose, for example, to provide that claimants in receipt of some tax exempt social security benefits, such as war widows' pensions or most payments of income support, will not have to report such income on their claim forms. Similarly, as the government announced at the time of the Pre-Budget Report last November, we shall disregard child maintenance payments in the hands of recipients, as we currently do in WFTC to help single parents going back into work. To avoid cutting across our efforts to encourage savings on pension credit by those on lower incomes, the draft regulations provide that income from special tax-free savings vehicles such as ISAs need not be mentioned in tax credit claims. That was of interest in previous debates.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para9"></a>I hope the Committee will agree that I have sought to clarify the purpose of the powers in subsection (8) and that they are certainly not unprecedented. They have a track history going back to family credit. I hope that as a result noble Lords will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para10"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, for his explanation of his Amendment No. 54. I entirely agree with the emphasis he placed on the need to align the definition of "income" for new tax credits as closely as possible with the income tax rules and to counter the possibility that a small minority of claimants may try to manipulate their income in order to claim or increase their entitlement to tax credits. However, the amendment is unnecessary. As the noble Lord is aware, the Government are bringing forward a technical amendment that will clarify the scope of the Inland Revenue's powers to define income for new tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para11"></a>In addition, the draft regulations that we published last week for consultation and to inform our debate contained detailed provisions to address the noble Lord's concerns. The Explanatory Notes pick up cases about how capital is treated, including companies' stock dividend and the like. It may be that rather than take up the Committee's time, it would make sense if I write to the noble Lord, but he will find that information there.
<P>

<a name="20521-39_para12"></a>Amendment No. 53 is a technical amendment designed to clarify the scope of the Inland Revenue's power to define income for new tax credits by way of regulations. I have probably covered that already, but to make sure I am moving Amendments Nos. 49, 50 and 53, which I hope noble Lords will feel able to accept.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-39_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am delighted by what the Minister had to say about student loans and I thank her very warmly indeed. I will not be moving Amendment No. 158 in its place in the Marshalled List or bringing it forward on Report. Perhaps I might say a brief word about Amendment No. 54.

<a name="20521-39_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freeman, has heard the Minister, as it were, impale me on the lance of Humpty Dumpty earlier this afternoon, in the case of people on a life support machine. Humpty Dumpty has his uses. They are usually beneficent, but the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, asked whether the vires could be drafted in a slightly tighter manner. That is a very moderate request and one to which I hope the Minister in future may pay attention. It would narrow the gap between us on this subject considerably, but the overwhelming note on which I end my remarks is that of facts.

<A NAME="20521-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   I am not sure if this is the time to raise the matter, but is the definition of "income" clearly enough defined for any self-employed person who is claiming the benefit?

<P>
<A NAME="20521-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Perhaps I may say once again how immensely helpful it was to have the draft regulations which the noble Baroness provided. It enabled us, ahead of our discussions this afternoon, to be aware of the Government's intentions in relation to student income.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para0"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the need to relate what is in the Bill to more normal Inland Revenue practice, and presumably tax law. I now notice, but I had not previously realised, that we are both agreed that subsection (8) as it stands is not satisfactory and the Government's Amendment No. 53 makes some changes to that. If it is indeed to be aligned with tax law more generally, can the noble Baroness give us any idea where in particular in the tax law we might find the corresponding provisions, and also whether there is some degree of case law which might limit the apparently unlimited ability of the Inland Revenue in this case to decide what is or is not income?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-40_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The scope of income definition has been discussed with key interest groups, including the Low Income Tax Reform Group, with whom I think the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, has been in contact. We are aware that they have further points to discuss and officials will be taking those discussions further.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para1"></a>On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, on the definition of self-employed, I can confirm that it will be clearly defined for the self-employed. Indeed, they will benefit from the alignment of the definition with tax, so that they will be able to use their tax accounts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I could not hear that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-40_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The self-employed will be able to draw on and use their tax accounts for these purposes, and that is one of the great advantages of the new tax credit scheme.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para2"></a>I do not know whether I can immediately give the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, the exact reference in tax law that he sought. If I cannot do so this evening I shall certainly write to him.

I am not clear why it is necessary for the board to have that power, or indeed how it would set about such a task. In the latter part of the clause there is a limitation of that; that such an estimate does not affect the rate at which he or she, or they, are entitled to a tax credit, in which case I am not clear what the purpose of the estimation is. Perhaps the noble Baroness could enlighten us. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20521-40_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Clause 7 establishes the principle that tax credits are based on the income of the tax year. As I sought to explain earlier, annual income may be either the income of the current or the previous year. However, current year income cannot be known until the end of the year and so the system would not really be responsive if adjustments to reflect current year income were only made at the year end. Those who need more help because their income has dropped would have to wait until the end of the year on a lump-sum payment, while those whose incomes have risen significantly would be overpaid and would then have to pay back much of that money at the end of the year. That would be a far from sensible way of targeting money on those who most need it.

<a name="20521-40_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 56 is a drafting amendment which forms part of the package of changes distinguishing between entitlement and awards. At this point I have to remember to refer for a moment to Clause 16, although I know that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will be cross with me. However, it is necessary for me to do so in order to explain the reason for the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para17"></a>Currently, Clause 16 provides that the Board may decide to amend or revoke an award where it has reasonable grounds for believing that the award is incorrect or that the person to whom it has been made,

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20521-40_para18"></a>
In the light of the necessary changes to the Bill in relation to awards and entitlement, which we have already discussed when considering Clauses 3 and 5, it has become apparent that it is inappropriate for the Bill to use the words "revocation of awards". As I explained earlier, awards and any payments under those awards are the vehicle for delivering support during the year, prior to entitlement being finalised at the end of the year when all the relevant facts are known. Viewed in that light, it is clear that once it has been made, an award cannot simply disappear, which is what the reference to the revoking of awards might be taken to imply. Using the word "terminating" seems a more accurate description of what is going on. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>children independent of support for adults. In particular, we are making payment for the support of children go to the primary carer, since they usually bear the everyday responsibility for a child and meet his or her everyday expenditure. It is vital, especially for families of low income, that enough support is directed to that family to lift or keep the child out of poverty.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para25"></a>I refer now to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, on Second Reading. There is increasing recognition that many more families now share responsibility for children than was previously the case. This occurs in particular where families have split up and where there is encouragement from the Child Support Agency, the Lord Chancellor's Department and the like, that even though partners may split up, parenting continues. We seek to encourage the ability of children to retain contact with both of their natural parents as much as possible.

<a name="20521-40_para26"></a>The increase in shared responsibility between families therefore raises the question of whether, in the future, directing support solely to the family mainly caring for a child will continue to be the right approach when more than one family has responsibility for that child.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para27"></a>We are taking a reserve power. We do not want to move too quickly on this. It has major read-acrosses for other benefits, such as housing benefit, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell understands. It would require extensive consultation with the relevant groups, who might otherwise be apprehensive about some of its implications. It also involves expensive IT changes.
<P>

<a name="20521-40_para28"></a>None the less, in response to the legitimate and proper issues raised on Second Reading, it seemed right to make some protective changes to the Bill at this stage to equip us to deal appropriately with shared care cases if in the future it seems right and proper that we take a different approach. I could go into detail about the individual clauses if that would be helpful, but they allow us to take that power. I hope that noble Lords will accept the amendments. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20521-41_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, for this. As she says, it recognises the shift in the direction of government policy on family law, which is all towards encouraging contact with both parents and encouraging the sharing of responsibility wherever possible. It is not, of course, the right treatment for every child in every broken marriage. There is no such thing as the right treatment in every case. However, where a choice exists it is clearly to be encouraged and where care is shared, often on nearly an equal basis, clearly the financial rewards should also be shared as far as possible.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para0"></a>I entirely understand the case for flexibility that the noble Baroness has made. It is a stronger case in this Bill than in most others. We are in a rapidly moving landscape. The future of the CSA is in question, as is the future of much of the Family Law Act 1996 and a great deal else, including housing benefit. Were the noble Baroness to attempt to lay anything down in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>tablets of stone, she might find that stone is a rather more fragile material than we sometimes think, as most quarrymen know.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para1"></a>I understand why the noble Baroness wants flexibility. It is the right way to go about it. I hope she will keep in touch with her noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor and his department on this, and I look forward to any future developments on this front.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para2"></a>Finally, the assumption that there is such a thing as the primary carer is not necessarily valid in all cases. I remember one cheerful group of people in which the parents had swapped partners. They spent the summer together in a very large farmhouse. The primary carer was whoever happened to arrive first when a child fell over and cut their knee. It is not always as simple as that, but the assumption that there is a primary carer in all cases should not be made lightly.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para3"></a>I thank the Minister very warmly for what she has done and look forward to developments with a great deal of interest.

<a name="20521-41_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: We come to a series of extremely arithmetical but none the less important amendments. We have sought to write on the face of the Bill the proposals made by the Chancellor in his Budget. We may or may not have been successful in that attempt. No doubt the noble Baroness will tell us whether that is so. The key to the argument is on the face of the Government's own documentation, in Table 3.4 on page 16 in Child and Working Tax Credits&#151;Modernisation of British Tax and Benefits System which was published in April 2002. It is apparent from that table that there is to be a massive increase in the extent of means-testing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Could the noble Lord repeat the citation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I refer to page 16, table 3.4, of the document Child and Working Tax Credits - Modernisation of the British Tax and Benefits System, which gives marginal rates. I said "means testing"; I should have said a massive increase in the numbers of people affected by high marginal rates. It looks as though there will now be a marginal deduction rate of more than 60 per cent and that the number of people subject to that will increase from 94,000 to 1,450,000, which is certainly a startling achievement. The increase in numbers facing the marginal deduction rate of more than 60 per cent is evidently largely due to the extension of in-work support for those without children through the working tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para9"></a>Overall, if one looked at the Budget, the increase in expenditure on this overall exercise was something like &#163;2.7 billion. It is a rather strange aspect of the Budget. If one looks at the changes that the Chancellor made, effectively the impositions on business would pay for <P>


<a name="column_CWH121"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the increase in National Health Service expenditure. The other increases in taxation are effectively all going towards the proposals made in the Bill. In terms of the orders of magnitude&#151;although not necessarily the allocation between raising and spending tax revenues&#151;broadly speaking, that is the situation.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para10"></a>We see here a massive increase not only in the number of people subject to high rates of marginal taxation&#151;or, alternatively, benefit withdrawal&#151;but we see also a very big increase in the extension of means testing. I know that the Minister does not like the expression "means testing" and would prefer to use the expression "targeting". None the less, the effect of the Bill is fairly apparent so far as concerns what is really happening.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para11"></a>There is a huge redistribution of income here. We have gone from new Labour to old Labour. A rather curious feature of it&#151;perhaps the Minister can give the Committee some explanation&#151;is that this applies only to people over the age of 25. As I understand it&#151;I may be wrong&#151;the effect of this redistribution of income does not apply to those under 25. We are not quite clear why this arbitrary line has been drawn at that particular level.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para12"></a>The overall effect of the proposals is clearly very radical indeed, extremely expensive, and it has the undesirable side effects that I have mentioned. It is also the case that the tapers run right the way up the income scale to &#163;58,000. Is it &#163;58,000?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It can be before the tables finally taper out.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   To &#163;58,000. So we get this huge extension of the taper into those who have previously been beyond the scope of this kind of Government action.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para13"></a>On Second Reading I said that the gap between those who were not involved with the Inland Revenue at all because they did not complete tax returns&#151;but who were going to be in the benevolent scope of the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;and, at the other end of the scale, those who were subject to the Inland Revenue because they paid tax, seems to have disappeared altogether. Perhaps it has not disappeared altogether, but could the Minister give some idea of what percentage of the population at the moment is not involved with the Inland Revenue at all, and what percentage of the population will no longer be involved with the Inland Revenue if these proposals are adopted? The gap appears to be growing smaller and smaller.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I would need an abacus to work that out.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The noble Baroness does not need an abacus or a computer&#151;hand-held or otherwise. It is not a laughing matter. It means that the amount of form-filling intervention and so forth which is going on is vastly increased. We have grave doubts about the way in which the Government's proposals are working. More and more people are being drawn into <P>


<a name="column_CWH122"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the clutches of the Inland Revenue. That is perhaps a rather pejorative way of putting it, but it is the case that the extent of government intervention in people's day-to-day lives&#151;or more exactly the extension of the number of people with whose everyday lives the Government are directly concerned&#151;is increasing very rapidly indeed.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para14"></a>Having said that, we have sought to write it onto the face of the Bill. No doubt the noble Baroness will say one ought not to do that; one can do it all by regulation and so forth. But it is important to bring home to people exactly how far the Government are now going in extending the scope of their activities. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that the Bill does have a redistributive effect. I would regard that as neither Old Labour nor undesirable. We on these Benches are not raving egalitarians. On the other hand, we have noted that over the past 20 years inequality has increased faster in this country than anywhere else in the developed world except New Zealand. We think the pendulum has swung too far and that it is time it swung the other way. The fact that the Bill does have a redistributive effect is one of the reasons why on these Benches we are prepared to welcome it.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para15"></a>I take the point that it must involve an extension of means-testing in the use of these very long tapers. But we have already been through the fact that we cannot avoid poverty traps except by the use of very long tapers. We worked that out in Labour and in vain in the Parliament of 1992-97. The conclusions we reached then appear to be sound.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para16"></a>There is also a major tactical disadvantage in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, if he should think at any future stage to press it. He is writing the amounts of these credits into primary legislation. If he has any means of uprating them I have not seen it, and if I failed to spot it, I make my apology. Incidentally, the matter of uprating is one that I hope we may address in a future amendment. As things stand, these sums could only be uprated by primary legislation, and if I were a Member of the Legislative Committee of the Cabinet&#151;which, thank God, I am not&#151;I would not welcome such a proposal because I would expect to be bombarded with more requests than I could comfortably accede to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-41_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Earl, Lord Russell, has made the substantive point in response to this amendment, which is that it is daft putting figures on the face of a Bill because we are going to need primary legislation to keep amending it&#151;unless the noble Lord thinks he seeks to end redistribution by freezing the amount in perpetuity until Parliament can find more time.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para17"></a>Perhaps I can reassure him, however. Under Amendment No. 214 tabled in my name, to which we will come in due course, he will see that the Government are effectively committing themselves to an annual uprating assessment of these awards. He will also know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer made <P>


<a name="column_CWH123"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it clear that the child tax credit, which is the high value benefit in all of this, will for the life of this Parliament be uprated in line with earnings. I hope that he will take on board the serious point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that it is never desirable to put figures that properly need to be regularly amended and updated on the face of a Bill because of the method of seeking to overcome them.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para18"></a>The noble Lord also asked why we were excluding the under 25 year-olds. He is right; that is exactly what we are doing. That is because, first, there is a well established precedent in social security law that we make a distinction between those under and those over 25 years of age.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para19"></a>What we know is that while the under 25 year-olds may be poor but for the most part their poverty is not created by difficulties of access to the labour market. In those aged over 25, however, twice as many proportionately are in the bottom quintile of income compared to the under 25 year-olds. They are poorer because, in part and for various reasons, they find access to the labour market more difficult. They may suffer a mild disability or they may be under-skilled. The under 25 year-olds, however, are both less poor and have easier access to the labour market. In practical terms they are more likely to be living at home and receiving parental support. That is the reason why, when making this major expansion for the first time to make work pay for single and couple families without children, it is being introduced for those aged over 25.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para20"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord asked me how many families would now be subject to means-testing, as he referred to it, by the Inland Revenue. Leaving aside that I regard paying tax as means-testing by the Inland Revenue, though I am not sure that the noble Lord would embrace that, if we are dealing with some 25 or 30 million or so households&#151;units of assessment&#151;in this country, then 5.75 million come within the framework of this Bill. Many others are pensioners who come within the framework of pension credits, but that is not a relationship handled by Inland Revenue, but by the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para21"></a>I wonder whether those remarks have met all the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. I do not want to move on to debate about marginal deduction rates. I shall happy to do so if the noble Lord wishes, but given the hour, it may not be wise. He rightly identified that the main increase in the greater numbers was both the increased generosity of the tax credits and their extension to those who are single and without children. That accounts for the much greater number coming within it.
<P>

<a name="20521-41_para22"></a>That may relate to a subsequent amendment tabled by the noble Lord confining those recipients of tax credits to no more than 25 per cent of the population, which in a way it would have been sensible to have grouped with this because that would have the equally perverse effect of limiting the redistributative push of these tax credits. I have to say that the noble Lord and I have very different views on this.

<a name="20521-41_para23"></a>I am proud of the fact that not only are we tackling child poverty, but we are making work pay for families for whom life is always precarious and whose lives are always churning out of work and into work. They worry whether they can cope. It is magnificent that we are able to achieve both objectives in a way that simplifies and streamlines the amount of support we will give to families in need. I hope that any amendments pursued by the Opposition benches will not seek to reduce the element of bringing support to children in poverty and helping and encouraging their parents both to move into work and to stay in work. Only in that way will those children have a chance of a decent future.

<A NAME="20521-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   If this were all cost free, that would of course be a highly desirable situation, but one cannot overlook the fact that this has to be paid for by someone. One needs to look at both sides of the coin.
<P>

<a name="20521-42_para0"></a>Perhaps I may pursue one final point with the Minister. Until now, a large group of people has not been involved with the Inland Revenue at all. They do not fill in tax returns and consequently they are excluded from the system. How many people does the Revenue estimate it will now be dealing with compared with the number it was dealing with before the passage of this Bill?

Where there was more than one claim received for a particular child or children, Amendment No. 54 enables us to pay a reduced amount of any element payable in respect of any particular child. It is part of a bundle on shared care. As I tried to explain to the Committee at that time, it is part of the Government's taking a reserve power to address this issue as and when necessary. I reminded the Committee that, given the complexity and read-across to other benefits such as housing benefit; given the problems of IT and given other developments, what we needed at this stage was a reserve power rather than seeking to spell it out. This is part of that group.

The amendment is of quite considerable importance.
<P>

<a name="20521-42_para17"></a>The passported benefits between them, especially in the light of the continual and rather rapid increases in prescription charges, are a very important part of the value of social security to most claimants. It has been one of the weaknesses of the CSA that it did not carry passported benefits forward when people came off income support and came on to the CSA maintenance. That was a result of the failure of the House to carry an excellently drafted amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carter. I am sorry for his failure on the application, and I hope that he still remembers how good his arguments were.

<FONT SIZE=3>Bill, though led, obviously, by Inland Revenue and Treasury. The point I was making is that quite a lot of benefits were not for DWP or Inland Revenue, they were for other departments. The big value one, which is pre-school meals, is the responsibility of the Department for Education and Skills, and others are the responsibility of the Department of Health. The DWP connection was not the problem; it was the fact that other departments have to rethink what income flags and income eligibility they are going to attach to existing bids for these passported benefits, given the new financial structure for tax credits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-42_spnew17"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I was aware of the concession on pre-school meals, which I welcome and which I was just about to come to. For the rest, since we do have a sovereign Parliament, which may do whatever it likes, one ought occasionally to take advantage of that fact. While we have got it, let us use it.
<P>

<a name="20521-42_para19"></a>Whether something is done about this will make a big difference to the success of the Bill in achieving the objectives that the Minister and I share. I appreciate the point that the Government have already made that because the tapers are so long, this will bring passported benefits to people far higher up the income scale than have normally received them, or than we would expect to have any reasonable, equitable claim to receive them. Some sort of clawback arrangement would have to be worked out.
<P>

<a name="20521-42_para20"></a>I can see that the problem is extremely technical. I am rather glad that I am not in charge of trying to work out the answer. One possibility, which I am sure has occurred to the Government, although I do not know what they think about it, is making any passported benefit that comes to people who are higher up the income scale a taxable benefit at the higher rate of income tax, but not at the lower rate. That would be one way of making sure that we were not using such a benefit simply to subsidise the more prosperous upper middle classes. However, if it was not done for the people who are using the tax credit instead of income support, I think that the Bill, very sadly, would fail in its purpose. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I certainly agree with the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that this amendment raises very important issues. Two particular aspects give me cause for concern. One of them arises from the earlier debate we had on the extent to which individuals are notified of the whole range of benefits that are being provided by the Government.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para0"></a>The second point that gives me some cause for concern is partly about the level of income at which these benefits become available given the length of the taper. A third point, which has just occurred to me, is that the noble Baroness referred to the fact that many of these benefits are the province not merely of one department, be it the Department for Work and Pensions or Inland Revenue, but of a number of other departments as well.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para1"></a>In one sense, the Bill ought to adopt the same policy which Ministers in this House adopt; namely that they should speak for all departments. Presumably, we <P>


<a name="column_CWH128"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot leave the issue in the air and at some stage, if adjustments are to be made to other benefits as a result of the Bill, then we are entitled to know what will be those adjustments. They may be extremely important.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para2"></a>Because it is so important, perhaps we may return to the matter on Report. For the time being, I should like to ask her exactly which benefits does she think may have to be modified by the departments responsible for them as a result of the Bill? In what way are these changes to be made since, presumably, some of them may require primary legislation, or at least secondary legislation? If the Bill is going to have an effect on other benefits then clearly we shall need to know that, otherwise we will have a false understanding of the extent to which this legislation will affect individuals. It would be helpful if the noble Baroness could give us a brief list of which benefits will be affected by the introduction of the Tax Credits Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-43_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It does not quite work like that. It is not that benefits will be affected by the Tax Credits Bill. At the moment, here is a system of financial support for out-of-work families, along with some for in-work families. Here too is a system of passported benefits, which I am happy to describe. There is a read-across between certain levels of benefit, entitling people to certain passported benefits which, for the most part&#151;with only one or two exceptions&#151;would not apply to in-work benefits.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para3"></a>Because we are seeking this structural reform, child tax credit will brigade the out-of-work and the in-work benefits. Therefore, the links through to the passported benefits have be reconsidered. What it does not do, however, is alter the passported benefits as such. Those will remain the responsibility of the individual departments which provide them. For example, free school meals are provided by the Department for Education and Skills, while free prescriptions and dental treatment are provided by the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para4"></a>Those are the big benefits, but some minor ones are provided by my department, including bereavement benefits, maternity allowances, funeral grants, social fund payments and so forth. Issues like that must be considered, but it is the big ones, about which noble Lords, including the noble Earl, Lord Russell, are most concerned. Those must include free school dinners, because that is a high value benefit. Those benefits, and many more, use entitlement to current key social security benefits and tax credits as a peg for deciding who should have access to them. They flag up an entitlement. This is a way of cutting down on administration and targeting passported benefits on those whom the department wishes to help.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para5"></a>Those passported benefits&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Higgins is right in that we are revisiting an earlier discussion&#151;remain the responsibility of the departments which administer them, not the Treasury or the Inland Revenue or, for the most part&#151;except where specified&#151;the Department for Work and Pensions. It is those other departments which set the rules for entitlement. They decide what level of income <P>


<a name="column_CWH129"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>brings a family into entitlement for support and it is therefore usual for the department in question to set down eligibility in its own legislation.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is absolutely right to point out that this is obviously a Government matter, not simply one for the Inland Revenue or the Department for Work and Pensions. Officials from the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and the Department for Work and Pensions have been in discussion with the departments responsible for passported benefits for some time. We are all aware that decisions need to be made and Members of the Committee will be told as soon as we have confirmation of the detailed proposals for entitlement. While I do not believe that it would be right for the Bill to determine entitlement to passported benefits, it does contain provisions to allow departments to make the administration of passported benefits run smoothly.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para7"></a>Schedule 5 to the Bill includes provisions to allow the Revenue to share information with the Department of Health and the devolved administrations for health purposes, for obvious reasons. In addition, Schedule 3 ensures that, where entitlement to passported benefits is set out in primary legislation and the departments concerned have agreed, amendments to their primary legislation are made so as to replace the links currently in place with WFTC or DPTC with links to the new tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para8"></a>I have already referred to funeral payments and maternity grants. I wonder whether my remarks have met the points raised.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para9"></a>As I say, I cannot be more helpful at this stage as to what precisely the income level will be for people to achieve entitlement to what are currently passported benefits. That I cannot tell the Committee. We are still in discussions on that. As soon as I have that information, I shall bring it to the Committee. Ultimately, it is for those departments to determine because it is part of their budgets and part of their responsibilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I understand that it is for those departments to take the lead on these matters. Am I right in understanding the noble Baroness to say that, following the consultations between the departments, if it does require changes in legislation, those changes will be incorporated in the Bill? I do not see where else it could be done.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para10"></a>There is also the issue that if someone now becomes entitled to a tax credit then, dependent on the extent that that raises their income, they will either be entitled to a lower level of benefit if that benefit is income-related or, if it is a free benefit at the moment, they may find that they are excluded from it altogether. Again, I am not clear how, following the consultations, this is likely to take place in practice.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para11"></a>The other point I am not clear about is whether the noble Baroness is saying that these consultations will be completed before Report stage and that we should <P>


<a name="column_CWH130"></a>

<B>21 May 2002 : Column CWH130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>get various government amendments at that stage which implement the very important issues that the noble Earl, Lord Russell, has rightly raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-43_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, for his support on this issue. He is right that we need to know the answers to these questions before the Bill becomes law, otherwise we are simply incapable of judging what will be the effect of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para12"></a>I must apologise for keeping the Committee from its dinner, but if this matter is not settled a great many people will be kept from a great many dinners for a very long time.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para13"></a>The case I had most in mind was free prescriptions. From going into my local chemist since the latest increase in prescription charges, I have noticed that it has become over the chemist's counter an extremely contentious subject, and the chemist shows signs of visible anxiety whenever the subject is mentioned. That indicates a real difficulty of which we ought to be aware.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para14"></a>Can the Minister make a few slightly more precise comments? Can she first say that there will be an entitlement to passported benefits which will be connected with the Bill? Can she say that it will be settled before the Bill becomes law? Can she say that there will be a mechanism for a clawback so that the benefit does not go to people on incomes of &#163;58,000 a year&#151;which I believe we all agree it should not. If the Minster can say "yes" to all these questions, then we could rest in peace and go and have our dinner. Can she?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521-43_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No&#151;because on the third of those questions there would be no intention, certainly on my understanding, of an eligibility for free school dinners, for example, which takes a family up to &#163;50,000 being clawed back. I am reasonably confident that one way of proceeding would be, in some cases, to use existing benefit levels&#151;for example, the adult IS or JSA level might be one such trigger&#151;otherwise one will have to go for a defined income figure at which the benefit cuts off. That would be one approach. That was the noble Earl's third question.
<P>

<a name="20521-43_para15"></a>As to his other two questions, there certainly will be passporting. My dilemma is that I cannot tell the extent of the income scale to which passporting will go, whether it will be the same for all benefits or whether there will be a symmetry, partly to act as a form of taper, if I can put it that way. So one could go up the income scale for one benefit rather than another. How far up that income scale it will go, and whether it will simply replicate the existing income cut-off, that I cannot yet tell the noble Earl. That decision is awaiting further confirmation from the other departments.

Each individual will be mobilised for a period of no more than three months, which allows a little over two months' deployment in an operational theatre with the balance comprising pre-deployment training and post-tour leave. We expect to have to continue using similar, or possible slightly higher, numbers until next spring. The requirement will be reviewed regularly to ensure that the numbers called out are the minimum required to support operations.

The voting system for elections to regional assemblies is described in paragraphs 6.11 to 6.13 of the White Paper, Your Region, Your Choice, published on 9 May. Annex G illustrates in detail how the system works. As the White Paper says, we expect that the overall representation in an assembly will be broadly representative of the votes cast. However, it could be misleading to give an estimated outcome based on the results from a different type of electoral system (first-past-the-post for a general election) and where other factors are also unknown (eg, the exact proportion of ''top-up'' seats and the effect of the 5 per cent vote threshold for representation in an assembly).<P>

<P>
<A NAME="20521w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   No. There are significant differences between the responsibilities and budget of the National Assembly for Wales and those proposed for elected regional assemblies in England. We have followed the precedent of the Greater London Authority in proposing a precepting power for regional assemblies in England, but this does not mean that we believe that a precepting power is also necessary for the National Assembly for Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   An elected regional assembly would be responsible for the Regional Development Agency in its region. It would take on the strategic and resource allocation role of the local office of the Housing Corporation.
<P>

<a name="20521w02_para0"></a>It is also the Government's intention that accountability and funding for the arts and sports which are regional in character will be devolved to an assembly in a way which protects national priorities. In putting this into practice on arts, the Government will take account of the experience of the new regional framework and any reviews of it. In deciding the best arrangements to apply this principle to sport, the Government will take account of the current review of sport in England by the Performance and Innovation Unit and the quinquennial review of Sport England.
<P>

<a name="20521w02_para1"></a>In addition, elected regional assemblies will have influence over a range of public bodies, including the Learning and Skills Council, the Small Business Service, the Highways Agency, the Strategic Railways Authority, the Environment Agency, the Countryside Agency and English Nature.

<A NAME="20521w02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton:  </B>  We will be asking the Boundary Committee for England to recommend the best 100 per cent unitary structure for a region, having regard to the twin criteria of needing to reflect the identities and interests of local communities and securing effective, convenient local government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521w02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton:  </B>  Costs will vary from region to region, mainly because of the different sizes of their electorates. But we expect them all to fall in a range around &#163;15 million to &#163;30 million a region. This estimate includes all costs necessary to establish an assembly, including the cost of a referendum and of the first elections to an assembly.
<P>

<a name="20521w02_para2"></a>As chapter 5 of the White Paper, Your Region, Your Choice, says, we expect regional assemblies to bring about savings and other benefits which need to be set against their costs. We believe that an elected regional assembly is a public investment that can have a major impact on a region's productivity and prosperity, as well as increasing democratic accountability over decisions taken at the regional level.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521w02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton:  </B>  Successive UK governments have established the boundaries of the regions that will now be used for elected regional assemblies. With some changes over time, they have been used for certain administrative and statistical purposes since the Second World War. They are now used by, for example, the Government Offices and regional development agencies and for the constituencies for European parliamentary elections. These UK boundaries are also recognised by the European Union for relevant purposes, but the boundaries are ones that the UK Government and Parliament have decided.

<A NAME="20521w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  Agreement of the draft Directive on Savings is conditional on sufficient reassurances being received that key third countries will adopt equivalent measures. The effect on the economies of the Crown dependencies of adopting the principles of the Code of Conduct on Business Taxation would depend on the nature of the tax changes introduced to replace the current harmful features.

<P>
<A NAME="20521w03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  It is the responsibility of the European Commission to ensure that member states fulfil their obligations under EC rules, and for the Commission to determine the programme of inspection missions by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO). The FVO did not carry out a further inspection mission to France on poultry meat production in 2001.

The fact that the FVO has criticised the authorities in a member state does not mean that meat cannot be produced in accordance with EC law in that member state. The focus of health inspections is on the individual carcass, and meat may be lawfully traded only if it has been passed by veterinary inspection in the slaughterhouse, and has been given a health mark.

<P>

<a name="20521w03_para6"></a>The directive will inevitably impose new labelling costs, although these will be partially mitigated by the two-year transitional period provided for. The task of setting maximum limits for individual vitamins and minerals falls to the Commission acting on the advice of the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). Setting unnecessarily low maximum permitted levels for nutrients in food supplements would have a detrimental impact on both manufacturers and health food retailers and would place an unnecessary restriction on consumer choice.

The numbers quoted reflect the position at a point in time, and are continuing to rise.
<P>

<a name="20521w04_para0"></a>The interim report as at 2 April 2002 shows that of 455 responses, 76 trusts had 100 per cent clinical and support staff with access to email and browser facilities. A further 128 had declared their intention to take up the NHS national email service currently being procured, which is accepted as meeting the target for management purposes; 137 trusts have 100 per cent consultants with desktop access.
<P>

<a name="20521w04_para1"></a>A total of 284,079 (45 per cent) clinical and support staff have email and browser facilities; and 19,753 consultants (72 per cent) have desktop access.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  I have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses copies of the report of the quinquennial review of English Heritage. The report is also available on line at the DCMS website www.culture.gov.uk. The report affirms the value of English Heritage and its statutory functions. It also highlights a number of areas which need further work, in particular reviews of English Heritage's:

<a name="20521w04_para5"></a>English Heritage already has much work under way as part of its modernisation programme. I have therefore asked it to integrate the review's findings and recommendations into that process. DCMS and other interested departments will work closely with English Heritage to ensure that the recommendations in the report are implemented quickly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521w04_wqn3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether their procurement policy includes environmental criteria; and, if so, what are the criteria.[HL4161]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20521w04_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  Government procurement policy is to obtain value for money having due regard to propriety and regularity. Value for money is defined as ''the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the customer's requirement''. Sustainable development objectives, including policies aimed at reducing adverse environmental impacts, are pursued within the framework of this procurement policy and the EC procurement rules.
<P>

<a name="20521w04_para6"></a>Government departments have been required since 1990 to operate procurement strategies that take into account the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions. This means drafting contract specifications (including for production processes) that reflect government objectives; selecting suppliers that have the technical capacity to meet the environmental criteria specified; and awarding contracts to the bids that offer the best combination of quality and whole-life costs for the contracting authority. Whole-life costs will include, for example, energy consumed over the life of the product or service and disposal costs. Incorporating environmental criteria into procurement is explained in a note published jointly by HM Treasury and the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1998 and may be viewed on the Office of Government Commerce website. Detailed guidance on government policy and specific environmental criteria may be found in the Green Guide for Buyers&#151;URL: http://defraweb/environment/greening/greenpro/greenpro.htm.
