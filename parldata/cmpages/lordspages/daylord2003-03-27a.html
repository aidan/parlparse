<P>

"but should only seek to recover the recurrent running costs of the courts"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-01_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: We now resume the debate which finished on the previous occasion with the success of Amendment No. 132 on civil court fees. In many ways, as the Minister is aware, we on the Opposition Benches are seeking to assist the Government to resist a Treasury-imposed directive, which would lead to virtually all the costs of civil courts being raised through the level of court fees.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para7"></a>Not that I am ever allowed to disclose any private discussion, but I am aware that there is considerable unrest at all levels of civil justice about this policy. In particular, on the last occasion that the Committee debated the Courts Bill, I quoted the Civil Justice Council, chaired by the Master of the Rolls, which had called on the Government to abandon the policy of raising virtually the full cost of civil courts through fees.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para8"></a>However, as the Minister will be aware, since that date and since the passing of the amendment, the Government have decided to unveil court fee increases. I must not show too many of my grey hairs, but I can recall the court fee being £10 for the writ. I remember it rising to £50 and then to £100. I see from the Law Society Gazette of 20th March that, as from 3rd April, if anyone wishes to commence proceedings in the High Court, the proposed increases will mean that the fee will be £500. The Government intend that the court fee for a claim of more than £100,000 within the High Court jurisdiction&#151;say, by someone with a disability who has been injured in an accident&#151;will now be £700. That will be the cost of simply starting the process. One hopes that under the reforms of the Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, there will be the <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>normal pre-action protocols. But if the proposals go through, the cost of issuing the writ will now be £700, and if the claim happens to be above £150,000, it will be £800.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para9"></a>I ask the Government to reconsider. There is no doubt that, as the Civil Justice Council points out, this will lead to a denial of access to justice. I hope that that will no longer be the case following the passing of the amendment. In these amendments&#151;in particular, Amendment No. 132A but also in Amendments Nos. 132B and 132C&#151;we give the Government a menu of options. Indeed, we are from the Opposition and we are here to help the Government. They can choose any one of these three amendments.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para10"></a>The first&#151;Amendment No. 132A&#151;would exclude the recovery of costs other than recurrent running costs. It is a very sensible amendment proposed by a number of outside bodies. Amendment No. 132B would seek to exclude from this new power for the Lord Chancellor to set fees the recovery of judicial salaries and the cost of accommodation. We are aware that problems have been raised by the Royal Courts of Justice, and those have to be dealt with. I hope that the Government will be able to engage in the widest possible consultation and a proper and open debate about the issue of the Royal Courts of Justice and about whether a level of 100 per cent recovery is appropriate and defensible. If it is not, what should the percentage of recovery be, and is it a percentage that will change over time?
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para11"></a>The final amendment&#151;Amendment No. 132C&#151;would lay down that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Lord Chancellor may not under this section seek to recover judicial salaries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-01_para12"></a>
I hope that this will be the most acceptable of the amendments. The provision of judges is a social function. It should not be borne only by those who choose to commence proceedings and are required to pay court fees.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para13"></a>I hope that the Government will consider having a meeting with the Civil Justice Council. I understand that there has been no meeting on this matter, but the Minister will be aware that the council issued a very clear report on it seeking a reversal of the policy. The Civil Justice Council, chaired by the Master of the Rolls, is an important body on which sit leaders of civil justice in all its forms. I believe that they deserve at least a meeting to debate and discuss this policy. In the mean time, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   We on these Benches support the amendments for the reasons very cogently put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. The Minister may recall that at our last Committee meeting I raised the question of whether the fees would be set at a level such that those who could pay would be subsidising those who could not. Following that, she wrote to me on that topic. As I understand it, the Government are saying that that is not the principle upon which the fees will be apportioned. I should be <P>


<a name="column_915"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grateful if the noble Baroness could repeat that assurance this morning in open court, as it were, before the Members of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I intend to deal with all three amendments in responding to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The effect of these amendments, none of which are consequential on each other, would make it a statutory requirement that the Lord Chancellor should have regard when prescribing fees to the need: first, to recover only the recurring running costs of the courts, which is Amendment No. 132A; secondly, to exclude judicial salaries and accommodation costs, which is Amendment No. 132B; and, thirdly, as in Amendment No. 132C, to exclude judicial salaries alone. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for his attempt to assist the Government in this regard, but I shall decline his invitation.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para14"></a>A statutory provision that excludes judicial salaries and accommodation costs from recurrent running costs would be an undesirable fetter on the Lord Chancellor's powers in exercising his ministerial responsibility to set fees; it would understate the true cost of the service; and it would require a significant proportion of business-related cases being subsidised by the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para15"></a>Subject to subsidies to protect access to justice, the Government's policy is to recover through fees the cost of civil court services, which includes judicial salaries and accommodation costs. That approach is based on the general principle that it is reasonable to expect that those parties who can pay should meet the cost of that part of the civil justice system they are using in order to resolve their dispute. The policy of recovering most of the costs of the courts through fees ensures the best targeting of scarce public resources. These are public expenditure decisions for the Government.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para16"></a>First I shall deal with specific points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The Committee will remember that accommodation costs were first included in costs recovery in 1982. In 1992 the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the then Lord Chancellor&#151;whom I see is sitting in his place&#151;agreed it was anomalous that judicial salaries should not be included. The introduction of accruals accounting across government has brought in capital charges for property which reflect the true cost of services. This principle and approach is now in its 11th year, so it has been established for some time.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para17"></a>The civil courts are funded appropriately. The Government showed their commitment to ensuring that citizens can access and enforce their legal rights or have their obligations determined by an independent tribunal by enshrining the European Convention on Human Rights in the domestic Human Rights Act.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para18"></a>Last year&#151;2001&#150;02&#151;the Government funded civil and criminal legal aid in the sum of £1,717 million. The total cost of running the criminal and civil courts was approximately £1.1 billion. In fairness to the taxpayer, there is no reason why court users who can pay should not pay for the cost of the civil courts service which <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they are using. We are not talking of those who cannot pay, or, as the noble Lord suggested, the disabled, who may very well have the advantage of legal aid. The noble Lord will know that legally-aided applicants do not pay fees; they are paid by the Legal Aid Fund.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para19"></a>I am happy to repeat what I said in my letter to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. We do not recover "full" cost as the policy of protecting access to justice also applies. The Government funds those receiving exemptions and remissions and the family proceedings subsidy and not other fee-paying litigants. The Government's policy is normally to recover the full cost of government services but Ministers can agree exceptions, as for the civil courts. Recovering the full or partial cost of services ensures the best targeting of scarce resources. So the noble Lord is absolutely right to say that that is the Government's position. I am very happy to reiterate that for the purposes of the debate.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, touched on the recent fee increase. The overall increase is under 12 per cent. It is the first increase since April 2000. Some fees have remained unchanged since 1999. Over the three-year to four-year period the annual increase is between 3 per cent to 4 per cent. Without increases a £30 million budget shortfall is projected for 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30327-01_para21"></a>These are important and difficult issues. We think that the Government have struck the proper balance in assisting those who cannot pay and in cushioning them, as I described when last we were in Committee. But those who have the means&#151;and noble Lords will remember we touched on the work in the commercial Court where litigants have those means&#151;should pay and pay at a proper rate. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   There are number of gaps in the response of the noble Baroness. First, her argument is that the provision would be an undesirable fetter. However, she has not yet given the Committee the benefit of her view, or that of the Government, on the passing of the last amendment which preserved the principle of access to justice. We seek to build on that principle.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para0"></a>The Minister's point about those who can afford to pay does not answer the point raised from our Benches and those of the Liberal Democrats. We are particularly concerned about people who are just above the threshold. Although she may say that it does not apply to legally aided applicants, she will be aware that the Government have virtually abolished civil legal aid. Most applicants must now enter a complicated mechanism called a conditional fee agreement on a no win, no fee basis. Those agreements were introduced without proper research, and the courts must now deal with the consequences.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para1"></a>My final point is that we are dealing with the law of diminishing returns. As fewer and fewer people pay court fees, the court fees rise. Although the noble Baroness seeks to persuade us that an increase of around 12 per cent is small, I do not believe that it is, particularly given some of the specific fees. There is a <P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem now that fees are being set too high. With the deficit, there is underfunding. The Master of the Rolls recently pointed out that the IT system underpinning the civil justice reforms has not yet been implemented. The Minister should reconsider. She has not responded to my invitation to meet the Civil Justice Council. I hope that she will consider it.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para2"></a>In the mean time, I wish to press Amendment No. 132C, which would exclude judicial salaries, and to test the opinion of the Committee. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 132A.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para13"></a>Amendments Nos. 133 and 136 are probing amendments designed to clarify some of the terms of Clause 88. The clause inserts a new Section 19B of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, introducing, for the first time, provision for the award of costs against third parties in criminal proceedings. A third party costs order is defined as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an order as to the payment of costs incurred by a party to criminal proceedings by a person who is not a party to those proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-02_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30327-02_para15"></a>I assume that a third party costs order can apply to part of the costs incurred by a party to the proceedings and not simply to the whole of the costs, and I have tabled an amendment that would clarify that. Although I have little doubt that that is what subsection (2) of the new section means, I would like it clarified.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para16"></a>Amendment No. 136 is designed to deal with a significant omission from new Section 19B. The new section says nothing about the nature of the proceedings by which a costs order may be made against a third party. It is obvious that justice requires that a third party to criminal proceedings&#151;in other words, somebody who is outside the proceedings and is not a party himself&#151;cannot be ordered to pay the costs of those proceedings, unless there has been a hearing at which he is entitled to be present and make the case as to why a third party costs order should not be imposed.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para17"></a>There is no provision in the new section that requires the regulations to be made by the Lord Chancellor to include any provision either for notifying the third party or, more importantly, giving the third party a right to a hearing at which objections can be made to an order being made against him for payment of costs. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   This is an important group of amendments, and I want not only to respond to the words of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, but to speak to Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 and support the points that the noble Lord just made.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para18"></a>The intention to introduce a new power for the magistrates' courts and Crown Courts was backed up by a statement made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that the power should be deployed against the media, as he described it. The proposal is of real concern to the Newspaper Society, particularly to the 1,300 regional and local newspapers&#151;daily and weekly titles, paid-for and free&#151;published by its members throughout the United Kingdom. The Committee will know that, as has been pointed out, such newspapers cover the day-to-day work of the criminal courts. I know that the concern that is being expressed is shared by the Society of Editors.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para19"></a>The principle, which everyone supports, is that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. That requires that justice be administered in public, so that the process and the results are open to public scrutiny. It is important to aid public understanding of the way in which the criminal justice system operates. <P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Often, it is left to the local and regional media to ensure that people are aware of how the criminal law operates.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para20"></a>As they stand, the provisions&#151;namely, the wide-ranging and, to some extent, uncertain powers to make substantial costs orders against the media&#151;will be a disincentive to the reporting of proceedings. Editors, newspapers and the media will face the risk of the award of costs of legal defence and the cost of premiums for insurance against wrongful attempts to impose such penalties. For smaller papers, comparatively small sums could exert a chilling effect on the reporting of court proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para21"></a>Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 would identify what "serious misconduct" is. As the Bill stands, that need not be contempt in any form, a breach of a court order or a reporting restriction or any other breach of criminal or civil law. It is wrong to introduce new controls over reporting in that way. At the moment, if there has been a mistake, the matter is dealt with under existing law, backed by powerful sanctions but with procedural and substantive legal safeguards for freedom of expression.
<P>

<a name="30327-02_para22"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I am concerned that there will be a risk that orders for prohibitive costs will be made arbitrarily against third parties&#151;in particular, newspapers&#151;for conduct or publication that is not even unlawful. That could have a chilling effect on reporting and publication that would be detrimental to open justice and public scrutiny and to public understanding of the criminal justice system. I hope that the Minister will reconsider.

<A NAME="30327-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I speak to Amendment No. 138 which, in my opinion, is one of the most important amendments in the Bill. If the Government want to do anything about cost and delay, they must tackle the scandalous situation which has arisen in the past two or three years in respect of the failure of the Prison Service and private security firms to deliver prisoners to court in time, and sometimes at all.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para0"></a>My recent experience covers the Wales and Chester circuit, the northern circuit, the Midlands circuit and the Central Criminal Court in London. Each circuit has the same problem. In the past, we attended court one hour before the hearing. If it was a 10.30 a.m. sitting, we would be there at 9.30 a.m. in order to see the client. Now, it is a complete waste of time to do that. I cannot recall a case recently which has started at the specific allocated time.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para1"></a>The various problems are these. First, there is an unwillingness between the Prison Service and private security firms to co-operate. Secondly, the private security firms, in particular, do not have enough personnel. Consequently, they traverse the countryside&#151;outside London&#151;carrying the prisoners to various courts, and are immune to any criticism made of them. Thirdly, on arrival at the court building, a period of time has to elapse while they arrange themselves and the practice has now developed&#151;I understand as a result of insurance requirements&#151;that no prisoner is taken to a conference <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>room unless handcuffed to a member of prison staff. That is the position within the secure area of the court to which prisoners are brought. All that takes time.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para2"></a>Another problem is that the interview rooms are not properly manned. It happens all the time in Birmingham where there are 12 or 13 interview rooms but only five are manned at any one time. The result is that queues of lawyers, counsel and solicitors stand outside hammering on the door, trying to use the intercom to talk to Prison Service personnel, to people who are completely indifferent to the problems that the lawyers are facing and to the problems that the court upstairs is facing. It results in total frustration.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para3"></a>I referred to Birmingham and Wolverhampton. I remember one day recently when 28 prisoners were brought in custody to the court. They all arrived late. Only three interview rooms existed and the queue of lawyers stretched from the lobby before the entrance to the secure area right across the main hall of the court. Everyone was standing around wasting time and wasting public money.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para4"></a>The judges have no means of doing anything about the situation. They have no coercive powers whatever. Some shrug their shoulders; others do what they can. I know of one judge, for example, who, whenever there is a delay in his court, writes a letter and keeps a copy. In a short period of time, he has acquired a thick file which he intends to send to the Lord Chancellor's Department when a particular private security firm is seeking to renew its contract. That is the only weapon that there is&#151;namely, the contract.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para5"></a>The amendment proposes that the judge is given the power to make an inquiry at the time to establish whether he is being lied to as regards where the prisoner has been taken&#151;that has happened in the past&#151;and to establish the reasons for the delay. Subsequently, the judge could order costs against the Prison Service or the private security firm or wherever the fault may lie. That would instantly improve the situation.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para6"></a>At the moment, this country is spending millions of pounds in paying lawyers for hanging about unable to do their jobs. It is paying millions of pounds for wasted court time. It is an amazing sight to see a High Court judge sitting in his own court for a quarter of an hour because there is no person available to man the dock and therefore no prisoners can be brought in. That happened recently to me in an important Crown Court in the Midlands.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para7"></a>That issue must be tackled. It must be dealt with. The contract system simply is not working. I hope that I shall hear something from the Government which will address this particular problem. It is a scandal.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Before the Minister replies, the issue of the press, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, is the subject of the single amendment in the next group. I did not speak to it as I asked for it to be <P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>degrouped because it is sufficiently important to require its own group. Perhaps the Minister will bear that in mind when replying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I speak to Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 which are perhaps related to Amendment No. 137A. I cannot see how the proposal would work if "wilful" were substituted for "serious". The number of cases in which the press "wilfully" misconducts itself can be counted on the fingers of one hand, if they exist at all. The press lack wilfulness because it is simply negligent. There is a combination of the reporter who misunderstands and the sub-editor who does not understand either, and so forth, which leads to serious misconduct and everyone throws their hands in the air and says, "Well, I'm terribly sorry. It shouldn't have happened and we shall try to ensure that it doesn't happen again".
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para8"></a>The question of costs only arises in the Bill if there is not only misconduct, but serious misconduct. Therefore, I cannot understand what is wrong with that. Amendment No. 138 clearly deserves maximum support and I hope that the Minister will be able to say that this is something which will be tackled and will be tackled energetically. She obviously has instructions not only from the Lord Chancellor but also from the Treasury and this is wasting public money. Therefore, one might expect the Government to endorse it enthusiastically.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made comments in relation to the chilling effect on local and regional newspapers. I believe that he described the arbitrary way in which costs may be awarded. That procedure will be applied by the courts exercising their judgment judicially. It would be fair to say that the courts have never in the past exercised that duty in an arbitrary way. Therefore, implicit in these provisions in the Bill is that they will continue to behave in the same proportionate way as they have historically.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para9"></a>Before I turn to the particular amendments, there is already an acknowledgement that there is a difference between regional and national newspapers. In contempt cases, the courts have accepted that the fact that a newspaper is regional and not national is a mitigating factor in deciding what the penalty should be. We believe that the same would apply to the new cost provision. I wanted to say that before turning to the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para10"></a>Amendment No. 133, tabled in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Kingsland, proposes that the court may order the third party to pay,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all or any part of the",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-03_para11"></a>
relevant costs&#151;in other words, to decide the proportion of costs that the third party should pay.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para12"></a>The intention in this clause is to shift the burden of costs to those who cause them to be incurred or wasted. We also intend that where costs are to be paid, it will be for the courts to decide, after considering all the relevant circumstances, whether it is appropriate <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the third party to pay all or only a proportion of the relevant costs. We believe that approach is proportionate and reasonable. I know that this is a probing amendment, so I wanted to say that clearly.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para13"></a>The new section that the clause adds will form part of a group of sections on costs in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. We believe that, as far as possible, the wording of the new clause should be consistent with that in other sections. Spelling out,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all or any part of the costs",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-03_para14"></a>
would create a contrast between the new section and the existing Section 19(1) of the 1985 Act, which provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision empowering [the court] in any case where the court is satisfied that one party to criminal proceedings has incurred costs as a result of an unnecessary or improper act or omission by, or on behalf of, another party to the proceedings, to make an order as to the payment of those costs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-03_para15"></a>
Including "all or any part" in one section but not another could form the basis of an argument that the section that did not include that phrase did not permit an order to be made as to part of the costs only.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para16"></a>In addition, the amendment is unnecessary. Our wording already allows the court to make an order for part or all of the costs. I hope that satisfies the noble Lord. I see him indicating that that is so.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 134 and 135, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, spoke, would define the meaning of the impropriety that may cause costs to be wasted or incurred. I concur with the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, about that. Amendment No. 134 would refer only to "misconduct", rather than "serious misconduct". Amendment No. 135 would define the impropriety as "serious and wilful misconduct". We chose the term "serious misconduct" because we do not want to include all misconduct. We want to catch those whose improprieties are considered serious or grave, such as the juror who prefers to go to the races rather than attending court, or a newspaper that publishes a prejudicial article that causes a criminal trial to be adjourned or abandoned. There is no need to remind the Committee that the Sunday Mirror published an article that caused the first trial of Woodgate and others&#151;more popularly known as the Leeds footballers case&#151;to be abandoned, at considerable cost to the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para18"></a>We do not want to catch a juror who is late for court through his own fault, but only by quarter of an hour. His lateness is clearly misconduct of a sort, but it may not be considered serious and the resulting wasted costs may be inconsiderable. We believe that "serious" is necessary and removing it would widen the scope of the legislation beyond that which was intended.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para19"></a>We view the addition of "and wilful" also as limiting and unnecessary. An impropriety may be serious, but at the same time it may not be wilful. For example, to publish a newspaper article reckless of the potential impact on a trial should be capable of being caught by the clause, even though it may not have been done wilfully, in the sense that there was no wilful intent to disrupt the administration of justice. It is reasonable to <P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that a professional journalist or editor would understand the high degree of care that needs to be taken with articles about those involved in or related to current criminal proceedings. However, the same could not necessarily be said about the average man in the street who is not subject to any professional obligation and may be unaware that certain actions could have a detrimental effect on any proceedings. The court will be able to take account of these different considerations in determining whether, in the particular context, an impropriety should be treated as serious misconduct. "Wilful" could unduly restrict the court in cases of reckless acts or omissions where a third party costs order would be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30327-03_para20"></a>Under Amendment No. 136, when the court is considering making a costs order, the third party must be notified and given the opportunity of making representations before any such order is made. Of course we accept that the third party must have a right to a hearing, but we propose to provide for that in regulations and not in the Bill. On the notification of and representation for third parties, the Government intend to follow the provisions in existing regulations.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My point was not that those issues should be included on the face of the Bill, but that the face of the Bill should spell them out as among the specific things that regulations should be required to provide for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand what the noble Lord has in mind, but we still say that it would not be necessary. I am happy to say that we intend to include those issues in regulations. They will be similar to provisions in existing regulations that have been made relating to cases under Part 2 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The noble Lord will know that Regulations 3 and 3B of the Costs in Criminal Cases (General) Regulations 1986 provide that parties to proceedings who have acted improperly, and legal or other representatives who have acted negligently, may make representations to the court before any costs order is made against them. In those cases, it has been sufficient for the issue of representations to be dealt with in regulations and not in the Act. We propose the same here. I hope that the noble Lord will in due course be content with that.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para0"></a>Amendment No. 137 would limit the requirements to be satisfied before the court can consider a costs order by limiting the definition of serious misconduct to an "intentional or reckless act". It would limit the act to one that made a material contribution to the mischief and it would limit the mischief to delaying or causing the abandonment of a trial.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para1"></a>I have already said that we believe that it should be for the courts, after considering all the facts of each case, to determine which improprieties, including omissions as well as acts, constitute serious misconduct. Clause 88 allows the courts to do that.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, spoke to Amendment No. 138. He rightly raised an issue that causes much frustration to the courts and contributes to the waste of court time and taxpayers' money. He <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>gave us some graphic examples of the nature and extent of the problem and the level of frustration that it has caused to all those who have been subject to it.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para3"></a>However, we believe that the amendment, although absolutely pertinent, is unnecessary. Clause 88 already allows the court to deal with errant deliverers of prisoners. If costs are wasted because of late delivery, the court can look at the circumstances that caused the lateness. If it was the result of serious misconduct, the appropriate action can be taken&#151;the court can make a third party costs order. Putting such detail on the face of the Bill can be unhelpful. It can encourage people to argue that the scope of the legislation has been unnecessarily limited, which will allow for other actions of serious misconduct to escape. I thank the noble Lord for raising this important issue, but we believe that the clause already enables the court to catch the situation that he described. The court will be able to assess whether there was a serious matter of misconduct with which it would be proper to deal. Now that the court has this sanction&#151;these teeth&#151;with which to bite such miscreants, we certainly hope that that will have a salutary effect and will cause people to behave in a more appropriate manner.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para4"></a>Has the noble Lord degrouped Amendment No. 143, because I believe that it was spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   It was Amendment No. 137A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para5"></a>I turn finally to Amendment No. 143. The amendment proposes that any regulations made under proposed new Section 19B, which deals with the award of costs against third parties in criminal proceedings, should be made by way of the affirmative resolution procedure. When preparing the provision, we took the view that none of the usual reasons for having the affirmative resolution process applied in this case.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para6"></a>In its report on the Bill, the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform raised no objection. Noble Lords will know of the importance we have attached to the committee's report. I may say that that applies where the committee has made no recommendation as well as where it has.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para7"></a>Clause 88 inserts a new Section 19B in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 which is similar to other provisions on costs contained in Sections 19 and 19A. Indeed, Section 19 is cast as conferring a regulation-making power. Neither of those powers, nor the general regulation-making power in Part II of the 1985 Act, is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. We see no reason why the regulations made under new Section 19B should require the affirmative resolution procedure when the existing provisions they will mirror have been subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para8"></a>We are satisfied that the regulations made under new Section 19B should be subject to the negative resolution procedure because the provisions which would be contained in those regulations are concerned <P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 926</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the detail of how the court's power to make third party costs orders will operate in practice; in other words, they will be primarily about procedural matters. For this reason, we do not believe that the affirmative resolution procedure is appropriate and I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30327-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am entirely satisfied with the Minister's response on Amendment No. 133. As regards Amendment No. 136, while I would have preferred to see something in the Bill that specifically required regulations to be made about hearings, I accept the Government's assurance that they will be included, if only because any attempt to make a costs order without a hearing against a third party would be a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para9"></a>Perhaps I may ask my noble friend to comment briefly on his position on Amendment No. 138.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am delighted with the response made by the noble Baroness to Amendment No. 138 and I am pleased that the Government intend to cover this scandalous situation as I have described it. The words of William Blake come to mind:

<br>

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-04_para10"></a>
but I do not think that there are sufficient "arrows of desire" in the current phrasing. I should like to make the point very specific because the clause relates to making regulations. Given that, provision should be made in regulations dealing with the Prison Service and the private security firms.

<a name="30327-04_para11"></a>I shall come back to this matter at a later stage, but for the moment I shall not pursue it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-04_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, spoke on the subject of this amendment during the previous debate. The Newspaper Society, as the representative of the provincial press, has spoken to both the noble Lord and myself on this matter.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para16"></a>The society objects to the press being subject to third party costs orders at all on the grounds that the existing penalties for any breach of reporting restrictions under the rules covering contempt of court are entirely adequate. I have to say that I felt unable to go as far as that, but press coverage of the criminal courts, particularly in local newspapers, as the noble Baroness said, is a matter of importance. There is a real <P>


<a name="column_927"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 927</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>risk, as was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that the possibility of a third party costs order may act as a deterrent to the full and proper reporting of court cases.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para17"></a>When the court decides whether serious misconduct has taken place, it should take into account the important role of the press. Amendment No. 137A is therefore specifically targeted on the press, unlike the earlier amendments, Amendments Nos. 134 and 135, which are of general application and would apply to everyone.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para18"></a>Mistakes made by the press, even if they are mistakes that have serious consequences in terms of costs, should not necessarily be regarded as matters of serious misconduct. Of course the deliberate publication of matters known to be likely to lead to a mistrial is an entirely different matter, but this amendment calls upon the court to have particular regard to the importance of the right of freedom of expression. In doing so, the amendment is based on a similar clause that was added to the Human Rights Bill during the course of its passage through Parliament in 1998.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para19"></a>We believe that, for the same reasons it was felt justified to include the clause in the Human Rights Bill, a clause of this kind would be justified for inclusion in the Courts Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   I agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I wish I could respond simply by saying that I disagree.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para20"></a>While I understand why the noble Lord seeks to press the amendment, we say that it is inappropriate for the following reason. We object because of the use of the word "particular". The noble Lord has stressed that he wishes the court to have particular regard to the importance of the convention right to freedom of expression when deciding whether to order costs against a third party, but we say clearly that it is our belief that the court, when reaching its decision, should have regard to the totality of the Human Rights Act 1998. No one part of that legislation should have any lesser or greater importance than another. It is the balance struck in the Act that is so important.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para21"></a>As the noble Lord knows, the criminal courts are in any event required to act in a way that is compatible with Article 10 covering freedom of expression, and that will apply when they are considering whether to use the power conferred by this clause. However, we do not think it appropriate for the criminal courts in this context to be required to have particular regard to that article. Section 12 is concerned primarily with the balance between the freedom of expression of rights and the right to respect for private life. We are concerned here solely with apportioning the costs incurred or wasted as a result of serious misconduct by a third party. It is not appropriate to give special weight to freedom of expression in the costs context.
<P>

<a name="30327-04_para22"></a>But we believe that the courts have demonstrated, through the way in which they have applied the law in this area, that they will be proportionate, reasonable <P>


<a name="column_928"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>and proper in the discharge of their duty. There is nothing that the courts have done to date that has caused me to fear that when looking at this legislation they will not properly take into consideration the necessary balance between these issues and discharge their duty with the usual honour and integrity which we expect of our judges.

<a name="30327-05_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30327-05_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: We now move to consider Clauses 92 and 93 headed "Damages", which provide for periodical payments to be ordered by the court. This gives us an opportunity to review the position of structured settlements. The amendment asks a question about the extent to which periodical payments will be dealing with future loss, whether pecuniary or not.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para8"></a>It is some time since the first UK structured settlement involving periodical payments with model documentation was put in place. In July 1989, the first structured settlement attracted considerable publicity. In the following year more cases were settled on that basis. Since then the flow of cases has increased. In June 1991 a UK Law Commission inquiry was appointed to look at structured settlements which reported in 1994. It concluded the report Structured Settlements and Interim and Provisional Damages in the following terms:
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-05_para9"></a>
In May 1995, legislation based on the commission's recommendations was enacted. We have seen the development since then. I refer particularly to the Damages Act 1996, which allowed for structured settlements to be made by consent.

<a name="30327-05_para10"></a>In a case before our Judicial Committee in 1998, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn, made the following comments:

<FONT SIZE=3>
That explains why we are here today discussing Clause 92 in particular.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para13"></a>We have had extensive consultation. I pay tribute to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. In March 2000 he published a consultation paper entitled Damages: the Discount Rate and Alternatives to Lump Sum Payments. He concluded that further discussion was necessary. In March last year he published a further consultation paper entitled Damages for Future Loss: Giving the Courts the Power to Order Periodical Payments for Future Loss and Care Costs in Personal Injury Cases. The post-consultation report was published in November last year. I applaud the speed with which the Government have responded in putting forward Clause 92 as far as it allows for periodical payments.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para14"></a>The issue has been looked at the by the Clinical Disputes Forum, which published a paper on the subject in August 2000 entitled Lump Sum Damages and Periodical Payments. The working party of the Master of the Rolls published a report last August on structured settlements.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para15"></a>I support what is clearly a more appropriate way of compensating claimants because it will ensure that they have the money to which they are entitled and for as long as it is needed without the anxiety of the award running out if they live longer than expected. But a number of reports have concluded that there must be an element of finality. We shall come to specific amendments dealing with the proposals on variation in a moment.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para16"></a>The extensive consultation that has taken place has disclosed that periodical payments are to be welcomed provided that they introduce a degree of finality. There are views in favour of periodical payments from a range of organisations such as the National Health Service Litigation Authority, the Medical Defence Union, the Medical Protection Society, the Association of British Insurers, the International Underwriting Association and by claimants' organisations. Generally, these are to be welcomed. But all of them are unanimous in their view that they have serious concern about a proposal for those payments to be varied at some unspecified stage in the future.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para17"></a>The variation clauses could cause much more litigation, endless uncertainty, constant scrutiny for claimants and financial instability for those who seek to compensate. I hope that the Minister will accept that there could be a fatal flaw in the system. If periodical payments are introduced with a suspicion that at some stage in the future they will be changed or varied, then I do not believe that the general welcome for periodical payments will continue.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. If there is a fundamental change of circumstances, it is impossible not to vary the situation. Obviously, the noble Lord is right in that <P>


<a name="column_930"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 930</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there should be no repeated surveillance of such a situation. Would the noble Lord like to comment on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   The noble Lord is right in that provisions presently exist for what are called provisional damages. Where there is a suspicion that at some stage there will be a serious deterioration in the claimant's condition, then it is perfectly possible for the damages to be put on hold, so to speak, under the system of provisional damages. That could be incorporated under the existing legislation in a structured settlement.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para18"></a>The noble Lord has given me an opportunity to emphasise the point. There may be a suspicion that there will be no finality. The Master of the Rolls' working party demonstrated the attraction of finality introduced by lump sum payments. But, as I read the proposals, there is presently nothing on the face of the Bill to meet the point that the move to the alternative system of periodical payments might produce continuing uncertainty. There is a genuine worry on the part of those who face claims&#151;particularly in the National Health Service but also, generally speaking, insurers and re-insurers and those acting on behalf of claimants&#151;that periodical payments in the form of structured settlements will not succeed because there is no finality and it is impossible for a file ever to be closed.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para19"></a>The Minister may seek to reassure us on that point. I very much hope that she will, as she now seeks to explain exactly what, in form of damages, the periodical payments will cover. I hope that she will not mind my having widened the debate to indicate the general concern that exists over what could be the fatal flaw of variability. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for his generous compliments in relation to the way in which this work has been undertaken, and I return them. The work on periodical payments has been successful only, as a number of Members of the Committee have been kind enough to indicate, because of the work done by all those who have participated in this area, including the noble Lord. So this is a joint venture to that extent.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para20"></a>I do not mind at all the fact that the noble Lord has broadened the issue slightly. It may be helpful, therefore, if I set out in broad terms how we view periodical payments, because there has been some confusion. I hope that when we come to deal with the basis on which these could be reviewed I shall be able to make sufficiently clear and helpful comments to reassure the noble Lord that his anxieties as regards periodical payments and their take-up and application are not well founded.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para21"></a>These proposals aim to promote the widespread use of periodical payments as a means of paying compensation for future financial loss and care costs in personal injury cases. At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, all <P>


<a name="column_931"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 931</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>welcomed the powers to order periodical payments. I was pleased, as I have said, that the noble Lord was able to reiterate that today.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para22"></a>At present, a court can order periodical payments only where both parties give their consent. Otherwise, it will order a lump sum. We believe that the existing system of compensation for future losses by way of lump sums is unsatisfactory. It is based on predictions about the future life expectancy of a claimant which are inevitably uncertain and almost always lead to over-compensation or under-compensation. That results in an injustice either to the claimant or to the defendant. If claimants are under-compensated because they live longer than expected, they may need to fall back on the state, causing an additional burden on the taxpayer. If claimants are over-compensated, they receive a windfall, the cost of which is ultimately borne by the taxpayer or through insurance premiums.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para23"></a>In contrast, periodical payments will help to ensure that people receive the compensation to which they are entitled for as long as it is needed. This will give greater security to claimants, who will be able to plan for the future without the anxiety or the awards running out if they live longer than expected. Periodical payments also transfer investment responsibility from claimants to defendants, who are better able to bear it.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para24"></a>We believe that periodical payments can also be valuable in assisting the rehabilitation process. Claimants will receive regular payments which are more accurately assessed to meet their on-going needs rather than face the difficulties of managing a substantial one-off lump sum. That will enable claimants to return to a normal life by allowing them to manage their everyday affairs with a regular stream of income and help them to look to the future and focus on the possibility of rehabilitation. In addition, the absence of the need for complex and often adversarial discussions about life expectancy should lead to the quicker resolution of cases and encourage early and effective rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para25"></a>Periodical payments will provide benefits to defendants by allowing awards to be managed more cost-effectively. They will be cash-flow savings for the NHS and defendants' insurers will have the greater choice over how payments are funded. We do not wish, by way of review, to jeopardise any of that security. The Government believe that the benefit of periodical payments will accrue from the greater use of these payments. A power for the courts to order periodical payments is needed to realise those benefits.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para26"></a>Under the current system, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has indicated, where the consent of those parties to a structured settlement is required, this option remains little used, and lump sums remain the norm&#151;often to the disadvantage of claimants, defendants and the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para27"></a>We recognise that periodical payments will not always be the most appropriate method of payment, and that lump sums will continue to be preferable in some circumstances. Our proposals will not prevent the court making a lump sum order where it considers <P>


<a name="column_932"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that to be the best option for the claimant, and it is our intention that the Civil Procedure Rules, supported by practice directions, will provide guidance to assist the court in making an order that best meets the needs of the claimant.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para28"></a>Of course I understand the import of this amendment. But it would change the definition of the type of damages for which the court will be able to impose periodical payments from,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"damages for future pecuniary loss in respect of personal injury",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-05_para29"></a>
to damages for "future loss" in respect of personal injuries. As we have indicated in our consultation paper, it is our intention that the power to impose periodical payments should be available in respect of future loss of earnings capacity, future care costs and similar expenses. The use of the term "future pecuniary loss" is intended to cover those areas.
<P>

<a name="30327-05_para30"></a>The term is used elsewhere, in the Damages Act 1996 and in other legislation relating to damages, and is issued here for reasons of consistency. The new power will not apply to damages for past loss or to damages for non-pecuniary loss such as pain and suffering. It will apply to "future pecuniary" loss. I hope that we shall be able to ensure that the meaning of the term is explained in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill on that basis. On the basis of my remarks, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment. I hope that the clarity of that statement has satisfied him.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister, not only for responding to the amendment, which was essentially probing, but also for giving a general outline of the way in which the Government are approaching the whole question of structured settlements. We shall need time to reflect on the Minister's response, and we shall, of course, return to the subject of variation in a later group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para0"></a>My only additional point is that we must bear in mind the needs of people with disability which has been incurred as the result of an accident or trauma. There is a feeling on the part of some of those with disability that they have not been involved at the centre of this whole process relating to periodical payments. There is a real concern that periodical payments be some form of inhibitor as regards the emphasis on rehabilitation and getting people back to work.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para1"></a>Stephen Duckworth, who is a leading campaigner on disability matters, has made me aware that we need to consult people with disability in order to ensure that periodical payments will encourage them to become more independent and more amenable to rehabilitation interventions. There is the possibility&#151;we shall return to the issue on variation&#151;that the constant question mark over the level of payment may have a detrimental effect on the rehabilitation process. We need to focus on that aspect which the noble Baroness will have very much in mind. However, to give the necessary width to the debate, I mention it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30327-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 139:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-06_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) Periodical payments shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the Retail Price Index."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-06_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: I did not participate in the debate on the previous amendment but I strongly agree with the principle of periodical payments, moving from the existing structured settlement regime, which requires the consent of both parties if it can be done only by an out of court settlement subject to approval by the court, to a situation where the court has power to order periodical payments. While this is a step forward it will be essential to ensure that the real value of periodical payments is maintained. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para5"></a>Even at the Government's target figure of 2.5 per cent inflation, periodical payments with a fixed annual amount would steadily lose their real value over time. Ignoring the effect of compounding, a 2.5 per cent increase over a period of 10 years per annum would lead to a decline in real value of the periodical payment over those 10 years by 20 per cent. The figure is 20 per cent not 25 per cent; that is a matter for the mathematicians. If one takes into account the compounding of the interest&#151;the 2.5 per cent per annum is measured not on what happened 10 years ago but with the previous year's figure&#151;the problem becomes even more acute. The consequences would be not only serious but disastrous if inflation rates were over 20 per cent per annum as in the 1970s or early 1990s.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para6"></a>It is now practicable to ensure that the real value is maintained because the cost of an order for periodical payments can be funded through index-linked government securities. It is not practicable to link periodical payments to earnings. That is unfortunate. Because of the increase in real earnings, a person rendered unfit for work 40 years ago and in receipt of periodical payments fixed even in real terms at the 1963 figures would have a standard of living well below that of a healthy contemporary even if those periodical payments had been index linked. That seems to me an unavoidable problem. There is no realistic way in which an earnings-linked annuity could be funded. However, I believe that linkage to the retail prices index is not only practicable but plainly desirable and essential. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   It is an important amendment. It touches on the way in which periodical payments will be dealt with. I considered carefully this aspect when reading paragraph 35 of the Master of the Rolls' working party's report on structured settlements. Close matching regulations oblige, for instance, life offices to hold assets to match their liabilities. Close matching is a key issue when one considers the way in which any annuity payment will increase in value. That close matching was found in the Insurance Companies Act 1982 but is now regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with the detail to be found in the FSA Interim Prudential Source Book for Insurers, Volume 3 Guidance Notes, Section 4.4, linked contracts, paragraphs 2.1 to 2.15.
<P>


<a name="column_934"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 934</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para7"></a>There is no point in setting up a system for structured settlements when no available products will conform to the close matching regulations. That is fundamental if we are to proceed with a general move towards the structured settlements which so many people would like to see.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. It is important that the real value of periodical payments can be preserved over the whole period for which they are payable. The indexation of payments is already a matter for the court's discretion and the Bill does not affect that. At present it is common practice to link payments to the retail prices index. However, it would not be appropriate to prescribe this as a blanket index to which all payments must be linked. In some cases it may be appropriate to link different heads of damage to different indices. The court currently has that flexibility.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para8"></a>We believe that it is important to retain the current flexibility and for indexation to be left to the discretion of the court which can have proper regard to the individual circumstances of each case. I hope that that reassures noble Lords. We think that this ability of the court will address their concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   Perhaps I may respond. Where the liability is to make index payments under an RPI structure, there is an available close-matching asset in index-linked government stocks. There is a general wish to see those made more widely available. However, if we were to move to another index&#151;I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;there will be no availability of any close-matching product which would enable the defendant, the defendant's insurer, or reinsurer, to make the necessary provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am not sure how the court's discretion now arises. It would arise only by virtue of the requirement that a court approve a structured settlement and that it will not do so unless the settlement makes some provision for indexation of the payments due under that settlement.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para9"></a>We have here a different situation. The court is making the order, not merely approving a settlement agreed between the parties. It is plainly desirable, therefore, that the court should be required to take steps to preserve the real value of the periodical payments. I should like to see a provision on the face of the Bill&#151;perhaps not as absolute as my amendment&#151;which states that the court shall be required to provide for the payments to be indexed unless it sees reason for them either not to be indexed or to be linked to some other index.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We should bear in mind how the courts currently approach the issue. When matters come before the court, all parties will have to direct their minds to the nature of the order that the court might make. The noble Lord will be familiar with the process. The court will make enquiries as to what the consequences are for various <P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggestions that will be urged on it by various parties. That is the nature of the discussion that will be under review. It is part and parcel of the way in which courts have historically approached these issues that they wish to be assured that, if liability is established, the damages that flow from that, both general and specific, together with pecuniary loss, properly compensate the individual applicant for the injury suffered at the date of the incident and, thereafter, for the damages that flow therefrom. We are relying on the practical day-to-day way in which the court has dealt with that process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I still believe that it would be desirable and important to place something of this kind in the Bill, although perhaps not in these words. I shall consider some alternative possible wording. From my reading of proposed new Section 2(1)(a) and 2(1)(b) of the Damages Act 1996, it is not made expressly clear that the court even has the power to award periodical payments that are index-linked rather than fixed. I am strongly minded to bring back the issue on Report. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-06_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is entirely different in nature from the previous one. It arises from correspondence with the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. The association pressed for an amendment that would provide that an order for periodical payments should need specifically the consent of the claimant or a McKenzie friend, when the claimant was represented by a McKenzie friend.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para13"></a>I saw problems with requiring consent in all cases, particularly in the case of a young person who was legally capable of taking a decision for himself but might take an unwise one. The prospect of a large lump sum may be tempting to a claimant who would be better off in the long run with a periodical payment. The claimant might also come under pressure from members of his or her family who expected to profit in some way from the lump sum.
<P>

<a name="30327-06_para14"></a>Having said that, the court should undoubtedly have regard to the wishes of the claimant and should be required to find out what they are. I accept that in practice a court that acted reasonably would almost certainly do that. However, the requirement should be in the Bill. I do not suppose that the court would ignore the claimant's wishes, even without a statutory obligation, but if the requirement were in the Bill the court would have to find out the claimant's wishes. It would also mean that if the court did not act in accordance with those wishes, it would have to give <P>


<a name="column_936"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 936</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasons for overriding them. It is desirable that it should do so. Therefore, there should be an obligation to have regard to the claimant's wishes. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="30327-07_para0"></a>Normally, periodical payments should be a matter for the claimant, but that is not always possible, as the noble Lord said. However, the claimant's plans for the future should be taken into account. The Minister said that guidance would be available to the court, which is important, and I invite her to say something more about the availability of such guidance at this stage. That would be enormously helpful to the House in considering the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. I should not like a one-sided system to be set up, although I am aware of the views of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para1"></a>The association made it clear, as the noble Lord has just made clear, that we must have the guidance in place before we go further down this route. The association wrote:

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-07_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30327-07_para3"></a>My main point, however, is one that I mentioned before, which was made by Stephen Duckworth of Disability Matters and several other leading people, who speak in support of the need for rehabilitation. The International Underwriting Association and Association of British Insurers study on rehabilitation and the initiatives taken by periodicals such as Post magazine, urging forward the code on rehabilitation, make it clear that periodical payments must be in the interests of the person receiving compensation. The interests demand that there should be, when appropriate, an early and prompt return to work and/or return to normal life, when that is possible.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para4"></a>Will the Government have some more joined-up thinking about the need for rehabilitation at a much earlier stage, especially when the defendant is a Government department or the National Health Service, in some form or other, or the Medical Defence Union or Medical Protection Society? There is an urgent need to deal with the problem early in the interests of the claimant. Will the Minister comment on the need to ensure that the people who have suffered are at the centre of the discussion?

<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I shall reassure my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis about our approach, and try to respond to the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, after dealing specifically with the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para5"></a>We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that the views of the claimant in relation to periodical payments is the important issue. The Bill already provides for the rules of court to set out criteria that the court must take into account when considering whether to order periodical payments. As the noble Lord rightly said, it would be impractical and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to list in primary legislation all the factors that the court will need to consider. As we all know, this is a developing area of law and it is essential that there is flexibility to adjust the criteria in the light of experience. I respectfully suggest that that is best achieved through secondary legislation. We intend that the rules will assist the judiciary and parties in identifying factors that may be relevant in deciding whether periodical payments or a lump sum is appropriate. I reiterate that there will still be cases where periodical payments are not appropriate and do not meet the needs of the parties, particularly the claimant, and where the court will not so order.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para6"></a>We fully accept that the claimant's wishes are an important factor. I reassure the Committee that those wishes will undoubtedly be one of the factors that the court is required to consider. However, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to single out that factor in primary legislation as the amendment proposes. The court must be allowed to take into account all the individual circumstances of the case and weigh all the relevant factors against one another in making the order that it considers best meets the needs of the claimant. The weight to be given to the claimant's wishes, for example, might depend on the reasons for them and the quality of the advice on which they are based. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, mentioned issues to do with pressure from family and whether they think a lump sum might be more advantageous to them. Those are all important issues for the court to weigh.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para7"></a>Does the claimant, for example, want a lump sum to spend on a holiday or to start a business? How strong is his or her business case? Has he or she been properly advised? I am sure that the court will be minded to take into account all those issues. Of course the defendant's wishes run through all of that. However, I think that it would be wrong to suggest, by placing it on the face of the Bill, that the claimant's wishes should outweigh all other factors. I therefore invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made an important point about rehabilitation. We, too, see rehabilitation as a very important issue. We hope that, by the introduction of periodical payments, it will be easier to settle cases earlier. We know from research that the earlier these issues are settled, the easier it is for the injured person to be rehabilitated. We hope that that is something that will inure to the benefit of the claimant. We have already said that the proposals offer advantages for the defendant. Rehabilitation, however, is a critical issue. I reassure the noble Lord that the importance of the rehabilitation <P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 938</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>issue&#151;how we address it and how we encourage individuals to take advantage of the opportunities for rehabilitation&#151;is very much on the agenda and part of the conversations that we are having with various government departments. I assure him that it is not an issue that this department or other departments will fail to address. We are addressing it with great energy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her helpful reply and her assurance that there will be guidance in regulations on the factors that have to be taken into account by the court in reaching its conclusion. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30327-07_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Before calling Amendment No. 139ZAA, I have to inform the Committee that if this amendment were to be agreed, I would not be able to call Amendments Nos. 139ZB and 139ZC.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-07_para10"></a><P>

<a name="30327-07_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment would leave out Section 2 of the Damages Act 1996 so far as subsection (4) is concerned. Amendment No. 139A, which is within the group, would leave out lines 4 and 5 on page 45. That provision concerns,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"enabling a party to apply for a variation of provision included under paragraph (a) or (b).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-07_para12"></a>
Amendment No. 139B, which is also in this group, would leave out "(a) or", in line 5, so that one could apply only under paragraph (b). Amendment No. 147ZA would leave out the words "whether or not" from line 18 and insert "if". Amendment No. 140ZB would, at the end, insert "or". Amendment No. 140A, which is in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, is also in the group. I think that that covers all the amendments in the group. I thought that I should read them out so that everyone knows exactly where we are in the latest selection.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para13"></a>Amendment No. 139ZAA is really a probing amendment. I have to confess to the Minister that I really do not understand subsection (4), and I look forward to her explanation. On Amendment No. 139A, however, it should be possible to vary the way in which payments are made. We are dealing here with the mechanics of payment, not with variation&#151;to which we shall return as a big subject for debate. There would be no concern if, for example, the claimant wanted quarterly payments rather than monthly ones. That should be allowed. The intention is clearly for the courts to control such variation. Again, I am giving the Minister the opportunity of responding on the point.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para14"></a>Amendment No. 139B offers for consideration whether the words "whether or not" should be replaced by "if". If the court does not specify the method of payment, I am not sure that the person who is obliged to make the payment should be fixed with a method and then be in breach of the order if he varies it as long as the payments are still made and secure. I hope that that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>explains the reasoning behind the amendment. It may be advantageous if I now leave it to the Minister to explain. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I apologise to the Committee for my earlier untimely intervention. Amendments Nos. 139A and 140A are in my name. However, I should prefer to speak to them in full later. The points have been more than adequately addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   In order to assist the Committee, I think that it might be helpful if the noble Baroness spoke to the amendments now as they are in the group we are considering.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_time0"></a><H5>1.00 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-07_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I thank the Minister for that guidance. All of my amendments relate to the proposals to introduce settlement reviews in clinical negligence cases. My concerns are on four levels: for patients themselves; about the complaints procedures which patients encounter in the NHS; for the healthcare professionals; and for the NHS itself.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para15"></a>When a clinical error has occurred, patients understandably and rightly feel deeply wronged. Redress is sought to cover expenses incurred in future care but also&#151;and often much more powerfully&#151;in an attempt to obtain justice for the tragedy that has happened. Of course no money can compensate for the phenomenal emotional and physical trauma that somebody experiences when an error has occurred.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para16"></a>After an error, the complaints procedure comes into play. Patients repeatedly report a block in the process. They feel that there is a brick wall when they desperately need information and an apology&#151;but an apology is slow to come as healthcare professionals and trust management may fear that to apologise would be to admit liability. The new NHS complaints procedures have improved enormously in recent times and the open and speedy way in which issues are dealt with is long overdue.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para17"></a>Sometimes the trust or defence union will settle rapidly out of court to achieve closure for all concerned rather than fight a case, to avoid lengthy court procedures and the stress involved. However, if it is feared that such a settlement might be deemed an admission of guilt that can later be revisited to increase a settlement, the trend towards rapid resolution for closure will be reversed and trusts will try to avoid anything that might be construed as an admission of guilt through fear of later review.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para18"></a>The NHS apparently has a huge and rising bill for negligence payouts. In 2001&#150;2002, the bill for all known and anticipated claims was £5.25 billion&#151;a staggering increase of £850 million in the last year alone. Only five years ago, the total provision for clinical negligence was much lower, at £2.3 billion. National Audit Office accounts show that the NHS paid out £446 million to settle clinical negligence claims last year, which is £31 million more than the <P>


<a name="column_940"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 940</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>previous year. The introduction of settlement reviews can only increase that trend, unless the NHS reverses its current policy of rapid settlement.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para19"></a>I am grateful to the Lord Chancellor's office for corresponding with me earlier this year. Its letter outlines the intention of the Bill, which actually matches what currently happens. The medical defence unions currently fund long-term payments through buying an annuity. I understand that in practice, an annuity can be bought only from the National Farmers Union Mutual and that there is no choice in the market. The defence unions are not in a position to self fund. Their subscriptions are drawn principally from employees of the NHS, so review and variation would inevitably impact indirectly on NHS costs.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para20"></a>I now return to the people at the heart of this&#151;patients and the healthcare profession. Make no mistake, when a doctor makes an error, it is devastating for that doctor. I have seen many professional colleagues feel destroyed by a complaint&#151;even one with no grounds. I have seen colleagues haunted for life by an error. Of course the patient is more than haunted. He or she has to live day in, day out, with the outcome of an error or, worse, negligence. Patients are owed a duty of continuing care, which includes the duty to help them to rehabilitate and resume life as much as possible. The Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, have stressed the importance of rehabilitation, so I shall refer briefly to evidence from rehabilitation programmes.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para21"></a>From 17 well-conducted studies in the literature on the impact of litigation on the rehabilitation process, there is consistent and powerful evidence that ongoing litigation and, independently to it, unemployment have an adverse effect on recovery. For patients to achieve closure on episodes seem crucial to their future quality of life. I am not saying that settlements should not occur. I certainly welcome the implication of the introduction of periodical settlements&#151;but leaving settlements open to review may mean that patients cannot complete the grieving process that will and must occur. They cannot have closure.
<P>

<a name="30327-07_para22"></a>The NHS might come to fear that admission of fault may leave the way open to future, unquantifiable review claims&#151;making the early stages worse for patients. The NHS cannot afford the open-ended nature of such reviews. Most of all, the victims&#151;the patients&#151;will be unable to rehabilitate because any long-term improvement may work against a future claim review. Patients will be encouraged to be locked into to an acute psychological state and never achieve closure in their lifetime. It is well documented that the individual's psychological state has a huge impact on physical recovery. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I will take up the invitation to explain how the clauses work because I understand that they may have caused difficulties. The points that the noble Baroness makes so powerfully are important and I will respond to them fully when we reach the next group of amendments. I reassure her that a lot of work is continuing. The Chief Medical Officer, to name just one authority, is working hard on <P>


<a name="column_941"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 941</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reviewing all aspects of clinical negligence, including the complaints procedure. We are hopeful that that work will chart a way through for us.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para0"></a>The proposed amendments would affect the way in which the security of periodical payments is protected. They would have unfortunate practical consequences for the ongoing security of periodical payments awards, so the Government are not able to accept them. None of the amendments is consequential on any other&#151;except Amendment No. 140A, which is consequential on Amendment No. 139A.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para1"></a>It may be helpful if I explain the purpose of the provisions relating to security. New Section 2(3) requires the court to be satisfied before it makes a periodical payments order that the continuity of payments is reasonably secure. New Section 4 of the Damages Act 1996, inserted by Clause 93, ensures that the continuity of periodical payments is fully protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, where the payments are self-funded by an insurer or funded by an annuity. Section 2(4)(b) provides that in those situations, the continuity of the payments is reasonably secure for the purposes of new Section 2(3). Similarly, Section 6 of the Damages Act 1996 and new Section 2(4)(a) guarantee the security of self-funded payments by public sector bodies made under a ministerial guarantee.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para2"></a>In making a periodical payments order, it is not intended that the court should specify how payments are to be funded in terms of the particular type of investment to be used, provided it is satisfied that the payment method is reasonably secure. That matter will be for the defendant or the insurer. It is right that, provided payments are reasonably secure, defendants and insurers should be able to choose the funding arrangements that suit them best.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para3"></a>However, in order to be satisfied of that, it is likely that in most cases the court will specify that payments must only be funded in ways provided for under new Section 2(4)&#151;that is, those ways that attract statutory protection. Alternatively, the court may be asked to agree another method of funding that does not attract statutory guarantees. Therefore, new Section 2(5) enables a court order to include provision about how the payments are to be made and to require the person who is to make the payments to take specified action to secure their continuity. The government amendments that I shall move after the debate on these amendments will, I hope, clarify the section further.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para4"></a>It may sometimes be necessary or desirable for the insurer or defendant to change the method of funding the payments. This will not affect the amount of payments. To ensure that the protection afforded by the original court order is not lost as a result of any subsequent change in funding, new Section 2(7) provides that an alteration in the method of funding shall be treated as a breach of the order unless the new method falls within the protected categories of funding, or the court declares it is satisfied that the continuity of payment under the new method is reasonably secure.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para5"></a>The second possibility would arise in two situations: first, where the defendant wished to change from a protected method of payment to one that was not <P>


<a name="column_942"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protected; secondly, where the defendant wished to change from one non-protected method of payment to another. New Section 2(5)(c) enables the court to allow a party to bring the matter back before the court in such situations so that it can consider the proposed new method of funding and approve it if appropriate. The amendments moved by the Opposition would harm the way these interlinking provisions operate.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para6"></a>Amendment No. 139ZAA seeks to remove new Section 2(4), which sets out the methods of payment that the court may consider to be reasonably secure for the purposes of new Section 2(3). As I have explained, the section is designed to enable the court to identify which payments attract statutory protection and therefore which it may automatically consider to be secure.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para7"></a>The amendment would require the court to declare itself satisfied by the security of the individual method of funding in every case, even where a method protected by statute was to be used. As a consequence, defendants and insurers would have to present to the court details of the specific investment or method of payment with which they intended to meet the order. This would reduce the flexibility for defendants and insurers to fund payments in the most cost-effective way, would increase court time and costs unnecessarily and might delay payment.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para8"></a>While I am aware of some concerns about the availability of insurance products to meet court ordered periodical payments, we do not consider it to be a significant issue. Defendants will be able to inform the court if the terms of an order would cause particular difficulties. However, as annuities are already used to provide structured settlements, we would be disappointed if the insurance industry did not seize the opportunity to meet an increased need for periodical payments. We should also not forget that not all periodical payments will be funded by insurance products; for example, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, the National Health Service might fund payments directly as they arise, rather than purchasing an annuity from a life insurer.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para9"></a>As I have explained, the provisions in new Section 2(5) are intended to cover all the different situations where the court may need to include provision about the method of payment, and one element would not function properly in the absence of the others. Amendment No. 139A, which seeks to delete new Section 2(5)(c), would have the effect of preventing any application to change the method of payment being made. Amendment No. 140A is consequential and deletes the reference to new Section 2(5)(c) in new Section 2B(1). This reference is included in new Section 2B(1) in order to clarify that the Lord Chancellor's order-making power on variation of periodical payments does not extend to provisions relating to the parties' ability to apply for variation of the method by which the payments are funded.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para10"></a>I am going through the arguments slowly, because when practitioners and others come to look at the provisions I hope that my explanation will assist them to see how they interlink. Amendment No. 139B <P>


<a name="column_943"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 943</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would restrict the circumstances in which an application to change the method of payment could be made. These amendments would prevent the provisions from functioning effectively to protect the ongoing security of payments. If I may respectfully say so, that would not be in the interests of either claimants or defendants.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para11"></a>The same is partly true for Amendment No. 140ZA, because it reduces the circumstances in which it would be necessary to obtain the court's approval to a change in the method of payment. The effect of substituting "if" for "whether or not" in new Section 2(7) would be to limit the orders covered by the provision. In those orders not covered it would then be possible for the defendant, without the court's approval, to change to a method of payment that attracted no statutory protection. That would create a potential loophole and might mean that certain claimants were not adequately protected.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para12"></a>Amendment No. 140ZB is a drafting point relating to the list of instances in new Section 2(7) in which an alteration of the method by which periodical payments are funded will not be treated as a breach of the order. The word "or" is implicit at the end of paragraph (a) and does not need to be inserted. The drafting here reflects the approach used elsewhere in the Bill; for example in Clause 30(1), Clause 36(4), Clause 49(3) and Clause 57(2).
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para13"></a>I have dealt with the matter exhaustively but I hope that it is now clear.

<A NAME="30327-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   It is indeed clear. Speaking on behalf of practitioners, I am sure that all those involved in implementing these provisions will print out the Minister's words and place them close to their hearts. I am grateful to her for her explanation. As she has indicated, these provisions deal with variation in the method of payment. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, on her important points on variability. When we come to page 46 of the Bill and the amendments grouped with Amendment No. 140ZC, we will be returning to those points. I shall defer further comment from these Benches until then. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30327-08_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: These amendments clarify the methods of payment to which I have just referred that are reasonably secure for the purposes of new Section 2(3), which requires the court to be satisfied before it makes a periodical payments order that the continuity of payments under the order is reasonably secure.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para17"></a>As I have explained, new Section 4 of the Damages Act 1996, inserted by Clause 93, ensures that the continuity of periodical payments is fully protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme where the payments are self-funded by an insurer or funded by an annuity. Section 6 of the Damages Act guarantees the security of self-funded payments by public sector bodies made under a ministerial guarantee. But Section 6 is not designed to guarantee payments made by government departments and is not suited to the National Health Service, which will be funding a substantial number of periodical payment orders, as it would appear to require an individual guarantee in each case. That did not matter when periodical payments had to be made by agreement. It would be clear to the claimant that the defendant department was good for the money, so the absence of a formal guarantee would be no bar to a settlement.
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para18"></a>In future, however, a court ordering periodical payments will need to be satisfied as to their future security. That requirement will apply when periodical payments orders are made against government departments and health service bodies, in particular the National Health Service Litigation Authority. At present, such payments are usually self-funded, and we wish to ensure that that can remain the case under the new system. Self-funding the payments as they arise represents the best value for the public money concerned. Therefore Amendments Nos. 139ZB, 139ZC, 139ZD, 139ZE, 139ZF and 140ZBA will ensure that the continuity of payments made by government and health service bodies is reasonably secure for the purposes of new Section 2(3).
<P>

<a name="30327-08_para19"></a>Amendments Nos. 140ZBB and 140ZBC enable the Lord Chancellor to specify in an order the bodies that will constitute "government and health service bodies" for the purposes of new Section 2(4) and (7) which deal with alterations to the method of payment. The amendment is framed in that way to provide clarity as to the bodies which are protected and to provide flexibility, for example, to alter the designated bodies should they change in name or status. I beg to move.

To ensure that the Bill achieves that, Amendments Nos. 139ZG and 139C clarify the provisions relating to the method of funding payments. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-09_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30327-09_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: This probing amendment is intended to discover the proposed effect of a bankruptcy order on a right to periodical payments. I believe that the position should be similar to that of occupational and personal pensions. The position in that regard broadly is, first, that the underlying right to a future pension payment does not vest in the trustee in bankruptcy and therefore cannot be sold to pay debts; secondly, that the pensioner can retain part of the current payments&#151;the guaranteed minimum payment in the case of a contracted-out occupational pension&#151;but the balance of the current payment goes to a trustee in bankruptcy; and, thirdly, that after the pensioner has been discharged from bankruptcy, he or she gets the subsequent pension payments in full. That seems to be a good model for periodical payments for damages.
<P>

<a name="30327-09_para13"></a>It would be distasteful in the extreme if someone's rights to substantial periodical payments for severe personal injury could be bought and sold. However, it is not clear that new Section 2(6) of the Damages Act 1996 achieves that. It provides for restrictions on the assignment or charge of the right to periodical payments, which I welcome. But what about bankruptcy? It is not mentioned in that provision. The fact is that the property vests in a trustee in bankruptcy by operation of law, not by assignment or charge. Subsection (6) does not appear to cover the case of bankruptcy. Have the Government formed a view about the effect that a claimant's bankruptcy should have on an order for periodical payments? Do the rights in fact vest in the trustee in bankruptcy? If so, can he dispose of them? What happens about periodical payments becoming payable during a period of insolvency? Do they vest in the trustee in bankruptcy? If so, should all or part of them remain <P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>payable to the claimant? For example, should the claimant continue to be entitled to receive payments that would be equal to what he might otherwise receive in means-tested benefits?
<P>

<a name="30327-09_para14"></a>This important issue needs more consideration than it appears to have received to date. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I say straightaway how grateful I am to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for raising the issue of the insolvency treatment of periodical payments, which I agree is in need of clarification. He spoke on this issue at Second Reading. In my subsequent letter to him and other noble Lords, I set out my understanding of the current law. I have since been informed that the situation is more complicated than was suggested by the initial advice that we were given. We therefore welcome this opportunity to consider the matter.
<P>

<a name="30327-09_para15"></a>This is a complex area of the law, and one which has not yet been tested by the courts. At present, the treatment of periodical payments in bankruptcy will depend on whether they are to be considered to be in the nature of "property" or "income" for the purposes of the Insolvency Act 1986. The law is unclear. If they are considered to be property, they would vest in the trustee, but any "personal" element, including care costs, would be held on constructive trust for the bankrupt. Those anxieties were highlighted by the noble Lord. If they are considered to be income, Section 310 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that income received after the date of bankruptcy may be claimed for the bankrupt's estate by way of an income payments order. New Section 2A(2) of the Bill ensures that income payments orders can be put in place where necessary.
<P>

<a name="30327-09_para16"></a>We believe that periodical payments that relate to loss of earnings should be treated in the same way as the earnings of a bankrupt who is working. It is not fair to treat payments made to replace earned income differently from earned income itself. However, we recognise that different considerations should apply where a claimant is receiving periodical payments specifically to meet the cost of care needs and believe that it should not be possible for those to be claimed for the bankrupt's estate. Under current law, if periodical payments are treated as "income", it is unlikely that the court would make an income payments order in respect of care costs because the provisions of the 1986 Act specify that the court shall not make an order the effect of which would be to reduce the bankrupt's income below that necessary to meet his or her reasonable domestic needs.
<P>

<a name="30327-09_para17"></a>If periodical payments are treated as property, care costs will be considered as personal and held on constructive trust for the complainant. We believe that the bankruptcy treatment of periodical payments should strike a balance which recognises that care costs should be protected but does not otherwise give those in receipt of payments preferential treatment over other bankrupts. We are in discussion with the Insolvency Service over an amendment to achieve that balance and to clarify the treatment of periodical payments. Therefore, my thanks to the noble Lord are <P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>very genuine, and I am sure that many claimants will thank him, too. I hope that the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his amendment in anticipation of the amendments that we shall bring forward on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, is right: the situation in Zimbabwe has got worse. We are awaiting publication of the review report from the Commonwealth secretariat. Noble Lords will be aware that there was a successful stay-away organised by the MDC, at which there was an 80 per cent success rate over two days. Since that successful stay-away, more than 600 people have been arrested and about 250 people have required hospital treatment in Harare alone. That is an appalling situation. The United Kingdom Government are working with our EU partners on a statement condemning the action which has been taken. The United States and others have already condemned it. I agree with the noble Lord that the credibility of the Commonwealth is at stake, and will be at stake in December when the Commonwealth discusses these issues again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell the House what measures Her Majesty's Government are taking to encourage the efforts of Archbishop Ndungane, the Archbishop of Cape Town, who is doing sterling work to bring about some type of solution in Zimbabwe? Is the Minister aware of the offer of Morgan Tsvangirai, following the two-day stay-away last week, that he is now prepared to re-engage in discussions with ZANU-PF in the hope of forming a government of national unity?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the efforts of the Archbishop of Cape Town. Indeed, he came and spoke to officials in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as part of a programme of discussion with key stakeholders. He has made two visits to Zimbabwe. As a result of his second visit, when he spoke to a range of NGOs and others, he is reflecting on next steps. I understand that yesterday President Mbeki, speaking to Parliament in South Africa, made it clear that he would be prepared to talk to the Archbishop as well.
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para0"></a>With respect to the offer made by Morgan Tsvangirai, that statement was again welcomed yesterday by President Mbeki. Indeed, President Mbeki made it clear that South Africa would be willing to host any such talks if it would help to revive the initiative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, given that the suspension of Zimbabwe will now continue until the CHOGM in <P>


<a name="column_949"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 949</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>December, will the Government encourage the troika to develop concrete yardsticks which can be applied by the heads of state in deciding whether to re-admit Zimbabwe? Will they ensure that one of those yardsticks is full compliance with the procedures in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, including co-operation in its investigation of the illegal arrest and torture of many opposition MPs, including&#151;and in particular&#151;Mr Job Sikhala?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, with respect to the needs for benchmarks. However, the troika set benchmarks at their meeting last year at Marlborough House. One of those benchmarks is being used in terms of the review that has been undertaken, which is yet to be published.
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para1"></a>The suspension from the councils continues on the basis of the Marlborough House statement. So it would be quite difficult to re-open that issue. But we could, with the Commonwealth, look at ways to ensure that further human rights violations are monitored and put to Commonwealth heads in December.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, what action, if any, have we taken to bring a resolution of censure to the United Nations on this issue? Secondly, are we not able to give assurances to people who have been tortured and who may be able to escape from the country to South Africa or to a neighbouring country, that they will be received here without further preliminaries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, with respect to the noble Baroness's first question about censure, we have, through the European Union, put a resolution to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The noble Baroness will recall that we had a similar resolution last year, which was not even put to the vote, given the blocking action by African countries. This resolution has yet to be taken at the commission, but there is an EU resolution which is being supported by other countries.
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para2"></a>With respect to the noble Baroness's second point, she will be aware that anyone from Zimbabwe seeking asylum in the United Kingdom can claim asylum either on arrival in the United Kingdom or from a third country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, now that we are hearing about the increased atrocities and mayhem being created in Zimbabwe, will the noble Baroness undertake to encourage her colleagues to maintain exclusion of this monstrous regime not merely from the Commonwealth but from all other international organisations where we have influence?
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para3"></a>Further to the observation of my noble friend Lady Park, could we bring forward speedily a resolution to the United Nations and show the same vigour as the US Administration have already shown? Should we not be ahead of it, rather than following behind?
<P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para4"></a>Finally, could we not now draw up a list of those who have committed, or who are alleged to have committed, crimes against humanity in Zimbabwe&#151;a list of potential war criminals, as it were&#151;just to show that we are determined to act and are not prepared to let Zimbabwe go on for ever, rotting in the way that it is now doing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, will be aware that the EU sanctions have continued. There was a sanctions rollover, so the travel ban, assets freeze and moratorium on the sales of arms continue.
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para5"></a>On the noble Lord's second point about pursuing a resolution and pursuing it with vigour as the United States has done, I am not entirely sure to what the noble Lord refers. The United States has only just announced its list in terms of an asset freeze. With respect to a resolution, the United States supports the EU resolution, which is going to the UN Commission on Human Rights. The noble Lord will be aware that there have been discussions about the possibility of bringing the issue to the UN Security Council, but the view of many members of the Security Council is that Zimbabwe does not pose a challenge to international peace and security and that this remains a domestic issue. That is something we shall need to overcome. We are in constant discussion and dialogue&#151;not only in the UN but with other partners&#151;on this matter.
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para6"></a>With respect to the noble Lord's final point about a list of those who are alleged to have committed human rights abuses, a number of organisations are amassing information with respect to human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. Putting individual names against those abuses is quite difficult, but I assure the House that it is a matter that is being looked at.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the Government received on 19th March the report and recommendations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights about the matter. We are giving careful attention to those and will give our response in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, the Government have already done a great deal to advance a human rights culture. But does my noble friend agree that there is a decisive need for a central independent body&#151;for example, a human rights commission&#151;to oversee an educational programme, particularly in schools but also elsewhere, if the full purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 are to be achieved?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, there is much force in what the noble Lord says. We have, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>therefore, expressed an intention to consider carefully the Joint Committee's report, which makes just such a recommendation. I can tell noble Lords that it repays very careful reading, and the Government intend to do just that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a member of the committee to which the Minister refers. Is she aware that it is now more than five years since the Government expressed two cautionary reservations about a human rights commission, both of which have been met by the Joint Committee? The first was that they needed advice about how it might work; the second was that there should be a sufficiently high degree of consensus among the existing human rights organisations.
<P>

<a name="30327-10_para7"></a>Is the Minister also aware that this is one of the most important pieces of unfinished business of the Cook-Maclennan constitutional agreement between our two parties? Can she assure us that it will not be kicked into the long grass for another five years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the first two points. But it is only fair for me to remind the House&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord does not need to be reminded&#151;that the Joint Committee, quite properly, took two years to consider the matter. We do not complain about a moment of that time because we think that it will repay careful reading. As the noble Lord says, we must respect the report by examining precisely how the committee proposes to bring about the changes and by considering what is the Government's proper response to those carefully crafted recommendations. I assure noble Lords that the matter will be given anxious consideration across the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-10_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, having supported the Human Rights Act 1998 without any hesitation at that time, I remind the noble Baroness that, in the past year or so, it has been found to be unenforceable to some extent; therefore, if a human rights commission is set up, it would have much more limited powers than those envisaged under the Human Rights Act.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, questions about the professional conduct of any member of a school's workforce are for head teachers, governors and local authorities to resolve. Serious cases of teacher professional misconduct can be referred to the General Teaching Council.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. As a former schoolmaster, I <P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agree with the professional associations, which feel that children should not take part in demonstrations and protests in school time. There is parental concern because of the question of legal responsibilities. Where children are away from school, with the encouragement or assistance of adults&#151;whether they be on the school staff or not&#151;the relevant school governors should take the matter seriously. Will my noble friend invite school governing bodies to consider the matter carefully?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I recognise that, as a former member of the profession, my noble friend intends to do his utmost to uphold its prestige and reputation. There is no need for us to remind governing bodies of their responsibilities; they are able to discharge them. In the one or two cases in which the issue has arisen, the governing bodies have acted in exemplary fashion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, for the benefit of parents who meet their legal obligation by seeing that their children attend school, can the Minister say who is in loco parentis for children who, having taken time out of the school day to protest, are injured?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, when the pupil is registered at the school, the responsibility lies with the school for the duration of the school day. That is why schools recognise that children who leave the premises must do so under supervision and can be at risk. We are all conscious of the fact that, at times, things go wrong on school trips and visits. However, it is highly unlikely that pupils would be supervised on a demonstration, and, as far as the school is concerned, any student who has left the school during school time has broken the agreement with the school to attend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, on these Benches, we agree very much with the Answer that the Minister gave. However, although we should discourage children from leaving school during school time to demonstrate, we should encourage them to demonstrate. Is that not a good way of encouraging them to take an interest in politics?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, that would depend on the subject about which the students were demonstrating. I can think of subjects that might cause consternation to all of us.
<P>

<a name="30327-11_para0"></a>We all recognise that we live in a democratic society and that young people are part of that democratic society, although, if they are under voting age, they have limited rights. Like the noble Baroness, we want young people to have an understanding of the issues facing society, and we are keen to promote citizenship. From time to time, that is bound to give rise to interesting and involved debates about current issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord did not answer my question. I asked who was in loco parentis in such a situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I had made the situation clear. If the pupil has registered <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for attendance at the school, the school takes responsibility. If the students then take themselves off away from the school without permission, the school has an obligation to do something about it. In the first instance, it would notify parents, who would need to know about that unauthorised absence.
<P>

<a name="30327-11_para1"></a>There is no doubt that, when a child under school leaving age registers at a school, that child is under the auspices of the school authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend consider the fact that, in some cases, children from primary schools were involved in the demonstrations? Will he express the hope that the Liberal Party would not wish to see those children involved in demonstrations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-11_spnew26"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I imagine that anybody who wants to be a Liberal has to start fairly young and, I hope, give up fairly young as well. My noble friend will recognise that my reference to the citizenship education that is part of the school curriculum did not apply to junior schoolchildren, only to those in secondary education.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, if young people had the power to vote at the age of 16, they might not feel it necessary to protest on the streets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, that is an interesting point, although the noble Baroness may have noticed that a fair number of adults have been protesting on the streets as well. They are of voting age, so the one does not exclude the other.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, has my noble friend heard of cases of school registers being marked with "W" for war or "D" for demonstration, instead of "A" for absence? Does he condone such things being done in the name of school governors and schoolmasters? Whatever the age of the pupils, they are absent, and their absence should not be condoned in such a way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, as I indicated, it is for the headmaster, in the first instance, and the school governing body to make a judgment about such things. The department is concerned with overall attendance figures and the performance of local education authorities in improving attendance and reducing truancy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, what use will be made of the photographs, including photographs of children, that were taken at recent demonstrations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, as far as the schools are concerned, it is a matter of truancy. The schools will have the information that they need about whether a student has been in attendance. Schools <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>keep a register, and the teachers are responsible for the attendance of children at the school during school hours. The issue of photographs does not come into it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that lessons in citizenship might cover the point that it is not good citizenship for young creatures way below voting age to kick the police and spit at them? That is not a good beginning to their life as a citizen. I hope that that will be expressly mentioned, when schools tackle the question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, we would deplore such behaviour by young people in any circumstances. Although the Question has arisen because of anxieties about the unauthorised absence of children from school, most reports about the demonstrations have indicated a relatively low number of incidents of the kind to which the noble Baroness referred. In our debate yesterday, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, gave due testimony of the good relationships that obtained on the demonstration that occurred outside the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the concern is not so much about the truancy of children but about the possible condoning or assisting of that absence by staff? As an ex-teacher, I join the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, in saying that allowing it to happen is unprofessional conduct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I agree with that. Strong views are held about such issues, and teachers will play their part as citizens of a democratic society. However, the noble Lord is right: when they are in their position in school, they are professionals, and bias of any sort would be a negation of educational values.

The clause allows the Lord Chancellor&#151;while negotiations continue on the final numbers for each country and before any agreement is reached on the matter, still less any change in Community law&#151;to order the expenditure of public money to investigate a range of possible outcomes as regards changes to our existing electoral arrangements.

<a name="30327-12_para4"></a>In general, it is best to proceed on the basis of what the law is, not what it might be. I should therefore be grateful to the Minister if she could advise the House of the circumstances in which this power might be used by the Government.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para5"></a>I am prepared to accept that there may be many exceptional circumstances. There is the firm background of the Nice treaty. There is the impending accession of a large number of countries and the approaching date of elections to the European Parliament. Against that background, it is reasonable to explore changes in the franchise arrangements as envisaged under the Bill. But that could be treated as a special case. Exceptional circumstances do not justify permanent powers.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para6"></a>Is the view of the Minister that there might be a change in the law at some time in the future a justifiable pretext for taking a permanent power to incur spending on an investigation of possible electoral futures? I am not sure that it is. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will give some indication of where and when this power will be used and will explain the safeguards that there will be on the use of such an open-ended power. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30327-12_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, this amendment will limit the circumstances under which the Lord Chancellor can take action to instruct the Electoral Commission to commence its redistribution work. I am grateful for the way in which the noble Baroness has put it; namely, that this is a probing amendment. The effect of the amendment would prevent the Lord Chancellor from asking the Electoral Commission to work on an expected number of MEPs.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para7"></a>Although we expect to be reasonably certain of the final numbers of MEPs for the 2004 elections by September 2003&#151;by which time it is expected that all the accession states will have held their referendums&#151;it is likely that the final figure will not be certain and fixed by Community law until it is too late for the Electoral Commission to finish its work and for the necessary implementation to take place. Clearly, that will simply limit flexibility and possibly prevent the work being completed in time. There can be no objection to beginning work early when a change is anticipated so that we can be quick off the mark when the final decision is made.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para8"></a>Furthermore, the Electoral Commission will be able to make recommendations, which would suit different possible numbers, to enable a review where the final position is uncertain. But it is only the recommendation which matches the final number fixed under Community law which can be reflected in the order.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para9"></a>Allowing work to commence on the expected number is simply prudent planning. I hope that that is an explanation with which the noble Baroness will feel able to be content.

"( ) After the first issuing of a notice by the Lord Chancellor under subsection (1) after the coming into force of this Act, no further notice may be issued until the Lord Chancellor has invited the Electoral Commission to carry out a full review of the method of election of MEPs, including specifically the issue of whether it is the most effective means of allowing electors to choose the individual candidate or candidates of their choice from among all those standing for election, and the report of the Commission has been laid before both Houses of Parliament."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-12_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I do not pretend that the wording is perfect. But the point behind it is extremely important. It follows on from the spirit of an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, in Grand Committee&#151;an amendment with which this side of the House had a great deal of sympathy, but which was swatted away by the Minister as not relevant to the present Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para14"></a>With respect, the issue is entirely germane to the present Bill which is about the representation of the United Kingdom in the European Parliament. Those of us who believe profoundly in the importance of the European Parliament, as I do, are deeply concerned by the degree of cynicism and alienation that surrounded the methods of election used in the last European elections. I do not believe that it is in the long-term interests of true representative democracy or the standing of the European Parliament to perpetuate that system of election.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para15"></a>The closed list system, used cynically, deprives the electorate of what this amendment asks that they should have; namely, an effective means of choosing an MEP of their own choice from among candidates set before them. Surely that right is the very essence of representative democracy.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para16"></a>As is well known, we on this side are not in general terms enthusiasts of PR systems. But the fact is that it is possible to have a PR system which allows electors to choose an individual MEP. Sadly, the Government chose a system in 1999 which deliberately deprived the electorate of that right. Instead, they placed the selection of MEPs in the hands of the central apparat of the various political parties through the notorious closed list system.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para17"></a>To its great credit this House, on six occasions, stood against that undemocratic system. Indeed, it never agreed to the imposition of closed lists. They were imposed by use of the Parliament Acts. No less an authority than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, has added his voice to those who argue that an Act such as this, passed by only one House of Parliament, is of questionable legality. But that is not the issue before us today.
<P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 959</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para18"></a>However, I question whether this discredited and anti-democratic system can be allowed to continue indefinitely without question, as the Minister appeared to imply in Grand Committee. There is no one outside the ranks of the Government and their most robotic supporters outside Parliament who thinks that it should.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para19"></a>Amendment No. 5 is not a device to interfere with or to hold up progress towards treaty implementation or towards the next European elections. Doubtless, that change will be levelled, but it would be wrong. Nor is it a frivolous amendment. It addresses an issue of major concern. It simply states that at a certain point in the future after the first order issued under this Act, but before any subsequent order, the Electoral Commission should be required to conduct an investigation into the nature and application of the closed list system and into whether it properly allows the public to choose their MEPs.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para20"></a>It also asks that the report of the Commission should be debated in both Houses of Parliament. That is not an unreasonable proposition or an unreasonable expectation to have of the Government. Indeed, I believe that there would be agreement with this objective on all Benches of this House. I do not think that this House which fought so hard and for so long against closed lists should give up that fight.
<P>

<a name="30327-12_para21"></a>I hope that the Government will listen and that the Minister will give an undertaking that there will be a full review of the validity of the closed list system. If not, I shall be tempted to return to the matter at Third Reading. Indeed, given any encouragement from noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches, I might be tempted to test the opinion of the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, indeed, that was a challenge. I am pleased to welcome the conversion of the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, to those who support a more democratic system of election than either the closed list or first-past-the-post systems. The Liberal Democrats were strongly opposed to the closed list system, which is probably the worst system invented for elections in multi-member constituencies. We have always taken the view that the single transferable vote system (STV) was clearly the best in these circumstances. Failing that, an open list system, which would enable voters to regulate the order in which members came on that list, was very much preferable to the closed list system.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para0"></a>Therefore, I support the idea of the Electoral Commission looking at this issue, although, on this occasion with no advance warning, I would not necessarily press the noble Baroness to divide the House. Certainly, it is a proposal that we should welcome and which we might well look at favourably.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-13_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am in full agreement with all that my noble friend Lord Goodhart has said. Quite often we discuss the decline of interest in politics, but at Question Time this afternoon we discussed an <P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increasing interest in politics. I think the common factor here is that interest in politics no longer can be translated automatically into support for a party.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para1"></a>A great many noble Lords in this Chamber feel very passionately about one or more political causes which have supporters in all three parties. Often those people wish to cast their votes, just as much as anyone else would wish to do so. But they cannot do so by voting for a party; they can do so only by voting for individuals who happen to have an attachment to that cause for which they stand.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para2"></a>That is something for which elections by a closed list system makes absolutely no allowance. Only if you can vote for the candidate because of the causes for which that candidate stands can you express your opinion. So getting away from the closed list is something which might do a good deal to revitalise interest in elections. Furthermore, it would lead to the point where, instead of having representation of the parties, we would have representation of the people. After all, that is what it is all about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, this debate has echoed the vigour with which the matter was pursued when it was debated in 1999. It was right for the noble Baroness to remind noble Lords that on six occasions it was sent back to another place. But we know that, ultimately, it became the law of our country through the democratic processes we have all accepted and adopted. The will of the people, as expressed through those democratic processes, was therefore heard and upheld.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para3"></a>All I can say is that these are hotly contested issues about which people feel passionately. However, if I may speak frankly, the place for such discussion and debate is not as part of proceedings on this Bill. We have held only one election under the Act. By all accounts it was a successful election and marked just the beginning of the road. Of course in years to come further deep discussions may take place over whether that voting system is the one we want to adopt in the long term, but it is not for today and it is not for this Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para4"></a>The amendment attempts to question the current voting system. Whatever the arguments, they go way beyond anything that could be done here. The effect of the amendment would be to engage the Electoral Commission in a long and complex review of a system which Parliament put in place only five years ago. As noble Lords will no doubt recall, that was a difficult and trenchant examination.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para5"></a>The Electoral Commission has a tight job to do in time for the elections in 2004. We think it appropriate for the commission to concentrate on that task. It would not be right to impose a requirement for a review of the system before going any further.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para6"></a>I know how tempting it is for the noble Baroness to say that she may seek to press the matter, but on this occasion I invite her to resist.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-13_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a short and largely self-explanatory amendment which has been tabled in response to a letter from a person registered as a voter in Gibraltar. The names of the electoral regions are listed in subsection (3) of new Section 1 of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002. If the Electoral Commission were to so recommend, the Lord Chancellor could then decide that Gibraltar could be added to, say, the North East region for the purposes of the election, the North East being the region with the smallest number of voters per seat. That could take place, but it would not mean that Gibraltar would become a part of the north-east of England, because plainly it is not.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para10"></a>In order to explain what is the constituency, it would be more rational to say that the constituency is the constituency of the North East region of England and Gibraltar. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, Clause 9 provides the basic building block for the enfranchisement of Gibraltar&#151;the creation of a combined electoral region consisting of Gibraltar and one of the existing regions of England and Wales. Clause 10 goes on to enable the Lord Chancellor to make an order to create that region following a recommendation from the Electoral Commission. The amendment would provide that the name of the combined region should include "Gibraltar". We believe that such an amendment is both unnecessary and disproportionate for achieving our shared aim of enabling Gibraltarians to vote. Of course I note the enthusiasm with which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, alighted on the North East to be the chosen area, but that is something which the commission will have to consider with a great deal of care.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para11"></a>The creation of the combined region and the requirement under Clause 14 for there to be a register in the Gibraltar area of the region of those eligible to vote in the European parliamentary elections will ensure the franchise of the people of Gibraltar. Eligibility to vote will be defined in the same way as in the United Kingdom; that is, by reference to residence in that part of the electoral region. Furthermore, Clause 15(1) of the Bill states clearly that, among other criteria, a person is entitled to be registered in the Gibraltar register if, on the relevant date, he is resident in Gibraltar.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para12"></a>Adding Gibraltar to the title of the region raises an interesting issue because the average electorate in an electoral region for European Parliament elections is 3.7 million people. While it may seem preferable for <P>


<a name="column_962"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasons of transparency to have the name of Gibraltar in the title of the electoral region, that could equally be seen by those living in other parts of the region to be disproportionate, given the size of the electorate in Gibraltar relative to some of the other geographical areas that may be included in the combined region.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para13"></a>Perhaps I may give an example. The Isle of Wight has an electorate of some 104,000 people, while Gibraltar has around 20,000 voters. But the Isle of Wight does not have its name in the title of the region and I would have some sympathy with its voters if Gibraltar were to become part of the same region&#151;the South East region&#151;its name included in the title and thus a disproportionate amount of attention from candidates and the media attached just to the concerns of the Gibraltar part of the region. While all the electors in the combined regions will need to be aware of the component parts of the region, that can be achieved more than adequately through the normal publicity and documentation that is provided during an election campaign, without the attendant dangers of deflecting the political debate unfairly away from the needs of the region as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para14"></a>During the debate on a similar amendment in another place, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledged that literature distributed in Gibraltar would need to be clear on this matter. We shall be considering how best that can be achieved when the detailed implementation of the provisions contained in the Bill begins.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para15"></a>We should not forget that while it is our firm intention that the people of Gibraltar should be enabled to vote in the European parliamentary elections, those elections and the electoral system are for the whole of the United Kingdom. We must be seen to be enabling free and fair elections to take place on the same basis throughout all the geographical territories covered by the system. We believe that the way in which Part 2 of the Bill has been formulated achieves that for all concerned and that therefore the amendment is not appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30327-13_para16"></a>Perhaps I may remind noble Lords that, in relation to the regions, it has become the practice to set out in a table in legislation which areas are included in each combined region. Thus the names of the various areas will be made clear in the table. As it does for all other regions, we think that that will suffice.

<A NAME="30327-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches have always been in favour of the small battalions and in this context Gibraltar is certainly a small, but worthy one. The difference between Gibraltar and the Isle of Wight is that the latter is part of the south-east region whereas Gibraltar is not part of any of the regions to which it might become attached for the purposes of this Bill. However, I have made the point and I do not intend to take it any further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 7:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 9, line 34, leave out "includes anything" and insert "is provision"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-14_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30327-14_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 8 and 9. These amendments are intended to pick up comments made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. In its eleventh report the committee doubted whether secondary legislation was appropriate for establishing the right to vote, the right to register a vote as a voter or the right to serve as an MEP in Gibraltar.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para2"></a>The report pointed out that the corresponding disqualifications in the United Kingdom were mostly dealt with by primary legislation although in some cases it was brought in by secondary legislation referring to primary legislation in another Act of Parliament. The report pointed out that the disqualification under what are now Clauses 17(1)(d) and (g) and Clause 21(1) are not limited to making provision corresponding to provision in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para3"></a>The Government delivered a full reply to that, but the committee was not persuaded and repeated the comments I have already mentioned in its twelfth report. The effect of these amendments is not to require primary legislation, but to do the next best thing, which is to limit the powers under Clause 17(1)(d) and (g) and Clause 21(1) to the making of provision corresponding to that in the United Kingdom. That means that it will not require primary legislation, but that disqualification must be limited to grounds for disqualification established by primary legislation in the United Kingdom. That seems to be more appropriate than the apparently much wider powers which the Bill now gives to the Government to legislate by regulation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I believe that when we debated this issue in Grand Committee the noble Lord said that he was minded to consider the matter further and possibly return to it at Report stage. He has kept his promise.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para4"></a>The noble Lord has made clear the purpose of these amendments is to try to restrict the enabling powers in Clauses 17 and 21 of the Bill. Amendment No. 7 seeks to restrict the powers in Clause 17(1) to provisions which correspond to those which are made in regulations under Section 53 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. Such a restriction is neither necessary nor practical given the context within which we are working.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para5"></a>Clause 17 enables the Lord Chancellor to make regulations supplementary to Clauses 14 to 16 of the Bill, which relate to the provision of a Gibraltar register for European parliamentary elections, the franchise and the entitlement to be on the register. These regulations will set out the details for these <P>


<a name="column_964"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 964</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matters and that detail will as far as possible be the same as that in the equivalent UK provision, adapted where necessary to reflect the position in Gibraltar.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para6"></a>For the benefit of the House I should also explain that the matters to which I have referred are dealt with in UK law by both primary and secondary legislation. However, much of that legislation applies only indirectly in the case of the European Parliament elections because the franchise for European parliamentary elections is derived principally from the United Kingdom parliamentary franchise. As a result there is a large amount of primary and secondary legislation which is applicable to the UK franchise and which is not set out in the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 or the regulations under that Act.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para7"></a>It has been necessary to provide for the establishment of a separate franchise for Gibraltar as clearly there is not a UK parliamentary register to rely on. So all the primary and subordinate legislation will need to be dealt with specifically under the Bill and adapted where necessary to suit Gibraltar's circumstances. We will of course need to consult with the Government of Gibraltar to be sure that we get it right. This provides some idea of the enormous task that this would present if we were to try to establish on the face of the Bill precisely all the issues dealt with under Clause 17 and then to replicate the UK provisions with appropriate adaptations for Gibraltar.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para8"></a>Our aim is to have all the necessary legislation in place by as early a date as possible and no later than the autumn, so that all those involved in preparing for June 2004 elections have plenty of time beforehand to make the necessary preparations. This would not be possible if more substantive amounts of detail were to be included on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para9"></a>The overall approach of this legislation is to treat the Gibraltar electorate in the same manner as voters in an existing UK constituency. Enfranchisement, therefore, is based on UK electoral law and the Bill will enable replication of the relevant UK rules for Gibraltar as far as possible. Similar groups of people will be enfranchised and covered by similar rules to those already in place in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para10"></a>Perhaps I may give one example. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Bill enfranchise Commonwealth citizens who qualify by satisfying the relevant immigration provisions and also residency requirements. Clause 17 gives the Lord Chancellor the power to make regulations concerning residency requirements and the definition of qualifying Commonwealth citizens. For maximum consistency across the combined region these regulations will effectively match the UK requirement and ensure that all voters in Gibraltar are treated in a fair and equal manner to the remaining voters in the combined region.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para11"></a>I hope that that clarifies the situation for the noble Lord. It is entirely in line with the commitments we have made, including our public notification to the European Council in February 2002. There may be those who are concerned about the powers being too wide, but the implied limitations within the Bill itself ensure that that cannot be the case.
<P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para12"></a>It remains our view, therefore, that all these matters are suitable to be dealt with under secondary legislation and indeed that it would be impractical to attempt to do otherwise. To restrict the powers in Clause 17(1) only to matters addressed by the regulations under Section 53 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which are largely matters of detail and procedure, would mean that all other provisions that need to be made under Clause 17(1) would need to be made on the face of the Bill. I cannot believe that that is the noble Lord's intention.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para13"></a>I take Amendment No. 8 as intending to confirm that the matters addressed by subsection (3) are not challenged. However, I respectfully say that it is not right to refer to those provisions as being without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), as subsection (3) includes a number of matters which are clearly distinct.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para14"></a>As to Clause 21, it enables the Lord Chancellor to extend the classes of those disqualified by Section 10 of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 from being an MEP to include also persons having a connection with Gibraltar. The intention is to do this by both extending existing UK provisions so that they apply to Gibraltarians in similar circumstances, and also to include similar, but distinct, classes of people in Gibraltar to UK classes where UK classes cannot easily be applied to Gibraltarians.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para15"></a>Amendment No. 9 would restrict the power in Clause 21 so as to disqualify from being an MEP only classes of persons who are disqualified from being a member of the House of Assembly of Gibraltar. As with Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, Amendment No. 9 would restrict the power too far.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para16"></a>I hope that those explanations will satisfy the noble Lord that we have responded in a proportionate manner and will reassure him and the House that the powers in Clause 17 relate to matters which are suitable for delegation and which are limited in their scope by the very nature of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the full explanation that she has given. Indeed, it goes somewhat beyond the explanation given in the letter from the Lord Chancellor to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee to which I referred.
<P>

<a name="30327-14_para17"></a>I accept that there would perhaps be excessive rigidity in amendments on the lines that I have proposed, and that the Government's intentions are indeed proportionate to the purposes which it will be necessary to achieve in order to introduce Gibraltar into the European elections system. Therefore, in the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30327-15_para4"></a>Some people have argued that mental health patients must be excluded because it is simply not possible to carry out an assessment and arrange a care plan within the minimum interval provided for patients receiving acute care. The Government do not dispute that; indeed, <P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we accept that it may well be the case. If it did seem appropriate to extend reimbursement to the mental health sector in the future, we would want to consider whether the level of reimbursement or the minimum interval should be altered to reflect any additional difficulties. The Bill already allows us to do that. So, as happens in Sweden, we could allow a longer period of time.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para5"></a>However, despite having allowed for different time-scales, I understand that noble Lords are still concerned about this. For that reason the Government have tabled amendments to require any regulations which bring patients receiving mental health care within the definition of "qualifying hospital patient" to be subject to the affirmative procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para6"></a>Because the amendments have been added at this late stage, the drafting is rather tortuous. Perhaps I may explain the effect of the amendments, why they are necessary and how they relate to each other.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para7"></a>Although we originally thought that achieving this would mean an amendment to Clause 1, we were advised by parliamentary counsel that, because the substance of the issue is more to do with the affirmative procedure, the amendment is more properly located in Clause 8. Therefore, in Clause 8 we have added a requirement that regulations which prescribe mental health care must be subject to the affirmative procedure. That has meant that we also need to define "mental health care", and to do this it is necessary to add an order-making power to deal with the problem of definition in the most straightforward way. That order will prescribe mental health care as care which is received by a patient who is under a consultant psychiatrist. Two further consequential amendments have been added to Clause 9 and Clause 11.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para8"></a>The implications of these changes are that the existing set of regulations prescribing care, which are currently out for consultation, will have to be slightly amended to exclude this type of care, as defined in the order, as being outwith the definition of acute care. Then, as and when it is considered appropriate, we will lay before the House regulations bringing patients receiving mental health care within the scope of the definition of "qualifying hospital patient". If the Government decide in the future that bringing such patients within the provisions of the Bill would be an effective way of tackling the delays as regards community care services suffered by people with mental illness&#151;a point addressed several times during our debates&#151;Parliament will then be able to debate, and disagree to, any such regulations.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para9"></a>I agree with what the honourable Member for Chelmsford West said in another place; namely, that this group could be included in the future but should not be included at the moment. That is the right approach. I hope that noble Lords will be able to accept the Commons amendments.

<P>

<P>

<a name="30327-15_para12"></a>Our thanks are due also to the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Intorducing the affirmative process is an elegant solution. It was, as I recall, the noble Earl's suggestion and I am grateful to the Government for taking it up.

<a name="30327-15_para13"></a>Thanks are more properly due to the noble Baroness and her colleagues in the department. They have recognised that extending the scope of the Bill to patients in receipt of mental health services is a matter of considerable concern, particularly among those in the voluntary sector.

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para17"></a>Something upon which we in this Chamber are all agreed is that patients&#151;they are mainly older patients&#151;should be supported in leaving hospital when they are medically ready and that when current arrangements let them down, as occurs all too often, we have to act to put that right. Our problem with a further six months' delay beyond October this year is the very real risk that the benefits of the concentrated efforts already made by health and social partners will be lost. We know that much good work has already been done. Instead of local authorities and trusts across the country continuing to work together we are afraid that there could be additional delay.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para18"></a>I wish today to assure noble Lords that although the Government still intend to commence the provisions which implement the process&#151;that is, the giving of the notices and the assessment&#151;in October, they will not commence the provisions dealing with charging until 1st January 2004.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para19"></a>In addition, noble Lords will remember the commitment announced by the Secretary of State in November to transfer an extra £100 million to councils' budgets for each full year of the scheme's operation. I can confirm now that councils will proportionately receive £50 million for 2003&#150;04. This will be paid as soon as practicable so that councils can invest these extra resources in expanding older people's services as fast as possible so that they can be well prepared for implementation in January. There will then be £100 million in 2004&#150;05 and again in 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para20"></a>We have delivered, therefore, a period of grace. It means that the NHS and local authorities will have a three-month period over the winter to prepare for full implementation during which the charging operates only in shadow form and no charges for delays will change hands. I believe that this will bring health and social care partners together and, crucially, allows for proper planning without the loss of momentum. Part 2 of the Bill will come into effect on Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para21"></a>I turn to the sunset clause, Amendment No. 47. We are still convinced that it is not an appropriate use of a so-called sunset clause. While delayed discharges are a serious matter for the patients and families, they can hardly be called a matter of national emergency. Neither is there any inherent reason for the Bill to come to an end in five years' time other than the Opposition seeking to limit its effect.
<P>

<a name="30327-15_para22"></a>It is an important point. Are we really saying that noble Lords should be able to put a time limit on a Bill which the elected Government have brought forward? Constitutionally, I believe that that sets an extremely unfortunate precedent. In a previous debate, the argument was made elegantly by the noble Earl that it would be no bad thing if all Bills had a sunset clause. In certain cases, such as national emergency or where civil liberties are affected, that may be appropriate. But in the case of the majority of Bills there are already procedures for repeal or amendment. We have dealt with that. To require Parliament to revisit legislation without a very good reason for doing so places a fetter on Parliament's ability to legislate and to do so in this Bill would set an unfortunate precedent.

<P>

<a name="30327-16_para1"></a>I listened carefully to what she said. In essence, she has taken many of the same lines of argument against the amendment as were used by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, during our debate last week. I do not accept the arguments which attempt to portray sunset clauses as somehow anti-constitutional and as fettering the will of Parliament. If Parliament decides that an Act must be subject to a mandatory review in both Houses after a certain period of its operation, then Parliament is entitled to make that decision, no matter what the subject of the legislation. I take some comfort from the fact that it was not only Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who joined me in pressing that opinion through the Lobbies last week: there was also a healthy number of very distinguished Cross-Bench Peers. I was heartened by and grateful for the support of all noble Lords who voted for the amendment. Nevertheless, in deciding what to do with the amendment today, I feel that I must take account of the considerable number of concessions made by the Government during the Bill's entire passage. They are not insignificant concessions. I do not propose today, therefore, to press the sunset amendment. I believe that we have had a useful debate on the subject. Another place has considered the issue and rejected it and there the matter should lie.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para2"></a>I turn, therefore, to the issue of the sunrise clause. I thank the noble Baroness for her extremely constructive and helpful speech. The amendment we are debating is, as she will know, one to which we attach very great importance. We do so not through a desire to make life difficult but because of the intense anxiety that exists in local government, the voluntary sector and the NHS itself about the speed with which the legislation was to be introduced. I shall not rehearse the arguments at length; that has been done <P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>enough already. But in essence they boil down to two concerns: the need for local authorities to put in place the necessary human resources to enable them to deliver what is required of them on the ground, especially home care services; and the need to deal with issues emerging from the ombudsman's report and the Coughlan judgment to ensure that there are properly understood and consistent procedures in place throughout the health service to deal with decision-making about NHS-funded continuing care.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para3"></a>Twelve months, I believe, was the minimum period necessary to allow for those matters to be expedited in order for the Bill to stand a chance of achieving its aims even on a restricted definition. This very day I received a letter from the Local Government Association which urges this House to continue supporting the inclusion of my amendment within the Bill. I do not believe that the noble Baroness should be under any illusion about the strength of feeling "out there" about this matter. However, this is the second occasion on which the House has had to decide this issue. Another place has rejected the amendment that was carried here last month.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para4"></a>There is, I think, a natural limit to the parliamentary process in that sense. Today the Government have made a considerable effort to be conciliatory. That has to be recognised; I do recognise it. In an ideal world, I would have wished for a deferral of the financial penalties until April 2004. However, from debates in this House and from my private discussions with the Minister, I do not believe that that is an end result which the Government would ever concede. If I have understood the Minister correctly today, she has very considerably expanded the concession made in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. She said that the Bill will come into operation on 1st October 2003 but that the operation of the financial incentives and penalties will not commence until 1st January 2004. At the same time, funding of £50 million will be made available to local authorities as if the scheme had been fully operational for a full six months of the next financial year. If that is a correct understanding of the Government's offer, it represents a considerable step in our direction, and it would not be a productive use of parliamentary time to call a further Division on the issue.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para5"></a>Will the Minister tell us how the sum of £50 million is to be distributed among local authorities? Will she also allow me to press her on the amount of money itself? She will know that there is real worry in local government about the shortage of resources in social services. Will she undertake to leave the door open on the possibility of increasing the amount of money available during the coming financial year? The LGA has estimated that, if £50 million is distributed from October or perhaps even sooner, as much as £35 million will be swallowed up in fines between January and April 2004. That would leave little for investment into building up capacity, which everyone agrees is the single most important task for local authorities in the coming months.

<a name="30327-16_para6"></a>The compromise offered by the Government, although not everything that we could have wished for, is a significant step forward. I thank the Minister for that. I do not propose to ask the House to express a collective view on the issue a second time. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I add my support to the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I realise that the Government have moved a very long way and that the blunt instrument that the Bill was a few weeks ago has been considerably sharpened.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para8"></a>I wish to question the Minister on timing. The issues of money and time are closely interrelated. We argued consistently about time being a precious commodity for local authorities. We have not focused much in our debates on the fact that, as well as new services being put in place, much effort will have to be spent on reshaping and redefining existing services, such as day care. We have not discussed those services much. They are not always provided directly by the local authority, and it will take some time to ensure that they become part of the whole process of rehabilitation of older people.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para9"></a>When will the £50 million be announced? It would be a much more effective investment if it were implemented very soon, way ahead of the Bill coming into force. There is a real possibility that when the fine system starts in January, in the areas where the system does not work for some reason and when the single assessment process is introduced in 2004, local authorities may begin the financial year with a deficit that they could not have worked out. January to March is a short time for them to reorientate their budget. Playing with budgets at the back end of the year is not always easy.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para10"></a>I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that it would have been preferable to introduce the system in April 2004, but that is not going to happen. However, there will be time for local authorities and the NHS to do some tight planning and redefinition of services. I stress that the NHS is integral to the process. I hope that the department teams responsible for the change will work closely with local authorities and the NHS during those six months to give them a steer to help them implement these measures successfully.

I declare an interest as a member of the boards of the John Grooms charity for disabled people, which means that I understand the issue of providers, and of the National Care Standards Commission, which means that I understand the issue of regulation. I wish to comment on how the process will affect providers, and the way in which they consider the issues across the board.

<P>

<a name="30327-16_para11"></a>I have nothing to say about the sunset clause. I welcome the additional time, but it is a great pity that it had to be brought about by pressure from the opposition Front Benches, with additional pressure from the Cross Benches. I could not be present due to other commitments, but I associate myself entirely with the comments made by other Cross Benchers.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para12"></a>Will the Minister discuss with her department the complications that the measure will cause on the ground for those who are providing and regulating such decision-making? In her introduction, she said that extending for a further three months might delay the impetus of partnership between health authorities and local government. I challenge that comment because local government and health authorities are struggling and working hard together to provide services. The difficulty is one of change management, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pointed out. That takes time. There are also issues of resources. One has to have resources in the right place at the right time.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para13"></a>Only today, I heard that fees for registration and inspection in the sector will be increased by 20 per cent. Although that has been planned for the future, it gives rise to an issue of timing in change management; it is an additional issue that make providers feel that they are not valued. It also causes stress. It will not help if people are wavering over whether to close their establishments. It will become extraordinarily difficult for inspectors to make decisions when they go into homes.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para14"></a>I give that example as an illustration of how complex the issues are on the ground when people are trying to deliver services. In my experience, having worked many years in local government and the voluntary sector, most people want to provide the best service for the individual old lady who is facing them in the old people's home on that day. Only this morning, I heard on the radio about a home that was going to close because the local authority was unable or unwilling to provide fees for the residents.
<P>

<a name="30327-16_para15"></a>I welcome the changes. But will the Minister discuss these matters further with her department? There is certainly not time enough to have in place what we need to have in place, but the move is valued by many Members of the Committee.

<P>

<a name="30327-17_para0"></a>I congratulate the Minister, but I also send congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, who is not in the Chamber today. He worked ceaselessly and tirelessly on the Bill, and the compromises that he could afford and that he negotiated have been carried on so well by the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, who has taken over his role.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their generous response. I do so particularly on behalf of my noble friend Lord Hunt, who put tremendous effort into the Bill. He is very happy that we have been able to achieve a workable outcome. Noble Lords in the Chamber have taken the Bill apart and to heart in different ways and I am grateful to them.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para2"></a>I shall try to answer some of the questions, the first of which was on money. I say to the noble Earl that the final decision on allocation will be made shortly. The matter has been considered, but it has not been decided because of the question of a starting date. We will let noble Lords know as soon as possible. As for when the £50 million grant will be available, that will have to be debated in Parliament under Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, but we will pay it to councils as soon as practicable after that.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para3"></a>I hope that that goes some way towards meeting the issues raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay, Lady Howarth and Lady Barker. We need to create capacity, allow time and provide resources as soon as possible so that people can see exactly what they have to do. The extra funding will help them to be better prepared. The access grant provides for additional funding for home care, intermediate care and community care, and the first tranche will come into effect in April 2003. So resources will be available almost immediately. All I can say is that we shall be monitoring what is happening to the £50 million. I can say no more on that as it is a matter for the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, referred to the changes. We are conscious that we are expecting a lot from social services and that many other events are occurring in their world which require careful management. However, we embarked on this legislation in the knowledge that people were being inappropriately placed in hospital and left to become worse rather than better. The spirit behind the Bill has been to provide a better future for those people. We are aware of the dedication and hard work of social services. We have every expectation that they will be able to meet the challenge. But we do not underestimate the challenge and we are aware of the other difficulties. I hope that our changes will signal that we are aware of what they need to do and that we support them.

The Commons disagreed to this amendment for the following reason:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-17_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
6ABecause it is unnecessary to require consent for the giving of notices containing no personal information and because Lords Amendment No. 9 makes more appropriate provision for consultation.


<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this House do not insist on their Amendment No. 6 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 6A.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para8"></a>At Report stage we agreed a government amendment that places a duty on the NHS to consult the patient, and where appropriate their carer, prior to issuing a notice to the local authority of the patient's likely need for community care services under Section 2. That reinforces the existing good practice, supported by statutory guidance for Section 47 assessments as well as the single assessment process and the recently published discharge workbook. It is a key principle that the patient should be kept informed and be consulted at all stages of the assessment process. This amendment puts the matter beyond doubt by placing that requirement on the face of primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para9"></a>Our amendment goes further, however, and requires consent. I understand that where the patient clearly gives or withholds consent to the question of whether social services should be notified, that would appear to be straightforward. In a previous debate, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, stated that he thought that few people would not want at least to have advice from social services on what services they might need when leaving hospital. The problem with the word "consent", however, is that the matter is not always that clear cut.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para10"></a>There are cases where the patient may refuse, thinking that he wants nothing to do with social services. He may be unaware of what social services can do, or afraid because he has never had any contact with social services. He may be concerned about the implications for his family, his privacy and his future life. There may be other cases in which an older person does not feel able to give a clear answer but wants to wait for a family conference before agreeing or wants someone to explain what is involved. In such cases the lack of consent would stop the NHS contacting social services. It would even prevent the social worker based in the hospital visiting, causing several days' delay in discharge planning. If consent were eventually given, it could still substantially reduce the time that social services had to assess and plan. Our amendment&#151;<P>


<a name="column_976"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 976</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which means that the NHS body must consult both the patient and their carer, if they have one, before issuing the notice&#151;will mean that the patient knows that social services is involved.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para11"></a>As we said, in the majority of cases patients will be happy at least to have the options explained. For those who are concerned about what social services might do in their case, the social worker may be the very person to reassure the patient. However, that process must be given a chance. The NHS body must be able to start planning for discharge and needs to be able to notify social services. I reiterate again that all that is being given to the local authority with the Section 2 notice is the patient's name. So if the social worker arrives on the ward but the patient does not agree to social services involvement, they still have a right to refuse to co-operate or to accept the services on offer. That is why we believe that the government amendment was appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para12"></a>Guidance for the Bill will also clearly tell the NHS what steps that consultation should involve. We have made clear in guidance exactly what steps have to be taken. I can tell noble Lords that we would also be prepared to include in regulations that the Section 2 notice must briefly record the patient's or carer's views and the outcome of the consultation. We have therefore listened to the concerns, and we believe that that proposal will meet them. It will make clear to the NHS the importance of involving patients and families at that stage and of keeping them fully informed as to what happens next in the discharge process.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para13"></a>I hope that, with those reassurances, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

I am glad that we have moved on from the position outlined in the draft regulations which seemed to give older people no say at all in the process. I believe that it is right to enable older people to have some influence in the process.
<P>

<a name="30327-17_para16"></a>Always at the back of my mind was the fear that older people seeing the new system in operation as described at earlier stages would believe that if they went to hospital, nothing could be done to stop them going into an old people's home. That might seem an irrational fear to your Lordships but it is real to many older people. I am glad that it will be possible to explain to older people that such will not happen to them but that they or members of their family can be active participants.

<A NAME="30327-18_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, while the concessions made are not all on the face of the Bill, we now have a more patient-centred measure than before, which is a thoroughly healthy development. I retain a small measure of disquiet about possible abuse of patient confidentiality&#151;even under the tighter rules that the Minister outlined. I add my thanks for the comprehensive letter sent by the Minister's colleague, Jacqui Smith, a few days ago.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para0"></a>It is important never to lose sight of patient confidentiality. We can be cavalier about it. We can even be cavalier about it within the confines of the NHS&#151;but outside the health service, it is important to remember that sensitivities must be observed as much as possible. That said, we have taken several major steps forward and I thank the Minister for her part in that process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the changes to the Bill, which is moving away from over-rigid enforcement of consent by patients&#151;to whom the thought of signing something might seem threatening&#151;in favour of consensus and assent.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para1"></a>I noted with interest the Minister's comment that the interview with the social worker would record the carer's views and the outcome of the consultation in the case notes. Can the Minister clarify whether that will be done in the clinical case notes from the patient's ward or in the case notes held by social services? That has some implications for who will audit the process and be responsible for making sure that consultations are routinely recorded&#151;so that one can be sure that the process was one of negotiation.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para2"></a>As the noble Earl said, older people are often frightened about any breach of confidentiality&#151;particularly in respect of financial issues. They are absolutely terrified of information about their assets leaking out and feel vulnerable to crime. When older people are ill, they may have a distorted perception of the world around them. Face-to-face contact with a social worker is important but we need to ensure that the audit processes are implemented, to ensure that the Bill's important provisions are continually enacted and that no shortcuts are taken&#151;and so that if there are any local breaches, they can be acted upon quickly.

Is there any intention of collecting that data? I was recently involved in another review where it was clear that there was a huge lack of consistent information to underpin strategic planning. It would be useful if we could capture relevant data to provide good information for the future.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, makes an important point.

<P>

<a name="30327-18_para3"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that we are talking only about recording the fact that a consultation has taken place&#151;so the clinical notes would not be relevant in that context. The Section 2 notice itself will provide the record.

<P>

<a name="30327-18_para8"></a>The amendments in this group raise the crucial issue of informing and involving patients and carers in the performance of a social services assessments and decisions as to which services are to be provided. Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 propose that local authorities should consult patients and carers during the assessment of community care needs and obtain their consent to the care plan. Amendment No. 16 would further require the local authority to inform patients of the costs.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para9"></a>The Bill makes no difference to a patient's rights with respect to consent. Patients have an existing right not to consent to receiving the services that social <P>


<a name="column_979"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 979</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services have assessed as being needed. Neither social services nor the NHS have the right to force services upon a patient who does not want to receive them.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para10"></a>Clause 3(11) makes it clear that the assessment and care planning process is part of the Section 47 assessment process and therefore one stage or part of the single assessment process. We do not want to undermine that connection or consistency. Singling out the assessment in the care planning process from all other Section 47 assessments and care planning would differentiate the process in the Bill from all others of assessment and care planning inside and outside the hospital&#151;which would lead to confusion between agencies and lack of co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para11"></a>I want to re-emphasise and reiterate our solution, given in a statement by my honourable friend the Minister in another place, for how we will tackle the concerns expressed in the amendments for all Section 47 assessments. Section 47(4) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 contains a power for the Secretary of State to issue directions as to the manner in which assessments are carried out. We will therefore issue a direction under this power to make it clear that the local authority, having assessed the needs of the patient, should consult the patient before deciding which services to provide, gain agreement to the care plan where possible and provide information about the costs of that care plan to the patient.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para12"></a>This will be the first time that this direction-making power has been used in 12 years. Through this direction we will require all Section 47 assessment processes to reach this standard on consultation and agreement. Therefore the effect will be far greater than an amendment to the Bill. Since it will affect all Section 47 assessments it will bring consistency to the assessment process, including the single assessment process, and it will be equally legally binding on all Section 47 assessments.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para13"></a>The direction would cover all the points made in Amendment No. 16 apart from an absolute duty to gain consent to the care plan and the exact wording on mental incapacity. This is because the use of the word "consent" could mean that the council spend months trying to gain consent to a care plan from someone who was unreasonably withholding consent. Since the 1990 Act it has been practice that assessor and user should agree the care plan and we would propose that the directions should carry the wording,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"take all reasonable steps to reach agreement",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-18_para14"></a>
which gives the right balance of reasonableness to both parties; the patient and the council.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para15"></a>We would not use the wording in Amendment No. 16 on mental incapacity because the exact form may cut across forthcoming legislation on mental incapacity. But we would certainly make the general statement that the council must ensure that the patient's best interests have been duly considered where they lack mental capacity. This reflects councils' current legal duty. I hope that having strengthened the Bill and the process, with that assurance noble Lords will not press their amendments.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
14BLeave out "not".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-18_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 15B, 16B and 18B with which it is grouped. Throughout the Bill's passage we have fought tooth and nail for consent. The basis for our arguments has been in many ways the Bill's architecture, which we on this side of the House have found far too weighted in favour of the NHS and against patients. There has been a sort of pendulum process. We saw that the Bill was weighted one way, we tabled a number of amendments that took it in the opposite direction, and perhaps now the pendulum has begun to swing back.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para18"></a>What we have done and why we have done it have been open to misinterpretation. Throughout our discussions we were trying to reach the key word in the Minister's statement: agreement. I am glad that she has come forward with a proposal for directions that are about agreement. In our discussions we have been motivated by a wish to empower patients. I confess that during our discussions the Government were slightly unlucky in that they caught me at a time when a friend who was in hospital took a bath only to return to find someone else in her bed. That rather coloured my views of some of the speeches.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para19"></a>I also want to take issue with a remark made in another place on 19th March. The Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whether hon. Members in another place are the people in the real world is questionable, but we have listened to people who operate in the real world".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 19/3/03; col. 975.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-18_para20"></a>
I have a piece of evidence that will prove that that is not true. As everyone knows, in "The Archers", Mrs Antrobus has just returned home from a period of intermediate care, and the whole of Ambridge and the rest of us are desperate to know whether Roy and Hayley are going to manage to enable her to stay at home. I am afraid that it does not get more real than "The Archers".
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para21"></a>These amendments, particularly the one on assessment, are about enabling older people to go through a process that is time-linked, centred on their needs, and at the end allows them to say if the services provided for them were not right. Throughout our discussions we have talked a great deal about where and when assessments will happen. I have accepted what Ministers said: that acute hospitals full of MRSA are not places in which to make decisions about the <P>


<a name="column_981"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 981</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>continuing needs and support of older citizens. "The Archers" had it absolutely right the other day: Mrs Antrobus was wondering whether she could manage.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para22"></a>I think it is true that the BBC is party to a political conspiracy. How it knew that in these two weeks in Parliament we would be focusing on Iraq and delayed discharge I do not know, but it is marvellous that it did. I am being flippant, but I am trying to hit at the heart of the Bill, which is about older people being in a process in which they are able to play a part rather than having things done to them for the convenience of others.
<P>

<a name="30327-18_para23"></a>I take to heart what the Minister said about all reasonable steps. It was never our intention that family members could hole older people up in hospital so that they could never leave. We were talking about setting standards in reaching agreement with older people about their care packages. I listened to what the Minister said about mental incapacity. I am slightly disappointed and remain convinced that old people with Alzheimer's or dementia or who have had strokes may find themselves disadvantaged by this process. We will look at the important mental incapacity legislation with extreme care. I welcome what the Minister said about consent and I shall welcome the contribution of other noble Lords.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on their Amendment No. 23 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason 23A.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para11"></a>The amendment raises the important issue of the information received by the patient and carer about the date of discharge. It is extremely important that the NHS gives the patient and their carers all the information they need to make discharge as safe and co-ordinated as possible. We agree that the patient and the carer need information about the discharge date as much as social services. I submit that they need that information just as much for every discharge, regardless of whether it is a discharge conducted according to the processes of this Bill, or whether a routine discharge is involved, by which the patient goes back to the care of his or her family. I again refer to the revised Hospital Discharge Workbook, which makes it clear that every patient is to be provided with information and advice throughout the discharge process, not just about the date but about the care that <P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they will receive after discharge. As a further way of reinforcing that, I can confirm today that the regulations around the notice of the discharge date will require that the hospital confirms that that information has also been given to the patient.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para12"></a>Amendment No. 23 is seeking to go beyond that by placing an entirely new duty on the NHS to gain the patient's consent to discharge. As we said previously, that raises serious questions for the NHS as a whole and its general ability to function and to manage admissions and discharges on a rational basis. It would undoubtedly increase delayed discharges and the length of hospital stays.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para13"></a>If a patient had a right to consent to discharge, they would effectively have a legal right to remain in a hospital bed indefinitely. The decision that a patient is ready for discharge is one for the NHS body, but it needs to be taken in consultation with the patient/carer, social services and other health professionals by a suitably qualified member of hospital staff with responsibility for discharge. The guidance for the Bill will make it plain that the decision to discharge is one that must be taken in consultation with all relevant parties, including the patient/carer. That will be made clear in guidance. I would argue that even without that guidance, acting in that way is part and parcel of the NHS's general duty.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para14"></a>I cannot therefore accept that the patient must give informed consent to discharge. However, I understand the real concern that patients may leave hospital with an inadequate care package. The first step, which we have already debated, involves proper discussion between social services and the patient about the adequacy of care.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para15"></a>I know that noble Lords opposite are also concerned about older people who may be desperate to get home and therefore accept a care plan, which turns out, in practice, to be inadequate. We have responded to those concerns: the Section 7 guidance in the Bill will state that where the discharge plan is a care package in the person's own home, social services are to review the discharge care package, including that provided to the carer&#151;if there is one&#151;within a maximum of two weeks to check that the post-discharge care has been adequate and is working. The Section 7 guidance will include advice to monitor the arrangements in an even shorter time if there appears to be any concern that the post-discharge situation might be unstable. That means that any perverse effects that may arise can quickly be identified and addressed on an individual basis in a very short period of time.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para16"></a>There is much flexibility in that arrangement. Each patient's progress through the stages of assessment and care planning may differ and where there is an ongoing assessment, that will in itself be a review. The care plan can be updated as a result of that ongoing assessment. In those circumstances, the short-term review may not be needed or will become part of the longer-term review. A complex assessment could be carried out in interim care or it could be that the <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discharge plan involved a period of intermediate care, which in itself includes a review. Either way, we are providing for all eventualities in terms of home care.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para17"></a>On the other hand, we want that good practice of review after a short time to extend to other points in the care pathway; for example, where the person goes home after a period of care, such as intermediate care. We will introduce that through cross-references between guidance on the Bill and guidance on the single assessment process. We will be consulting fully on all that&#151;we realise that it is a new element in the process, which I am sure noble Lords will welcome.
<P>

<a name="30327-19_para18"></a>On the NHS side, we will make it clear in directions that every patient should be assessed against local criteria for fully funded NHS continuing care before social services are contacted about providing community care services and that patients should be fully informed about those criteria and that they can request a review. That will be confirmed in the regulations governing the Section 2 notice. We have also made it clear that the directions about the conduct of continuing care reviews will mean that those reviews must be conducted within 14 days. We have symmetry between the period of reviewing. During this time, if the patient is in hospital, he can remain there. I hope that that relieves some of the serious reservations of noble Lords.

<P>

<a name="30327-20_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 would impose a permanent statutory duty on inspection bodies to monitor the impact of the Bill on patients and carers and a permanent statutory duty on the Secretary of State to report on an annual basis to Parliament on the outcomes of patients affected by the Act.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para3"></a>Perhaps I could restate the steps that the Government have taken not only to monitor the effects of policies on the NHS and social care in real time so that action can be taken if there are perverse effects, but also to evaluate policies. In addition, I remind noble Lords about the proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) <P>


<a name="column_985"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 985</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill to make the new inspectorates much more independent of government. In the light of that, the major problem that we have with the amendments is that it would be inappropriate, having just proposed that the Secretary of State would agree high level priorities only with the new inspectorates, immediately to start a detailed list of inspections that the inspectorates must perform. I hope that noble Lords accept that it would not be right to undermine their independence in that way.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para4"></a>Health and social care already involves a raft of ways of evaluating performance&#151;performance indicators include delayed discharges, emergency readmissions, home care and people helped to live at home. We are also introducing indicators on the speed of service provision. Those indicators will quickly indicate if substantial problems arise, even if they are in only some local areas. The department is also carrying out work at the moment on improving the sensitivity of readmissions data, so that it more accurately reflects whether a patient is readmitted with the same problem as previously. We need to know that. Those mechanisms are robust.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para5"></a>The department's interest in reducing the unhappiness that delayed discharges cause will absolutely not stop when the Bill is implemented. In response to concerns about the impact of the Bill and incentives on behaviour in the NHS and social services and the effect on patients, we will commission an evaluation of the system and of its implementation during the first year of operation. We want to ensure that the system, and the incentives within it, are bringing about positive changes and identify any barriers to successful implementation. In addition, the implementation team, which is led and staffed by practitioners, will be encouraging local partnerships to have "dry-runs" of the system before commencement, which can also be evaluated by a wider reference group and fed back to the implementation team. We want to learn the lessons as early as possible. We will want to intensify that work from October until full implementation in January so that social services and the NHS feel supported when they introduce the new system of notifying each other and acting on those notices. At the same time, the implementation team can offer support to areas having particular difficulties&#151;it will build on what has worked well elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para6"></a>I return to the inspectorate. I know that noble Lords were concerned that there was a gap between the difference between collective quantitative information and quantitative information, so that we knew what was happening to the patient and the impact on him or her. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was concerned about that.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para7"></a>The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill proposes the establishment of two new health and social care inspectorates&#151;the Commission for Health Audit and Inspection and the Commission for Social Care Inspection. One of their functions will be to validate performance statistics, but they will also monitor and report on the "whole system" with an emphasis on the experience of the <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>patient and user of the service. We believe that that is a major step forward and one which noble Lords will welcome. The new CHAI inspections will include foundation trusts.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para8"></a>Noble Lords may be interested to know that the current inspectorates and the Audit Commission are already planning a wide-ranging and co-ordinated study of older people's services across health and social care. Field work will begin later this year and it will consider the new structures and report in 2005.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para9"></a>Both the new inspectorates will report annually to Parliament on the provision of NHS and social care. Their independence from the department will mean that instructions from the department about the detail and frequency with which they need to inspect older people's services would not be possible as the relationship between inspectorates and department is currently envisaged.
<P>

<a name="30327-20_para10"></a>On that issue, the Commons reasoned that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to impose a permanent specific statutory duty on the inspection bodies to monitor the effects of the Bill or on the Secretary of State to report every year to Parliament specifically on the effect of the Bill. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will accept that it is preferable to maintain this independence and that the additional evaluation that I have introduced today and the existing very robust mechanisms that we already have in place will meet the reservations raised at previous stages of the Bill.

<a name="30327-20_para14"></a>What do we mean by monitoring? The noble Baroness is right. It will not be enough to collect quantities of bald statistical data.

<P>

<a name="30327-20_para16"></a>CHI will need to gain a much better handle, for example, on the causal factors underlying emergency readmissions. At present, I understand that it is simply not possible to say from the statistics available how many patients are being readmitted to hospital on an emergency basis for a clinical condition for which they were previously being treated. That kind of information is essential if the Government are to have any hope of implementing the system of financial flows which they have announced.

<A NAME="30327-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews </B>   rose to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 26A to the Lords Amendment No. 26 and do propose the following further amendment to Lords Amendment No. 26:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
26BLine 26, at end insert&#151;
"(7A) Until 31st March 2005 the period of two days referred to in subsection (7) is exclusive of Sundays and public holidays in England and Wales."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-21_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30327-21_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, throughout the Bill, we have discussed the inclusion or exclusion of weekends and public holidays from the minimum interval&#151;that is, the time within which social services must assess and arrange services for a patient. The argument has been made that social services departments cannot and should not be expected to perform these functions outside of the normal working week.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para7"></a>However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, pointed out in our previous debate on this subject, we should surely be looking forward to a time when ways of working have changed and health and social care <P>


<a name="column_989"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 989</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>really do work together and support each other. She said that keeping people in hospital, for whatever reason, longer than is absolutely necessary is not acceptable in this day and age and that to put this requirement on the face of the Bill would not help patients.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para8"></a>An older person delayed in an acute hospital bed does not disappear or become any less vulnerable to the consequences of a delay simply because the weekend occurs and social services do not work at weekends. I believe that we should be moving towards a more flexible approach to working hours that means that the needs of individuals for community care services can be more effectively met. We believe that excluding Saturday, Sunday and public holidays from the face of the Bill would send entirely the wrong message about what is acceptable and what we expect in the future for our older people.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para9"></a>However, I know that many local authorities are not yet in the position where they would be able to provide services, for example, over the Easter bank holiday weekend. Although I believe that all local authorities should aspire to the practice of the best, which already provide assessment teams with extended hours and at weekends, I am prepared to give a commitment that we shall exclude Sundays and public holidays from the minimum compliance period in the first instance.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para10"></a>The amendment tabled by the Government would require the regulations to exclude Sundays and public holidays from the minimum period until 31st March 2005. That means that local authorities have nine months from now, without financial consequence, to prepare for Saturday working&#151;something that most social services are already moving towards. But, because we accept that not all social services currently provide a seven-day service and could not move overnight to doing so, social services will have more time&#151;until April 2005&#151;to plan for this. I also want to emphasise that April 2005 is the earliest date that seven-day working could be introduced.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para11"></a>The amendment gives only the date before which the regulations cannot be changed; it does not specify that the regulations will change on that date. Furthermore, we shall also state that any notice given by the NHS to the local authority in respect of a patient on a public holiday will be treated as if it were given on the following day. That means that there will be an extra day before the Section 2 notice informing the local authority of the patient's likely need for community care services and before the Section 5 notice informing it of the discharge date become effective.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para12"></a>I hope that noble Lords recognise that this represents a positive compromise. I hope they will accept that we do not want to give the message on the face of the Bill that it is acceptable for older people routinely to wait in hospital five or more days for an assessment or for services to be in place, which would be the case if the whole weekend were also excluded.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para13"></a>But I am happy to put on the face of the Bill that the regulations will exclude Sundays and public holidays until 2005 and will therefore give local authorities more time to adjust to new ways of working. I reflect <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>again on what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said about the need to recognise the pressure that local authorities are under. They will now have more time to carry out their duties from implementation. I hope that noble Lords will agree with the change. I hope that they will feel that they no longer need to insist on their amendment and will accept the government amendment in lieu. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para14"></a>Moved, That this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 26A to Lords Amendment No. 26, and do propose Amendment No. 26B to Lords Amendment No. 26.&#151;(Baroness Andrews.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has rehearsed the arguments. We have had them at every stage of the Bill. This has been one of the most closely argued areas of the Bill. I do not propose to go into all the rebuttals. There is much that I disagree with in what the Minister said. I still think that the arguments are strongly felt on both sides. The concerns on both Opposition Benches are about unsafe discharge at weekends and the problems of staffing in local authorities, which would have a knock-on effect on the patients. None of our arguments has been about the convenience of local authorities. They were about patients. We have to agree that that is common ground. The arguments were about what was best for patients.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para15"></a>In the best of all possible worlds&#151;I think the noble Earl, Lord Howe, used that phrase earlier&#151;we would press the amendment. We would like weekends and bank holidays to be excluded permanently as long as the Bill is in effect. However, we all recognise that the Minister has made a fair compromise. Time will tell whether local authorities can change their practices and whether discharge will be safe. They will at least have a fair run at it of a year and six months to get their house in order and see whether they will be able to start up at bank holidays and weekends as if they were ordinary working days.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para16"></a>I am pessimistic about that, but on the other hand, as with all these things, it is a matter of how far amendments should be pushed back and forth between the Commons and the Lords. We have reached the point at which insisting further would not be fruitful. We need to see the outcome of the proposals. The Government have come up with an elegant interim solution. Let us see whether it works.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-21_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I have a question to add to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. If the Government see fit at some stage to introduce regulations that would bring about seven-day working, it is terribly important that local authorities are given adequate and reasonable notice. It would be helpful to hear from the noble Baroness that the Government will bear that point closely in mind should they decide to introduce seven-day working.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the noble Baroness's compromise, but I should like to put straight on the record some of the <P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>underlying assumptions. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that none of us wants to put the convenience of services above the needs of consumers, patients or users of any kind. That is the underlying position.
<P>

<a name="30327-21_para17"></a>I am concerned that an impact assessment may well not have been carried out to look at workforce planning and the availability of staff over these periods. After all, social services run a number of seven-day services, including residential services for children and home care services. However, those workforces are already seriously in difficulty, as the noble Baroness will know from the various taskforces looking at workforce planning in that area. Like my colleagues, I am gravely concerned that we will be in difficulties and will be discharging people unsafely unless we have made that impact assessment before we move to a different work pattern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we all share the concern that discharge should be as safe as possible. That is one reason why we have given such careful thought to the ideas that noble Lords put forward. I assure the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that we will certainly consult local authorities on any further changes and take advice, as we have done before.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para0"></a>I am conscious that the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, knows more about good practice in social services than does any other Member of the House. She has rightly spoken about the need for proper workforce assessment and planning to determine the impact. Many professions are changing the way they work. Social services have already done so. The changes that we are proposing will be a natural development from where social services are at the moment, taking into account where they want to be in the future. I hope that in time the changes will be positively welcomed in the modernisation of the profession.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 35A to Lords Amendment No. 35.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para6"></a>Subsection (4), which Amendment No. 35A removes, would delay the coming into effect of the part of the Bill that deals with delayed discharge payments until 30 days after the Secretary of State has determined that there are sufficient incentives within the system to prevent the NHS from discharging patients too early. Noble Lords will know that we had some problems with the amendment, because it does not fit with the main structure of the Bill. However, I understand the concerns of noble Lords, and the noble Baroness, who has been particularly concerned with this, that we have over-focused on social services and that there should be an explicit fairness between them and the NHS so that patients are not discharged too early, with all the consequences that brings.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para7"></a>Noble Lords are right to want to ensure that discharge follows proper procedures and is safe. We certainly do. The existing Commission for Health Improvement has a remit to monitor quality and to ensure that trusts provide a high standard of care. Clearly, they would not provide that standard of care if they discharged patients too early. I referred earlier in the debate to the successor body to CHI, which will be more independent of the department and will have a remit to monitor and report on patient experience and behaviour. The noble Baroness was very concerned that we should get away from data and statistics to look at real people and real hospitals. That monitoring will clearly cover aspects such as the patient's journey through hospital and discharge to another care setting. Noble Lords will recall that older people's services are the subject of a forthcoming Audit Commission study.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para8"></a>The National Centre for Health Outcomes Development is working with the department on improving data on readmissions. In the light of what the noble Earl said in our previous debate, that is very good news. We will certainly keep noble Lords up to date on that. It will help us discern when readmissions are caused by bad discharge factors and not, for example, by the epidemiology of the area, the demography or the high rate of chronic illness.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para9"></a>However, in response to concerns that the NHS may have got off lightly, we need to emphasise that strategic health authorities have a particular role to play through their performance management, because readmission rates are a specific performance indicator and therefore also have a direct effect on waiting times and access targets, which are all used to determine a trust's star rating. It is not in the interests of a trust to discharge patients too early and risk their being readmitted, because the impact on a trust's star rating carries with it a real financial penalty for trusts, in that access to <P>


<a name="column_993"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 993</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>performance funds is limited to high-performing trusts. So, a trust with a high rate of readmissions risks losing access to extra funding and freedoms. A core discharge policy that led to readmissions could also lead to a trust failing its clinical audit.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para10"></a>Thirdly, the impact that high numbers of readmissions will have on the hospital's capacity acts as a disincentive to discharging patients too soon. If hospitals need to treat the same patient twice because they have come back as an emergency admission, they will have less capacity to treat patients on waiting lists. We are talking about enlightened self-interest as well as proper performance management.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para11"></a>It is essential to ensure that the system that we put in place is fair to patients and to social services and does not have any unintended consequences, such as causing a riot and readmissions. I believe that we have robust systems in place to prevent that occurring. Noble Lords will remember the commitment I made in our earlier discussion on Amendment No. 23, that we will issue guidance requiring social services to review the care package within two weeks of an older person returning to their home from hospital. This review will take place earlier if that person is particularly frail or vulnerable or living alone, which means that any problems can be picked up. As I said, this guidance will be issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. Councils will be under a duty to follow it.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para12"></a>The three-month period between October and December when reimbursement operates in shadow form also provides extra time for the NHS and social services to ensure that the new systems introduced by the Bill function properly and to make any necessary changes. I believe that the monitoring that will be carried out by the new inspection bodies, the two-week review of the care package, the period of shadow operating and the existing incentives on trusts to perform well are powerful enough to prevent the NHS from trying to cut corners in its discharge practice and will ensure that patients are protected when reimbursement is introduced.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para13"></a>This may be the last time that I shall speak with, as it were, any freedom on the Bill, so I conclude by saying that I am grateful to all noble Lords who have informed and illuminated the Bill and its impact on people leaving hospital in a vulnerable condition. It has been a robust but extremely positive and constructive debate. We are all agreed that the Bill is the better for it and it sends a strong powerful signal to those implementing the Bill that Parliament is fully behind it.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para14"></a>I also pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath who carried the Bill through four-fifths of its passage and responded with his usual commitment and intelligence&#151;and slight scepticism at times&#151;but always in good heart. At the end of the day there is absolutely no distance between us. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, we have the common interest of the individual patient at heart. We very much hope that this Bill will make a material difference to their prospects when they leave hospital.

<P>

<a name="30327-22_para16"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the noble Baroness will know that one of our objections to the Bill&#151;and she has implied this in her remarks&#151;is its one-sidedness. There is a yawning absence in it of any financial incentives and penalties which would bear down on the NHS in a manner commensurate with those bearing down on local authorities. I do not believe that it was an unreasonable expectation on our part that it should have been a more balanced affair than it is. This indeed was the impression conveyed by the Secretary of State when the Government's policy was originally announced. Without such a balance, the risk is that there will be nothing to deter hospitals from discharging patients too early or from rushing through the discharge procedure with excessive speed.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para17"></a>I believe that that is a very real worry. We are not convinced that the gradual introduction of financial flows over the next few years will represent an adequate counterbalance to the measures contained in the Bill, and certainly not for a considerable time. Nevertheless, I do not think that any purpose would be served by sending the amendment back to another place today. I say that partly because of the concessions which the noble Baroness has already made on the issue of monitoring. I was glad to hear what she had to say on that topic. I cannot stress too strongly that it will be the monitoring of how the Bill works in practice that will be of most value in informing and shaping future hospital practice.
<P>

<a name="30327-22_para18"></a>That is not to say that ex post facto monitoring is as powerful a determinate of behaviour as financial incentives. We could have hoped for such incentives to be in place from the outset. Alas, they will not be. Nevertheless, I think we have some powerful substitutes in the work that will be done by CHI and its successor.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>something she said. She talked about the reassessment happening within two weeks of discharge from hospital.

<P>

<a name="30327-23_para0"></a>I was being flippant earlier on, but actually I believe that is one of the most important parts of the Bill. It is its underpinning and the determination of whether it works in the best interests of older people. I am extremely serious.

In the event of the insolvency of an insurer funding periodical payments, new Section 4, inserted in the Damages Act 1996 by Clause 93, provides that the claimant's payments are fully protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. In order to receive compensation under the scheme, it may be necessary for the claimant to assign his or her right to the payment to the scheme manager.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 46, line 3, leave out from beginning to end of line 42 on page 47.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para26"></a><P>

<a name="30327-23_para27"></a>The noble Lord said: We now move to a very important debate on periodical payments. As I mentioned, they are much welcomed by a range of bodies, including the National Health Service Litigation Authority, the Medical Defence Union, the Medical Protection Society, the Association of British Insurers, the International Underwriting Association and various other bodies representing claimants and defendants.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para28"></a>That is the general welcome. The concern is that there is provision in the Bill for the structured settlement, involving a series of periodical payments, to be reviewed. That appears to be an open-ended situation. If the provision were implemented, there would be genuine concerns that the concept of reviewability would cause more litigation and endless uncertainty. I know that many people involved in work for and on behalf of people with disability believe that that could put claimants under constant scrutiny and that there would be financial instability for defendants, whether they were government departments, the National Health Service or insurers and re-insurers and their policy holders. There is a belief that it could be a fatal flaw.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para29"></a>One of the points made by the Minister that received a warm welcome was that she foresaw the widespread use of periodical payments. I agree that lump sums are unsatisfactory. To some extent, they place huge pressure on the people least able to cope. The Minister added that she did not want the reviewability provisions to jeopardise the new concept. I could not agree more. If the Bill is to allow reviewability in the way presently outlined, some provision must be inserted to restrict its use. The provision for review could pursue the adversarial system for the rest of a claimant's life and impose undue burdens on defendants. In certain cases, insurers might feel that a programme of surveillance was justified, to make sure that the claimant used the funds appropriately.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para30"></a>Several other issues arise from this group of amendments. I realise that it is not a matter for the Minister, but I must point out that seven amendments in my name have been grouped. I know that we are anxious to make progress on the Bill, but we will need <P>


<a name="column_998"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 998</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time on Report to go into the matters in further detail. I want to hear what the Minister has to say about the amendments before deciding which issues to take forward in a wider debate.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para31"></a>Amendment No. 140ZC would leave out the provision for reviewability. Amendment No. 140C would lay it down clearly that, for reviewability to be allowed, it would have to be envisaged in the original court order that that variation would take place at some stage. The amendment would insert the following words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provided that the original court order for periodical payments expressly permits a party to apply to a court for variation in those circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para32"></a><P>

<a name="30327-23_para33"></a>Amendment No. 141ZA is in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, but I have tabled Amendment No. 141ZB, which is a similar amendment. It is a rather lengthy provision, but it would allow variation only if there had been serious deterioration or a substantial improvement. The change would have to be of some magnitude for variation even to kick in at any stage. I shall come back to Amendment No. 141A.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para34"></a>Amendment No. 141AA would delete the provision whereby the Lord Chancellor could take steps, even if those steps would be better taken by the civil justice rules committee. Amendment No. 141AB would omit lines 27 and 28 from page 46&#151;the Henry VIII provision&#151;which would leave out the opportunity for an order to be brought forward in any way that would amend the enactment. There is another amendment that would delete the words "or amend". Subsection (4) reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An order under this section may apply (with or without modification) or amend an enactment about provisional further damages".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para35"></a>
That would create a tremendous uncertainty because it allows anything to be enacted.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para36"></a>Amendment No. 141C seeks to ensure widespread consultation. I do not want to descend into a debate on whether the wording should be "may" or "shall", but I hope that the Minister realises the imperative of consultation. Amendment No. 141D would leave out the opportunity for the Lord Chancellor to consult with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such persons as he thinks appropriate",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para37"></a>
but to consult,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as widely as is reasonable in the circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para38"></a>
Perhaps that gives the noble Baroness an opportunity to comment on the extent of the consultation envisaged.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para39"></a>Amendment No. 141E is an important amendment which seeks to ensure that these provisions are not retrospective. Before dealing with Amendments Nos. 141EA and 148A, I shall pause to spend a moment considering retrospection.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para40"></a>The effect of uncertainty cannot be underestimated. Looking back over recent years, there have been many examples of the stockpiling of claims that are awaiting decisions on levels of damages, multipliers, interest rates and now costs. There are also many examples of the backdating of increases in damages and costs. Therefore, there are real concerns that the provision <P>


<a name="column_999"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 999</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for possible retrospective effect would create a serious problem for all those involved in structured settlements.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para41"></a>To give an example: at the moment there are a number of structured settlements being entered into. That is being encouraged. They are being entered into with the consent of the parties. Will they be entered into when the parties to them realise that now these provisions could be retrospective? The structured settlement into which they are entering could be changed at some stage and reviewability imposed on an already existing agreement that does not allow for it. On the face of the Bill that would be possible. Any comments from the Minister would be much appreciated. Otherwise, I fear that we may see a sudden full stop to the evolution of structured settlements.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para42"></a>That demonstrates the dangers of variation. Although I spoke about the need to restrict the provision, I still return to the fact that most people to whom I have spoken outside this House regard the possibility of variation as a very serious flaw&#151;perhaps even a fundamental flaw&#151;in the development of structured settlements. It is a serious worry.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para43"></a>It is a worry not only to insurers, reinsurers and claimants, but I know that it is a particular worry to the National Health Service. I recall a very effective speech today made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff. She pointed out that the provision now for the National health Service has been increased so that the anticipated claims for clinical negligence now stand at £5.25 billion. That is an appalling figure. Of course, it takes into account the likelihood of settlement of all claims as determined by actuaries. But in 12 months the total liability has increased by £850 million.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para44"></a>One reason why it has increased so substantially is that there have been a number of retrospective changes to the law which have resulted in damages awards being revisited and increased substantially. As the noble Baroness pointed out, the total of £5.25 billion is not to be paid out in any one year. The actual sum paid out during the 2001&#150;02 financial year amounted to £446 million. But that, in itself, was £31 million more than the amount paid in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para45"></a>Aside from the NHS Litigation Authority, which has made its views very clear, the two main organisations here are the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society. The MDU has made a strong case against reviewability which includes some of the points I have already made: lack of finality and certainty; difficulty in defining the circumstances that might give rise to review, in particular for the defendant; causation&#151;to which I shall return in a moment; costs; the wishes of the parties and retrospective costs.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para46"></a>Causation is an interesting point. If a structured settlement is reached, but is open to review, in many medical negligence cases or cases involving allegations of medical negligence, it will be necessary to determine the extent to which a change in circumstances is related <P>


<a name="column_1000"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1000</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the negligent act rather than, for example, the effects of an illness, old age or another reason unrelated to the original negligence. That would require revisiting the whole problem. I can well understand why the Medical Defence Union is so concerned about this aspect.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para47"></a>The Medical Protection Society has also demonstrated a point made by a whole range of defendants; namely, that the society needs to be able to close its books, as do insurers and reinsurers. Reviewability will create a continuing uncertain liability that would be extremely difficult to manage. For example, the bodies would need to increase their reserves to meet the possibility of an order for increased payments demanded, say, 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years after the initial settlement. Furthermore, the MPS has pointed out that, as a mutual organisation, it collects from its members the subscriptions needed to meet expected liabilities. The introduction of reviewable settlements introduces a huge degree of uncertainty about those future liabilities.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para48"></a>In many cases of clinical negligence a claim that reaches court may well relate to what had happened years earlier. However, the MPS provides indemnity on an occurrence basis; that is, provided that the doctor was in MPS membership at the time of the incident giving rise to the claim, he or she can apply for assistance even if they ceased to be a member long before the claim is made. So the introduction of rules applying to new claims is retrospective from the society's point of view because they apply to past subscription years. The society also makes the point that I have already put forward concerning claimants being spied on.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para49"></a>I shall end on the most serious point of all. Reviewability may inhibit rehabilitation. I believe that there is now a widespread consensus that what is most important in such claims is to ensure that, where appropriate, everyone's efforts concentrate on helping the individual to secure an early and prompt return to work or, in other circumstances, to an early and prompt return to the community. Later we shall address the question of future medical care, but surely the emphasis in all these structured settlements&#151;we wish them well because a system of periodical payments is far better than the old lump sum damages system&#151;should be that the interests of the claimant, the victim, are paramount.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para50"></a>Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, those involved with organisations promoting disability rights feel strongly that in all this, the central focus must be placed on getting an individual back into the work and back into the community. They fear that reviewability may well inhibit the process. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-23_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 141ZA, 141A and 141B in this group. This is part of a very important group of amendments. Clause 92 is probably the most controversial clause outside the provisions relating to the administration of the magistrates' courts. It certainly caused great concern to the insurance bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the Medical Protection Society.
<P>


<a name="column_1001"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1001</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para51"></a>The right to re-open a claim for damages in very limited circumstances has existed for several years by virtue of Section 32A of the Supreme Court Act 1991, which was introduced by a later amendment. Basically, that provides that the original damages may be awarded on a provisional basis in very limited circumstances. Amendment No. 141ZA brings the restrictions on claiming provisional damages into the definition of the circumstances in which it will be possible to re-open an award which has taken the form of periodical payments.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para52"></a>What has to be shown before an order can be made is that in the original case it was proved or admitted that there was a chance at some definite or indefinite time in the future that the injured person would develop, as a result of the act or omission which gave rise to the cause of action, some serious disease or suffer some serious deterioration in his or her physical or mental condition and the court assessed the provisional damages on the assumption that the injured person would not develop the disease or suffer deterioration in his or her condition. That simply transposes those restrictions into periodical payments.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para53"></a>A right to re-open a case in those limited circumstances, whether it be provisional damages or periodical payments, seems justifiable. There are clearly cases where a condition may develop and there may be a serious deterioration in the condition, but it is simply impossible at the time of the hearing to determine. In the past, before it was possible to claim provisional damages, it led to the case being delayed as long as possible so it was possible to ascertain as accurately as may be done, whether the condition was likely to develop or not. Introducing provisional damages has made it unnecessary to delay the case in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para54"></a>There are cases where the damages cannot be easily assessed until a future date when it becomes clearer whether a condition will develop. If the court was forced to come to a final view at the original trial it might award a great deal too much in damages or a great deal too little. I entirely accept that in such circumstances a power of variation is needed both as regards provisional damages and periodical payments. I also believe that these are rare circumstances. I understand that few orders have been made for provisional damages.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para55"></a>Therefore, I agree with most, but not all, of what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said. The issue on which I disagree is retrospectivity. From what I have said it is obvious that I do not agree that there should be no power of variation, but it should be at a limited level on the basis of the provisional damages limitation.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para56"></a>Amendment No. 141ZA would restrict variation to cases where the court, when making the original order, has expressly allowed the claimant to come back for further damages at a later date.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para57"></a>There are a number of reasons for this. First, if there were to be a general right to come back for damages, it would be likely to add substantially to the cost of insurance. It would also mean, for example, that <P>


<a name="column_1002"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1002</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>medical records relating to any case where the claimant had been awarded damages&#151;or periodical payments&#151;would have to be kept for decades just in case further actions arose.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para58"></a>Despite that, if I thought that, in general, it would be for the benefit of claimants if they were allowed to reopen claims at a later date because of some change in their condition, I would support a general right. However, there is clear evidence&#151;referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff&#151;to show that a general right to reopen a claim for damages would not be in the interests of most claimants because of the importance of closure and the importance of the claimant, having received damages, being able to get on with his or her life.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para59"></a>Under proposed new Section 2B(1) of the Damages Act the Lord Chancellor may allow a variation of an order to be made in any circumstances that he specifies. As I understand it, the Government intend, at any rate initially, to restrict the circumstances in which an order for periodical payments could be reopened. But that would leave the power, which could be exercised by some future Lord Chancellor, to give a general right to reopen cases. I believe that that is inappropriate. Certainty is of great importance here. It is plainly undesirable that insurers should be faced with the risk that, at some time in the future, the Lord Chancellor might return to this legislation and widen the circumstances in which a variation could be made. I believe that we should place the same limits on the variation of periodical payments as apply in primary legislation to the variation of the order for provisional damages.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para60"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 141A. It is largely consequential on Amendment No. 141ZA. It seeks to remove paragraph (b) in proposed new Section 2B(3) of the Damages Act 1996. It would remove the provision under new Section 2B(3) that an order may make provision,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which has effect irrespective of the conditions or other terms of the court's order or of the agreement".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para61"></a>
That wording is extremely wide. It is highly undesirable to allow existing orders or agreements to be overridden. That should not be allowed to happen. It is not clear, frankly, what is the purpose of new Section 2B(3)(b). It also appears to be in some conflict with the provision in new Section 2B(2)(b), which allows the courts to reopen a structured settlement only if the agreement for settlement expressly allows that to happen. Will the Minister explain in what circumstances the provision in new Section 2B(3)(b) can be used. It may have some legitimate purpose; but, if so, I believe that it could be contained in a narrower set of words.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para62"></a>I have also tabled Amendment No. 141B in this group. Its effect would be to remove the words "or amend" from subsection (4) of proposed new Section 2B. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, referred to that. The subsection states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An order under this section may apply (with or without modification) or amend an enactment about provisional or further damages".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-23_para63"></a><P>


<a name="column_1003"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1003</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
While it may be appropriate to allow consequential amendments, the power appears to go a long way beyond consequential amendments. It could be used to alter the existing primary legislation about provisional damages so as to extend the circumstances in which provisional damages could be awarded. That is a matter we have not discussed and will not discuss. It is highly undesirable that it should be possible to introduce the power by secondary legislation even if, as is provided by subsection (6), it has to be by the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para64"></a>Finally, I refer briefly to the issue of retrospectivity. I am unable to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on this part of his argument. There is already a power to award provisional damages. Where there is a power to award provisional damages by definition there must be a power to reopen that award; otherwise the damages would not be provisional. I cannot understand any real difference of principle which would require us to refuse to allow an order for periodical payments to be varied in circumstances where, if the order had been made for provisional damages, it could have been varied. I do not believe that the matter would have the serious consequences suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt.
<P>

<a name="30327-23_para65"></a>Subject to that, I entirely agree with the noble Lord's views on the issue. Therefore, I am happy to support in general what he said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I have spoken to this group of amendments but perhaps I may add a couple of points and comment on matters raised.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, rightly highlights how damaging delays are for patients, in particular if that is on the premise that, "We'll see what is going to happen". I understand that for a small number there is an argument for an interim settlement followed by a rapid review. There is a danger that the patient will feel in a state almost of suspended animation from the time of the interim settlement until the review. The benefits are very small. On balance, unsettled issues for patients can be psychologically damaging.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para1"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said, uncertainty hangs over patients. It is like a sword of Damacles. Patients are terrified that they will be watched, with any recovery going against them. Uncertainty works against them in clinical care. Perhaps I may outline the reality of a patient currently going through litigation. Everyone is frightened of looking after him. The patient goes into hospital because he is ill or into another part of healthcare because he has something wrong with him and needs treatment. However, because there is ongoing litigation all clinicians are scared of dealing with the problem. It is a natural response. There is a huge tendency towards defensive medicine. Defensive medicine is not good medicine. With good medicine, one is always undertaking risk assessment and going for management which is of least risk and most benefit to the patient. But there are no absolutes. It is always a matter of professional judgment on behalf of the clinicians.
<P>


<a name="column_1004"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para2"></a>When one is being defensive in one's practice, that balance and clinical acuity is often impaired. I have seen patients who have gone back for repeated operations, offered to them in good will and with the best of intentions. They have been accepted by the patients in the false hope that they will be a magic answer to their problems but they have only compounded the problems. I had one patient in my care who was operated on 30 times. It all began when he was reoperated on when in the process of a complaint&#151;a litigation&#151;against someone from a previous operation. A downward spiral can occur in clinical care.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para3"></a>The other problem is rehabilitation. I declare an interest, because I run a chronic pain management programme for patients who have chronic intractable pain that has not responded to any interventions when all interventions and investigations have been exhausted. I know from first-hand experience that patients do not do well who undergo litigation and have not achieved closure. They are always worried that someone will say that it is all in their minds, as a way of getting out of financial or care liabilities. Such patients cannot move on in the rehabilitative process, and it becomes almost a waste of expensive resources in pursuing a rehabilitative programme when, psychologically, they and their families are not ready for it.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para4"></a>Such patients come under huge pressure from those around them, who love them. Everything that happens to them is blamed on the original problem. Whenever they get a headache or a backache, which we all get from time to time, it is blamed on the original problem. People tell them that it must be because of what happened to them, which reinforces their inability to rehabilitate and move on. To put it in simple words, it impairs their ability to look at the bits that still work well and maximise them, and to learn to live with the bits that are damaged.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para5"></a>For those reasons, and because of my genuine fear that the clinical care of these patients will be seriously compromised if it is known that they are in the process of litigation that may go on to be revisited, I do not believe that the process of review of structured periodical payments or any other type of settlement would do any patient a service. In fact, I fear that it would do patients a great disservice.

<A NAME="30327-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Unlike the noble Baroness and the two noble Lords who spoke before her, I cannot claim to have had any experience or expertise in the working of this matter. I retired from the Bar when I was 66, which was 28 years ago. However, as a parliamentarian who happens to be a lawyer, I like to see any legislation dealing with the administration of the law put into workable and simple phraseology and practice.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para6"></a>Amendment No. 140ZC would remove from the Bill a system that would cause delays and unnecessary confusion. Surely, the aim of obtaining necessary flexibility should be achieved in ways that do not cause delay. On page 46, in new Section 2B, under the <P>


<a name="column_1005"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1005</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>heading, "Variation of orders and settlements", we find a most elaborate scheme. The Lord Chancellor is given wide powers to cause variation without, it seems, much consultation on his part.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para7"></a>Under subsection (6) we find:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An order under this section . . .  shall be made by statutory instrument".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-24_para8"></a>
It cannot be made,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless the Lord Chancellor has consulted such persons as he thinks appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-24_para9"></a>
But who are they? Are they the parties to the action which perhaps took place long before? The order may not be made,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless a draft has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-24_para10"></a>
Of course it is right for Parliament to lay down what the law should be and endeavour to achieve justice, but it is extraordinary to suggest that the variation of an order should become the responsibility of Parliament, requiring that a draft be laid and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para11"></a>The provision goes into further complication when it states that the statutory instrument,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may include transitional, consequential or incidental provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-24_para12"></a>
We are anxious to achieve justice. Indeed, as I understand it, although it is so many years since I practised, the Supreme Court Act 1991 and the Damages Act 1996 have caused justice to be further obtained. However, I sympathise with the views put forward by my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral when he criticises the whole scheme of new Section 2B. I most earnestly hope that the noble Baroness, on behalf of the Government, will think twice about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I have just one small point. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, was speaking, as I understood it, in contemplation of the Lord Chancellor making an order with regard to a specific case. I certainly had not so read it. I had thought that this was a power to create categories of case in which the court can take that action. Perhaps the Minister will tell me whether I am right about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have so far spoken. A number of themes are clear. First, there is general assent to the need for periodical payments and for them to be robust. Secondly, there is total agreement that closure&#151;mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff&#151;for claimants who find themselves involved in this sort of litigation is absolutely critical. We hope that the way in which the Bill is currently phrased will enable such closure to take place, and the variation which is permitted within the Bill will not do violence to that principle. This group contains some very complex and detailed amendments and I want to do each of them justice. I think that they merit individual consideration.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para13"></a>These amendments, none of which is consequential on any other, all relate to the provisions in the Bill for the variation of periodical payments orders and settlements. Amendment No. 140ZC would remove Section 2B entirely. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will <P>


<a name="column_1006"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1006</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be surprised to hear that the Government cannot accept this amendment. The principal purpose of periodical payments is to meet as accurately as possible the actual needs of claimants as they arise. The provision of a power to allow scope for variation in defined circumstances is an important element in realising the full benefit of periodical payments. I say in passing that the comment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, was apposite.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para14"></a>Our recent consultation paper sought views on a number of options. The majority of respondents were in favour of some form of variation, with a significant number wanting something much wider that that which we are now proposing. However, I fully understand the views expressed by the insurance industry and medical defence organisations&#151;and their desire for certainty regarding their outstanding liabilities, which were fully outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. For that reason, we have adopted a cautious approach to variation.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para15"></a>As stated in the Explanatory Notes, the order will, as far as practicable, adopt the mechanism currently applying to claims for provisional damages. The circumstances in which further damages may be requested shall be set out in the initial order of the court and relate only to the individual claimant's medical condition attributable to the original accident.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para16"></a>There are two small but important differences when compared with provisional damages: the rules on variation will allow defendants to apply, and the circumstances will include both deterioration and improvements. Circumstances sufficient to justify a variation will have to amount to a significant change, which will keep minor disputes away from the courts.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para17"></a>Our intention is that the power to vary awards of periodical payments will be tightly drafted and carefully controlled&#151;including a requirement for the court's permission before any application can be made. Any future exercise of the Lord Chancellor's power to specify the circumstances in which an order can be varied would be subject to consultation and affirmative resolution by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para18"></a>Such a restricted system of variation should not require additional compensation over and above that already payable. Insurers are already providing for such eventualities&#151;usually by way of contingency payments&#151;but because the amount of the award has to be calculated at the time of the original order, that can involve estimates of future need that may not be accurate. I am sure that your Lordships have known of many such instances.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para19"></a>In some cases, claimants might not receive the compensation to which they are justly entitled, resulting in their needs not being met or having to be funded by the taxpayer. In other cases, defendants and insurers may make substantial and unnecessary payments for events that never occur. That is clearly the worst of both worlds.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para20"></a>In cases where there are real difficulties in assessing the likelihood of a claimant developing a particular medical condition or overcoming a medical disability at the time when the periodical payments order is <P>


<a name="column_1007"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1007</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made, a variable order can provide the best solution. The Government recognise that in the majority of cases a non-variable award is likely to be more appropriate. Many foreseeable changes can be built into an annuity&#151;and some are. The annuity can be used in a flexible way to reflect anticipated changes in the claimant's needs. There is no reason for that not to continue. The more creative that the insurance industry can be in providing flexible annuities to meet future change, the less likely that wider scope for variation will be needed. It will be less likely too that the order-making power will need to be used again.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para21"></a>I reassure the Committee that we have no plans to extend the scope of variation after the initial order. We want to see how the intended regime works. But that should not prevent us from keeping open the option of extending or limiting further the extent of variation in the light of experience and future developments in the insurance market, or making any minor adjustments should that prove necessary. I believe that an order-making power provides the flexibility to do so and is the best way of dealing with variation. The need for consultation and affirmative resolution will ensure that any future proposal&#151;and, as I have indicated, none is planned&#151;is subjected to rigorous scrutiny and debate. We believe that the greater use of periodical payments will have benefits not only for claimants but also for defendants and their insurers and that the power to vary is a necessary and important part of the new system.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para22"></a>I understand and have listened carefully to the anxieties expressed. I hope that now, as I respond to specific amendments in turn, I shall be able to allay those anxieties to noble Lords' satisfaction. Amendment No. 140C would limit the power to vary to circumstances where the original court order expressly permits it. We intend that the initial order will allow variation only where it is specifically provided for in the court order. This type of detail is more appropriate to the order-making power. We believe that it is unnecessary and unduly restrictive to include such a requirement in primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para23"></a>Amendments Nos. 141ZA and 141ZB limit the provisions that may be included by the Lord Chancellor in an order enabling the upward variation of a court order for periodical payments. The limits they would introduce are based on the wording of Section 32A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 relating to the courts' existing power to award provisional damages, but are considerably more restrictive. Section 32A permits provisional damages to be awarded where there is proved or admitted to be a chance that, at some definite or indefinite time in the future, the claimant will develop some serious disease or suffer some serious deterioration in their physical or mental condition as a result of the defendant's act or omission.
<P>

<a name="30327-24_para24"></a>The amendments would require proof or admission at the time of the original court order that the disease, deterioration, and, in the case of Amendment No. 141ZB, improvement, would occur.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his clarification. By restricting the scope of the order to circumstances where it was proved or admitted that the disease, deterioration or improvement in the claimant's condition would definitely occur rather than where there was a chance that it would occur the amendments would prevent our making the initial order in the terms we propose, which go no further than the provisional damages. If the noble Lord seeks to replicate the position in relation to provisional damage there is probably nothing between us.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para0"></a>Restricting the terms of variable periodical payments beyond those governing provisional damages would discourage their use and could force awards to be made by way of lump sums and provisional damages where variable periodical payments were more suitable. That is our worry. By preventing any future orders being made in different terms in the light of experience and future developments in the insurance market, the amendments would undermine the purpose of the order-making power. Not only would they prevent extensions to the scope for variation, they would also prevent any restriction that might be necessary.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para1"></a>Amendment No. 141A proposes the removal of the provision that allows an order for variation made by the Lord Chancellor under Section 2B(1) to have effect irrespective of the original terms and conditions of the court order or agreement. That provision is intended to ensure that the framework for the order-making power is wide enough to capture all possible eventualities for variation. Any such order would of course be subject to consultation and the affirmative resolution of Parliament under the terms of Section 2B(6).
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para2"></a>However, I recognise the concern outlined by noble Lords and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, about the provision. They fear that it could create unacceptably high levels of uncertainty, and the Government are therefore willing to accept the amendment. I hope that that gives the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, pleasure.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para3"></a>Amendment No. 141AA removes the provision enabling an order of the Lord Chancellor to make provision of a kind that could be made by civil procedure rules. The provision in the Bill is intended to provide greater flexibility, as it is likely that provisions relating to variation may contain elements of substantive law which would be more appropriate to an order than rules of court. There may also be occasions where it is more efficient to deal with a particular matter <P>


<a name="column_1009"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1009</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wholly by order rather than by rules. As noble Lords are aware, rules of court are subject to negative resolution by Parliament. If it is decided to implement any provision by way of an order, it will be subject to consultation and the greater scrutiny of affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 141AB and 141B would prevent an order for variation amending legislation governing provisional damages. Amendment No. 141AB would also prevent an order from applying such legislation. As we intend that the initial order for variation will operate on similar terms to that of provisional damages, it is clearly practical that an order should be able to apply the legislation that governs those damages. There is also the possibility that the courts may wish to award a lump sum by way of provisional damages in conjunction with a variable periodical payments order. If the power to amend provisional damages legislation was removed from the scope of the order-making power, any necessary amendments to ensure that the two regimes could operate in tandem would have to be made through primary legislation instead. That would be extremely cumbersome and inefficient. We believe that the most effective way to achieve compatibility is through the order-making power. That provision has, of course, been considered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which did not consider that the attention of the House needed to be drawn to it.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para5"></a>Amendment No. 141C raises a drafting point. The use of the word "may" in Section 2B(6)(b) is standard drafting and is not permissive but prescriptive. It is used elsewhere in the Bill. The Lord Chancellor will be required to consult before making an order under Section 2B(1). I hope that the noble Lord will agree that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para6"></a>The Bill requires the Lord Chancellor to consult,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such persons as he thinks appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-25_para7"></a>
The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, raised that issue in relation to Amendment No. 141D. He and the noble Lord, Lord Renton, asked about the people whom the Lord Chancellor was likely to consult. Consultation will include&#151;I hesitate to call them the usual suspects&#151;the legal profession, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, the Forum of Insurance Lawyers, the insurance industry, the Association of British Insurers, medical defence organisations, the National Health Service Litigation Authority, the judiciary, the Civil Justice Council, disability groups and other government departments. It will be available on the departmental website.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. She has now made it clear that, although it appears to me from the wording of the clause that the Lord Chancellor can require the courts to deal with cases on an individual basis, that is not the intention of it and that, therefore, there is no question of particular cases being dealt with by an order by the Lord Chancellor but merely dealt with by the powers given to the courts.

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1010</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para8"></a>That being so, and I suppose I must apologise for thinking that it could be meant the other way, I believe that between now and Report the Government should consider the wording of the clause in case other people imagine&#151;it is quite easy to interpret it as such&#151;that it gives power for action to be taken in individual cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hear and accept what the noble Lord says. However, I hope that during these debates in Committee we shall give those who come to construe the Bill in due course the kind of information that will enable them to be clear as to how these matters should properly be read. I hope that that will prove to be of assistance to them.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para9"></a>Amendment No. 141D would replace the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such persons as he thinks appropriate",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-25_para10"></a>
with the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as widely as is reasonable in the circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-25_para11"></a>
The wording used in the Bill is not intended to limit the scope of consultation. It will of course be important to seek the views of all those with an interest before any change is made. If Parliament is not satisfied with the degree of consultation in any particular instance, then it will be able to indicate that under the affirmative resolution procedure. Therefore, I believe that Amendment No. 141D adds nothing further to the existing provision.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para12"></a>Amendment No. 141E provides that an order for variation would apply only to claims arising after the date of the commencement of this section. Amendment No. 141EA has a similar effect but limits the application of an order further&#151;that is, to injuries which occur after the date of commencement. Although I recognise the general concerns of defendants and insurers on the "retrospective" effect of legislative change, the initial order will be no more than is provided for under the current system of provisional damages. I understand that those damages cause no difficulty at present.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para13"></a>In those circumstances, where it is known that there is a chance of medical deterioration in the future, compensation is now paid, one way or another, either as provisional damages or built into the award as a contingency payment. As I explained, this latter practice may well lead to overcompensation overall while leaving some people who need it undercompensated. Where the court makes a variable periodical payment order, insurers should be able to reserve or reinsure against that, as they do now with provisional damages orders.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para14"></a>If the provisions relating to the court's power to vary periodical payments applied only to claims arising or injuries occurring after the date of commencement, it could be several years before the provisions took effect. In the meantime, awards would continue to have to include provision for events which might never occur in cases where a variable order might be more appropriate. The precise transitional arrangements for the provisions regarding periodical payments have yet to be settled.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para15"></a>However, I can say now that the relevant clauses of the Bill will not apply to claims concluded by its implementation date. I hope that that statement will <P>


<a name="column_1011"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1011</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>give the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, the clarity and assurance that he needs in relation to this difficult and, I accept, testing issue.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para16"></a>While I understand the need for suitable insurance products to fund variable periodical payments, it is not practical to require the Lord Chancellor to be satisfied with all the arrangements that might be put forward by defendants before the provisions come into effect, as Amendment No. 148A would require. Under the intended terms of the initial order, the possibility of variation will be known at the time of the original court order. As I have said, insurers should be able to reserve or reinsure against that.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para17"></a>In addition, the court will have to be satisfied before making a periodical payments order that the continuity of the payments is reasonably secure. It would be open to the defendant to inform the court if the terms of an order would cause particular difficulties. In the event that a second order under the order-making power was considered, the need for different funding options would undoubtedly be taken into account and consulted upon. I therefore invite noble Lords not to press those amendments.
<P>

<a name="30327-25_para18"></a>I have tried to answer comprehensively, because these are difficult issues. There has been a lot of worry and concern among all parties about how they will operate, but I hope that there is now sufficient clarity for noble Lords to be comfortable that these are sound provisions that they can support.

I am particularly concerned that it is desirable in everybody's interests that the restrictions on the making of orders should be parallel with those in relation to provisional damages and that that should be on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   This has been a very important debate. We have spent over an hour productively. There have been some very important speeches. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, on her moving account of the serious problems that could be caused to rehabilitation. She gave us a practical insight into some of those difficulties. With great experience behind her words, that was of great benefit to the Committee. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, on his points. If he had not tabled the amendment to delete subsection (4), I would have done so. I therefore share his delight about the Minister's agreement to delete that subsection, although the noble Lord must take the credit.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Renton made an important point, although it was helpful to have the contribution of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, to put it in context. We shall have to consider further the <P>


<a name="column_1012"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>point raised by my noble friend. On the face of it, his interpretation of events looks reasonable, but I take the point of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, that that may not be the effect and we must look at the issue further. I thank my noble friend for his comments.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para1"></a>I praise the noble Baroness, who has given the Committee a meticulous and reassuring response. As she knows, there have been some serious concerns. Her statement in summing up this wide-ranging debate will give comfort to those who have had serious cause for concern. She did not answer all the points, but I welcome the wording that she has used, in particular the adoption of a cautious approach to variation, the circumstances that she has clearly set out and the way in which she has made clear that the relevant clauses will not apply to claims concluded by the implementation date of the Bill.
That series of matters is of enormous importance. We must now take time to examine carefully what the noble Baroness has said. I believe that I could summarise by saying that she has done much to reassure those who had cause for concern. It is now our task to set her words against the terminology of the Bill to ensure that it has the effect she seeks.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para2"></a>Sadly, rising stars do not stay in the same place for very long. I am sure that the noble Baroness, when she looks down on us from a new Cabinet position in the short time&#151;I suppose I must say&#151;left for the Government, she will understand that we must make sure that the legislation will apply to her successor of whichever colour. It may well occur that her successor does not share her views that it should be as restricted as she has announced, particularly in later form. I hope she will now give us an opportunity to think carefully about what she has said this evening, but we thank her for her reassuring words. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30327-26_para43"></a><P>

<a name="30327-26_para44"></a>The noble Baroness said: I hate to spoil the party after such a long run of amendments not moved or formally moved. I shall speak to an amendment for a change. Earlier in the Bill, some weeks ago, we debated the pilot schemes for fines enforcement that will be launched under Clause 31 and Schedule 2. Orders made under Clause 31(4) allow pilot schemes to be introduced in particular areas and, in relation to those areas, may modify Schedule 2 or any enactment in connection with its operation.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para45"></a>When the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform considered the matter, it said that it would accept that delegation was appropriate as would be the negative procedure. But it said that that would be in the context of Parliament approving the idea of pilot schemes as proposed in the Bill. The difficulty is that, when we debated those matters some weeks ago, noble Lords demonstrated significant concerns about the operation of the new pilot scheme. We share the Government's objective of trying to ensure that fines collection is far more effective and efficient than at present. But considerable concerns were expressed about the manner in which the Government intend that the new scheme should come into operation.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para46"></a>So the reason for tabling the amendment is to ask the Minister whether she has taken the opportunity in the intervening weeks since our last debate to reflect further on whether the negative procedure might be appropriate in this matter, and, if she has so reflected, to share her conclusions with the Committee. If she has not had the opportunity so to consider, will she undertake to do so before we reach the matter, as we surely shall, on Report? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As the noble Baroness explained in moving the amendment, it would make a modification to ensure that pilot schemes were subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para47"></a>We have given the matter careful thought, and we fully understand the interest in the details of the proposed arrangements that prompted the amendment. The enforcement measures are a radical departure from existing practice, and the Government believe that they should be thoroughly tested before implementation. There would be little merit in piloting the measures unless it were possible to change or even abandon elements of the package that did not work as intended. Pilots will be carried out immediately following Royal Assent, during late 2003 or early 2004, with the aim of introducing the fines collection scheme as soon as possible following evaluation.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para48"></a>The pilots will allow different elements of the scheme to be tested in different areas so that their effectiveness in improving the payment rate can be evaluated. For example, a discount for prompt payment and/or an increase for default may be piloted in one area; wheel clamping or registration of the debt as sanctions for defaulters may be piloted in another.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para49"></a>As the Bill stands, the Lord Chancellor may, once the pilot schemes have been evaluated, make an order under Clause 31(8) modifying Schedule 2 and associated legislation in the light of experience of the pilots. That final package, which may still be the whole scheme as presently envisaged or a modified scheme, would then be put to Parliament for approval under the affirmative resolution procedure before being rolled out nationally. That approach will enable the Government to bring forward a package of tried and tested measures that, we can be sure, will deliver the improvements in performance that the Committee will want to see.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para50"></a>Amendment No. 144 would make the piloting of the schemes, details such as which parts of the scheme were to be piloted in which area and any temporary change to enactments to allow the pilots to take place subject to affirmative resolution. The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform found that the power as a negative resolution had been appropriately delegated.
<P>

<a name="30327-26_para51"></a>The final package will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and that provides the necessary flexibility. I repeat that the Select Committee found that, in this instance, the negative resolution procedure was as appropriately delegated. We are not providing a blank cheque, and there is an opportunity to have a full and detailed debate on the details of the final scheme. We think that we have covered the concerns that the noble Baroness understandably raised in moving the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. It goes further than was possible when we covered the matters in a grouping on the operation of the pilot schemes.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para0"></a>I remind the Minister that the Select Committee put its approbation of the negative procedure in the context that it applied only if Parliament approved the pilot scheme, which we have not yet done. That is why I do not wish to take the matter further, even if I disagreed wholly with the Minister, which I do not.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para1"></a>I shall consider the Minister's explanation in the light of the discussions we shall have on Report. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 144A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 52, line 2, after "officers)" insert ", section 68 (power to amend legislation in connection with Criminal Procedure Rules) or section 75 (power to amend legislation in connection with Family Procedure Rules)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-27_para3"></a><P>

<a name="30327-27_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 144A, I shall speak to Amendment No. 145. Clauses 68 and 75 contain powers for the Government to amend legislation in connection with criminal and family rules respectively. At the moment, they are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Our view is that that is inadequate, and the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform agreed with that view in its second report, dated 11th December, 2002.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para5"></a>I simply tabled Amendment No. 144A in order to ask the Government when they intend meeting the commitment that they have already given on this matter to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#151;in their response to the Committee's report on the Bill at Annex 2 of the seventh report of the Committee&#151;and the commitment given by the Minister on 11th February at col. 658.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para6"></a>After hearing the commitment made by the Minister on that date, I eagerly awaited sight of a government amendment. However, naturally patient as I am in all matters, last week I gave up on patience and tabled my amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para7"></a>Earlier today the Minister was gracious enough to accept another amendment. I live in hope that she might accept this one. However, if she is unable to do so, I should love to know why the drafting is wrong and why the Government are to table an amendment at a later stage&#151;or, indeed, if they will bring one forward.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para8"></a>I shall speak briefly also to Amendment No. 145, grouped with Amendment No. 144A. I tabled this amendment in response to paragraph 17 of the Select Committee's report. We have debated at length the Government's plans to divide England and Wales into administrative areas to be known as local justice areas. That is dealt with in Clause 8.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para9"></a>Clause 97(4)(a) states that the first order under Clause 8 shall be laid before Parliament only. In other words, it is not subject to the affirmative or, indeed, the negative procedure. Subsequent orders under Clause 8 will be subject to the negative procedure, as set out in Clause 97(5). The reason for the Government doing that is that the first order,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will simply be renaming petty sessions areas as local justice areas and will not change any boundaries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-27_para10"></a><P>


<a name="column_1017"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
But, as the Committee points out, the power to make the first order is not limited in this way. The Committee goes on to state that it considers that unless it is so limited, there is no reason why the first order should not be subject to the same procedure as subsequent ones. I agree on that matter too. It is another case in which it is to be hoped that the Minister will say that she will accept the amendment or, indeed, return with a better drafted amendment. But how on earth one could draft something better than leaving out paragraph (a), I shall live and learn! I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Amendment No. 146 standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford and myself is also in this group. It deals with the statutory instruments made for the purpose of changing court fees. The existing position is that an order to vary fees must be laid before Parliament. It is not subject to any parliamentary scrutiny and it cannot be prayed against.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para11"></a>Clause 87, taken together with Clause 97(4) would keep the existing position. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee criticised this and recommended that a fees order should be subject to the negative procedure and so could be prayed against. In response to the Committee, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said in his letter:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "The Committee was also concerned about the scrutiny afforded to Clause 87, allowing the Lord Chancellor to set fees by order. I have carefully considered the views of the Committee and agree that it would be preferable that this clause be subject to negative resolution".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-27_para12"></a>
This amendment does exactly that. It takes the order under Clause 87 out of the list of orders referred to in Clause 97(4) which lists those amendments which are not subject to parliamentary procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para13"></a>Orders relating to fees under Clause 87 would then fall to be covered by Clause 97(5) which applies the negative resolution procedure to all statutory instruments not otherwise dealt with. As the Government have not put down their own amendment I hope that they will accept ours. I, too, support the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, in her Amendments Nos. 144A and 145.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that I shall make noble Lords happier, though I feel rather mean because I believe that my noble friend Lady Scotland should be doing so having toiled as long as she has today.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para14"></a>I shall work through each of the amendments in turn. Amendment No. 144A is similar to an amendment tabled earlier in Committee. On that occasion, I said to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;at col. 658 of the Official Report of 11th February 2003&#151;that it was the Government's intention to follow the recommendation of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform with regard to Clauses 68 and 75.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para15"></a>The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform reported that it was not satisfied that the Government had made the case for the negative <P>


<a name="column_1018"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1018</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>resolution procedure in those clauses. As a consequence, in January the Lord Chancellor responded to the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, stating that he accepted the recommendation and would consider an appropriate amendment to the clause.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para16"></a>I want to reassure noble Lords once again that this remains the Government's intention. We shall bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Report addressing the issue. The amendment will provide that any order made under these clauses to amend or repeal primary legislation would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para17"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 145 would be to make the first order made under Clause 8 setting up local justice areas subject to the negative resolution procedure. We are grateful to noble Lords for raising the matter. If the amendment has been prompted by concerns that the Lord Chancellor would radically alter local boundaries when making the first order under Clause 8, then the amendment is unnecessary. I can assure noble Lords once again that the boundaries of local justice areas will be the same as those of petty session areas when the new arrangements set out in the Bill come into operation.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para18"></a>As I said during our debate on Amendment No. 35, we shall spell this out in the transitional provisions of the Bill to be introduced as a government amendment. Current petty session area boundaries are of course subject to changes made by magistrates' courts committees using the existing procedures. In our view it is not necessary to make the first order under Clause 8 subject to any parliamentary procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para19"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 146. Its effect would be to make orders under Clause 87 subject to the negative resolution procedure. The current, separate fee-setting powers for each of the three tiers of courts are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny and Clause 87 sought to replicate that position. However, following the reports of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform and the Human Rights Select Committee, along with the views wisely expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his remarks at Second Reading, the Lord Chancellor has considered the matter again and has determined that it would be preferable if this clause was subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para20"></a>While the Government agree with the principle behind the noble Lord's amendment, I am afraid that, as currently drafted, it is technically deficient. On page 52 of the Bill, the word "or" should be inserted at the end of line 6, while the word "or" should be deleted at the end of line 8, in addition to the noble Lord's proposal to omit paragraph (c) in line 9.
<P>

<a name="30327-27_para21"></a>I can confirm that the Government intend to bring forward an amendment on Report to achieve the same effect and I therefore invite the noble Lord not to press his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   We wait with bated breath to see what superior drafting the Government bring forward, but we welcome the commitments just <P>


<a name="column_1019"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>made by the Minister. However, I am little concerned with regard to his response to Amendment No. 145 when he spoke of the government amendment being part of a package of transitional provisions. Naturally we shall want to look at that to ensure that it properly covers the point. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) An order under subsection (3) shall not be made until a draft has been laid before both Houses of Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-28_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall, with the leave of the Committee, speak to Amendment No. 148 and also to Clause 98 stand part. I appreciate that I shall take a little longer than is usually the case when moving amendments, but I thought it appropriate to group these together and, it is hoped, knock the matter on the head today rather than take up time on Report. I hope to reach a position where I shall not need to return to this matter at the next stage.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para2"></a>I tabled Amendment No. 147 because I was concerned that the Government thought that the negative procedure would be appropriate for future amendments to primary legislation in connection with the Bill. It is important that changes to primary legislation are made by affirmative order. I have raised these matters in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, during our previous debates on the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill. I have not done so within the context of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para3"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee points out that Clause 98 enables the Lord Chancellor to lay orders to make any supplementary, incidental or consequential provision and any transitory, transitional or saving provision which he believes is necessary or expedient for the purposes of, in consequence of, or for giving full effect to any provision of the Bill. That includes the power to amend or repeal primary legislation. But these orders are only subject to the negative procedure. So the committee's conclusion is that in view of the fact that orders under that section may amend or repeal primary legislation, the Committee may wish to consider whether the negative procedure under this section is justified.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para4"></a>I have concerns overall about Henry VIII clauses. I was very intrigued to note the suggestion of the chairman of the Select Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, in the debate on 14th January.

He went on to raise the question of whether there should be sunset clauses on such matters.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para6"></a>My questions relate to issues which arose from that debate. I begin with the last first, which is the matter of sunset clauses. I appreciate that the delegated powers committee has a further special report on such clauses, which would be valuable. I ask the Minister to undertake that the Lord Chancellor's Department reviews very carefully the use of sunset clauses and how it might concentrate the minds of Ministers as regards the proper drafting of Bills. As ever, I do not point the finger of blame at those who physically draft the Bills. They are at the mercy of Ministers who change their minds at the last minute, sometimes with good reason, but sometimes not. Has the Lord Chancellor's Department any intention to review the possible good uses of sunset clauses?
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para7"></a>I have two specific questions which relate to the issues raised by the scrutiny committee. The first is as regards the presumption in favour of the affirmative procedure. The committee recommended this. As regards this Bill, it said at that stage that if the Government choose the negative procedure they should give their reasons in full before departing from the affirmative procedure and the Explanatory Notes. Why should these notes precede the comments of a Select Committee?
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para8"></a>The question is whether in future the Lord Chancellor's Department will be of good behaviour or be bound over, so to speak. However, I understand now from Europe that we are not allowed to say that. I shall be a recidivist and keep to the old wording for the time being. Could the Government give an assurance that the LCD will follow the committee's recommendation on that matter?
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para9"></a>As regards the wording of such clauses, the committee accepted that they could not always follow a standard form, but it was persuaded that when the Government drafted the Explanatory Notes they should offer an explanation of the reasons why a particular form of wording has been used in each case for a Henry VIII clause. Will the Lord Chancellor's Department follow that procedure in future if there is another blockbuster Bill or a teeny-weeny one? I hope that it is going to follow good practice on that. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30327-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We are grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling this amendment, which raises wider issues surrounding delegated powers contained in legislation of which the Government are well aware. The Government are keen to take seriously the views of all those with an interest in powers of this nature, particularly those of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Indeed, the report of the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, published on 11th December last year was welcomed by the Lord Chancellor in his letter of 6th January. We agreed to address all of the committee's concerns. We have given <P>


<a name="column_1021"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1021</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that undertaking. As I am sure the Committee is aware, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, in its special report on delegated powers, recommended a,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"presumption in favour of the affirmative procedure",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-28_para10"></a>
for such powers. My noble and learned friend Lord Williams, in response to the report, expressed the view that each case should be looked at individually; and, in this case, we agree that amendments to primary legislation should be subject to the affirmative procedure. To this end, we intend to bring forward a government amendment which will subject all orders by the Lord Chancellor amending primary legislation under Clause 98 to the affirmative resolution procedure. It would clearly not be sensible to subject amendments to statutory instruments to the affirmative resolution procedure. I am sure that that is not the intention of the noble Baroness, although it would be the result were the amendment to be accepted.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para11"></a>Amendment No. 148 proposes that orders made by the Lord Chancellor for supplementary, consequential and transitional provisions be limited to a period of three years following the passing of the Act.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para12"></a>I do not think that we can be quite so accommodating on this amendment as on the previous one. The provision under Clause 98, as I am sure the noble Baroness will be aware, is necessary for a number of reasons. Given the scale of the consequential amendments necessitated by the Bill, we believe that a clause of this nature is unavoidable. It is impossible to know which other Bills in the current parliamentary Session will receive Royal Assent before the Courts Bill. This could mean that Bills containing, for example, references to petty sessions areas could be enacted before provisions in the Courts Bill, requiring a consequential amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para13"></a>We believe, therefore, that imposing an arbitrary time limit on this provision could impair the effectiveness of the Bill. It is, unfortunately, impossible to ensure that all references to petty sessions areas, for example, are dealt with before the expiry of, say, a three-year period. Noble Lords may be amazed to learn that we have identified some 1,025 different references to petty sessions in primary and secondary legislation, all of which would need to be dealt with, whether by the Bill or by orders made under it. It is not simply a matter of substituting one phrase for another in every case. Some legislation dates back to the 19th century and is not easy to amend. As your Lordships can imagine, guaranteeing that we covered every single reference would be something of a major exercise, and, were one to be identified at a later stage, the amendment would mean that a suitable opportunity would have to be found to amend the relevant statute by primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para14"></a>I would, however, like to reassure the noble Baroness that the scope of this order-making power is limited and will be used only to make minor supplementary, incidental or consequential amendments or transitional provisions. It is our intention to be specific in using the power. It would not be possible for an order made under this clause to make amendments to legislation introducing new policy.

<a name="30327-28_para15"></a>In addition, as it is our intention to make orders which amend primary legislation subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, this House will have the opportunity to debate any such amendments whenever made. I hope that that reassurance and the explanation I have given go some way towards satisfying the noble Baroness and that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-28_para16"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the Lord Chancellor would keep these matters under review. Yes, of course, the Lord Chancellor will keep all the matters relating to sunset clauses and so on under very careful review.

<P>

<a name="30327-29_para7"></a>My amendment does not affect the question of whether anyone shall continue to hold a relevant office after the age of 75 because it refers throughout to former holders of office.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para8"></a>So when one strips it down, one comes to this position: if the amendment is agreed, we shall restore the position to that which existed when I ceased to be Master of the Rolls in 1992 whereby, when pressed for judicial manpower, it is open to the Master of the Rolls to invite those who have retired, usually recently retired or who have been appearing recently as members of the court, to assist on a daily basis.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para9"></a>The great saving grace of that system was that particular retired lords justices could not arrive suddenly and say, "Now I should like to sit" if the Master of the Rolls had grave doubts about whether age had overtaken their usual faculties. So there was no problem about that. In my experience I thought it right&#151;no one has ever suggested that I was wrong in this respect at least&#151;to invite Sir John Megaw and Sir David Cairns to sit from time to time, often at very short notice (a matter of hours) in the Court of Appeal. I gave up inviting them when they each reached the age of 84, not because they were not as bright as buttons (if I may use the expression) but because they themselves felt that perhaps the age of 84 might create some criticism if anyone ever discovered it. No one ever did discover it because it was certainly not apparent from the way in which they framed judgments and so on. That is what I suggest, but it is a matter not for me but for the Master of the Rolls, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips. When I spoke to him on this matter, he said that he was in favour, as he is very pressed indeed.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para10"></a>I hope that the amendment commends itself to the Minister. I should make it clear that, prima facie, I have a considerable interest in this matter because it would enable me to sit as a member of the judicial member of the Privy Council and as a Member of this House judicially, which I have never done. I could also go back to the Court of Appeal. However, let me make it clear that wild horses&#151;including the Master of the Rolls&#151;will not drag me back. When one has not done that kind of thing for 10 years, the strain of doing it again would be overwhelming. The amendment intends to enable those who have recently retired to be brought in and to help out. If they have kept their skill up, those of a considerably greater age might be invited to come back. But that is a matter for the Master of the Rolls, not for me.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para11"></a>Having declared my interest and negatived that interest, I beg to move.

<A NAME="30327-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I commend the noble and learned Lord for introducing the amendment. It is not surprising that a number of people in this House are not keen on compulsory retirement ages. I commend the noble and <P>


<a name="column_1024"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1024</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learned Lord for striking a blow at compulsory retirement ages. For example, the age of 60 for civil servants is absurdly young.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para12"></a>On the other hand, of course&#151;and I am sure that the noble and learned Lord will agree with me, although I have not discussed it with him&#151;there is a particular justification for a compulsory retirement age for High Court judges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I did, I hope, make it clear that I was not striking blows in relation to retirement ages. I referred only to post-retirement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am not sure that I have fully understood the difference. If the noble and learned Lord intervenes in the course of my remarks, I shall happily give way to him.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para13"></a>I believe that he will agree with me that there is a particular justification for the existence of a compulsory retirement age for High Court judges, which has existed since 1959. They enjoy a substantial security of tenure, which is justified in its turn by the constitutional imperative to ensure the independence of the judiciary. High Court judges, as all your Lordships know, may be dismissed only by a vote of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para14"></a>The difficulty before a compulsory retirement age was introduced was that, inevitably, some judges who did not appreciate their declining abilities stayed in their posts for too long. Professor Robert Stevens was, until recently, the Master of Pembroke College, Oxford. After delving into the records of the Lord Chancellor's Department, he wrote of the very great difficulties that successive Lord Chancellors and their Permanent Secretaries have had when struggling to ease out judges who were past their prime.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para15"></a>The late Lord Denning referred in his memoirs to a High Court judge in the 1950s who was strongly criticised by the Court of Appeal for his unusually extensive questioning of counsel. The then Lord Chancellor arranged for the judge to continue to sit for a little while and then to resign, which he did a few months later.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para16"></a>The extension of the service of a judge for a certain period, after the compulsory retirement age of 70, depends no doubt on careful consideration by the Lord Chancellor's Department in consultation with senior judges. If a judge is asked to continue to sit as a judge until he is, let us say, 75, his sitting does not depend on the decision of the judge himself; it is of course a request that is periodically renewed by the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para17"></a>However&#151;I mention this because it was the view of the Peel Commission, in 1936&#151;there is at least a theoretical risk that the power to extend a judge's judicial life may be used as a means of control over judges. He will get the opportunity, he may think, to continue to be asked to sit only if he acts in a way that he thinks the authorities would approve of. In 1936, the Peel Commission&#151;on which some distinguished judges sat; it was chaired by a former member of the <P>


<a name="column_1025"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1025</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Cabinet, who I think was the first Earl Peel&#151;thought that any such power to give a conditional extension to a judge's judicial life was undesirable.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para18"></a>Unfortunately, the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, is not in his place. I have not discussed it with him, but he might say that the European Convention on Human Rights is not being complied with if judges can continue to sit on the say-so of the Lord Chancellor's Department or of particular heads of particular courts. That service can, of course, be discontinued. I have great sympathy with the flexibility of Amendment No. 149, but I wonder how it would fit with the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="30327-29_para19"></a>Although the noble and learned Lord himself referred principally to the example of the Master of the Rolls&#151;a position which he held, as we all know&#151;asking judges to continue to sit from time to time, his amendment is much wider than that and refers to other courts including, as he himself mentioned, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I myself see no reason why a judge beyond the age of 75&#151;into his eighties, if you like&#151;may not be perfectly fit. But I am not sure that I like the idea of judges being allowed to sit only on the say-so of senior judges or the Lord Chancellor's Department. I am not sure that I see that as fitting in with the principle of an independent judiciary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   Perhaps the noble Lord will accept it from me, first, as I said, that this amendment has nothing whatever to do with retirement; and, secondly, that the retirement age is not 70 for a large number of judges. Anyone appointed after 1993, I suppose&#151;I forget the exact date&#151;is subject to 70. Up to that date, the age is 75. As for the noble Lord's idea that any sort of pressure would be exerted on a retired Lord Justice because of the possibility that the Master of the Rolls might not wish to ask him back to the Court of Appeal, all I can say is that he can never have met them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   Of course the noble and learned Lord is absolutely right. However, it is a matter of perception. I can assure him that the Peel Commission, in the 1930s, was worried about that risk. He may also think that the European Convention on Human Rights is somewhat concerning in this respect.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, has instigated a very interesting debate. I am much struck by his argument that flexibility may be needed to call upon those who have great experience, and to do so at fairly short notice. However, there is a question that I must put to the Minister. If the Government feel that they cannot accede to the request of the noble and learned Lord&#151;if so, we would be interested to hear their reason&#151;can they give an assurance that sufficient numbers of the judiciary will be able to perform the necessary tasks? I note that there was recently a statutory instrument from the Lord Chancellor's Department to increase the number of judges by two. In response to my noble friend Lady Seccombe, the reason given concerned the huge <P>


<a name="column_1026"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1026</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increase in judicial review appeals regarding asylum. One can see greater volume arising in that way, so there may need to be not only greater flexibility but more full-time appointments. If the Minister cannot accede to the noble and learned Lord's request, one hopes that she will be able to assure the House that there will be sufficient numbers of the judiciary to perform the appropriate work.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para0"></a>I end by wishing the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, a happy 72nd birthday this month&#151;proving the noble and learned Lord's point that 70 is no bar to effective service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I have some sympathy with the amendment. One of the greatest 20th-century judges in the common law world, Oliver Wendell Holmes, was not appointed to the American Supreme Court until he was in his 60s. He continued to sit with no loss of skill until he was past 90. So there are cases where persons of advanced age can continue to add to the court.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para1"></a>I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, about the International Convention on Human Rights, but it has not been suggested that the present system&#151;by which former judges can be called upon to sit between their retirement age and 75&#151;contravenes the convention. I imagine that is because the selection of panel members is in the hands of other judges, not of the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Chancellor's Department.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, this has been an enlightening debate. I hope that your Lordships will not think that I am burdened by youth when I comment that having witnessed the performance of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, this evening, anyone who claims that one reaches one's prime before the age of 92, 93 or 94 might be much mistaken.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para2"></a>I understand entirely the purpose of the amendment so eloquently moved by the noble and learned Lord, who is right that the facility to invite skilled judges to sit when the need arises was much taken advantage of before 1993. I am not surprised by the noble and learned Lord's comments in relation to the acceptance by the current Master of the Rolls that it might be a tempting consideration.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para3"></a>I assure the noble Baroness that there are sufficient judges to meet current needs&#151;and the Lord Chancellor, as already demonstrated by a recent order, will take steps to enhance their number if further needs are identified. The Court of Appeal has made significant improvements in minimising delay and the momentum is being maintained through continued skilled management.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para4"></a>I recognise the noble and learned Lord's concerns in seeking to exempt former Lords of Appeal and Court of Appeal judges. I am also conscious that in passing the 1993 Act, Parliament sought to strike a delicate balance in sensitive constitutional territory. Earlier decisions may need reappraisal in light of developments. Your Lordships will know that a European Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in <P>


<a name="column_1027"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1027</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employment and occupation in terms that, it is believed, encompass the judiciary includes provisions to prevent discrimination on the basis of age. Domestic implementation is required by 2006 and careful consideration will be given to how the age provisions are to be implemented. The continuing relevance of the retirement regime established by the 1993 Act will form part of that consideration.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para5"></a>I believe therefore that it will be preferable to address age-related restrictions as a single exercise rather than through piecemeal changes to existing arrangements. Of course I bear in mind the historical references made by my noble friend Lord Borrie; the importance of preservation of independence and the need to give certainty. Those issues will have to be taken into account when these matters are reconsidered.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para6"></a>There is no way to diminish the qualities that continue to be displayed in abundance, as on this occasion, by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, and other noble Lords who left the 75-year mark behind a little time ago. I endorse everything the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said about the performance of my noble friend Lord Borrie. He is a mere youth and there is much to expect from him, as indeed there is from the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, whom I see in her place. I had the great pleasure of telling her earlier how surprised I was when she said that she is now a retired magistrate. I rightly expressed my disbelief that that could be so.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para7"></a>I hope that the noble and learned Lord will withdraw his amendment. He has had to wait a long time. This issue should and could be looked at again before 2006 when we come to consider the implementation of the directive.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   Once again kind flattery by the Minister gets me nowhere. In 1993 ageism was on the ascendant. The position is entirely changed now. It is ridiculous to say, "Oh well, this is piecemeal. We have to look at it all in the light of a European directive". What does it have to do with Europe? It is our judicial system. The Master of the Rolls says that he wants to do this and I have no reason to doubt him. I do not want anyone to be misled by the Minister's perfectly bona fide assurances that orders will be brought forward&#151;as they have been recently&#151;to increase the number of judges.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para8"></a>I have lived with this situation for 10 years. What happens is that under extreme pressure the Lord Chancellor brings forward an order for the number of judges&#151;I forget what it is called. That looks fine. The trouble is that it is subject to the Treasury's consent and the Treasury does not give consent, so it is purely a paper transaction. The matter should have been dealt with straightaway. Whether there will be sufficient support at a later stage to divide the House I do not know; I do not command any battalions, so I have to leave it to others. But it is a great pity.

Under Section 2(4) of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948, no regard can be given in determining the reasonableness of any claimed future care costs and expenses or in reducing those costs and expenses by taking advantage of facilities for providing future care services, which may be available under the National Health Service. That produces a ridiculous situation, under which the NHS&#151;or the Medical Defence Union or the Medical Protection Society&#151;are compelled to make substantial awards for setting up in effect private care at home on a 24-hour basis for one individual for the rest of his or her life when there is evidence that it is not in the best interests of the claimant to have what is virtually a private hospital built around them. The NHS must allow the claimant to receive what may be better treatment from the NHS when all the money has been spent. The person can then claim that better treatment free of charge on the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para14"></a>At the moment, the courts are precluded by this provision from balancing the cost of private treatment against the cost of public treatment even where evidence is presented to the court that the claimant, in their own best interest, should receive treatment under the NHS. I have in mind my own experience of cases in which isolating the claimant in a 24-hour private hospital that is built around their home is probably the last thing that should happen, particularly with regard to their rehabilitation. They should be among other people with similar injuries, who are often receiving better care. The courts cannot currently review the reasonableness of future private expenses or the possibility that the extra costs can be minimised or avoided by taking advantage of facilities that are available in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para15"></a>How serious is that? The experience in the NHS in dealing with claims is that future care costs are the largest single item in damages awarded in large claims. About two-thirds of the total liability for clinical negligence resides in a small number of large claims <P>


<a name="column_1029"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1029</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where much of the award payments are channelled into the private sector for the patient's long-term care. That means that, for patients who suffered their injuries in NHS hospitals, a large amount of money is transferred out of the NHS and into the private sector for the benefit of a very small number of people.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para16"></a>I understand that the Medical Defence Union believes that about £1,000 million leaves the NHS&#151;I refer to the total NHS liabilities, which have been estimated at £5.25 billion&#151;in order to set up those facilities. It estimates that £1,000 million could be redirected into NHS care if patients who needed long-term care were guaranteed that care under the NHS rather than the NHS having to pay damages that reflect the cost of private provision of long-term care.
<P>

<a name="30327-30_para17"></a>I hope that the Minister will take time between now and Report to consider that matter. It is strongly felt by many doctors, dentists, nurses, consultants and people in the NHS. I have not discussed the amount of money coming from insurance premiums to pay for that care. With regard merely to the NHS, we should consider how much better that money could be spent within the NHS by setting up even better facilities for everyone. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I rise briefly to support the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, has outlined the case very eloquently from the financial perspective. But I believe that another perspective needs to be outlined&#151;that of the patients themselves.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para0"></a>A large amount of complex, highly technical and skilled care is now available to the NHS but is not available in the private sector. If a patient has had the misfortune to put forward a complex and unusual negligence claim and he has a rare and complex condition requiring ongoing intervention, he will almost inevitably have to access NHS care. There may almost be a duplication of care provision and continuity will be lost. Perhaps I may cite one simple example. If someone has lost his whole bowel and is dependent on total parenteral nutrition, even if he is managed at home on a 24-hour basis, he will inevitably have to access the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para1"></a>Legislation made in 1948 was appropriate to the services of the time, but there is a danger that the level of technical care available today bears no resemblance at all to what was scientifically known in 1948. I worry that the care delivered to patients does not, in this sense, offer redress. It does not help them to live with whatever problems they have and it does not help them towards a more integrated and better quality of life.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I say both to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that I understand the concerns which the amendment seeks to highlight. I am not able to accept the amendment because the implication of the change would not be restricted to personal injury claims involving periodical payments alone, and it is questionable whether the amendment is within the scope of the Bill.

<P>

<a name="30327-31_para2"></a>In any event, I do not believe that such a significant change to the substantive law on damages would be appropriate without full consultation. The amendment, as proposed, would also have considerable resource implications for the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para3"></a>In opposing the amendment, we do not wish to pre-judge any recommendation that the Chief Medical Officer might make on possible reforms to the arrangements for clinical negligence cases in the longer term. The Government would wish to consider those before deciding the appropriate way forward. I can certainly tell the Committee that the issues referred to by the noble Lord, and alluded to by the noble Baroness, have been raised and are being considered. We await the report of the Chief Medical Officer with not only great anticipation but interest. I can assure noble Lords that that report will be read with great care, and any recommendations that the Chief Medical Officer may make will be given the utmost consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. It would be helpful to know what kind of timescale we are operating on and whether or not the Chief Medical Officer's report will be made public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I do not know at this moment and I am not privy to that precise information. I know that we have been anxiously awaiting the report. Particularly bearing in mind the scope of the issues which the Chief Medical Officer must address, the noble Lord will know that we would obviously prefer the consideration to be comprehensive. We await the report within the timescale appropriate to the Chief Medical Officer.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para4"></a>We are very aware how important this issue is. I know that a great deal of care is being taken in structuring the recommendations. If I am able to give the noble Lord specific details, I shall certainly write to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   I am very grateful to the noble Baroness. Obviously I shall consider carefully the points that she raised. I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, for, again, having brought us face to face with some very practical consequences of the 1948 legislation. Of course the amendment must be within the scope of the Bill or it would never have been accepted by the Public Bill Office. However, I shall reflect on it and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30327-31_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: I do not propose to speak at length to the amendment, but it is a further opportunity for us to refer to the duties of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. I declare an interest as a previous holder of that office.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para12"></a>We shall debate the issue at length in the many days that are being set aside for Report. I do not wish to pre-empt that.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-31_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am not able to accept the amendment. I heard with trepidation the noble Lord's words that he will return to the issue at length on Report. Of course I understand why he says that.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para14"></a>The amendment is deficient. Section 26 of the Justices of the Peace Act says that references to the Lord Chancellor, in Sections 5(1), 6, 7(4) to 7(6), 8 and 25 should be construed as references to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. These sections will naturally be different under the Courts Bill. Additionally, Clause 6(4) of the Courts Bill would need to be amended. So, in any event, we would not be able to accept the amendment in this form.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para15"></a>However, as the noble Lord knows, I have wider and less remedial concerns. First, I should set this question in context. I know that noble Lords are concerned that the provision to transfer the duchy's responsibilities for the appointment and removal of magistrates is unwelcome to some magistrates in the region.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para16"></a>There has been a great deal of concern expressed by the Chamber during the passage of the Bill about the lay magistracy, and the Government's regard and intentions for it. I hope that the Committee will agree that we have gone some distance to meet these concerns. We have promised to restore the Supplemental List. We have demonstrated our commitment to the role of the lay magistracy in its general criminal jurisdiction and its specialist jurisdictions. The plans to extend magistrates' sentencing powers are also a demonstration of the faith in the magistracy. We have enhanced the position of Benches in statute as a step to allay magistrates' concerns about local justice; and also because we believe that Benches are a valuable institution and important to magistrates. I do not think that we can be accused of disregarding those issues.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para17"></a>I welcome the opportunity to explain why Ministers of both departments are in agreement that we should transfer those responsibilities to the Lord Chancellor. The current split of responsibility for appointing magistrates is anomalous even under the current system. It does not apply to professional judges. It does not apply to other ancient duchies. Other historical counties and regions accept that local advisory committees, chaired by lord lieutenants of counties and advising the Lord Chancellor, constitute a valid means of appointing magistrates for the locality. That system will continue in the duchy area, as it will across the jurisdiction. Indeed, many would argue that in such an important matter as the appointment and removal of magistrates, the heightened opportunity for inconsistent practice represented by the split of responsibilities is hardly acceptable.
<P>

<a name="30327-31_para18"></a>On the last occasion I answered this question I outlined the nature of the consultation. I went through the fact that when Lord Justice Auld consulted on the matter there was wide consultation about whether there should be jurisdiction bringing all the courts together to unify the system. Those matters were taken into account. Because of the lateness of the hour, I shall not go through the extensive reasons why this <P>


<a name="column_1033"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1033</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decision was taken. I have set out the full reasons in a letter to noble Lords. If the noble Lord returns to the issue on Report, I shall delight in extolling the reasons in full. I hope that the noble Lord will not think it discourteous of me if I do not go into any further detail at this point and that he feels content to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30327-32_para0"></a>I warn the noble Baroness that extensive feelings are held on this issue by many people across the Duchy of Lancaster and elsewhere. There is a feeling that they have not been specifically consulted about this proposal, save by Mo Mowlam, albeit a short time ago. The virtually unanimous view was that this provision should be retained. Someone decided to alter that view without any further consultation on the specific proposal. That is why such strong feelings are held. We shall return to the matter on Report. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30327-32_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order has been seen by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. In my opinion, its provisions are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The order makes minor changes to the extensive list of powers of seizure in Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.
<P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column 1034</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para11"></a>Part 2 of the Act, which comes into force on 1st April 2003, gives police officers and other investigators powers to seize property from premises and persons for examination elsewhere. Those may be necessary because there is insufficient time to conduct an effective examination on the premises or there is a need to use special technical equipment.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para12"></a>As noble Lords will recall, the provisions in Part 2 were introduced to deal with the problem identified in the case of R v Chesterfield Justices and the Chief Constable of Derbyshire ex parte Bramley, which highlighted the difficulties faced by the police where material that they are entitled to seize is contained with a large collection of material, some of which they might not be entitled to seize.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para13"></a>Provision has also been made in Part 2 for the seizure and retention of inextricably linked material, such as the contents of an entire computer hard-disk drive, where it is necessary to prove when specific items of information were created or amended. The legislation recognises that, with the huge increase in the use of computers, investigators need to be able to seize and forensically examine an entire disk or hard-drive to determine when individual documents have been created, amended or even deleted.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para14"></a>The new powers in Part 2 are not free-standing and can be exercised only in support of an existing power of seizure. Those powers are listed in Schedule 1 to the Act. The draft order will be made under Section 69 of the 2001 Act but cannot be made until it is approved by resolution of each House. Under Section 69(1) of the 2001 Act, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has the power to add, modify and amend the powers of seizure listed in Schedule 1. The section thus provides a mechanism to allow for changes to other legislation containing powers of seizure that might need to be added to Schedule 1 or to amend it. Since the 2001 Act received Royal Assent in May 2001, new powers of seizure have been created and existing ones amended by the legislation. This order, therefore, merely tidies up the schedule to incorporate the changes. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="30327-32_para18"></a>Ideally, every last consequential and incidental provision would normally be settled before Royal Assent to an Act. It became clear, when we put additional provisions into the Act, including the safe country list and non-suspensive appeals, that it would be impossible to ensure that all consequential amendments had been identified prior to Royal Assent. We tabled an amendment to Section 157(4), with Parliament's agreement, giving us the power to do so later by affirmative order. This order allows for the amendment of previous statutes affected by the coming into force of the various provisions of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. They relate mainly to appeals and nationality.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para19"></a>The consequential amendments that relate to appeals amend Section 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Without them, the new appeals framework at Part 5 of the 2002 Act, which also contains new provisions on the certification of clearly unfounded claims by the Secretary of State, could not operate. The Part 5 provisions of the Act are due to commence on 1st April.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para20"></a>Several nationality provisions at Part 1 of the 2002 Act are also due to commence in April, including deprivation of citizenship and several categories relating to registration of citizenship. The consequential amendments that are required relate to deprivation and the ceremonies associated with citizenship.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para21"></a>The consequential and incidental amendments in the order are necessary to ensure that previous pieces of legislation affected by the coming into force of various provisions of the 2002 Act sit with the new legislation. The order forms a small but vital part in the restructuring of the appeals and nationality systems. I commend the order to the House.

As long as the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 has been in place, there has been a list of positions for which the offender, even if his or her conviction under the Act is spent, cannot escape his or her past. If asked an excepted question in respect of all past convictions by a person entitled to ask such a question, he or she must answer in respect of all past convictions, not merely those that are unspent.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para26"></a>The order contains several additional exceptions. The first relates to applicants for private hire vehicle drivers' licences in London. The amendment adds London's private hire drivers&#151;minicabs and so on&#151;who will become subject to licensing on 1st April 2003. The order will also cover those applying to be licensed by the new Security Industry Authority. The SIA will be responsible for licensing those employed in a number of private security industry sectors. Licensing will be introduced by sector beginning with door supervisors and wheel clampers at some time in 2004. Social workers and social care workers, including those in training, are to be registered by the General Social Care Council in England and the Care Council for Wales. This order will permit criminal records checks as part of the registration process which is due to commence on 1st April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para27"></a>The order also covers any employment or other work within a high security hospital; that is, Ashworth, Broadmoor and Rampton hospitals. The existing health service execption covers many, but not all, of those who work in the hospitals. This amendment is necessary to ensure that all staff can be made subject to the appropriate criminal records checks.
<P>

<a name="30327-32_para28"></a>The final amendment concerns staff working in probation and bail hostels. All posts in those hostels involve contact with residents and thus it is proposed that the amendment should cover all staff. I commend the order to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-33_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Haskel): </B>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, perhaps I may make one or two housekeeping points. The first relates to the microphones. The gentleman in the corner will switch them on and off, so Members of the Committee do not need to touch them. Secondly, there is a revised list of groupings which Members should have in front of them.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para2"></a>It may be helpful to remind your Lordships about the procedure for today's Committee stage. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para3"></a>I should also explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting. The Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division bells are rung and then resume after 10 minutes.

<A NAME="30327-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><b>"PART A1WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE</B></center><br>
 GENERAL PURPOSE OF THIS PART
<br>
(1) The purpose of this Part is to make provision for, or in connection with, protection of the water environment, including making provision, and enabling provision to be made, for, or in connection with, implementing in England and Wales Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23rd October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (referred to in this Part as "the Directive").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_GC38"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) In this Part "protection of the water environment" includes, in particular&#151;
<br>
(a) preventing further deterioration of, and protecting and enhancing, the status of aquatic ecosystems and, with regard to their water needs, terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands directly depending on those aquatic ecosystems,
<br>
(b) promoting sustainable water use based on the long-term protection of available water resources,
<br>
(c) aiming at enhancing protection and improvement of the aquatic environment through, amongst other things, specific measures for the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of priority substances and the cessation or phasing out of discharges, emissions and losses of the priority hazardous substances,
<br>
(d) ensuring the progressive reduction of pollution of groundwater and preventing further pollution of it, and
<br>
(e) contributing to mitigating the effects of floods and droughts, with a view to contributing to the achievement of the aims specified in subsection (3).
<br>
(3) Those aims are&#151;
<br>
(a) the provision of a sufficient supply of good quality surface water and groundwater as needed for sustainable, balanced and equitable water use,
<br>
(b) a significant reduction in pollution of groundwater,
<br>
(c) the protection of territorial and other marine waters, and
<br>
(d) achieving the objectives of international agreements, including those which aim to prevent and eliminate pollution of the marine environment, in relation to which measures are adopted under paragraph 1 of Article 16 of the Directive in pursuance of a proposal under paragraph 3 of that Article."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-33_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is fundamental to the Bill. It is to put the principles of the Water Framework Directive into the Bill. It will ensure that the implementation of the directive is timely, appropriate and maximises the opportunities that are offered by it. I am aware that directives are always transposed by secondary legislation and I ask the Committee to consider whether this may be the time to consider changing that. Perhaps they should not always be transposed by secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para7"></a>Perhaps the lack of scrutiny is one of the reasons why they were often inappropriately or badly transposed and certainly often too late. It is a case of good European theory sometimes turning into bad practice. I believe that in this case we can transform the way in which the world of water and its management is undertaken by including the Water Framework Directive in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para8"></a>That is not my opinion alone. I am sure that Members of the Committee will be well aware of the recently published report on the Water Framework Directive from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee of another place. I am tempted to read it almost in its entirety, but I will not. It is adamant that the Water Framework Directive offers the chance of giving real meaning to the nebulous concept of sustainable development, an issue I touched upon in my Second Reading speech. In the conclusions and evidence, it is striking to see how <P>


<a name="column_GC39"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many different bodies from all sections of the community believe that the directive should be transposed into primary legislation. I refer to bodies as various as the National Trust, several of the water companies and the RSPB. The overwhelming evidence is that the directive should be in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para9"></a>Is it a question of timing? I do not believe that it is. The directive must be transposed by the end of the year. We are considering the Bill in March and by the time that another place has considered it, it will almost be the end of the year. I believe that the opportunity could have been taken to include it in the Bill at this stage.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para10"></a>I was somewhat shocked to discover that within DEFRA there are two completely separate teams; one is working on the framework directive and the other on the Water Bill. Will the Minister tell the Committee who is the person co-ordinating the teams? I am surprised that the same team is not working on both measures.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para11"></a>I have asked myself why the Government have not chosen to implement the directive. Is it that they are not prepared, which having two teams may suggest? Is it that politically they do not want to include the directive in the Bill because it is complicated, or that there is a frightening effect that I do not yet understand? However, having spoken to all interested parties, I understand that it is a more cost-effective way of dealing with the management of water. Scotland has led the way in this&#151;it has its water Act and it has already transposed the directive. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-33_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I support the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. She beat us to it in tabling an amendment incorporating the directive into the Bill. Rather than having two amendments on the same directive, I am happy to support the principle of her amendment. Although I cannot anticipate his answer, I suspect that the Minister in response will say that it was all right in Scotland but it will not be appropriate for England.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para12"></a>I want to add to some of the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I want to refer to several matters raised in the report of the Select Committee on the Water Framework Directive because I believe that they need to be put on the record. It is important to establish what we are talking about.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para13"></a>At page 13, it is clearly stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Perhaps the most important of these questions, at least initially, is that which asks what is the current state of water quality in surface and ground waters in England and Wales. Before decisions can be made about what policies are needed to meet the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, it is vital that a clear understanding is reached of the current status of these waters, as currently no comprehensive overview exists of the ecological state of waters in England and Wales".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para14"></a>
I hope that the Minister will answer that question in his response.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para15"></a>At page 22, the Select Committee deals with changes in land use. It states that limiting diffuse pollution will be a costly and expensive undertaking for industry,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and will impact on the agricultural industry which is already under severe pressure. It is likely to require changes in agricultural practice&#151;perhaps even to the direction and the ethos of the CAP",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para16"></a>
a matter which will be under consideration this summer. The report continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As such it is emblematic of the significance and wide-ranging impact of the Water Framework Directive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para17"></a>
Yet, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, it is not included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para18"></a>Paragraph 57 at page 24 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we recommend that a scientific Steering Group be set up to advise Defra and the Environment Agency on the science surrounding the Water Framework Directive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para19"></a>
My question to the Minister is: has it been set up? If not, why not?
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para20"></a>Page 26 deals with resourcing. Paragraph 63 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any failure adequately to resource the Environment Agency to perform its responsibilities under the Water Framework Directive would be wholly unacceptable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para21"></a>
Are the Government happy that they have put in adequate resourcing?
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para22"></a>At page 27, it is stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recommend that the Government examine concerns about possible conflicts of interest arising as a result of the designation of the Environment Agency as competent authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para23"></a>
Later the report refers to a democratic mandate, an issue to which we shall turn later.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para24"></a>I move to page 31 and paragraph 78, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In short, there is a palpable lack of urgency&#151;perhaps even a sense of complacency&#151;in the approach currently taken to making administrative arrangements to implement the Directive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para25"></a>
These are critical observations by the Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para26"></a>Page 32 relates to costs and gold-plating, an issue which noble Lords often raise in the House. Paragraph 81, referring to agriculture, states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"agriculture can ill-afford the significant expense that it would incur if that approach was applied to diffuse pollution. 'End-of-pipe' treatment is likely to prove expensive to water companies and their customers, and will not tackle the root of the problem".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-33_para27"></a>
These are important issues and I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for putting them forward today. The individual items should be discussed, rather than rushed through.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para28"></a>I turn to look at another piece of legislation to which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has not referred. It is the regulations on Water Resources, England and Wales, 2003 No. 164. It was made on 30th January 2003, laid before Parliament on 31st January 2003 and comes into force on 1st April 2003. So far as I am aware, we have not debated it in the House. If I am wrong and we have done so, I apologise.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para29"></a>The regulation is important because it has an impact particularly on agriculture. I want to ask the Minister why, for example, at paragraph 3 is the requirement for an environmental impact assessment to be carried out only for the projects appertaining to agriculture, particularly irrigation projects. Is it because all other <P>


<a name="column_GC41"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>industries, interests or businesses are covered under some other heading? Why has this requirement not been included in the Bill? Why has it been separated out and why have we had no opportunity to debate it? I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that.
<P>

<a name="30327-33_para30"></a>Water resources are hugely important. We are anxious not only about how we use water, but about its quality. In supporting the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in moving the amendment, I have tried to add greater body to her shorter introduction. These issues are important and the Committee needs to consider them. If one is not careful, it is easy at the beginning of the Bill to omit references to issues, particularly when the Select Committee has highlighted many of them. I look forward to hearing what other Members of the Committee and the Minister have to say.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-34_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I, too, broadly speaking support the amendment. I do so in the context to which I drew your Lordships' attention at Second Reading. I am personally involved with a scheme in north Yorkshire on the River Ure. The original purpose of the scheme was to try to overcome what we regarded as being over-extraction of water during the summer months by Yorkshire Water. I am pleased to say that that was ultimately resolved through the good offices of the Environment Agency. On the back of that developed a programme designed to secure a more comprehensive structure of the river catchment area that would deal not only with the question of water supply and water quality, but also of the surrounding land with all the conservation and environmental implications.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para0"></a>Through the Environment Agency, we identified the main problem areas and how best they could be tackled&#151;in theory, at any rate&#151;given the various schemes and resources and funding that were available. But there were too many voids, so it was abundantly clear to us that such a scheme was unlikely to work successfully given the conditions at the time.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para1"></a>Somewhat inevitably, we hit major snags. One of our major objectives was to try to secure a project manager. That was clearly essential if the project were to be taken forward in a cohesive and effective way. I suspect that that has not come about simply through there being a lack of funds available to the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para2"></a>One helpful development was that we commissioned the services of a local ecologist and his equally well-qualified wife to undertake a full survey of the wildlife of the river, which I believed would provide a useful baseline in order to establish any future trends in the river's ecological status. Surely, that should be undertaken in all river systems if we are to be able to understand the changes that are likely to take place in future.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para3"></a>I bring the case forward as an example of a well-intentioned scheme, which is struggling through a lack of co-ordination and the inability readily to identify sources of finance. There was a great willingness to succeed, but the whole scheme needs lifting to a higher plane, with the proper enabling framework.
<P>


<a name="column_GC42"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para4"></a>I appreciate that it is the Government's view that the Water Resources Act 1991 gives a wide range of powers to the Environment Agency, including the control over water abstraction from rivers. I also believe that the Environment Agency has powers to instigate the baseline monitoring of river systems. However, I should be most grateful if the Minister could explain whether this is a statutory obligation or simply a power and the extent to which it is occurring, or will occur, throughout the river catchment areas of England.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para5"></a>Will the Minister also explain whether it is the Government's intention to see such monitoring schemes being translated into action, thus ensuring that comprehensive river basin management schemes are put in place to ensure that each system has a good supply of water, both in terms of quality and quantity? The important point I want to make is that that should be accompanied by environmentally sympathetic land management schemes.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para6"></a>I am aware of the all-embracing objectives of the Water Framework Directive to which the amendment refers and the high degree of subsidiarity attached to it. That is a welcome change among most European directives. But the question remains: will the Government be able to achieve a comprehensive river catchment management system through a combination of this legislation, previous legislation and the Water Framework Directive?
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para7"></a>My noble friend Lady Byford referred to the House of Commons Select Committee report. Paragraph 71 on page 28, which refers to the transposition of the directive into national law, states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But until the administrative arrangements which will enable the Environment Agency to function as the competent authority have been properly explored, Defra cannot be certain that primary legislation is not required".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-34_para8"></a>
My personal experience on the River Ure project, to which I have referred, highlighted the lack of cohesive responsibility available to the Environment Agency to follow through proper river catchment management objectives.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para9"></a>I therefore welcome Article 14 of the directive that requires that members states shall encourage the active involvement of all interested parties in its implementation, in particular the production, review and updating of the river basin management plans. But can the Government genuinely meet these objectives through regulations? Does the Environment Agency have the power to enter into management agreements with owners and occupiers? If not, I do not see how proper catchment area management will be achieved.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para10"></a>Furthermore, I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that I am not certain that Amendment No. 1 addresses the issue. I hope she will say that it does, but I am not entirely certain. And inevitably, I must ask: will the resources be made available for such a national undertaking?
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para11"></a>Pesticide run-off is costing the water industry about £120 million a year. Many river systems are in dire need of sound sustainable comprehensive <P>


<a name="column_GC43"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>management plans which deliver what most interested parties want. It is about engaging people; making them feel part of the overall scheme. I do not believe that it must be over-administrative, but without having a scheme and structure in place and a project manager to bring everyone together in a cohesive fashion, I am not sure how the system as we see it will work.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para12"></a>I therefore hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that at the end of debates on the Bill we will have in place a scheme which will be able to deliver the kind of requirements I have outlined.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I want to speak briefly not about the merits of the argument but about the words "General purpose of this Part". This is a purpose clause&#151;only for this part of the Bill and obviously not for the whole Bill. However, over the years, there has been long debate on such clauses, which were used a great deal. Gradually, they have fallen into disuse because they can lead to many legal problems on interpretation.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para13"></a>The noble Baroness should bear that in mind when considering the proposal. In laying down the purpose, it must be absolutely right because there could be much debate about the meaning of the various words used. I shall also be interested to hear from my noble friend whether having this purpose for this part of the Bill will have any effect on the rest of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-34_spnew2"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I, too, want to speak briefly in support of the amendment. The Bill covers regulation of quantity rather than regulation of quality of water. It would be good if a larger emphasis could be put on quality, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Because we are dealing with water, one has a vital link with the other: the more concentrated the water becomes, the worse the pollution.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para14"></a>The Water Framework Directive contains a logic which I like and it would be nice if our legislation followed the same pattern. It first sets the standards for water; it then sets out regulation for discharges of polluting substances; and then goes on to ensure that the rates of extraction are sustainable.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para15"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned, the Scottish Parliament has passed the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003. Interestingly, that is enabling legislation which will be followed by subordinate legislation. The question being asked earlier was whether we have the legislative framework to which the secondary legislation that is being proposed will be attached. I should be interested to hear to which part of our legislation it will be attached.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Peel mentioned the problem of how one will designate the responsible agency. It seems we shall run into an additional problem. Even in the second consultation paper on the Water Framework Directive, the issue of the cross-Border river basin districts has not been resolved. Who does <P>


<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one appoint and do we have an adequate idea of how we appoint the responsible agency for such awkward problems?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-34_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for moving the amendment. I am even more grateful that she did not read out the whole of the Select Committee's report. We are faced with the basic question. These amendments propose that we can depart from our basic procedure and transpose directives from the EU by primary legislation. That is not unprecedented but it is unusual.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para17"></a>The key issue today is not whether the Water Framework Directive is desirable&#151;most contributions indicate that it is&#151;but whether we should give it legal effect via the Bill or follow our intention to do so by secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972. That is the normal way of doing so and we have already begun the consultation period.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para18"></a>A number of noble Lords raised the matter at Second Reading and I wrote to them. Following the example of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I shall not read out the letter, compelling though it is. Part of the issue is that some of the directive already exists in English and Welsh legislation. Some of the existing legal framework therefore already exists for the transposition of the directive and some of the provisions in this Bill will help the transposition. However, other parts can be transposed in the normal way and some may not be transposed even were the amendment to be accepted. Although in moving the amendment it has been stated that it will put the framework directive into primary legislation, in practice it will not.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para19"></a>I want to return to the position on process. We have already carried out two major consultations on transposition of the directive and a third is planned this year. In that third phase, we will want to put forward the proposed draft regulations and an updated regulatory impact assessment. In relation to the first consultation, we asked for views on precisely the issues raised by the amendments and our use of secondary legislation. Responses to that consultation generally supported our approach.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para20"></a>My noble friend Lord Carter has asked whether a purpose clause is appropriate here. The purpose as described in the amendments would not be fully carried out. Because one would not be transposing the totality of the directive, it is a flawed purpose clause. However, it also raises general issues to which my noble friend referred.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para21"></a>That has allowed us to have a debate on the provisions of the directive and it has raised a number of related issues, some of which are raised in the Select Committee report. On the central issue, the report is rather tentative on primary and secondary legislation and does not come down in favour of either route. While it raises the issue, Members of the Committee cannot call it in support of what they propose in these amendments. However, it makes recommendations about assessing the legislative implications of the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>directive&#151;clearly we are already engaged in that&#151;and keeps an open mind on what should appear and in what form.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para22"></a>A number of related issues were raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the issue of joined-up DEFRA; whether people working on the Water Framework Directive and people working on this Bill are sufficiently cohesive. The answer is that they are. They are working on the same policy structure and they actually sit next to each other in the same offices in the department. In terms of ministerial responsibility, they are all accountable to my colleague Elliot Morley for delivering water policy in general. I do not believe that that is an issue. They deliver different aspects of the same policy in different ways.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para23"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, raised the issue of whether we should start from an assessment. I believe that the noble Earl, Lord Peel, also wondered whether we should start from an assessment of the status of water. The directive requires us to do that by 2004, to monitor it through to 2006 and at various stages to set objectives through to 2008. That is all in the directive and it will be transposed from the directive, but it is not appropriate to deal with that within the scope of the Bill because it can be dealt with in normal transposition. Nor is it the intention of the Government to gold-plate that transposition, unless there are circumstances of which I am not yet aware, where the benefits hugely outweigh the costs of such gold plating.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para24"></a>A number of other issues were raised in relation to the approach to water management and water quality. Many of the water quality requirements and procedures, referred to in the directive, are already provided for in earlier legislation. Therefore, the Bill is primarily about quantity and quantity controls and the way in which we approach those matters. This is not the place to deliver the precise management structure operated by the Environment Agency and other agencies, but the combination of the Bill, existing legislation and the regulations that are to be transposed will give the basis for comprehensive management as required by the directive and as referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Peel. To develop comprehensive river catchment management is a big challenge. We certainly intend to go down that road. There are technical and operational challenges to be faced to take us up to 2015 and beyond.

<A NAME="30327-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   As I understand the position, the Minister is suggesting that we do not need the Water Framework Directive in the Bill. However, in simple terms he is saying that we shall have the new Water Bill, the Water Framework Directive and the other regulations. One point made in the EFRA Select Committee report was that it recommends that DEFRA should take action on engaging the public in the Water Framework Directive. It recommends that DEFRA should involve local government and industry in discussions on the implications of the Water Framework Directive. In effect, it says that it should have the widest possible exposure so that not <P>


<a name="column_GC46"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>only those involved in the industry, but also consumers, know eventually what they are supposed to do, what the framework will be, what the water industry will look like and how it will be managed.
<P>

<a name="30327-34_para25"></a>It seems to me that this will be extremely complex. If one wants to achieve greater comprehension of all the long-term needs and structure of the industry, surely there is greater merit in doing precisely what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has suggested, as supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford; in other words, try to sort out the situation in one go. Or am I completely wrong?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We are already involved in a substantial exercise of engaging the public in consultation on the transposition of the directive in relation to some of the procedures leading to the Bill. Also the Environment Agency is developing a public participation strategy and we are setting up a stakeholder communication group on the totality of water strategy. That will pave the way for developing effective ways of engaging people at the catchment area or river basin level. I agree entirely with the Select Committee that that is a desirable process.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para0"></a>However, the noble Baroness and the amendments jump from there to saying that while we need to engage people in the comprehensive basis of what we are doing about water management, which I accept, we also need a single piece of legislation that covers all those aspects. Effectively that would mean producing a consolidated Bill that includes all the regulations, all the old legislation and all new legislation. No doubt that would detain us in Grand Committee in the Moses Room for considerably longer than the five days allocated for this Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para1"></a>Given that much of that legislation already exists, we are consulting on much of the legislation coming from the directive. We have a perfectly adequate way of transposing that&#151;as we normally do. The amendment suggests a novel way of dealing with a European directive and a novel way of dealing with policy. Whether ideal or not, almost every area of public policy has different pieces of legislation, of whatever status, and at the same time extant. Were the Committee and its equivalent to spend their time trying to consolidate everything, we would lose focus and not be able to make changes that are imposed upon us by the environmental challenges or by European directives.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para2"></a>Moving away from the procedure on environmental directives and other directives for their transposition under the European Communities Act would be a difficult step for Parliament to take. I accept some of the criticisms of the inadequacy of scrutiny, but there are some aspects of primary legislation that may not be scrutinised in the most optimal way. I believe that people understand that. People have to apply the legislation and those affected by it understand that once we have a European directive, it is transposed in a particular way into UK legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para3"></a>There are exceptions to that but in the amendment the noble Baroness suggests that the totality of water legislation, past and present, should be before us today <P>


<a name="column_GC47"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in a single Bill. That would be a novel and a rather over-radical change in the procedure of the House and of Parliament as a whole and would seriously delay some aspects of the transposition of what is desirable in the European directive.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para4"></a>Other issues were raised, such as the resources that the Environment Agency has to deliver its part of the Bill and related matters. There has been a significant increase in the resources available to the Environment Agency. The figure has risen from £620 million in 1999 to just short of £800 million this year. The grant in aid from the department has increased from £103.7 in 1999 to £116.7 in 2002&#150;03 and a proposed increase for next year will bring it up to £128.4 million. That is in recognition of a number of additional obligations that have been imposed on the Environment Agency and against a background of other areas of DEFRA and government expenditure not receiving anything like that degree of support.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para5"></a>In addition to references to the Select Committee and its rather tentative conclusions, there is also a reference to Scotland. Unlike some noble Lords, I am always willing to learn from Scottish examples, and sometimes they are good examples. In this respect, Scotland started from a different starting point. The structure of the water industry is entirely different in Scotland&#151;effectively it is still in public ownership&#151;and the state of legislation in Scotland is entirely different. Prior to the new Scottish Act, for example, the powers to control abstraction in Scotland were extremely limited. In a sense that reflects the climatological situation in Scotland, but our framework is much more developed than the pre-existing framework in Scotland. In addition, the Scottish Act does not put everything into primary legislation; substantial aspects of it are being dealt with in the Scottish Parliament by secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para6"></a>I do not believe that we can point to the Scottish example as being the one to follow here in the sense that the amendments suggest. Therefore, while we have had an interesting debate&#151;no doubt the issue of the Water Framework Directive will rightly be touched on at various stages during our deliberation&#151;I urge the noble Baroness not to return to this procedure. It would set an undesirable precedent and it is not the most appropriate way of dealing with the various requirements of water management with which the directive and environmental challenges present us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I took heart from the Minister's commitment that the Government intend to go down the route of river basin management schemes, although I find the timescale rather distressing. If such management schemes are to be effective, clearly they will require a certain amount of land management negotiation. Water quality and water quantity are inevitably tied up with the management of the land within the river catchment areas. Who will negotiate with the landowners and the farmers, if that is necessary&#151;in many cases it will be necessary&#151;and who will have the responsibility and the power to enter <P>


<a name="column_GC48"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into the management agreements? Without that, I do not understand how there will be effective river basin management schemes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Environment Agency would be the strategic body bringing together all the interests. Some of the arrangements may be between the water companies and the landowners and some between the Environment Agency and the landowners, or between different landowners and other users of water. The strategic and catalytic role would be played by the Environment Agency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   On the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, many of the provisions required to implement the Water Framework Directive have nothing to do with water; they concern land management and development in the widest sense, including planning, agriculture, forestry and a huge range of issues. If we were to bring all those points into a Bill called the "Water Bill", that may be a step further than the Minister has indicated. I would be interested to hear his reason.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness and the noble Earl are right. But there are many matters outside the direct area of water management&#151;what the water companies and the owners of water do&#151;that will affect the way in which we fulfil the responsibilities under the Water Framework Directive. I do not believe that either the noble Earl or I were suggesting that the Environment Agency should have total planning control over all those activities. I am unsure whether the noble Baroness will be relieved or disappointed about that. We are talking of bringing together the various forces that give a coherent way of managing particular water basin and river catchment areas. In most circumstances, the Environment Agency would have a lead role in such a situation, but it would not have a management or a direct regulatory role.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   When I next stand in Masham town hall, in front of those who are interested in bringing together the River Ure management scheme, what am I to say? I shall tell them that the Minister has said that the Environment Agency may have a role; that it may do this and it may do that. Among a whole range of people there is a great willingness to bring the situation together in an effective way. I do not expect the Minister to answer me now, but perhaps in writing he could explain how best such a scheme could effectively be administered and taken forward. There is a great willingness among people to do it, but there is a lack of steerage and, at times, commitment. Unquestionably there appears to be a lack of responsibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-35_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I shall respond to a couple of comments made by the Minister and then I shall ask him to answer some questions that I put to him. Returning to the secondary legislation issue, the Minister said that the Select Committee report did not say that primary legislation was essential. He <P>


<a name="column_GC49"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mentioned that it was a possibility. The report stated quite clearly that until the administrative arrangements which will enable the Environment Agency to function as the constant authority have been properly explored, DEFRA cannot be certain that primary legislation is not required. That is what the committee said. I cannot agree or disagree with that. That is what the report says and I think the Minister is pushing that statement away a little too quickly. That is unlike him, because normally he is very generous.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para7"></a>The Minister said that a third stage of consultation is taking place later this year. When will that end and when shall we have a response to the consultation? If it does not happen until later in the year, we may not receive the results until next year, and the time for the directive will have overrun and the Bill will have completed its passage through the House.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para8"></a>I ask the Minister to think seriously about the important point made by my noble friend Lady O'Cathain that people should be made more aware. Clearly people should be brought into this process and should have better information. I record my thanks to the Minister for eventually helping us to find our way through four Acts. It was nearly impossible. Many noble Lords may wonder why we have tabled certain amendments, but they were tabled to find out certain matters. I am sure it was a challenge to the Government as well.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para9"></a>If it is said that the Government want the general public to understand and to take part in the system, the public will not wade through four Acts and try to look at Butterworth. My noble friend has raised an important point that I hope the Minister will address with greater seriousness than he may at the moment feel is necessary.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, said that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, may have difficulties with her amendment as it stands. I do not believe that that detracts from what she is trying to achieve. It would be wrong of me to put words into her mouth, but she may want to reconsider it. I hope that this debate will add to what she is hoping to achieve.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para11"></a>I want to raise two other matters with the Minister. The Minister answered the first question raised by my noble friend the Duke of Montrose, but not the question of cross-river basin management. I would be glad if he would do so. And I did not receive a response on the Water Resources, England and Wales, statutory instrument, 2003, No. 164, to which I referred in great detail. Perhaps the Minister could respond to those points. In that document it clearly states that some small changes may take place and an environmental assessment will be carried out on all agricultural projects. The Environment Agency will judge whether it is likely to have a significant effect on the environment. I would like such matters clarified because they are not in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para12"></a>The NFU is anxious to give guidance to its members on the regulations that take effect from 1st April, which is not many days away. The Minister did not respond to that. Could he also mention the cost of the impact on trickle irrigation?
<P>


<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-35_para13"></a>I also understand that there is a slight change in statutory instrument No. 164 of 2003. My understanding is&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that originally it did not include areas of less than one hectare. One hectare does not sound much, but it is two-and-a-half acres. One can carry out a lot of horticulture on two-and-a-half acres. I believe it slipped the Minister's mind to answer my question on statutory instrument No. 164.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   The noble Baroness has mentioned the NFU. We have all received a letter from that organisation and a briefing from the CLA. There is also one from the RICS, but I do not believe that any of them have mentioned the directive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness raises a number of points. It is intended that the third consultation will take place over the summer and will include the draft regulations, as I believe I said, and a public response to those. We intend to meet the deadline of transposing that part of the directive by the end of 2003. That is a fairly quick timescale, but I make no commitment that that will be in place while we consider the Bill. It deals with a different aspect and not the primary aspects covered by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para0"></a>It is true that the Select Committee said that we should consider that, and we may need to look at the issue of primary legislation, but the point in the report to which I refer is paragraph 71, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the important point is the effectiveness of the transposition of the Directive into national law, not the means by which that is achieved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-36_para1"></a>
That gives no primacy to doing that by primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para2"></a>In relation to cross-Border river basins, some complex technical problems are involved. The body for England and Wales is already a cross-Border body. Cross-Border matters between England and Scotland involve rather smaller catchment areas than between England and Wales. Detailed discussions are taking place between the English authorities and the Scottish authorities, primarily between the agency and SEPA.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para3"></a>I apologise to the noble Baroness for not picking up the point relating to the application to agricultural projects. That covers a gap in the regulations where it is necessary to transpose the directive. That means that it will apply to those sectors of agriculture that are not already subject to the planning controls or to abstraction controls and covers a gap in the 1987 directive.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para4"></a>On the environmental impact assessment, the test has significant environmental effects. That is the same test as was in the 1987 directive. On our estimation the number of new projects that would be covered would be relatively few. Therefore, most land use that fell under that requirement would already be covered by previous directives. It may help the noble Baroness if I write to her setting out the terms of the earlier regulation in that respect.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para5"></a>Rather than write the speech that the noble Earl will deliver at Masham town hall, I shall write to him about the way in which we see the development of co-ordination on river basin water management. The key <P>


<a name="column_GC51"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>role, as I and the noble Baroness, Lady Young, have indicated, would be with the Environment Agency, but clearly it is a little more complicated than that. The powers of the agency would play a significant part, but other aspects would require private landowners and other private operators to play their part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   It is important for the noble Lord to appreciate that in our case there is a great willingness for all interested parties to co-operate in such a scheme. Matters appear to have gone wrong, whether through lack of finance or through direction or whatever, because the project officer has not been appointed by the Environment Agency. Without such a project officer to act as a catalyst the scheme will not work. If we could get that far down the line, I believe that there would be a tremendous willingness among many interested parties to make the scheme work without necessarily calling upon the Environment Agency to produce substantial resources.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the Minister answers that point, perhaps he could reply to two points that I raised: first, the difference between the directive, including land under a hectare; and, secondly, he said that the directive would not affect many in agriculture at the moment, but trickle irrigation, which I believe many people will use, is not included.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I shall have to write to the noble Baroness about the situation on less than one hectare. I am unable to respond to that immediately. On the second point, trickle irrigation is introduced under the Bill and indirectly by some of the transposition. However, if it were to require an EIA (environmental impact assessment) it would need to have a significant environmental effect. Some projects would automatically go through and for others, where there was a query that the environmental impact would be large, we would require the full EIA procedure in the estimate. That would be a limited number of projects of all kinds, including trickle irrigation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   Perhaps I could comment on some of the Minister's responses before my noble friend replies. He stated that there were four pieces of legislation. In promoting a Bill it is perfectly normal to state on the face of the Bill that it will amend the Water Resources Act 1991, the Water Industry Act 1991 and the Reservoirs Act 1975. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was trying to bring a piece of European legislation, the Water Framework Directive, within the ambit of the Bill. That is straightforward; it is a one-off. I point out to the Minister that the amendment refers to the England and Wales Directive 2000/60 EC. I have that document which states clearly that this is the directive of 23rd October 2000. It establishes a framework for community action in the area of water policy. Why will the consultation on that directive not be completed until the end of 2003?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I thought I had explained. The consultation on the directive has been a three-phase matter. Two of those phases have been completed. The <P>


<a name="column_GC52"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>third phase will be completed this year well in time to meet the deadline set out in the directive. I do not believe that there is an issue of slow progress by the Government on it. We have engaged many people to look at how the directive should be transposed. On his more general point, the issue is not what we describe the Bill as, even if we were to adopt a catch-all purpose clause; but what is the normal procedure of this Parliament in dealing with European directives.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Will the Minister be more specific on that point? He says that we have engaged a lot of people, but what is a lot of people in the terms of something as wide as the directive?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am sorry; I did not quite catch that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   The Minister says that we have engaged a lot of people in the consultation. In his terms for the directive, is that 1,000, 5,000 or 20,000 people?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I have absolutely no idea. We write to a lot of organisations&#151;probably hundreds&#151;in the course of consultation, as Members of the Committee know. I have no way of telling how many people they then engage in discussion. I would assume that those who respond have themselves engaged with many of their members and those whom they claim to represent. However, I am afraid that there is no way for me to give a definitive answer.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para6"></a>We have engaged in a three-stage consultation on the directive, as we would with any detailed legislation. The directive itself gives us three years to transpose it. The timescale towards its complete implementation takes us in some respects as far as 2015. That is why I referred to 2015 earlier, which the noble Earl criticised. We are at the beginning of a long-term process in which, as Members of the Committee have said, we have to engage and inform people, and to bring them together to deliver the intentions of the directive and the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para7"></a>I am clearly unconvinced, however, that one way to do that is to spend an awful lot of time trying to produce one consolidated piece of legislation to reflect all the different aspects, many of which are already in place and with which people are already reasonably familiar.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew11"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I have a note that states that the programmes of measures for water-basin districts must be operational under Article 11(7) by 22nd December 2012. Will the Minister help me with that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Different parts of the regulations have to be completed at different times.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That applies to primary legislation as much as it does to European legislation. I do not think that the noble Duke should be seriously surprised at that.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-36_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have spoken to the amendment. Each one, at least on our side, has given an interesting picture as to why we feel that it is necessary. The Water Framework Directive is all-embracing. The noble Earl, Lord Peel, and the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, outlined very well why it will affect people, not only in land management terms. It will affect them socially, through their pockets in terms of the bills that they pay, and in many other ways with which I do not think the Government have yet been fully seized.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para8"></a>One point that has been made again and again is that of costs and benefits, and how they will vary in terms of transposition. The Minister says that he has consulted a lot of people, and I suggest that consultation begins with Parliament, with democratic consultation. For that reason, I am particularly disappointed that the Government continue to resist having the Water Framework Directive in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para9"></a>I must declare an interest at this stage, because my husband chairs a voluntary committee in Somerset that is trying to bring together land and water managers, the Environment Agency, the voluntary sector and others to conduct a pilot into the management mentioned by the noble Earl. The evidence from the Select Committee gives the Government's official terms, stating at question 22 that they have made only a belated decision to conduct one pilot in the Ribble valley. I do not call that broad consultation. Until one has had some pilots and people can see how they are working on the ground, they cannot understand what the idea is about. It is an exciting opportunity, but very complicated to put into practice.
<P>

<a name="30327-36_para10"></a>I certainly bow to the knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, which is far superior to mine as to whether my amendment achieves the purposes that I wish. If it does not in his judgment, I will certainly look at it again.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-37_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   In any case, I hope to come up with something that will more exactly achieve the purpose that I wish, if the amendment will not achieve that.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para0"></a>Without a kick-start, the directive is still likely to be implemented by the Government in a piecemeal, late and unco-ordinated way. I feel great sadness that we cannot scrutinise and debate it so as to give us much more influence over how it is transposed. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, says that the CLA, the NFU and the RICS have not mentioned the directive in their briefings, but they certainly mentioned it in their evidence to the committee. I suggest to him that they have not mentioned it in their briefings because they have become depressed by the Government's attitude and the fact that it will not be in the Bill. When they see that there is a will in the House to put it in, I am sure that they will brief us and the Government at length on it.

<a name="30327-37_para1"></a>The Minister said that consolidation was too difficult. I do not accept that we should be held back by that. Let us be a bit more ambitious. I found it refreshing to read the Scottish Bill&#151;and with that, I should say that perhaps we should have fines whenever a bad pun about water is committed, and at the end we could give the funds to WaterAid. The Scottish Bill was in extremely plain English. I accept that Scotland does not have all the complications that England does, but nevertheless I feel that we should focus on a consolidated Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para2"></a>Perhaps the provisions are a good place for the Government to start. They could put into practice a principle, which they should have, that the general public can understand what on earth legislation is about. It is difficult for Members of the Committee to understand. I too appreciated the Government's efforts in giving us amended copies of the previous Bills so that we could see what the effect was. My goodness, I should think that even the draftsmen have huge difficulty. It would be nice if we could start on that principle for something as important and basic as water.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para3"></a>The Minister mentioned that there would be delay if the amendment were agreed to. The directive has to be transposed in principle by the end of the year, so I do not accept that the delay would be likely to be very long.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para4"></a>I am not sure how the Environment Agency views the lack of transposition of the directive. I suspect that it will work one way or the other, whichever it is given, because it will have to. The noble Lord said that it had adequate resources. I would have thought that it would have welcomed the certainty of the directive being transposed. Many others have wanted to be sure in that way, notably the water industry, for which certainty was particularly important. That wish for certainty ran through many pieces of evidence, including from the Wildlife Trusts. If the Environment Agency were frank, it might welcome it too.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para5"></a>Scotland is different, apparently, but I do not believe that it is different in relation to the amendment. It has to transpose the legislation, as do we. As the Bill goes through Committee, I for one will watch out sharply for when we need primary legislation. We are certainly unlikely to see another water Bill within the next five years, so I suspect that we may even see some government amendments tabled, because the Government will recognise that pieces of the directive will need primary legislation. In the meantime, heartened by the support that I have had, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "DUTY TO CONSERVE WATER RESOURCES

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-37_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is tiny compared to the first two. I am very hopeful that the Minister might look sympathetically on it, because I would have thought that it was in the interests of all of us to wish to conserve water resources. We have all said clearly that we desire to use water carefully. Indeed, our subsequent amendments look specifically at that. However, to state that on the Bill would give greater encouragement not only to those in the industry or in business using water, but to us as individuals.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para10"></a>I well remember my noble friend Lady O'Cathain saying that when she turned the tap on and then put the toothpaste on the toothbrush, she realised that she had allowed the water to run. Ever since, I now do that in reverse. Such silly actions are hugely important. The amendment is only very small, but I hope that it will receive great support from the Committee. I want to speak to it more fully after that broad introduction.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para11"></a>The Water Industry Act 1991 lays a duty on water undertakers to encourage efficient use of water. The amendment would widen the responsibility and should result in a government campaign similar to the good campaigns currently under way on, for example, energy conservation. Government departments and agencies should be set targets for improved use of water. Private industry already does that. Rio Tinto, for example, is introducing a scheme throughout the company. It has wider aims of increasing water-use efficiency, especially by increasing its use of recycled water and reducing its need for fresh water.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para12"></a>There is also a need to inform the public&#151;we touched on that in great detail on the previous amendment&#151;about water usage. We must encourage them to use water sensibly and to conserve it. There was much information during the drought years, but since then our minds might have slipped away from the need to conserve water.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para13"></a>As Members of the Committee will know, the Bill has taken three years to come before us. In fact, it was originally a reaction to a drought. Since then we have had extensive flooding, often unfortunately at the wrong time of year. There has been a lot of water. However, that should not take our eye off the ball. There is a need to require people to conserve water, even when it is in abundance. The Select Committee report states on page 35 that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the first&#151;and perhaps over-riding&#151;conclusion of our inquiry is that the Directive needs much greater public promotion".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-37_para14"></a>
That is hugely important.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para15"></a>I am trying to encourage the Minister that the amendment is only a few words&#151;five&#151;to accept. I hope that, with the support of others around the Committee, we can persuade him to accept it to the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My noble friend says most disarmingly that the amendment is only five words, but those five words are fundamental to the whole future of water in this country. I will not go back to the toothbrush analogy, but people simply do not realise <P>


<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>how valuable water is or how easy it is to conserve. They do not realise that it is in their interests to do so, not only as consumers now, but for following generations.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para16"></a>One big issue that came out at Second Reading was the stunning information given to us by the Environment Agency about the shortage of water per capita in parts of this country, by comparison with Sudan and Ethiopia. If those facts were brought home to the public in a greater way, I am sure that everyone would be prepared to act. It is not as though the Government are saying, "Don't drive your car". That would inconvenience people, but being sensible about conserving water would not. It merely means that they become slightly more responsible, and I support the amendment absolutely.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_time0"></a><H5>5 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-37_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I was delighted to hear the noble Baroness talk about the water shortages that I pointed out at Second Reading, particularly those in the south and south-east of the country. A number of requirements are already laid on elements of the water industry to promote water efficiency. Ofwat requires water companies to undertake a basic minimum level of activity unless supplies are under pressure, when a more active approach is necessary. Such an approach is not defined. In practice, some water companies do the minimum that they think that they can get away with in the face of Ofwat's requirement.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para17"></a>It is not just the water companies that are involved. Households could save up to 40 per cent of water through efficiency measures, both in design of houses and low-water appliances. Industry could save 30 per cent with even the most simple and cost-effective measures. There has not been as much estimation of the water efficiency savings that could be achieved in agriculture, but the dairy industry could probably make savings of upwards of 20 per cent. More effective irrigation methods could have a major impact on water use. There is a long way to go if we are to have the water efficiency level necessary in view of pressures on the water system.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para18"></a>From all that, one might think that I would support the amendment, but I am afraid that I do not. It seems to be one of those nice, motherhood-and-apple-pie amendments that admonishes the Secretary of State to admonish the rest of the world. A number of amendments on water efficiency take a more targeted approach, including Amendment No. 74, whenever we get to it. The noble Baroness has raised an important issue, but the amendment may not be the one to deliver the right action in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I certainly support the amendment. Contrary to what the noble Baroness said, I believe that it lays out some very important principles relating to the conservation of one of our most precious commodities. We have to be responsible in that respect.
<P>


<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para19"></a>In the Water Industry Act 1991, the industry itself had to ensure that wastage was minimised. There is still a lot of wastage in the industry, but it is better than it was in 1991. There are still tales of about 25 per cent wastage, but we have to look at the state of the infrastructure. It was probably put in place by our great-grandparents, and has done very well for the past 120 years or so.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para20"></a>We debated metering at Second Reading and how there were scarcities of water in different parts of the UK, as the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, said. In the South East, metering could be very effective so far as consumers and users are concerned. In other parts of the country where population pressure is not so great, the infrastructure is often in quite a state. Indeed, the pressure for metering in such places may not be so great. That will have to be resolved, and it will no doubt be debated further in greater detail.
<P>

<a name="30327-37_para21"></a>Sadly, we have heard recently of other problems to do with the supply of water in the Middle East and how scarce it is. We need to do everything that we can in terms of the efficient use of water, and ensure that conservation is right at the heart of the legislation.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I also want to speak in favour of the amendment. In doing so, I reiterate an interest that I declared at Second Reading, which is that I hold an abstraction licence. By declaring that, I keep my hands well washed&#151;that is another pound into the pot suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I also want to put on record how grateful I am to have been briefed by the water industry, the Environment Agency and Ofwat before the Bill. Those briefings have been extremely informative and helpful.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para0"></a>I shall not lay any responsibility or say who the offender was, but in those briefings we discussed water resources and how one might have additional ones. It transpired that in the territory, shall we say, of one major water company, the nearest and most easily accessible additional water resource that it had was the water leaking out of its own pipes. The quantity was very large. When we put the duty to conserve water resources in that context, it is very significant.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para1"></a>It has already been said that many water companies have had enormous success in terms of improvements, and that becomes extremely hard work below a certain point. However, if one installs the correct recording procedures so that one knows exactly what is happening&#151;some water companies have done so&#151;one can tackle leakage, and leakage is a resource. It is a significant factor.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para2"></a>Metering has been mentioned. If the development suggested in the South East goes ahead, it will help metering, because the practice in this part of the world is that all new houses are metered. The proportion of houses with meters will by definition rise.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para3"></a>My final observation on good use of water resources is a different aspect of the same point, and I am persuaded of it by looking abroad. One finds that other countries, especially the drier parts of the United States, are terribly good about ensuring that irrigation <P>


<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>water is already soiled water that has been rough-cleaned to a state in which it is suitable for such a use. The irrigation process becomes part of the recycling process and the cleaning process.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para4"></a>We can do a great deal if we set about that. However, in this country we do not work and think in that way enough. We might if the principle were enunciated in the Bill. I am sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, would not support the amendment, as it would help enormously by enunciating that significant principle. If it were included in the Bill, everyone would then know that they had to take the principle into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-38_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I support my noble friend. If one is to have a water Bill, it seems totally logical that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall take all necessary steps to encourage the efficient use of water".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-38_para5"></a>
I cannot think of anything more sensible, frankly.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para6"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, I was disappointed that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, did not support the amendment. I think that she said that she preferred the targeted approach. To me, that conjures up the idea that the Government, and through them her agency, will take a selective approach. I am not sure that that puts out all the right messages. I noticed, of course, that she was selective and chose agriculture as an example on which efficiencies could be made. She was absolutely right. However, we must not forget the fact that agriculture is responsible for only 2 per cent of the total amount of water abstracted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I would certainly like to support the amendment. Later amendments are targeted and I welcome the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for our Amendment No. 74. However, the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, lays the ground that efficient use of water should be a basic principle of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para7"></a>I am not entirely sure what has happened to the Government's resolve, as stated in Taking Water Responsibly. Perhaps the Minister will say where that went. They stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government will bring forward legislation, when Parliamentary time allows, to place water companies under an enforceable duty to conserve water in carrying out their functions. It will also bring forward legislation, when Parliamentary time allows, to place all other abstractors under an enforceable duty to use water abstracted . . . in an efficient and effective manner".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-38_para8"></a>
They went on at great length in promotion of efficient use. I accept that they did not seem to lay a responsibility on themselves to ensure that that happened, but that duty was implicit on the Secretary of State throughout Taking Water Responsibly. Why else would the Government publish something with that title?
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para9"></a>I was also very struck by some words at the beginning of Water Wise, an excellent little book produced by the Environment Agency. They state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"By investing a little time and money in implementing a simple water management plan, your organisation could reduce its water consumption by up to 80 per cent, releasing money to be invested in other parts of your business".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-38_para10"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
I suggest that that would apply to public bodies, private businesses and private households. By simply encouraging people or organisations to take that line, and by having a duty to enable them to do so, the Secretary of State would be doing a great service financially to many organisations and people. Companies could justify to their shareholders that they were making investments because they had to.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para11"></a>I further remind the Minister of the statements that he made yesterday, when he was talking about encouraging the labelling of appliances and so on to be energy efficient. He was replying to my Question on the successful Are You Doing Your Bit Campaign, and talked about the fact that the Government would do more to encourage efficient use of energy. He did not use the word resources but, in considering the Bill, we must regard water in the same way in which we regard energy. I shall return to that subject later in terms of water conservation. After all, it takes a large amount of energy even to clean water up, so the two are linked.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para12"></a>The amendment paves the way for the more targeted amendments later in the Bill, and I assure the noble Baroness of my support for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that I have some sympathy with what she is saying. Water used efficiently is very important, and we should ensure that the Bill and other measures increase the efficiency with which water is used. My problem with the amendment is that it could confuse the situation as to the burden of responsibility rather than clarify it.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para13"></a>Water companies, Ofwat and the Environment Agency all have duties and powers to promote water efficiency. To put a general duty on the Secretary of State could well confuse that. It would cut across the duties and powers already in place and those proposed in the Bill and elsewhere, and could lead to confusion of roles.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para14"></a>Water undertakers are already under a duty to maintain and develop an efficient and economic system of water supply in their areas. That duty provides the basis for setting annual leakage reduction targets, to which reference has been made&#151;leakages have been reduced by 25 per cent during recent years. Water undertakers are also under a duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. There is therefore a two-tier responsibility. Ofwat continues to require leakage reduction where that is economic, so the regulator is already involved in the matter.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para15"></a>A number of responsibilities fall to the Secretary of State. For example, the Government play an important role in ensuring that leakage targets are set and achieved. The Green Technology Challenge, a scheme introduced in last year's Budget, will offer enhanced capital allowances for investment in designated technologies to minimise water use and improve water quality. So there is a direct role for the Government, but the responsibility in existing statute, the rest of the Bill and the various directives that apply relates to the water companies themselves, to their <P>


<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibility to encourage water efficiency on the part of their consumers and to the regulators, not to the Secretary of State or the Government.
<P>

<a name="30327-38_para16"></a>We may return to the issue when we discuss the amendments to which my noble friend Lady Young of Old Scone and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred, including her own amendment. That may be a more appropriate point at which to consider some form of amendment to the Bill&#151;without committing the Government to accepting those amendments. But here in the Bill and in this form, such an amendment would confuse existing responsibilities. Whatever the merits of raising the issue, the Government do not support such an amendment, five words though it may be, at this point in the Bill.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-38_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   An idea has just struck me. The Minister says that there is a duty on everyone to promote the efficient use of water. That is fine. But there is a difference between conservation and efficiency. One can be efficient in the use of water&#151;for example, one can use one's sprinklers only at night, so that there is no great evaporation&#151;but it would be much better to specify conservation, because some plants do not require to be sprinkled at night. There is a subtle difference. Many people understand the idea of efficient use of water but, because from time to time we are deluged&#151;we have floods and what seems to be constant rain&#151;everyone thinks that there is plenty of water and so are not concerned about conserving it. There is a subtle difference that we should consider further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who spoke in support of the amendment. I am deeply disturbed that the chief executive of the Environment Agency does not think that it is a good idea. Members of the general public will view that with slight concern&#151;I certainly do.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I hope that I did not leave the impression that I do not think that water efficiency is a good idea; I simply said that the amendment was perhaps not the best way to achieve that outcome in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I hear what the noble Baroness says, but I shall read Hansard carefully tomorrow. I do not regard the amendment as in any way an apple-pie amendment; it is hugely important. So I am disappointed that someone who heads the Environment Agency, who will have to deal with the Bill and try to encourage us all&#151;whether we work for water companies or are just private individuals&#151;to ensure that it works, reacts in that way. But there we are.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para0"></a>I must say the same for the Minister; he will not be surprised at that. He said that he was sympathetic, but on this occasion we need more than sympathy. He said that he felt that the amendment cut across duties and confused other roles. Nothing is more confusing than what we are having to do, which is to go through the Bill, which refers to so many different Acts, let alone <P>


<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the statutory instruments and everything else. The amendment would clearly insert at the front of the Bill just a few words, so I am bitterly disappointed that both the Minister&#151;although I do not mean him personally, but the department&#151;and the Environment Agency take that view.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para1"></a>I am grateful to Members of the Committee who have supported my amendment. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith made an interesting suggestion concerning how the issue is being addressed in America. As we all know, some parts of America are very dry.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para2"></a>So I am not at all happy, and if we were on the Floor of the House, I should call for a Division. I register my objection. I am not satisfied, however kindly the Minister put me down, that the Government are unable to accept the amendment. We shall certainly return to it. My noble friend Lord Peel mentioned that agriculture accounts for only 2 per cent of total water drawn down. We as householders should be declaring an interest&#151;we all use water. Each of us uses a lot of water and there are ways in which we can help.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para6"></a>Clause 1 [Licences to abstract water]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-39_spnew2"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 9, after "days" insert "in any period of twelve calendar months"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-39_para7"></a><P>

<a name="30327-39_para8"></a>The noble Duke said: This is a probing amendment to ascertain whether the temporary licence is intended to cover a continuous period or whether, for example, an abstractor could take water once a week from April to September to restock water storage containers. The amendment is also intended to establish whether the temporary licence may be renewed year on year for the same purpose.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para9"></a>Perhaps those Members of the Committee who are modern-technology literate will forgive me if I fall back on old-fashioned imperial measures. I realise that it would take a big bowser for stock to fill one with 4,400 gallons per day before the operation fell within the 20 cubic metres at which a licence is required. However, if someone was in the habit of refilling a swimming pool once a week, he might well exceed the 20 cubic metres threshold on one day of the week, but not as an average over the whole week. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The temporary licences are intended to be used to cover one-off abstractions of a duration of fewer than 28 consecutive days where large volumes of water are needed for short periods&#151;for example, at a summer fair, for pressure testing of pipelines or other episodic events. Under the Government's definition, the Environment Agency will be able to assess the effects of short-duration abstraction of that order in relation to the time of year and current pressures on the system.
<P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para10"></a>With that clarification, the effect of the amendment moved by the noble Duke would be undesirable in several respects. It would allow abstractions on any 27 days in a 12-month period, rather than on 27 consecutive days. It would also allow short duration abstractions at a fixed time over many years&#151;for example, for 27 days, or almost the whole of February, every year for 12 years. I do not think that that is the noble Duke's intention, but that is what his amendment would allow. It would also allow short-duration abstractions over many years at any time of the year&#151;for example, any 27 days in any one year for 12 years.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para11"></a>Any of those cases would represent a fundamental change to what is intended to be the use of temporary licences. In all of them, the Environment Agency would have difficulty assessing what would be the impact and enforcing its decision. In turn, that would increase the time needed to determine the application and would defeat one objective of having a temporary licence provision, which is to deal with situations that may arise suddenly by providing a short-duration licence that can be issued quickly, without going through the lengthier process required for a permanent licence.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para12"></a>With that explanation, I hope that the noble Duke will understand what is intended by temporary licences and that his amendment would significantly worsen the situation.

<A NAME="30327-39_spnew4"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. What he said makes the meaning of the Bill's wording much clearer. We shall have to consider whether what he said is enough to make it clear for ever and a day, or whether some wording still needs to be added to ensure that anyone reading the Bill understands what he has explained to us today. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-39_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 55, which picks up a similar point. That point was mentioned on Second Reading by several of my noble friends&#151;Lord Elliot of Morpeth, Lady O'Cathain and Lord Peel&#151;and by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. Indirectly, it was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, who sought to give reassurance on the issue of discharge licences, which are subject to a four-yearly review that, she says, appears not to cause any problems. I accept that. It may or may not be an argument, but how many times have we all read in legislation that a Minister may decide on different courses of action for different cases? I hate to think how many times I have read that since I have been in the House.

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para16"></a>The problem is the glaring inconsistency between the problems of long-term planning and financing of the water industry&#151;especially of infrastructure&#151;and what we know of the suggested licensing regime under the new system that will operate on 12-year blocks. If one simply considers the problems of providing major reservoirs&#151;or, indeed, catchment area transfer schemes&#151;to supply water over big distances, they probably have at least a 20-year planning and lead-in time before they can be brought into action.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para17"></a>No one, and I seriously mean no one, will consider anything of that nature&#151;it will not even get to first base&#151;on the basis of an assurance of an abstraction licence for 12 years. That is unreal. So we have an immediate and apparent problem. One Member of the Committee has already referred to the fact that parts of the water industry are still running on essentially Victorian infrastructure. I do not suggest that one would necessarily want to introduce a licence that would match the lifetime of the infrastructure, but I hope that we can ensure that, even today, the industry builds to similar standards. The disruption that is caused if we do not is usually a hidden on-cost that the whole of society must reluctantly bear.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para18"></a>One would not build a house on the basis of a 12-year supply of water, but the Government are blithely talking about adding about another 500,000 houses in the south-east of England, where water supplies are already supposed to be under pressure. That is a glaring inconsistency.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para19"></a>This is a probing amendment&#151;although I regard the whole Grand Committee process as a probing process. The amendment would simply require the "issuing authority"&#151;I used that wording deliberately because, without wanting to hurt anyone's feelings, nothing lasts for ever and the Environment Agency may not last as long as much of the infrastructure that it sees installed&#151;to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"take into account the expected life of those related facilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-39_para20"></a>
I shall listen to the Minister's reply with interest, but I suspect that the wording might have been slightly more appropriate if I had used the words, "the funding period", which would at least have allowed the installer to get out of financial trouble. Major infrastructure for the water industry is enormously expensive. It is expensive for whoever undertakes it. If a farmer creates an impounding reservoir to take winter run-off and use it for irrigation in the summer, relatively for him, that is a very high cost. The same argument applies to someone using boreholes for aquifer recharge&#151;as can be done. All those systems are expensive for the person undertaking the work. That is a fundamental point.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para21"></a>I hope that the Government may be somewhat more sympathetic to this amendment than to earlier amendments that, in my view, are equally important. We shall come to the question of licences later, but if there is concern that it will be impractical to manage the abstraction of water in the interests of the catchment area sufficiently well if the licence period is too long, I suggest that that is the problem not of the <P>


<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person holding the licence but of the person issuing licences. We must think carefully, but there is no reason why in particular cases involving major infrastructure costs, or an individual who is undertaking high relative expenditure, people should not have a licence for the full period&#151;at any rate for them to recover their costs. That would make planning such operations much easier.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para22"></a>I shall say no more. I could enter some slightly less productive areas that are, to an extent, red herrings to the issue, but the fundamental point stands. I accept and place on record that the existing system is working extremely well. In my briefing, I am assured that long-term planning continues and that the system is beginning to work extremely well. But if we look for the legislative authority that makes it work, it does not really exist. At least, it is not spelled out.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para23"></a>I am encouraged to the extent that people will undertake what needs to be undertaken regardless of the law. That has always been the case. But some provisions should be in primary legislation, so that everyone knows what is the background and, more importantly, so that some lunatic cannot get hold of the system and make a mess of it. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="30327-39_para24"></a>We feel encouraged by the balance in the Bill that ensures that the habitat side of the business will be protected in a way that it has not been before. However, to have proper regard to sustainability, we must ensure that when people decide to invest in something, the agency will get its judgment right. The amendment places an additional onus on the agency to get its judgment right, so that it does not jeopardise someone who makes an investment only to discover that it was not as good as he thought.
<P>

<a name="30327-39_para25"></a>The Bill includes sufficient safeguards for eventualities that we may not predict, such as periods of drought. The amendment is geared more to times of normality. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<A NAME="30327-40_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My noble friend Lady O'Cathain is absent at the moment, so I shall speak to Amendment No. 55 on her behalf. It asks the Government to take into account the costs that my noble friend mentioned when speaking to a previous amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para0"></a>We have received correspondence and telephone calls from and held interviews with people who are involved in the industry who are worried about future investment if there is no relevant life-expectancy. That will put them off investing. I know that the Minister is well aware that, unfortunately, many of the water companies' existing pipes, and so on, are from the Victorian era. Although they were well built, it is a <P>


<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>long time since then and much of the infrastructure will have to be replaced. Thereby attaches a huge problem.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para1"></a>My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith touched on new build and the associated costs. In passing, I ask the Minister what costs included in the recent announcement by John Prescott about the anticipated new house build in the South East were directed towards providing water and sewerage. I understand that those costs were not included in that estimate. If so, why not? Was it because the costs were too high; or was that just an oversight? We all know that those costs are significant, and it is unfair to expect those who will carry the burden, whether as an individual business&#151;my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith acknowledged his interest in that respect&#151;or as companies, to undertake work when they cannot cover their costs.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para2"></a>If the Minister does not like the amendment&#151;he may well say that he has reservations about it&#151;perhaps he will explain to the Committee what time frame he would consider practical. Other, later, amendments, consider specific businesses, but I do not want to go into the specifics at this stage. This is an overriding, wide-ranging amendment, and it would enormously help the Committee if the Minister were to respond to the questions posed by my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We do not want to put people off investing but to ensure that our future structure is strong and sound.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para3"></a>We all know that we waste so much water, especially through leakage. If licensees will not get a proper term of life-expectancy, is it really fair to expect them to invest as they have during recent years? I support Amendment No. 55, as well as Amendment No. 5.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </B>   I support the amendment, because it encapsulates an important principle that applies to other amendments that we shall consider. That is that to judge the effectiveness and fairness of legislation such as this, one should take into account its impact on users of water, the industries that must use water and the many other constraints under which they work&#151;such as, in the end, setting adequate investment and planning horizons. The amendments would help the setting of investment and planning horizons that would lead to the efficient use of water, and therefore increase the worthiness of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-40_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   It is worth adding that any such business is likely to have bank borrowings. The bank will of course seek security when negotiating such borrowings, so I support the amendment from that perspective, which is integral to businesses that rely on abstraction licences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-40_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, rather took the wind from my sails by citing my example on Second Reading of sewage treatment works, which are regularly reviewed on a four to six-year basis and may have their licences altered with no compensation, although they have a right of appeal. So a 12-year <P>


<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>licence is more secure. Since the noble Lord stole that example, I was trying to think of others from other regulatory fields, but I could not think of one that was not parallel to the Bill's provisions, as opposed to those of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para4"></a>For example, under the integrated pollution prevention and control regime, factories, including some of our major chemical complexes, are regularly regulated. In many cases, they involve extremely high-cost, long-term investment, but their licences are renewed every six years. Nuclear power stations and reprocessing plants have an asset life-span of not just tens or fifties but of thousands of years, bearing in mind the waste legacy issues, but they also have licences that are reviewed over a few years.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para5"></a>Investment occurs right across the industrial and commercial world where it is not possible for businesses to say with absolute certainty that they will hold a single licence of an entirely predictable nature for the entire length of their business. If we look elsewhere in the regulatory regime, we will understand that that is not a deterrent to investment.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para6"></a>Indeed, water company investment is in a blessed state, in that it is one area of life where we have a long-term, strategic forward view. The sustainability of an abstraction proposition is assessed at the point of licensing to ensure that it is environmentally sustainable over a number of years. That decision is made against the background of the company's long-term water resource plan and the nation's water resources strategy, which stretches 25 years in advance.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para7"></a>When it comes to renew such licences, it would be strange if there had been such substantial change from the forward look over that 25-year period that the water resources strategy implies that there needed to be huge dislocation in the licence. It is more likely that there would be fine-tuning, such as the other industries that I mentioned&#151;our major industrial complexes and nuclear power stations&#151;take in their stride as part of their normal business process.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Investment in water facilities of all sorts is very important for the Government and the regulators. Part of the reasoning behind the amendments is probably misplaced, in that the Bill does not fix the duration of any new abstraction licence, it simply requires a time limit to be placed on every licence. When considering the length of licences or their renewal, the Environment Agency, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, said, must take account of the abstracter's reasonable needs, which includes the need for investment. Indeed, if the agency were not to take such needs into account, it would be open to challenge. If that led to a decision that a long-term licence was needed, the agency would have to act accordingly. But it is up to the agency to decide the licence duration on a case-by-case basis and in a way which fulfils its primary duty to consider local water resources.
<P>


<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para8"></a>It would therefore be inappropriate to incorporate a criterion such as fixed duration or to include a single unilateral criterion on asset lifetime which would be seen to override other criteria, not least the basic environmental criteria that are the objectives of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para9"></a>The agency must consider costs and benefits in the exercise of its powers by virtue of its obligations under Section 39 of the Environment Act 1995. That will clearly include some of the issues referred to in this debate.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para10"></a>The agency has recently published guidance on how it will address the duration and renewal of licences. Licences longer than what it regards as the normal 12-year period will be considered if the tests set out in Taking Water Responsibly are met and therefore justify a licence for longer than 12 years. Neither the duration nor the exemption from the duration are matters for the Bill. They require the Environment Agency to use its judgment on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para11"></a>The Government accept many of the more general points made in this discussion about the need for investment, to ensure that planning takes account of that need and that the regulatory provisions are sensitive to it. However, it would be inappropriate to write a single criterion into the Bill. With all respect to the noble Lord, it is quite a crude criterion relating to the lifetime of a specific asset with no cross-reference to the environmental outcome. Although many of the considerations to which he refers are appropriate for consideration by the agency, I do not think that including them in the way he suggests would help.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Byford, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, and the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, for their support for the principle of the amendment&#151;even if the wording is not perfect. I also thank my noble friend Lord Peel for what he said.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, spoke about industries being regulated under the integrated pollution prevention and control legislation. I, too, had something to do with that passing through the House. I have lived not exactly under the shadow of a nuclear power station, but there is one not far from where I live, for a long time, so I am well aware of the problems that they can create.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para13"></a>It is essential that industries producing discharges which can cause immediate and direct environmental damage if they escape should be regularly reviewed. I do not doubt that those industries are only too aware of that and review their own procedures even more regularly than might the Environment Agency. That is different from this instance, where we are dealing with the abstraction and use of a natural resource.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para14"></a>If we are considering, as we are obliged to do in the long-term planning process, the construction of a new major reservoir costing many millions of pounds and all the infrastructure involved in processing that water and getting it to customers, that process will not start. <P>


<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC68</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As I understand it, there is no presumption of renewal of a licence. We shall come to that later in the Bill, but it is absolutely fundamental.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para15"></a>I am aware, as the Minister has acknowledged, that the Environment Agency can, if it wishes, consider a longer-term basis for abstraction licences. If major problems are to be resolved in the future, longer-term abstraction licences must be considered.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para16"></a>I was a little concerned when the Minister said that licences for longer periods could not be issued without a concern for the environmental criteria, which is the primary reason behind much of the Bill. In a way, that is right and proper, but that consideration must be made before we even begin to consider issuing a licence, if it is to be issued at all. Once one has a licence and infrastructure costs mount up, one is committed on behalf of communities across the country, one by one. One cannot, at some point, turn off the tap because a wetland might be becoming a little dry. That is impractical.
<P>

<a name="30327-40_para17"></a>We shall have to return to this issue. We are considering what should be in the Bill. I have always believed that one should try to write into the Bill the primary matters which make it comprehensible for ordinary people, so that they understand the guiding parameters backing a service such as the water industry. Most thinking people would feel concern at the possible inconsistency&#151;I put it no higher than that&#151;between practice on the ground and the reality with which the industry has to work. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30327-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-41_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "IMPOUNDING TO CREATE LARGE RESERVOIRS
<br>
(1) The Agency, prior to granting a licence to a water company to impound water in a large reservoir, shall conduct&#151;
<br>
(a) an environmental impact assessment;
<br>
(b) a social impact assessment; and
<br>
(c) the subjection of plans to the local planning authority to obtain planning permission.
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State in England and the First Minister in Wales shall have the power to refer such planning applications to a public inquiry."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-41_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: We are addressing three amendments. Amendment No. 6 deals with the impounding of large reservoirs; that is specific to reservoirs that have a capacity of more than 25,000 cubic metres. Amendment No. 7 relates to smaller reservoirs&#151;my noble friend Lady Miller will speak to it. Amendment No. 8 addresses compensatory flow into river systems from reservoirs.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para2"></a>Amendment No. 6 relates to impounding to create large reservoirs. The new clause states that the agency, prior to granting a licence to a water company to impound water in a large reservoir, shall conduct three things in principle&#151;an environmental impact assessment, a social impact assessment and the subjection of plans to the local planning authority to obtain planning permission. The second part of the <P>


<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new clause would ensure that the Secretary of State in England and the First Minister in Wales shall have the power to refer such planning applications to a public inquiry.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para3"></a>This is a very important new clause. Indeed, as someone who comes from Wales, I believe it is crucial. We believe that the Bill should guide the conduct of the water company in increasing the water capacity, if that is its wish. When one dams a valley or other area, which is often in an environmentally sensitive area anyway, the impact can have an enormous downside and completely change the environment of the area where the reservoir is created. Local communities are often completely disrupted where a valley has been dammed. In the past, entire communities have been lost under the waters&#151;drowned, literally&#151;and the inhabitants have had to be relocated elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para4"></a>It is obvious that any plans would have to come within the ambit of the local planning authority to obtain planning permission. As a fallback position, there must be an appeals mechanism so that an appeal can be made on all those aspects&#151;perhaps to oppose any such development. The purpose and function of the proposal is to try to prevent communities from flooding, with the loss of livelihood, housing and community facilities and amenities, in addition to the environmental factors that I mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para5"></a>There is another aspect to that in that reservoirs can also be extended. A proposal is being considered that might extend one of the reservoirs in mid-Wales to twice its size. That is in the Elan valley.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para6"></a>I see the amendment as a protection of communities and a way to give them the means to appeal against someone coming along and basically saying, "We are going to drown your valley".
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para7"></a>I point out the number of reservoirs in Wales and the large city conurbations which they supply. I will write out their names for the benefit of the Hansard writers. One at Llandegfedd, near Pontypool, is a totally different type of reservoir to the ones in mountainous areas, and is basic to the water supply to south-east Wales.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para8"></a>The Talybont reservoir in the Brecon Beacons supplies Newport, along with the Usk reservoir; the Crai reservoir supplies Swansea; the Taf Fechan system in the Beacons supplies Cardiff&#151;there are three of those reservoirs; the Ystradfellte reservoir supplies Swansea; and the Llyn Brianne supplies Swansea and also transfers water. The Elan valley complex, which was very wisely invested in by the citizens of Birmingham in Victorian times, supplies almost, but not entirely, all of Birmingham's water supply. The Vyrnwy supplies Liverpool. The Celyn, which also supplies Liverpool, involved the flooding of Tryweryn. That did more for creating Welsh nationalism than any other act of any body in the United Kingdom in the past 50 years. The Brenig reservoir supplies north Wales, the Clywedog regulates the River Severn and the Llys-y-fran reservoir supplies Haverfordwest and Milford Haven.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para9"></a>That is just a few of the reservoirs in Wales&#151;there are many more. People in Wales will say that they do not want any more of their valleys flooded, thank you very much, and they do not want to lose a single additional community. In 1970, two valleys were saved from damming&#151;the Senni, in the area I come from, near Brecon, and the Dulais, in Montgomeryshire. Indeed, my noble friends Lord Hooson and Lord Thomas of Gresford became local heroes because, with the flood defence committee, they prevented both valleys being flooded. They contained substantial communities, not just farmhouses. During drought conditions, it is sad to see heaps of rubble in low water that used to contain communities, very often Welsh speaking.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para10"></a>The amendment would ensure that that historical situation does not repeat itself. We were talking earlier about the conservation of water. An efficient use of water should, if conducted properly, prevent such things from happening in the future. However, I fear that doubling the size of one of the Elan valley reservoirs will be quite an issue. It will impact entirely on another river system as well, so it is very important for the environmental aspects to be fully considered.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para11"></a>Amendment No. 8 is all about compensatory flow from reservoirs into river systems. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Agency shall set volumes of compensatory water flows to be released from reservoirs and impoundments into rivers in sufficient quantity to sustain the water quality and ecology of river systems".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-41_para12"></a>
This Bill is all about sustainability. I assure noble Lords that there are many instances, particularly during long summers, when acute observation shows rivers becoming ecologically unviable. One can see what happens to oxygen levels; there are dead fish in the river, and insect life is reduced. During the summer there is very often a conflict of priorities. The great demand for water conflicts with the need for sustainability. Decisions are taken, orders are made and often, because consumers or industries are running seriously short of water, the poor old river's compensatory flow becomes reduced. This can be very damaging; in bad drought years, the impact on the ecology of river systems can last for at least the next five years.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para13"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that throughout the year volumes of compensatory water flow from reservoirs continue to be released into rivers to ensure that they remain ecologically sustainable. It is my privilege to speak to Amendments Nos. 6 and 8, and my noble friend Lady Miller will address Amendment No. 7. I beg to move.

But I believe that what they have in common is the proportionate nature of regulation. As my noble friend has outlined, there clearly needs to be a strengthening of regulation. However, Amendment No. 7 would lighten the regulation with regard to small impoundments that <P>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>farmers, in particular, make on their lands when precipitation is at its greatest&#151;in January, February and March.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para14"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 7 is to encourage farmers and landowners to store winter water and to obviate the requirement for multiple consents for a very simple operation. Let me explain how complicated the Bill will make such a simple exercise as creating a small pond on a farm either for wildlife, for use later in the year to irrigate crops or for any other reasonable use.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para15"></a>The 25,000 cubic metres that I have suggested seems large when written down but it is not a large amount of water. Under the Bill as it stands, farmers who wanted to store that amount of water, would need the following consents: they would need consent under the Land Drainage Act 1991; an obstruction licence time-limited consent; an impoundment licence; and certification under the Reservoirs Act 1975. I will be encouraged if the Minister tells me that farmers will not need quite that many consents. However, for the creation of a small pond on a farm, that is over-regulation.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para16"></a>Furthermore, some of the other laudable efforts that the Government are making in terms of their agri-environment schemes are encouraging the creation of small ponds and habitats that can be created by ponds.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para17"></a>Habitat creation would be one benefit. A second would be that at times of floods, not quite so much water would be going downstream. Therefore, flooding problems further down the system could be alleviated if several landowners and farmers followed this pattern of working.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para18"></a>Thirdly, if water were flowing that fast, it would be likely to trap some of the silt and diffuse pollution so it would keep water quality downstream better. I have already mentioned the important subject of habitat.
<P>

<a name="30327-41_para19"></a>So there would be a lot of benefits to the environment and the public. This is one area that the Water Framework Directive catchment management system could encourage, but the small amounts of water specified in the Bill discourages this approach. It will mean more paperwork, more licence fees and will discourage the farmer. The Government have spoken about better regulation; I remind them that of the five principles of good regulation, which I have here, the first is to be proportionate; regulators should intervene only where necessary. My amendment would take out a completely unnecessary regulation.

<A NAME="30327-42_spnew0"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   At the risk of being accused of being a little boring about the amendment spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, Scottish legislation has introduced the concept of a water use licence that allows for both abstraction and discharge activities. Bringing everything together under a single licence might be a step towards simplification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I support these amendments in principle, although I have some hesitation about parts of them. Again, this is a question of what should be on the face of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para0"></a>I should like to speak first to the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, and then come back to Amendment No. 7, which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, spoke to afterwards. Amendments Nos. 6 and 8 refer specifically to issues relating to very large reservoirs. While I may sympathise with the number of inundated Welsh valleys, it sounded as though an awful lot of that inundation was for the benefit of the people of Wales. However, I have some sympathy about Birmingham.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para1"></a>The noble Lord will correct me if I am wrong, but with regard to Amendment No. 6 it would be quite remarkable if an environmental impact assessment were not already required in planning a really large reservoir, so I think that point would be covered. So, indeed, would the planning issues: one simply could not build one of these reservoirs nowadays without planning coming into it. The planners would have their say and demand their fee. It is slightly different for the very small reservoirs, but planning, as well as planning inquiries, can already be authorised.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para2"></a>I am sure that no responsible water service provider would undertake work without having made a social impact assessment. However, when making such an assessment, it is difficult to know where to draw the boundaries? Do we draw them within the confines of the reservoir or at the limits of the wider community that might benefit? If there is to be a proper social impact assessment, one needs to look at the wider issue rather than the narrow one. Ultimately, it would come down to proper compensation. Very often in this country, proper compensation is restricted by the current compensation law, a separate issue which is nothing to do with the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para3"></a>If we had more flexible and easier compensation laws so that people were better and more fully compensated for the very real loss and disruption that they might suffer if a valley in which they were resident were flooded, many of the difficulties in the planning process would disappear. We do not have such a system, unfortunately, but perhaps it is as well to mention that point yet again. I think we will find, when the Minister replies, that the points proposed in Amendment No. 6 are largely covered.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para4"></a>Amendment No. 8 proposes a new use for reservoirs&#151;I am sure that it is being considered&#151;slightly stronger than the current practice. Reservoirs are used largely for storage and, to a certain extent, to maintain flow, but not as the primary purpose of constructing a reservoir.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para5"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, is serious about his amendment, the almost certain consequence will be that reservoirs will need to be somewhat larger than they are at present. If we are going to use reservoirs as a proper part of water management to maintain flow during periods when it would otherwise be low, and to reduce flow when it is high, larger reservoirs will be needed than are provided at present. The principle of good water management is inherent in the amendment and it merits serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para6"></a>I support Amendment No. 7. We should keep reservoirs of the size referred to in the amendment as much out of the regulatory process as possible. We <P>


<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should bear in mind that we will be impounding what would otherwise be surplus water that is running down rivers and out to sea. It might be necessary to be slightly more flexible about the dates suggested in the amendment, but that problem is covered to a degree by the words "in time of flood".
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para7"></a>For the benefit of those Members of the Committee who are not immediately literate in metric measures of water, 25,000 cubic metres is about 5.5 million gallons. It is 25 megalitres, which is half the volume of water eligible for competitive supply under the competition rules suggested in the Bill. It is a large amount of water, but it is not massive. Expressed another way, it represents 50 acre inches. If you wish to put 4 acre inches on a crop from sowing to maturity&#151;which is about average&#151;you can work out how many acres can be irrigated throughout the season.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para8"></a>This is very important for farm storage, horticultural storage and irrigators. It is a part of water management to the extent that it is using water which would otherwise run out to sea. It is something that should be encouraged in every way. We may need to look at the exact wording of the amendment but it definitely deserves strong support. We should do everything we can to support the principle of the amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-42_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, took us so far around Wales that perhaps I should declare a family interest. Llyn Brianne I know; some of the other reservoirs I do not know. So, if I do have an interest in any of the valleys the noble Lord seeks to protect, I declare it now. I wish that during this beautiful week we had all been able to meet at Llyn Brianne reservoir.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para9"></a>I can reassure the Committee with regard to Amendment No. 6. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, the proposed development of any large reservoir is subject to planning consent under town and country planning law. The developer of a large reservoir must apply for planning consent from the local planning authority and, in the same way that the planning law refers to the ability of the Secretary of State to call-in a planning issue and to call for an inquiry, in Wales that role will be undertaken by the Welsh Assembly. There is also an appeal mechanism.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para10"></a>An impoundment to store in excess of 10 million cubic metres of water&#151;for a horrible moment I thought the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, was going to set the Committee mental arithmetic tests&#151;would require mandatory environmental impact assessment under the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment (England and Wales)) Regulations 1999. Smaller impoundments are subject to environmental impact assessment if they are likely to have a significant environmental effect by reason of factors such as size, nature and location.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para11"></a>Where a project is subject to environmental impact assessment, an environmental statement has to be produced to inform the planning decision. The statement must address a range of issues, including the <P>


<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>effect of the development on the local population. Noble Lords have raised an important point. Although we appreciate their concerns, I hope that when they have had an opportunity to read my response in detail they will agree that the amendment is not necessary in the light of current planning controls.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para12"></a>Amendment No. 7 does not achieve what is sought and could give rise to some practical problems. However, to some extent we support the intention behind the proposal to facilitate the storage of floodwaters without unnecessary bureaucracy. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, this would help reduce flooding and provide stored water for other purposes during drier periods.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para13"></a>We should bear in mind that the controls that are the subject of the clause deal only with impounding works that are constructed across a natural watercourse. By their very nature, such works are usually permanent and can cause significant disruption to flows passing on downstream to neighbouring owners and beyond, with the potential environmental disbenefits that could follow.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-42_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Perhaps I can help the Minister in a practical sense. When a stream is in full flow you could construct a run-off similar to the ones that mills used to have&#151;which would be activated only at times of high-flow&#151;thereby avoiding interruption of the stream. I am grateful for the Minister's support. There are ways round the mechanical difficulties to which she has referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-42_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Yes. But, for the reasons I have outlined, it would not be possible to impose the controls that we are seeking to improve by this clause only during defined months or during periods of flood. I shall obviously give further consideration to the point made by the noble Baroness. It is obvious from the way in which she spoke to her amendment that we share a common aim.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para14"></a>I can give some reassurance in regard to exemptions for water that is diverted into off-stream storage areas in the circumstances covered by the amendment. There is already an exemption in the Water Resources Act for abstractions for land-drainage purposes, which includes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"protection of land against . . . encroachment by water".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-42_para15"></a>
That is the other half of the equation to which the noble Baroness referred with regard to flooding.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para16"></a>While we propose in the Bill to reduce the scope of activities which fall within the exemption in Clause 7, the words I have quoted will remain unchanged. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness that, both now and in the future, water abstracted from a stream or river in times of flood is already, and will remain, exempt from the need for an abstraction licence.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para17"></a>Of course, that deals with only one of the criteria for further exemption suggested by noble Lords. The other is that storage during January to March should also have an exemption. This is more difficult. Sometimes, if we have dry winters, flows during these months may be severely limited. There are some areas <P>


<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC75</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the country&#151;I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, will say that farmers work well together&#151;where several irrigators seek to fill their own reservoirs from the same source of water and there is simply insufficient water for all to have a free hand. The Environment Agency is encouraging the storage of winter water and, rightly, will grant winter water storage licences only in those areas. However, control is needed to ensure that there are fair shares for all.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para18"></a>It is proposed that exemption would be available only if the land-drainage consenting process were applied to the scheme. We understand that the noble Baroness wishes to reduce bureaucracy. The Bill contains no proposals to make storage schemes more complicated. All types of permissions are covered to take into account different issues, such as a scheme's impact on water resource, on flooding and on safety in the case of a large and raised reservoir.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para19"></a>We do not believe that it is good practice to use one regulatory regime to achieve the objective of another. Impounding controls are aimed at ensuring the protection of other users and the environment from the potential stoppage of the flow, whereas the land-drainage systems are there to ensure that we do not aggravate flooding. Any new on-stream impounding structure will require both an impounding licence and a land-drainage consent. We expect the Environment Agency to ensure that applications are co-ordinated to minimise the bureaucracy involved. I hope that that explanation reassures the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para20"></a>We believe that Amendment No. 7 is not necessary and would not work in practice. I hope I have shown that the removal of controls during January to March would not be advisable in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para21"></a>As to Amendment No. 8&#151;I have visions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams, talking about river systems being affected to the disadvantage of those who prefer to catch sewin&#151;the agency already has a duty to protect and, where possible, enhance the environment in exercising its powers and can apply conditions to the licences it grants.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para22"></a>In the grant of any new abstraction or impounding licence the agency will consider the needs of the environment and the rights of existing abstractors. Where it is necessary to attach conditions to the licence in the kind of case referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, the agency can, and already does, constrain the licence to ensure that it is part of a sustainable extraction regime. These licences are in operation and include management arrangements to ensure that the environment is protected.
<P>

<a name="30327-42_para23"></a>I hope that I have given noble Lords the assurances they seek. The subject is quite complex. I have covered a range of issues but, if anyone requires further information after the Committee stage, I shall be delighted to write to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, referred to a number of issues, including compensation. There is no compensation for losing the house in which you were born or the community in which you were brought up. To understand, you need to talk to someone who can tell you, "I was born there", and who points to the middle of a piece of water; who deliberately goes there in the middle of a drought to see where he or she was brought up. It is a very sensitive issue indeed.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para0"></a>The noble Lord referred to the new use of reservoirs in terms of compensatory flow. As the noble Baroness said, reservoirs are used already for compensatory flow. Amendment No. 8 seeks to ensure that it is on the face of the Bill that compensatory flow into rivers should be at a sustainable level and not damage the ecology. I am afraid that, so far as compensatory flow is concerned, some river systems are totally inadequate.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para1"></a>Perhaps the noble Baroness will write to me&#151;or perhaps inform me in a later debate&#151;and specify precisely where these flows are protected in existing legislation. I suspect that it is in the part of the 1991 Act which deals with the water industry.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para2"></a>As to Amendment No. 6, the Minister said that the Secretary of State and the Assembly can call in various applications and that there is an appeal mechanism. Again it would be helpful to know where these assurances can be found in legislation. She said that I should be reassured&#151;I am sure she is right&#151;but one of the reasons for the amendment is to provide reassurance to communities that mechanisms are available to protect them and that there is a proper appeals mechanism. People would be reassured if that were the case.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para3"></a>I did not hear what the Minister said about the environmental impact and its relationship with the local population. I shall need to read Hansard in some detail if I am to return to the issue on Report. I may wish to return to certain aspects of the amendment in the future. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30327-43_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30327-43_para10"></a>The noble Duke said: In moving Amendment No. 9, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 10. Clause 97(5) makes it quite clear that the Bill applies to England and Wales only. The use of the word "otherwise" in Clause 3(12)(b) makes one wonder whether we are entering the areas of cross-border and river-basin districts and all the other issues referred to earlier. Or does it hint at some future development to which the Committee is not so far privy? Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as to the wording in the clause.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para11"></a>Amendment No. 10 is a probing amendment which seeks to remove the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"appears to the Environment Agency"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-43_para12"></a>
and to more clearly define the relevant person. It would not, for example, be reasonable to serve notice on a civil engineer or a contractor who was doing work at the behest of a landowner, even though the constructor may well be "responsible" at the time of those works. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-43_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   As regards Amendment No. 9, the provisions of the Bill apply to England and Wales only. The clause already defines the National Assembly for Wales as having jurisdiction over appeals in Wales and so, by definition, the Secretary of State can have jurisdiction only over appeals in England. Therefore Amendment No. 9 is not necessary.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para13"></a>There seems to be a misunderstanding as to the nature of the clause. Unless I am advised to the contrary before I have dealt with Amendment No. 10, the specific point raised by the noble Duke concerns cross-border river basins. I remember getting into terrible trouble banning lead shot on one side of the border between England and Scotland, so I shall await enlightenment on that issue.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para14"></a>As to Amendment No. 10, Clause 3 allows the agency to serve a notice on a relevant person which would require that person to apply for an impounding licence. The agency will not do this for each and every unlicensed impoundment but only for those where it believes a licence is necessary to secure the proper management of water resources or to protect the environment.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para15"></a>The agency may serve a notice on a number of people&#151;landowners, tenants, those operating impounding works or benefiting from them in other ways. The wide scope of the definition of "relevant person" is to ensure that the person who is in a position to implement the required changes can be identified. Any person who is aggrieved by service of a notice can appeal against it.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para16"></a>The amendment would restrict the range of persons upon whom the agency could serve notice. This could result in the agency not being able to serve notice upon the person who, in all the particular circumstances, bears responsibility for the impounding works.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para17"></a>The Secretary of State would be responsible for the part of a river in England and the National Assembly for Wales would be responsible for the part on the other side. This is where I got into trouble on both sides of an estuary over the issue of flying ducks with lead shot in them. The situation is clearer here because there are simple, physical boundaries.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para18"></a>I see that I may not have convinced the noble Duke. Perhaps I may write to him to clarify the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-43_spnew6"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I would like clarification. It is a puzzle why it should state "otherwise" in the Bill. There is another strange situation. The consultation document outlines river-basin districts. The head waters of the River Tyne begin in Scotland and then flow into England. It would appear that the river basin district will be coupled into the English side of management. If the Secretary of State can exercise his powers only up to the border, what will happen to the part of the River Tyne that is outwith England?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-43_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I shall need to come back to that question. That part of the River Tyne will stay there. Obviously there are other rivers where the same problem will apply. I can see the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, about to rise to speak about the River Severn. It is a complex issue and concerns the judgments that will have to be exercised. Quite clearly a consent in one jurisdiction would have to have regard to any impact it would have along the length of the particular river or waterway. However, before I get into deeper water, it would be wiser for the noble Duke to wait for my letter.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para19"></a>It will be clear cut where such a case arises in Wales because it will fall to the Assembly for resolution. In England it will fall to the Secretary of State. There is not a cross-border basin sub-text. Where the Water Framework Directive has cross-border implications, these are under consideration. The drafting will be a matter of convention.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para20"></a>I have now reached the stage where I am not quite sure that I have followed what I have said myself. It may be wise that we both read Hansard and for me to write to the noble Duke.

<P>

It is water that will be caught in a catchment and the fact that British Waterways may choose to use it for a canal system, or for any other purpose, will simply mean that that water will be unavailable to other systems. That is not a satisfactory situation.
<P>

<a name="30327-43_para28"></a>If the Water Bill intends that water will be better managed on a national basis by the Environment Agency, then to leave out a major water user&#151;and perhaps when he replies the Minister will indicate how much water British Waterways has under its control&#151;would seem irresponsible unless there is an extremely good reason for doing so. I cannot imagine that there is one.

<a name="30327-43_para29"></a>If British Waterways is outwith the regime, it could choose, for example, to sell its water for commercial gain&#151;the Minister will correct me if that is not the case&#151;but why should it not be subject to the same rules and regulations as everyone else?

<P>
<A NAME="30327-44_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I hope that the Minister will take these amendments seriously because they do have merit. There are about 68 British Waterways reservoirs, of which 40 could be exempt from the provisions of the Bill if the amendments are not considered.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para0"></a>Indeed, in the early discussion on Taking Water Responsibly, those reservoirs were included in the system that the Bill was intended to control, but they disappeared from the Bill itself. We can only speculate why. The amendment would bring those reservoirs back into the system of control under the Bill. I have a number of reasons for asking the Minister to consider the amendment. First, the whole system regulated under the Bill is in a state of change. I refer to changing environmental conditions and climate change. Many canals are being upgraded and restored and their use is changing dramatically. Indeed, some reservoirs are being expanded. It is important that reservoirs are included in the licensing system to enable them to be reviewed and reassessed in terms of their environmental impact and their impact on water for other users.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para1"></a>Secondly, I refer to reservoirs discharging only to canals. The issue in terms of their water use is not where the water goes to, but where it comes from in terms of the catchment. All reservoirs impact on catchments. Negotiations are already under way with British Waterways on improving the control of some <P>


<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the reservoirs which will remain outside licensing control under the Bill as presently drafted. However, that process is based on good will.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para2"></a>Thirdly, if the Water Framework Directive has an integrated approach to catchments it is highly likely that abstractions that impact on catchments will need to be subject to the control system if we are to comply with the directive.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para3"></a>Last but not least, I refer to a lack of equity. If the Bill is enacted in its present form, some reservoirs will be exempted from the measure but controlled by the canals Acts&#151;some of the canals Acts are as aged as the hills&#151;whereas others will be controlled by licences under the Bill. I believe that that signals a lack of equity, a two-tier approach and a lack of control with regard to some reservoirs which could impact on the environment and other users. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment.

<A NAME="30327-44_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   It is a pleasure to be angling from the same bank as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, and, indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I rather felt that on the previous group of amendments we had England and Scotland angling on opposite banks of the River Tyne and that they had their lines crossed.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para4"></a>The amendment contains a serious point on which I believe there is general agreement. I hope that the Minister will give an encouraging response. In one sense British Waterways is not a water abstractor in that the water comes out of the system and goes back into it. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, for as long as British Waterways has that water it is not available for other use and there is an abstraction problem in that regard.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para5"></a>The group of amendments that we are discussing merits serious consideration on the part of the Government. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I was interested to hear the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Young. There is no doubt that problems exist in this regard. I am particularly interested in Amendment No. 12, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A water system of the authority's with which that reservoir is connected".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-44_para6"></a>
Some canals are fed directly from river systems via weirs. Obviously, to keep the canal system going, particularly during the summer, it has to be supplied with enough water. However, that undoubtedly has a serious impact on some rivers. A balance needs to be struck here&#151;which can be achieved only by means of a licensing system&#151;between the water requirements of the canals and the need for adequate flows in rivers.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para7"></a>I believe I am right in saying that British Waterways sells water from its canals to industry and to other users, as it has every right to do. However, if that is to be deregulated, problems could arise as there may be competition for water which is required elsewhere in the system. On the other hand, canals have become <P>


<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely popular. The Brecon and Monmouth canal in my area has attracted much investment. I take off my hat to British Waterways for the work it has done on that canal. However, the issue we are discussing needs to be resolved in a fair and equitable fashion so that the water resource is properly managed. I question whether that part of the water resource to which I have referred should be outside the licensing system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There is misunderstanding about the provisions that we are discussing. I am not prepared to accept the arguments that have been put forward for the amendment. We are not talking about British Waterways and other navigation authorities being exempt from the main provisions. Their reservoirs that feed an ongoing system, which connects with the rest of the system, are part of the abstraction process. What we are talking about now is the proposed exemption in the Bill which is limited to reservoirs whose sole outlet is directly to a canal, and where there are no other waters which are dependent on the flows from those reservoirs; in other words, it is a closed system.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para8"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, British Waterways has about 40 reservoirs which would qualify for that exemption. All the other reservoirs of British Waterways and the other navigation authorities would be subject to all the requirements of the system. Many of the exempted reservoirs are small and most are close to the canals they serve. Some do not even have any catchment as they take excess canal water in wet weather in order to return it to the canal in dry weather. Therefore, there is no way in which that water could be used for other purposes. However, if the water from those reservoirs were to be sold at any point, it would become subject to abstraction licensing as it would become subject to the terms of the Water Resources Act.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para9"></a>Further, if that water were needed in a drought, the water from those reservoirs or the canals which they serve could be requisitioned by a drought order. It is not as if the water that we are discussing is totally exempt. However, the same considerations do not apply to a closed system as apply to systems which are not closed; it is not a question of a lack of equity. We are talking here about reservoirs in the context of closed systems. However, as I say, if the water from such reservoirs&#151;irrespective of whether they belong to British Waterways or to other navigation authorities&#151;were to be sold, it would become subject to abstraction licensing and it could be requisitioned under the terms of a drought order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-44_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I shall have to read carefully the Minister's reply. I believe that he mentioned a different sort of reservoir, but presumably it is still the same sort of water. If the Bill is to cover the very small reservoirs that farmers tend to construct on their land, I do not understand why British Waterways is able to keep its reservoirs outside the system. As I say, I shall read carefully the Minister's reply and take further advice on the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 5, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-44_para13"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMMENCEMENT AND EXPIRY OF LICENCES
<br>
(1) A licence granted under this Chapter to abstract water to prevent interference with any mining, quarrying or engineering operations (whether underground or surface) or to prevent damage to works resulting from any such operations ("de-watering abstraction") shall be stated to take effect and to expire simultaneously with any planning permission or any extension or amendment to any planning permission granted for such mining, quarrying or engineering operations instead of a specific date, or dates, in the licence for the de-watering abstraction itself.
<br>
(2) In all other respects, reference in this Chapter to the date on which a licence is stated to take effect and on which it expires is to be taken, insofar as a licence for de-watering abstraction is concerned, refers to the commencement and expiry dates comprised in any planning permission authorising the mining, quarrying or engineering operations relevant to the de-watering abstraction."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-44_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 15, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 31 and 61 with which it is appropriately grouped. In so doing I declare an interest as the non-executive chairman of Quarry Products Association.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para15"></a>All the amendments in the group relate to specific&#151;but I should like to think unintended&#151;inappropriate consequences of some of the provisions of the Bill for the efficiency of the quarrying industry. Without an effective quarrying industry many of the Government's policies cannot be carried through, not least the building of the 500,000 houses of which we have already taken note. Therefore, if the consequences I mentioned are unintended, it is important that we note them now.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para16"></a>My basic contention is that the abstraction of water to enable mining and quarrying to continue below the level of the water table is not equivalent to the abstraction of water for any other purposes. The water in question is either stored or returned immediately to the same water catchment area without contamination. Therefore, the abstraction of the water is on a different footing from the abstraction of water for use or for sale or for other purposes. Basically, as the holes in the quarry fill up to the level of the water table, the water is pumped out, additional quarrying is carried out and the water is returned. There is no loss.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para17"></a>I noted and welcomed the comments that the Minister made earlier; namely, that the Bill is essentially concerned with quantity of water. In the case of the quarrying industry, the quantity is not at issue. Should there be any minor sediment extracted at the same time as one gets to the lower levels of the abstraction process, the water is cleaned and then returned and the sediment taken out. Therefore, I believe that the provisions of the Bill should not apply to that form of abstraction. That is the point behind Amendment Nos. 186 and 187, which we are not discussing at the moment. However, it is a context within which the amendments we are discussing have <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be seen because if the later amendments were to be accepted the earlier amendments would not have the same force or perhaps necessity.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para18"></a>However, I now address the amendments before us, starting with Amendment No. 15. Amendments Nos. 15, 31 and 61 concern effectively time, money and location. The issue in Amendment No. 15 is time. It concerns the appropriateness of having a consonance of time periods between the licence granted to abstract water and the planning permission granted for mining and quarrying purposes. If such a consonance of time periods occurs, the industry will remain in good health because effective planning horizons for investments can be observed. But if the time period covered by the abstraction licence does not accord with that of the planning permission granted for the extraction of minerals, the industry faces a double hazard. The point behind Amendment No. 15 is that the licence to abstract water should run concurrently with the relevant planning permissions.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para19"></a>Amendment No. 31 deals with the implications of that not being the case. It is effectively a request for compensation and eligibility for compensation to be written into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para20"></a>Amendment No. 61 deals with a slightly different but very specific point. It is an attempt to seek clarification. The clarification which is sought has to do with the expression in Clause 20(2)(a),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for abstraction from the same point as the abstraction licensed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-44_para21"></a>
I refer in particular to the phrase "from the same point". If a new licence is granted for abstraction from the same point, that should not be taken in a semi-Euclidean fashion but should apply to the whole footprint of the planning permission already granted. So it would effectively be a licence to abstract water within the same quarry and within the curtilage of the same planning permission.
<P>

<a name="30327-44_para22"></a>Those are the reasons for the amendments that I have tabled. I believe that they have real significance, particularly if the later amendments are not accepted. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30327-45_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I support the amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, has spoken. I declare an interest. I do not have a financial interest but I live opposite what I believe is the biggest granite quarry in Europe. It used to be owned by Mount Sorrel Granite, then by Redlands and it is now owned by La Farge. It is a huge quarry. Interestingly&#151;as I am sure is the case with many quarries&#151;it forms part of an SSSI. I hope that eventually it will be returned to nature. I place on record my thanks to those who manage the quarry&#151;I do not always bless them when they are blasting away&#151;for trying to preserve the environment for those who live in the vicinity. It has been a nightmare situation. Locals and the quarry company have investigated ways of giving local people a better insight into the working of the quarry. I am digressing somewhat from the amendments but it is important to place that on record.
<P>


<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para0"></a>Water is, of course, hugely important to the quarry. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, I shall not discuss the matter in detail. He explained the matter very clearly. But it is impossible to work limestone and sandstone quarries without dewatering through pumping. It would be virtually impossible to blast the rock under water and it would, in any case, be impossible to retrieve the rock from the water after the blast. Like all other abstractors the quarrying industry does not consume the abstracted water in the accepted sense of the word, as the noble Lord, Lord explained, but simply returns it almost immediately to the acquifer in virtually the same volume and condition. It is important that Members of the Committee appreciate that as it is not commonly known. Some people just think that the water is wasted and not reused.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, rightly appealed to the Government that the planning permission and the abstraction licence should run concurrently. I am sure the Committee understands that. The licence life should be tailored to the life of planning permissions, which often in the case of rock quarries are 25 years or more. In the quarry near to where I live there is still in existence a licence going back to 1948. If that had not been activated, 50 years on the licence would have expired. No doubt many local people would think that a 50-year period is far too long but that is another matter. As was said earlier, one has to consider the practicalities and the costs of running quarries. We need the commodities that come from quarries irrespective of the wishes of those who live close to them.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para2"></a>I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, did not mention a right of appeal. He mentioned compensation. I do not know whether he intended to mention a right of appeal but omitted to do so in error. I am not sure what kind of appeal system may already exist. The Minister may tell me that there is one already. I should be glad to hear that.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para3"></a>I have been contacted by the Quarry Products Association which informed me that it had pressed its case&#151;which it considers a special case&#151;with both DEFRA and the Environment Agency over the past three to four years. Sadly, there has been no apparent recognition of the unique case with regard to quarry dewatering. If that is true, it is disturbing. Quarrying is a big industry, which we need. I should like the Minister or perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Young, to tell us why nothing has come of that situation.

<A NAME="30327-45_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I understand that where a Member of the Committee is a member of another body or chairs another body, they may not comment on that body's policy in this House. Only the Minister can reply to the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-45_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful for that clarification. I hope that the Minister will reply to the point. I believe that this is a critical issue. If it is not addressed properly, it puts the future of the industry at serious <P>


<a name="column_GC85"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>risk. As I said earlier, the industry is of national importance. It is extremely important that this strategic aggregate supply is not put at risk.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para4"></a>As was suggested, the proposed legislation will require that, for the first time, previously exempted quarrying dewatering abstraction will be covered by the transfer licence system. Indeed, as has been said, although no time limit is laid down, it is suggested that a 12-year cycle would be involved. That is not ideal. The Quarry Products Association holds the view that any legislation, subordinate legislation or policy guidance should provide for quarry dewatering abstraction transfer licences to be limited to the life of planning permissions. I am happy to support the noble Lord's amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-45_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I, too, support the amendments. Quarrying is a controversial matter in some areas but where planning permission has been given it often provides excellent employment opportunities in areas which often do not have alternative employment. I refer to certain remote areas. It makes sense to have the planning permission contiguous with the abstraction licence. That seems eminently sensible. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-45_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I speak briefly to the amendment which has parallels with Amendments Nos. 5 and 55 where we discussed linking licences to the life of an asset. The argument against the amendment we are discussing is the same as that against those other amendments. In the case of quarries, planning permissions are often lengthy and sometimes not time limited at all. Indeed, some quarries operate under mineral permissions that are so aged that everyone has forgotten their origins.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para5"></a>Many of the environmental challenges posed by the dewatering of quarries are due to the lengthy timescales involved. For example, hard rock quarries generally work down to deeper phases and it is difficult initially to assess what the impact will be, particularly in fissured limestone. In the case of gravel quarries, it is also difficult to predict what will happen if the quarry is extended. There is a need to bring the dewatering permissions within the control system. If they have little impact on the environment, quarry operators have nothing to worry about. I query with the Minister whether the Water Framework Directive requires these kind of abstractions to be covered by the licensing system. Therefore, we would need to implement that if that is not the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-45_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I begin by saying to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that if a specific problem has arisen, we should be delighted to receive a letter setting out the details of what approvals have been sought. We could investigate such a case.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para6"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said, the amendments seek to introduce specific measures that would apply to this particular group of abstractors. The intention to remove the current exemption for abstracting water for dewatering purposes will affect the mining, quarrying and engineering construction industries. The current regime applies generally to all <P>


<a name="column_GC86"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abstractors within its scope and it is right that there is equity of treatment for all. Special provisions for one group would be divisive. However, we recognise that that dewatering is not the same as other abstractions. That point was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para7"></a>Amendment No. 15 would, in effect, completely remove from the Environment Agency the responsibility for determining the time limit to apply to all licences granted for these activities.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para8"></a>The position of mining and quarrying companies will be no different from that of any other industrial abstractor: the time limit on the licence is not linked to any end date for the operation concerned. We are not persuaded that there is justification to adopt a different approach simply on the grounds that it is subject to some other time-related restriction.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para9"></a>However, I can reassure the noble Lord that quarry and mine operators will have the same opportunities as all other abstractors to submit to the Environment Agency a business case in support of their applications. This can address issues relating to the proposed life of the licence to be granted. The time restriction on the operation would form part of such a submission, and the agency will have proper regard to it.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para10"></a>Mineral planning permissions can be very long. They are distinctive, even planning terms, and we believe that to peg an abstraction licence to such a permission could limit the agency's powers to protect water, the very point of time limiting. However, we recognise the importance of there being&#151;this was a specific question that was put&#151;a right of appeal against refusal or conditional grant of an abstraction licence. There is a presumption of renewal on consideration of the time-limited licence.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para11"></a>Licences for quarry operations should be subject to the same opportunities for review within the catchment abstraction management strategy process, as any other time limited licence in the catchment, particularly as they will have variable effects over time, as the workings develop, move, change depth and those need to be able to be reviewed.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para12"></a>We recognise the concerns that have given rise to Amendment No. 31 and in light of that we believe that this amendment is unnecessary. We propose to make, and Clause 95 provides for, transitional measures to ensure that compensation would be available in the circumstances described in the amendment. That is where a mine, quarry or engineering works operator is refused a licence or granted a conditional licence and as a result cannot take full advantage of any planning permission granted for the operation. This is already publicly stated government policy&#151;in Taking Water Responsibly&#151;paragraph 3.17, and there is an availability of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30327-45_para13"></a>We also think the special treatment in respect of variation of licence conditions provided by Amendment No. 61 is not appropriate. The existence of planning permission has no relevance in the context of the limited extension of a licence, neither does it have any bearing on the environmental effects of <P>


<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<P>

<a name="30327-46_para0"></a>I note the point made about fairness of treatment across different industries. I simply underline the point that if the Bill is intended to protect quantity of water at a certain level of quality, that should not really be an issue because of the processes used in the mining business as the water is returned at equivalent quality. Therefore, the need to protect volume does not arise. That being said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30327-46_para3"></a><P>

<a name="30327-46_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: The four amendments in this group raise an important point, especially as the Government are encouraging ever greater diversification on farms. It is possible that the holding might have the occupier's house and household on it, but in addition there could be one or more tied cottages. Assuming that gardening, for example, is a domestic purpose, the water abstracted could well be used by more than just the occupier's household.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para5"></a>Looking at the Bill, subsection (3)(a) specifies that the abstraction is for use on contiguous and other land held by the same person. My question to the Minister is: what is the point in confining its use to the occupier? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-46_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I support the amendment. The practice is normal in more remote rural areas. Essex is not rural but when I was a boy it was certainly more remote than it is today. We used to supply water from our well and we pumped it up into a header tank. It supplied our house and all the stock on the farm. It also supplied a number of cottages. Therefore, the restriction in the clause is too narrow because it specifies "the occupier's household". In areas where there is not easy access to the mains and so forth, where there is a reasonable water supply it would be normal for one well or one borehole to supply a number of households. It might be three, four or five, one does not know.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para6"></a>My noble friend raised the diversification point. As drafted, the Bill is too narrow. One can accept the quantum of water but to tie it to the occupier's <P>


<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>household is too narrow. Using the water for domestic purposes is practical and if the domestic purposes happen to include a herd of cows, I do not see that as a problem. If one lives in a remote area where that is the situation, provided you are in the quantum of water, why worry about it?

The protected rights relate back to the Water Resources Act and the rights which existed prior to the 1963 Act. Those had to be taken into account in every future licence and no such licences are allowed to derogate from those protected rights. That deals with the historic issue.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para7"></a>However, Clause 6 extends the exemption for small abstractions so that small abstractions can be made for any purpose, not just those which are agricultural or domestic. Therefore, Clauses 6 and 17 limit protected rights under the new regime to those that existed under the old regime&#151;pre-1963 rights.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para8"></a>The effect of the amendments&#151;the concern behind me is slightly different from that expressed by both noble Lords who have spoken&#151;would not extend the exemption. They attempt to deal with the historic situation. The extension of the exemption is already achieved by Clause 6 because any abstraction of up to 20 cubic metres per day for domestic purposes, regardless of whether the occupier uses the water, will be exempt.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para9"></a>The amendments deal with the protected rights situation. They would extend what was trying to protect grandfather rights to the new situation. I do not believe that it was the intention of Members of the Committee to make that extension and we do not want any proliferation of rights which dealt with an historic situation.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para10"></a>There is a little confusion and it might be helpful if I write to the noble Baroness about the matter. If certain aspects are not dealt with, and if that lies behind their concern, they will not be dealt with by these amendments. On the other hand, there may be ways of dealing with them.

<P>

I am grateful for his help and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-46_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford </B>   moved Amendment No. 20:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 8, line 10, at end insert "provided that such well or borehole does not impinge upon pre-existing licensed abstraction producing potable water"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30327-46_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30327-46_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 20 deals with the question of one borehole impinging on a pre-existing licensed abstraction. It has been brought to my attention in particular by the British Soft Drinks Association. It is most concerned that Clause 6 sets out provision for exempting small abstractions from licensing requirements. Its water bottling members do not oppose licensing exemptions for small abstractions, but have concerns that exemptions can be made purely on the grounds of size without recourse to any notification or environmental impact assessment. Even small abstractions from the ground water require boreholes to be drilled and that activity could damage both rock strata and the supply and quality in the related aquifers. A BSDA member is currently confronted with just such an activity and has serious concerns for the future of his business if his water supply is affected. That is the reason for moving the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-46_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Once again, the explanation of the motivation behind the amendment is not what I anticipated. The effect of the amendment is that if a person puts down a borehole to take advantage of the exemption provided by the clause, he can find himself in breach of the exemption if the construction impinges on another extraction producing potable water.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para15"></a>It is not the borehole but the extraction that would be the issue. If the intention of the amendment is to provide protection to other bottling suppliers, the issue is whether the level of deregulation is appropriate in the circumstances; in other words, whether the small exemption could cause a problem for the soft drinks industry or the mineral water bottling industry.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para16"></a>It is inconsistent with the general objective of deregulating small abstracters if in this case we provide for the protection of other rights against that small exemption. The new regulatory scheme will have the flexibility for raising, or lowering, by order the threshold in local areas. It will therefore be for the Environment Agency when applying for such an order, and the Secretary of State in deciding whether to grant it, to consider whether any local threshold could vary from the general threshold in order to avoid interference with another abstraction. Clearly, that could arise in the circumstances which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, suggests.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para17"></a>If we were to have a complete exclusion and to base it on the borehole rather than the abstraction, we would, first, roll back a degree of deregulation and, secondly, fail to deal with the specific problem. I will need to consider the issue raised by the water bottlers because in certain circumstances they have a specific concern. We may be able to deal with that in a different way. Certainly as written it would undermine the intention of deregulation in this area.

<P>
<A NAME="30327-46_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. This is a technical area and he will have gathered that I am not expert in it. Nor do I have any financial or other tie with the British Soft Drinks Association. Quality bottled water has become a large industry. I would like to see it grow. I would rather we all bought UK water than water from abroad. I would also like it if we all drank more milk, but that is another matter. My noble friend says that it is not as good for me.
<P>

<a name="30327-46_para18"></a>The bottled water industry is a growing one and it is dependent on having a good, ready supply of water. If the industry is opened up and the supplies are affected, that will have a bearing on the industry. I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said. I hope that before Report stage we can arrive at a solution. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) Any such intention on the part of the Secretary of State shall be advertised in the appropriate places and be made no sooner than six months after the placing of such an advertisement."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30327-47_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 21, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 21A. Amendment No. 21 seeks to address the situation in which the Secretary of State has decided to make an order to vary the small quantity threshold. There may be good reasons for that&#151;there should be if he is to vary the order. He can do so for a small geographical area or for a class of water and so on. It may produce a confusing situation to small abstractors. They may not be aware of the variations and so be in breach of them. So Amendment No. 21 seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State's intention is well publicised.
<P>

<a name="30327-47_para1"></a>Amendment No. 21A deals with small abstractions that could significantly damage the environment, not by themselves, but in a combination. The intention of subsections (c) and (d) is to ask the Minister what provisions have been made for small abstractors. In one area of the country they may not have a particularly great effect, but in another they may. In particular subsection (d) addresses that situation. I do not understand how the agency is required to construct a register of small abstractors. When the Secretary of State considers making an order, on what information would he make it? The purpose of the amendment is to find out how that information will be gathered so that the Secretary of State can make an order based on real information. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-47_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   We understand that Amendment No. 21 is intended to increase the period of notice that abstractors will have of any change to the local threshold for licence control. I reassure the noble Baroness that that is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30327-47_para2"></a>Any order amending the threshold for abstraction licence control will be subject to the Schedule 6 procedure. That already requires notice of the draft order to be published and provides the opportunity for <P>


<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>representations or objections to be made. If necessary, the Secretary of State may hold a local inquiry into those objections. If approved, the order itself must then also be advertised. That process could take a substantial time&#151;rightly so, given the potential complexities and complications. Any such order could also take effect from a date that would recognise any further period of notice deemed necessary for the change of threshold to come into force.
<P>

<a name="30327-47_para3"></a>We therefore believe that abstractors will be given sufficient notice of any changes that may affect them and the opportunity to participate fully in the adoption of any such order. Having put that on record, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel satisfied that we have met her concerns.
<P>

<a name="30327-47_para4"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 21A. we recognise the intention behind the amendment. The first paragraph, would enable the agency, in setting a new threshold for small abstractions which would be exempt from licensing, to make different provisions for different areas, water or underground strata if cumulative small abstractions were giving rise to significant environmental damage. The agency would already have power to make such provision. The purpose of the provision includes the ability to anticipate precisely the circumstances covered by the amendment. I can therefore reassure the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC92"></a>

<B>27 Mar 2003 : Column GC92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness that in just such circumstances, the agency would act. The Bill already permits it to do so. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30327-47_para5"></a>As for the register, we are more wary. I reassure the noble Baroness that the agency will know the conditions of water resources in any area, as its duty is to monitor carefully and frequently. A function of the small quantity threshold is to reduce bureaucracy; we think it unnecessary for the agency to establish such a register. I hope that that reassures the noble Baroness. If not, I am sure that she will respond on the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327-47_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for her reply. Having said what I said earlier, I certainly would not want to be seen to be trying to increase bureaucracy, so I shall rest on her assurance that all those matters will be taken into account. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston): </B>  My honourable friend, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, has today announced that a new public appointments vacancies website has been launched at www.publicappts-vacs.gov.uk. This has been developed through the joint partnership working of the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions, and will be hosted alongside the Government's jobs and learning website at www.worktrain.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="30327w01_para0"></a>The new website provides for the first time a single source of information about public appointments vacancies at national, regional and local levels across England and the UK. People can search the site by area of interest, government department and by location to identify the vacancies that are available. They can then access further information about each vacancy, including how to apply.
<P>

<a name="30327w01_para1"></a>The Public Appointments Unit's own website is also being relaunched today at www.publicappointments.gov.uk. This provides general information about public appointments, how to get involved, the process and the range of public bodies.

<a name="30327w01_para2"></a>For people who do not have access to the Internet, the unit is producing a bi-annual newsletter that will include details of all the vacancies.

<P>

<a name="30327w01_para3"></a>As the majority of today's public appointments vacancies are publicised, in accordance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments' code of practice, the public appointments register maintained by the PAU can no longer be considered the most effective way to meet the needs of people who wish to become involved in public life. It has therefore been decided to close the register.
<P>

<a name="30327w01_para4"></a>We believe that the changes we are making will provide greater access to information about public appointments. They also support the Government's wider objectives on diversity, putting citizens first and extending the range of services on-line.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Laird  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by Baroness Ashton of Upholland on 18 March (WA 22) concerning GCSE results in Hull, why grades A(star), A, B and C passes in 2001&#150;02 are very much lower than the average in England; and what steps they are taking to improve the rate.[HL2234]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30327w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  Only 28.9 per cent of pupils in Hull's maintained schools gained as many as five GCSE grades between A* and C in 2002 and the Government recognise that this is disappointing. The position is due to a number of factors, including transfer of pupils from the city's primary schools to schools outside the city boundary, and disappointing pupil progress over the two years leading up to GCSE. The proportion of pupils securing five good GCSE grades has increased, albeit slowly, from a very low level of 23.4 per cent in 1999.
<P>

<a name="30327w01_para5"></a>The recent Ofsted report on the city council as a local education authority states that, since the previous inspection in 1999, there had been "some loss of impetus and focus on further improvement" in Hull, following the resignation of the director of education in 2001. In general, progress in the past three years had been slow. However, progress is reported to be "much improved" in the past year, although a step-change in performance is required if more children are to reap the full benefit of a secondary education. Since the Ofsted report, the director of education appointed in late 2001 has resigned. His successor is to take up her duties in May.
<P>

<a name="30327w01_para6"></a>Since 2002, the Government have made available a package of support to raise attainment in Hull and to sustain the city's secondary schools in achieving the step-change they need. This support aims to secure significant improvement by reinforcing work already under way in the city and by focusing on the specific needs of Hull. A key theme of that support is the facilitation of partnership working, among schools and between the schools and the local authority. For three years from 2003&#150;04, this support will be sustained by new funding that will have a big impact in Hull; an additional annual grant to the city council of <P>
