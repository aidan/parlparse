<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they now expect their new Disability Discrimination Bill to be presented to Parliament.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, our expectations have not changed. We are on track to introduce the Disability Discrimination Bill in this Parliament. Indeed, as noble Lords are aware, a draft is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. We will respond to the committee's report as soon as possible after it is published. Announcements on the legislative programme will be made in the Queen's Speech in the usual way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend, as ever, and to my noble friend Lord Carter and the Joint Committee for consulting disabled people with such unfailing care. It was movingly exemplified for me by their readiness&#151;in the Easter Recess&#151;to visit Sir Peter Large, who is currently too severely disabled to leave home.
<P>

<a name="40429-01_para0"></a>While I warmly acknowledge their manifold legislative achievements for disabled people, can we be assured that Ministers will move with all speed to enact the Bill, resorting if necessary to the rollover procedure now available to expedite Royal Assent?
<P>

<a name="40429-01_para1"></a>Will they also back the DRC's call for the "reasonable adjustments duty" on public authorities to be clearly stated as an anticipatory one in the Bill: a duty owed to disabled people generally, not only to individual disabled people who request help?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the House will join me in recognising the huge achievements of Sir Peter Large over many years. Obviously, his health is a concern for all of us but he has been a great figure in the world and has done so much for the disability cause.
<P>

<a name="40429-01_para2"></a>My noble friend asked about speed, rollover, and so on. That is a matter for the usual channels, but I can repeat again that we are on track to deliver the Bill within this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40429-01_para3"></a>My noble friend's third substantive question was about local authorities' anticipatory duty, as opposed to a reactive duty. The issue is whether local authorities are obliged, through their services, their functions and the public premises they own to anticipate the needs of <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disabled people by ensuring that ramps, audio loops, and so on are available. Yes, we believe that the duty for local authorities is anticipatory; we believe that the drafting makes it clear. But if, for example, the scrutiny committee believes on reflection that it is not as clear as it should be, we are willing to take this away and discuss it with legal counsel in order to ensure that we deliver transparency in the Bill. Of course, when the Bill goes through either House, it will be subject to the Pepper v Hart proceedings which make clear the intent behind the proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the Joint Committee completed its deliberations this week and the report should be published in the week of 24 May. The Minister will know that the report is based on the draft Bill which is, itself, an enabling Bill, based on the framework of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. I hope that in the light of that, the Government will be able to respond rather more quickly than the two months that they normally take to respond to such reports. I can assure the Minister that the recommendations are quite straightforward. If she could bring the process of response forward so that the Bill could be introduced before the Summer Recess, that would be extremely helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, we will have to see what the recommendations say. My noble friend who chairs the committee is in a better position to tell the House this than I am, but my understanding is that we are due to receive the recommendations of the Scrutiny Committee on about 24 May. Normally there is a two-month period after that which would take us through to 24 July. As that is the beginning of the recess, we would lose valuable time. So if there is any way of compressing the timetable, we will certainly try to do it. However, that depends on how substantial, dramatic, surprising or worrying the committee's recommendations may be. But if my noble friend has those concerns at heart, then I am sure that he will produce recommendations which we can respond to very quickly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness mentions valuable parliamentary time. Can she say by when she anticipates that full implementation of the Bill will occur? Is the end of 2006 a realistic objective? Will the publication be accompanied by the draft orders which, at one point, were promised to the Joint Committee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, on the last point, my understanding is that we still hope to publish the draft regulations simultaneously with the Committee stage of the Bill, as far as possible. From my own experience, if, for any reason we are unable to do that, partly because a late Clause 15 has been introduced into the Bill, obviously there will be a very full explanatory memorandum in lieu. We want to be helpful to the House and I am sure that the House would want that.
<P>

<a name="40429-01_para4"></a>I have no reason to think that we will not be on track to meet such a timetable in its broad terms. But the noble Lord will understand that there are aspects, not necessarily within the Bill, but associated with disability issues, such as transport, which obviously have a very long <P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>timetable because of requiring very heavy investment. So although we might expect to be able to meet such a proposed timetable, the noble Lord will understand that on some issues&#151;aviation, shipping, trains, buses, and so on&#151;there are different timetables in which vehicles will be fully accessible over a much longer period of time than 2006. However, within the substance of the Bill, I might hope to meet such a timetable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that we have taken up a great deal of time over many years asking about when legislation of this type will be enacted? Would the Minister be open to a deal that if we get this through as quickly as possible, the usual suspects will not ask any more questions about when it will happen? Surely that would free up a great deal of time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I would be severely disappointed in your Lordships, including the noble Lord, Lord Addington, if, having got the Bill through the House, they continued to ask when it would come before the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I was very sorry to miss the early part of my noble friend's Answer, so I am speaking rather in the dark. Is she aware that last Monday the Home Secretary announced that legislation on identity cards would be introduced in the autumn and on the statute book before the general election? Has she been able to give that kind of undertaking to the House today? If not, will she bear in mind that the identity card legislation is highly controversial and, as she will gather from these exchanges, the question of a disability Bill is not contentious and should go through the House very easily? Can she give that commitment, please?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I can only repeat the first Answer that I gave to my noble friend Lord Morris. Our expectations have not changed; we are on track to introduce the Disability Discrimination Bill in this Parliament. In that way, we will fulfil the commitment we made in our manifesto to extend civil rights to disabled people.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, the Prime Minister has no current plans to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, do not the Government agree that there should be a true balance between the Government, the Democrats and the Republicans? Even if President Bush and those around him will not acknowledge any possibility of defeat&#151;and that will not be the first time that they have got it wrong&#151;is it not vital that there should be a good rapport between the Government and the Democratic candidate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree about the importance of government to government relationships. Of course, party-to-party relationships continue, whatever the parties happen to be, and I include the opposition parties in this country as well as overseas. However, I am bound to say to my noble friend that government-to-party relationships become increasingly sensitive in an election year. That is true whether we are talking about an election in the world's most powerful country or, in my experience, whether we are talking about elections in some very small countries around the world. We have to be sensitive about the way in which we handle those relationships at such a time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, while I recognise the reasons behind what the Minister said, it is still some six months before the US election takes place. Would it not be therefore wise, in the interests of being even-handed&#151;although we on these Benches recognise that the Prime Minister and Mr Bush are very close&#151;to arrange some kind of meeting well before the time the campaign is under way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the relationship is indeed close, as was my right honourable friend's relationship with a president of a former party. My right honourable friend has recently returned from the United States. He might well have seen Mr Kerry when he was there, but that was not the way in which diaries worked at the time. I was careful in the way that I formulated my Answer. A meeting is not ruled out entirely but, as a matter of fact, the Prime Minister does not have any current plans for one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, may I take it from that answer that if Senator Kerry were to request a meeting with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister might be prepared to smile upon it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I cannot control my right honourable friend's diary. I suggest to my noble friend that that would be a question of timing. I do not see any reason why there should not be such a meeting. I have indicated to your <P>


<a name="column_885"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 885</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships that such a meeting might have taken place only a few days ago had diaries worked. However, as the election draws closer, one would rightly expect the Government, when acting as government, to be circumspect about any meetings with opposition parties or with parties of the governing party&#151;but not with the US Government. That is common sense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tugendhat: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness believe that circumstances might ever arise in which the Prime Minister would differ from the President of the United States in public?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thought that somebody might ask me that. I shall try to remind the noble Lord of when that has happened. The Prime Minister has differed from the President of the United States on the important issues of climate change and the Kyoto Protocol. The Prime Minister has differed from the President of the United States on his dedication to the death penalty. I have argued fiercely on many occasions with the US Administration about it. We have substantial differences with the United States on that. We also have sharp differences over trade; we have had trade disputes. The Prime Minister has spoken out forcefully against the way in which the President of the United States dealt with the steel issue. There have been frequent disagreements on territorial legislation as it has affected Cuba, Libya and, of course, Iran. There have also been frequent disputes and difficulties between us over a number of different countries. I shall instance at this point solely Cuba, because it is the one of which I had direct experience myself. We decided to resume relationships with Cuba. The noble Lord will know that we have diplomatic relations with a number of countries with which the United States does not. I think that I have been able to give the noble Lord a fairly comprehensive answer on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that we have a very large embassy in Washington and that it would become very difficult for diplomats if the Prime Minister were to carry on discussions with political parties? Nobody would be quite sure whether he was speaking as member of the Labour Party or as the Prime Minister. People in the Labour Party have traditionally gone to talk to their political opposite numbers. I would be surprised if the Labour Party was not doing that now&#151;the Conservative Party surely does the same&#151;on the basis of political party to political party. It is naive to cloud the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether contacts are being made by members of the Labour Party at this moment. I made a point of not asking that question, because I wanted to answer the Question of my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, as I must, from this Dispatch Box, as a government Minister. I, and other Ministers who are far more senior and important, understand the difference between being a party political animal and being a member of a government.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to appoint an independent supermarket watchdog.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, the Office of Fair Trading is currently conducting an audit of compliance with the statutory code of practice governing supermarkets' relations with their suppliers. The results are expected to be published by the end of this year. The Government will consider what action may be appropriate in the light of the OFT's conclusions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer, which offers me rather more hope than I had expected. The matter is an urgent one. The Prime Minister has admitted that the supermarkets have an armlock on the farmers. The rate of suicide among farmers continues to rise. The rate of salaries paid to people who run supermarkets also continues to rise. That is a crying scandal and a disgrace that should be put right as soon as possible. We should not wait too long.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, if I might try to detect a question in what the noble Lord has said, I think that it was to ask whether the Government will act with the greatest possible dispatch in light of all the concerns that he raised. The answer must be "yes". All those matters should concern us. I look forward to seeing the report of the OFT. That report should be based on good evidence, because good evidence is the best way of proceeding. We eagerly await that report and the opportunity to act on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, supermarkets have for a long time demanded greater returns from suppliers and farmers. They have wanted ever-bigger discounts and have taken ever-larger amounts. That has caused tremendous problems. Is there not a danger, if too much is done in that area, that those supermarkets will then buy their products from overseas and therefore cause much greater difficulty for the current suppliers here?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend makes an important point. It is vital to the United Kingdom's farming industry that a high proportion of the goods that are sold in supermarkets, food goods in particular, are sourced in the United Kingdom. Supermarkets now provide many non-food goods and services. We would want those to come from United Kingdom producers and service producers if that is possible. While I know that some criticisms have been made of the supermarket industry, supermarkets are major players in the realm of employment. One of them, Tesco, employs more than 200,000 people in just under 2,000 communities across the United Kingdom. <P>


<a name="column_887"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 887</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Supermarkets are large and dynamic players. If they can be linked with other parts of UK production, that must be in all our interests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, leaving aside for a moment the virtues and vices of supermarkets, does the Minister agree that we already have a sufficiency of watchdogs? One wonders whether there is sufficient, suitable kennel accommodation for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I have made the point that the OFT has the decisive role. Until the OFT reports, and in case its report contains anything on which we should reflect in that regard, we have no plans to change the watchdog. However, watchdogs get the chance to bark only if they see something that they have to bark at. More watchdogs will not alter that fact.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, while recognising the important issue that the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, has raised, we from these Benches would sympathise with the Minister's reply that the answer is to deal with this via the Office of Fair Trading code. Does the Minister agree that there was perhaps a slightly Freudian slip in his first Answer when he said that it was a statutory code? I thought it was a voluntary code for the supermarkets. Does he not also agree that pressure could perhaps be put on the OFT to appoint a dedicated food trade inspector with particular responsibility for this area in order to reassure the public on this vital matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I do not know that there is a huge amount to add to my last answer. Until the OFT report is available and we can consider whether there are any proposals of that kind, I am not sure that it would help to increase the number of inspections or inspectorates, although I understand the point. In reality, there is quite a lot of dissatisfaction about the operation of the code. I think that my noble friend Lord Whitty, in a recent press statement, drew attention to that fact. We want to see better relations between suppliers and buyers and we want to ensure that we move in the right direction when the changes take place. I have absolutely no doubt that the noble Lord's suggestion will be among the matters that we consider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, the Minister says that there is no evidence on this subject. Last week, Tesco published profits of £1.5 billion, which is equivalent to half the profits of the British agricultural industry; milk producers are receiving the equivalent of 9 pence per pint for their milk; and 1,700 milk producers went out of business in the past 12 months. What further evidence is required? Surely compliance with the code has to be formally sorted out. The British agricultural industry and British farming will go right down the drain if action is not taken soon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I did not say there was no evidence; I just said that we needed to collect sufficient <P>


<a name="column_888"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>evidence to be certain that we are moving in the right direction. I too have read the accounts of the profits of that particular company. I would draw attention in the briefest way to the fact that those profits are generated now out of non-food items including banking arrangements and a very wide range of things. As they are not disaggregated in the annual report it is difficult to tell which parts are due to food and farming production in the first place, although of course that will be significant. Whatever people feel about the proportion of profitability in relation to agriculture, the Consumers' Association has made the point that the whole of the operation has been extremely good for consumers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I think that the Question deals primarily with food. Does the Minister accept that in many instances there are good relationships between farmers and the supermarkets they supply? Many of them are quite happy with the arrangements. However, others feel aggrieved by the arrangements, and one of their problems is deciding whether to jeopardise their relationship with the supermarkets by giving evidence. Can the Minister give us any guidance on how that problem can be overcome? If the Office of Fair Trading does not have the evidence, it is in a very difficult position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, that is a very fair point. My attention has been drawn to some of the publications particularly in the farming world in which farmers' representatives have made the point that many people are anxious about providing evidence lest it should soil their relationship with the supermarkets. I can only observe that we must try to produce an environment in which people are not fearful. It is extremely hard to take the right steps unless there is as much detailed evidence as possible. I can say with confidence that the Government would take a very severe view of anything that imported undue fear into the minds of people whose evidence we need.

<FONT SIZE=3>especially as the noble Baroness's close and very well informed colleague Gisela Stuart MP and many other very well informed people have said that we should tear up this constitutional draft and start again? Europe needs something different and more modern from what we are being asked to look at over the next few weeks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister made clear in another place last week that the Government believe that if the treaty contains our essential points&#151;and I remind your Lordships that there is still a very tough negotiation ahead&#151;it will be in our interests to sign it. Unilaterally proposing a completely different treaty at the moment would be unrealistic and pointless. Worse, it would be against Britain's interests because it would undermine our own basis of negotiation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware&#151;I am sure she is&#151;that it really would be the most extraordinary way to negotiate if, in the middle of trying to negotiate a treaty which is plan A, you should disclose to the other side with whom you are negotiating what plan B is? I am delighted that she has rejected that extraordinary proposition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, when I looked at the Order Paper I could not help wondering about the genesis of the Question. I found it so breathtaking that I thought it could not possibly have come from the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, who as we all know is a very sensible and serious man. Perhaps he can put it to whoever in the Conservative Party thought that this was a jolly good Question to table that it is customary to finish trying to negotiate one treaty on a subject before proposing alternative wording for another one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister find it a little paradoxical that now that the current Government have adopted Harold Wilson's position on a referendum, the Conservative Opposition have adopted Tony Benn's position, which is that all other governments should be forced to renegotiate on what we think might be changed? Is she aware of any efforts that the Conservative Party may have made to discover whether any serious parties in any other governments within the EU might sympathise with its position?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am bound to say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that I think he needs to have a little chat with the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, on that point. I cannot argue for what the Conservative Party has been up to. I know very well what the Government have been up to. The Government have been up to ensuring that we argue for the points I have put before your Lordships on a number of occasions. We have stated those in a White Paper and been open and quite clear about them. Perhaps the noble Lord and the noble Lord from the Opposition Front Bench need to have a quiet word together.

<A NAME="40429-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree with the proposition put forward by Giscard d'Estaing this morning that a "no" to the constitution in a referendum is not necessarily "no" to Europe and British membership of the EU?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I do agree with that. However, I also agree with the other very serious point that Giscard d'Estaing made&#151;that a "no" would mean that Britain would be pushed to the sidelines and lose its influence in the European Union. We cannot quote him on the consequences&#151;perhaps it can be done on other points&#151;and say, "Isn't that right?", without giving the whole quote, which was that we would lose influence in Europe and be pushed to the sidelines&#151;in effect, where we were before 1997, not where we are now.

<A NAME="40429-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Harrison: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the draft treaty does indeed set out and simplify the appropriate roles for the enlarged Union and that failure to ratify the proposed draft treaty will actually increase red tape for British business?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the draft treaty sets out and simplifies the rules for an enlarged EU. What I particularly welcome about the decision on the referendum, which I believe is the right decision, is that we are now able to stop talking about process and start talking about the substance of this draft treaty. I, for one, welcome that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister not realise that some of us find it a little curious that the Government appear to have been bounced into agreeing to a meeting on 18 June at which it is intended to agree the final version when, as of yesterday, the current draft was not available to the Government? Indeed, the Minister for Europe told the EU Committee of this House yesterday that the Government did not expect it until 15 May. There really is quite inadequate time between 15 May and 18 June to consider the new version. Parliament will have virtually no opportunity to comment. Given that the matter will take at least a year after any agreement that may be reached on 18 June, surely it would have been better to take a little longer on the preparation as there have been a lot of changes since December.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the Government have been bounced, as the noble Lord puts it, into anything. The Government hope to reach agreement on 18 June. No one can be certain whether agreement will be reached. There are still many difficulties. Indeed, I emphasised the problems with negotiation in my answers to the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford. Those are the problems that the UK Government perceive. No doubt other governments will also have problems. The noble Lord says that too short a time is available. We are very clear <P>


<a name="column_891"></a>

<a name="40429-04_para2"></a>For those of us who have worked on this Bill previously it will be no surprise that the Government have taken the opportunity in another place to reintroduce this clause which was removed on Report in this House. Its effect is to amend Section 7(5) of the 2002 Act to remove what would otherwise be the Lord Chief Justice's veto over the removal of a listed judicial office holder after a proper process of inspection, inquiry and hearing.
<P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para3"></a>I sought at Report to set out clearly why the Government thought that it was important to retain this provision and to offer what I hoped were appropriate reassurances. I am happy to do so again, although perhaps not quite at the same length. I want to start by making it absolutely clear that if we thought that there was any conceivable risk to judicial independence, we would not be taking this step.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para4"></a>I wish to describe what will happen after devolution of justice. Perhaps that is the first point that I should mark. We are not talking about provisions that will come into effect this year. We know not when they will come in. These provisions will come into effect only when devolution has occurred and, subsequent to devolution, when the Government judge that there is sufficient stability and confidence for policing and judicial affairs to be dealt with in Northern Ireland. So we are not talking about the current environment which was discussed in a very interesting debate last night.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para5"></a>I turn to how the process will work under the provisions as amended by the Commons. We have discussed this. They go to the heart of the issue of whether there is any risk that a judge could wrongly be dismissed as a consequence of these measures. We should be clear about who it does not apply to. It will not apply to the removal of a Lord Chief Justice, a Lord Justice of Appeal or a High Court judge appointed before devolution of judicial functions. The removal of those office holders, were they to be found guilty of misbehaviour, would require not only the recommendation of a removal tribunal but also an Address to both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, this clause does not refer at all to that category of judicial office holder.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para6"></a>I turn to the remaining category of judge, I shall seek to put this more succinctly than I did on Report although I hope it was helpful that I talked in deconstructed detail at that stage. In summary, what the 2002 Act says&#151;it is good that it does so&#151;is that before any judge in Northern Ireland can be removed, there has to be a consideration of the case for removal by a tribunal of three people. That is different from what happened previously when effectively it was a decision of the Lord Chancellor. The three people are composed as follows: two of them are judges and one of them is a lay person. That begs the question: who chooses the two judges who will sit on the panel of three? The situation is clear. Those two judicial members will be chosen by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in all cases except for High Court judges and above, when the Lord Chancellor will choose those two judges. Noble Lords may ask who will choose them when the Lord Chancellor is abolished&#151;an issue that we are discussing in Select Committee&#151;and the answer to that is the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. He will choose them after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Lord President of the Council in Scotland, and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.
<P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para7"></a>The point I am labouring is that this panel of three will be senior significant judges appointed by people who have the strongest responsibility possible to protect the independence of the judiciary. I go further. The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland can himself decide to chair any tribunal except in respect of High Court judges and above. If he has any concerns at all, he can chair the relevant tribunal himself. If he decides not to do so, it is beyond reason to think that he would not put on to the panel of that tribunal two judges in whom he had considerable confidence regarding their judgment and thoughtfulness. That point does not need to be laboured.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para8"></a>Therefore, the tribunal&#151;it is proper that a tribunal should look into judicial misconduct or incapacity&#151;is dominated by the judiciary but not so dominated that there is no scope for a lay person also to be present to give a view from a wider perspective than just that of the judiciary. We cannot see&#151;I have scratched my head subsequently about this&#151;where there is risk or harm in that. Noble Lords might therefore ask why we are doing this. We are doing it because it sits in the context of Northern Ireland politics and how we try to move forward in those difficult circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para9"></a>The Government remain firmly committed to the Belfast agreement. We have tried steadfastly to create the conditions that will allow us to get the devolved institutions up and running and operating successfully. It is self-evident to all of us that there have been problems along the way and that the process was never going to be easy. However, the situation in Northern Ireland has improved considerably compared with what it was previously, albeit it is not as good as any of us wish. I refer to the important and timely debate that we had yesterday in that regard.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para10"></a>The criminal justice review flowed directly from the Belfast agreement. It goes to the heart of how you seek to build confidence in the criminal justice system in civil society across all communities in that society in ways that will allow for healing, harmony and for affairs in the future to be run much more in Northern Ireland itself. The Bill is about implementing that review in a way that will help us to move forward.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para11"></a>In short, the Criminal Justice Review led to the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, but that Act included one measure that was not in the review; namely, a power of veto by the Lord Chief Justice. In the discussions that took place around the Hillsborough agreement, and as part of that agreement, it was argued and the Government accepted that it was not right for any one person to have a power of veto over a decision, or rather a recommendation, made by such a tribunal. I have been privileged to have experience of two Lords Chief Justice for Northern Ireland in my role as Northern Ireland courts Minister, and I find it hard to believe how anyone would doubt the integrity of such people. Nevertheless, in the society of Northern Ireland, one might with a bit of imagination understand why some would feel it important that no one person would ever be able to appoint a judge, or recommend or veto a judge's dismissal. That is at the heart of the issue.

<P>

<a name="40429-04_para12"></a>If I thought that the provision was likely to threaten judicial independence as a consequence, I do not believe that I would be happy to stand at this Dispatch Box. However, for the reasons that I have explained, I cannot see how a tribunal, constituted as it is, could bring forward a recommendation over which a Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland would wish to exercise a veto. I have given serious thought to that.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para13"></a>The Hillsborough agreement agreed with that measure because it was part of a process of moving forward. The Government think that this House should support the Commons because we have to be seen to stand by our agreements if we are to put pressure on other people to come up to the mark and stand by theirs. That is the nub of the matter. Therefore, I commend the Commons amendment to the House.

<P>

<a name="40429-04_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the subject matter of the amendment has been debated on no fewer than three occasions in your Lordships' House&#151;at Second Reading, in Committee and on Report&#151;so I shall be brief in moving my amendment.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para16"></a>Until the passage of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, the dismissal of High Court judges in Northern Ireland, like the dismissal of High Court judges in England and Wales, could take place only on an address by both Houses of Parliament to the Queen.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para17"></a>When that Act is implemented, the situation for newly appointed High Court judges in Northern Ireland, but not for any class of High Court judges in England and Wales, will change. Henceforth, alleged misdemeanours will be considered by a committee consisting of two senior judges and one lay person. If that committee subsequently recommends dismissal, it can take effect only if consent is given by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. In other words, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland has a veto.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para18"></a>If Clause 5 were to be enacted, the situation would change because the veto of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland would be removed. Thus, in the space of less than two years, noble Lords would be facing the loss by newly appointed High Court judges in Northern Ireland of not one constitutional protection, but two. Newly appointed High Court judges in Northern Ireland no longer enjoy the protection of an address by both Houses of Parliament to the Queen, by virtue of the 2002 Act. In addition, if the Bill is passed, they will lose the protection of the requirement that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland concurs with their dismissal before it takes place.
<P>


<a name="column_895"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 895</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para19"></a>What a contrast with the situation in England and Wales. Under the Government's proposals in the Constitutional Reform Bill, High Court judges in England and Wales will not only retain the protection of an address by both Houses of Parliament but also, if the Bill goes through in its present form, acquire the additional protection of the consent of the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. What kind of signal is that sending to the judiciary in Northern Ireland?
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para20"></a>Today, and on previous occasions, in your Lordships' House, the Minister has given a number of explanations of why the change is required. First, the noble Lord says that it is required by the Criminal Justice Review. In my submission, that is a groundless suggestion. The conclusions of the review were known to the Government when the 2002 Act went through Parliament yet the veto of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland was inserted into that Act. Moroever, nothing in the text of the review requires the veto of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland to be removed.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para21"></a>Secondly, it has been said, not only by the Minister, but by his honourable friend in another place, that the veto is unnecessary in any case because, in practice, it would never be used. If the veto is unnecessary, why on earth did the Government strive so hard to insert it in the 2002 Act? Equally, if it is unimportant, why are they striving so hard to remove it from the Bill?
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para22"></a>The third reason that the Minister has given is that the requirement to remove the veto of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland is part of the Hillsborough agreement. That agreement is not a treaty. It does not bind your Lordships' House or another place. It is a political agreement. Noble Lords are entitled to take an entirely fresh view about whether the contents of the agreement merit enshrinement in an Act of Parliament. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the Minister the veto will never be used, why was it even on the agenda of the Hillsborough agreement? If it is so unimportant, why did it trouble the negotiators at Hillsborough?
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para23"></a>The Minister has given a fourth reason this morning, which is that the membership of the disciplinary committee will be composed of senior judges chosen by the Lord Chancellor. We all agree that Lord Chancellors, present and past, have all been extremely well qualified to make such a selection. However, if the Government get their way in the Constitutional Reform Bill, we understand that the Lord Chancellor will be replaced by a Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs who, in all likelihood, will be a political animal, probably without a legal qualification. What qualifications will the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, probably located in the House of Commons, have in future to choose those senior members of the tribunal?
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para24"></a>The most startling contrast of all is that between what the Government are trying to do in their Constitutional Reform Bill and in this Bill. In the Constitutional Reform Bill, they are saying that the judges do not have sufficient protection and that <P>


<a name="column_896"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 896</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill is designed to give them additional protection. I find it extremely difficult not to conclude that the philosophy underlying what the Government are trying to do in this Bill moves in the opposite direction; and, in my submission, there are, as a consequence, real dangers to the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40429-04_para25"></a>The tradition of judicial independence in Northern Ireland is long-standing and deep-seated, no better manifested than in the courageous decisions of so many High Court judges during the past 35 years. We must not put that at risk. If the Government want to have a system to protect judges which matches the quality of the system we have in England and Wales, I urge them to accept my amendment, wait until the Constitutional Reform Bill is enacted and then reconsider the matter. I beg to move.
<P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I will seize the moment. I will not respond at great length because we have previously engaged in these issues. I should make a slight correction. I am advised that when I opened the debate on the amendment, I referred to the Lord Chancellor having a veto when of course I meant the Lord Chief Justice. I am also in favour of the Lord Chancellor having lots of vetoes&#151;but perhaps that is another matter.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para0"></a>The issue turns on the question: is there risk and why does it matter? I can but emphasise the points I made previously. I cannot conceive how there is a risk that a judge could be wrongly dismissed&#151;and that would matter massively if it were so&#151;when the procedure for investigating an apparent complaint or an issue of incapacity is so much under the control of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. And so it should be. It is right that the Lord Chief Justice has the ability to chair the committee and appoint both its judicial members. It is also right in those very rare circumstances that it would not be he because they are of the High Court or above, and that they are determined by the Lord Chancellor or, subsequently, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, after consultation with the most senior judicial figures in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para1"></a>I should also have marked the fact that the Lord Chief Justice would also determine the rules and procedures of the tribunal. Therefore it is a process properly under the authority, shadow, influence and direction of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. But that is distinct from saying that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, acting alone, should have the ability either to sack or to block the dismissal of a judge. Even though I have put on record my view about the quality and integrity of the Lord Chief Justices I have met in Northern Ireland, it does not require much imagination to understand why that issue might cause anxiety in some quarters.
<P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para2"></a>The Lord Chief Justice would not be able to block a recommendation from a tribunal, but would be able to ensure that its recommendation was likely to be as fair and as proper as it is conceivable to imagine. And it matters because we have to stand by our agreements if we are to expect others to do so. There is therefore no harm and this measure, as affirmed by the Commons, is right and proper for this House to support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his response and I shall be even briefer. I want to react only to one matter that he raised concerning the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland being able to block a disciplinary tribunal decision.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para3"></a>I wonder whether the noble Lord has chosen the right description for such potential action by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. If, as I hope he will, the noble Lord accepts that Lord Chief Justices of Northern Ireland have been appointments not only of impeccable quality but also of unimpeachable independence, the only reason why a Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland would wish to veto the decision of a disciplinary committee would be on jurisprudential grounds. In my submission, the word "block", in those circumstances, is wholly inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para4"></a>The Minister and I have had several exchanges on this matter during the past month. I have great respect for him. He knows that on this occasion I disagree and therefore I would like to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 2. Because of some helpful, aggressive grouping by Opposition Front Benches, that amendment is grouped with Commons Amendments Nos. 8, 7, 3, 4, 5, 11, 9, 10 and 6. In the hope that it will help to shorten the debate, I shall try to explain in my opening remarks what those amendments are about.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 8 are intended to provide the Police Service of Northern Ireland with powers of entry, which can be exercised to effect an arrest under the powers of arrest without warrant under Article 6(3) of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003. The power in Amendment No. 2 applies in non-scheduled cases and the power in Amendment No. 8 applies in scheduled cases. The powers of entry can be exercised only if the police have been granted a warrant by a justice of the peace.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para9"></a>Amendment No. 2 provides that if a person is liable to be arrested under Article 6(3), a justice of the peace may issue a warrant authorising a constable to enter the specified premises for the purpose of effecting the arrest.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para10"></a>Amendment No. 8 provides that if a person is liable to be arrested under Article 2(4), a JP may issue a warrant authorising a constable to enter specified premises, again, for the purposes of effecting the arrest.
<P>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 900</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para11"></a>The aim of the amendments is to enhance the powers of arrest available to the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of a person who breaches, or is likely to breach, a condition of his bail. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, for encouraging us to look at these issues, which we have done, subsequent to our earlier discussions with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. We believe that they appropriately strengthen the powers of the PSNI.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para12"></a>However, as part of that, we had to ensure that the issue of Article 8 of the ECHR, with which the exercise of such a power would have engaged, was appropriately addressed and that Article 8(2) was complied with and the power exercised proportionately. That is why a justice of the peace must make that judgment and issue a warrant.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para13"></a>All the safeguards under Articles 17 and 18 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 will apply to the application for, and execution of, the warrant.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para14"></a>Amendment No. 7 makes the offences under paragraphs 1(1) and (2) of Schedule 2 to the Bill scheduled offences. Schedule 2 to the Bill creates two new offences of absconding while on bail in a scheduled case. These offences replace the offence of absconding while on bail under Section 67 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para15"></a>In explanation of Amendments Nos. 3 to 5 and 11, Clause 12 currently provides that prisoners who are subject to compulsory transfers may be transferred to England and Wales. The amendments provide that prisoners may be transferred to either Scotland or England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para16"></a>Before Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 were accepted in another place, Schedule 3 allowed judges, magistrates, coroners, social security commissioners, the High Court Master (Taxing) and the High Court Master (Enforcement of Judgments) to give directions to court security officers by virtue of the fact that they were defined as "persons in authority". However, other Masters of the High Court&#151;for example, those who deal with bankruptcy&#151;are not designated as "persons in authority", and therefore those Masters would not have been able to give directions to court security officers. The amendments address that issue.
<P>

<a name="40429-05_para17"></a>I trust that the amendments do not cause any disquiet to noble Lords, which is why I suspect they have been agreed for grouping in this manner.

<A NAME="40429-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, I apologise for the slight delay.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para3"></a>I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The aim of the Government is a stable and thriving labour market characterised by high employment, flexibility and choice, and a constructive climate of employment relations.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para4"></a>Through the Employment Relations Act 1999 and other legislation, we have put in place a framework for fair employment and fair pay, ensuring protections for the most vulnerable workers. We are moving from competition based on low pay and low standards to competition based on best practice, high performance and a committed, motivated workforce.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para5"></a>Vital to the success of this strategy has been a shift in workplace culture. We have worked with our key stakeholders to foster and support a better climate of employment relations based on partnership between employers and employees in the workplace. Over the past seven years we have seen a move towards more dialogue, and more productive workplaces. A new trend is being established on which we want to build.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para6"></a>The evidence shows that our policies are working. Better employment and trade union rights have not jeopardised jobs or led to industrial unrest as predicted. Quite the opposite. The UK now has the highest ever level of employment and the growth in jobs goes from strength to strength. The number of people in work at February 2004 was 28.3 million, up 183,000 on the previous three months and up 318,000 on a year ago.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para7"></a>We have created an environment in which business can grow and prosper. Job creation in the private sector is strong, especially in the retail, distribution, hotel and restaurant sectors. Employment in small and medium-sized enterprises has risen by over 637,000 since 1997. It is now our task to build on these achievements, moving towards high performance workplaces and worthwhile jobs.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para8"></a>It is against this background that I am pleased to stand before the House today to debate the Employment Relations Bill. The Bill draws together the key elements of our strategy and builds on the success of the 1999 Employment Relations Act.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para9"></a>I shall now outline to the House the ways in which the Bill will achieve this. We want high performance workplaces where employees are informed, involved and committed to the success of their business. We believe that the best employers thrive through good employment conditions and good workplace relations. Many of our most successful companies already work in partnership; for example, companies such as the Compass Group and Legal and General. The information and consultation directive, which the Bill <P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implements, will ensure that this standard will apply across the large and medium workplaces. Employees will have the right to be informed and consulted on key decisions affecting their future. Stories about employees hearing of redundancies by text or on the radio have abounded in the media. We do not think that that is an acceptable way to conduct employment relations and neither do the best companies.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para10"></a>Draft implementing regulations, which the Government have already published, are based on a landmark framework agreement between the CBI and the TUC. We have also consulted extensively with other stakeholders on the new provisions, first on the principles of information and consultation, and again on the detail of the draft regulations, as well as holding a series of roundtable discussions around the country.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para11"></a>We have been mindful not to ride roughshod over existing arrangements or to prescribe a "one size fits all" solution. The draft regulations will enable firms to tailor arrangements that suit their needs. Employers will of course be free to manage and to take decisions as they see fit, but the opportunity for ongoing consultation will lead to better decisions and help the process of change by creating a climate of trust and co-operation.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para12"></a>I turn now to statutory recognition, which is dealt with in Part 1 of the Bill. The Employment Relations Act 1999 was a landmark piece of legislation. It enshrined in law the cornerstones of our fairness at work agenda&#151;fair minimum standards, a new culture of partnership and family-friendly working. At the centrepiece of the 1999 Act was a new procedure for trade union recognition and derecognition in the workplace, where the majority of the workforce so choose. The Government gave an undertaking to review the operation of the 1999 Act and in July 2002 we delivered on that promise with the launch of a detailed and wide ranging review.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para13"></a>It was said at the time that the new recognition procedure was introduced that it would be unworkable and would lead to disputes. I am happy to report to the House that the review of the 1999 Act shows that quite the reverse is true. The statutory recognition procedure has been a resounding success. We wanted it to encourage parties to resolve issues voluntarily. That is exactly what has occurred. More than a thousand deals for voluntary recognition have been agreed between employers and unions since 1998. In contrast, the Central Arbitration Committee had made 89 declarations of statutory recognition by the end of March 2004.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para14"></a>The statutory procedure is workable for both employers and unions and has enabled the timely settlement of recognition applications. Contrary to the gloomy forecasts that the new procedure would encourage strike activity and jeopardise jobs, stoppages from industrial disputes are at their lowest since the 1920s.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para15"></a>We have therefore concluded that the overall structure of the procedure, its criteria and voting thresholds, are sound. There is no case for change. <P>


<a name="column_904"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 904</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, the review has identified a number of areas where the procedures could operate more efficiently and successfully.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para16"></a>Part 1 also contains important new measures to prevent the intimidation of workers during the period of recognition ballots, whether by a union or by an employer. Intimidation has been a problem in only a small number of cases to date, but we believe it is important that we take action to stop this type of reprehensible behaviour growing and undermining the success of the statutory procedure. There are two elements to our approach. First, the Bill ensures that access meetings between the union and the workers in the bargaining unit during the ballot period are private.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para17"></a>Secondly, we are importing tried and tested standards of general elections into recognition ballots. The Bill places a new duty on both employers and unions not to engage in improper campaigning activity. That will ensure that unions and employers cannot induce, coerce or threaten workers into voting a particular way or use undue influence to affect the outcome of a vote. These measures are fair and balanced. They send a clear message to both employers and unions that intimidatory behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para18"></a>The Bill contains a power for the Secretary of State to make regulations setting out what the remedies for breach of these provisions should be. It is our intention to bring forward amendments that will set out the remedies on the face of the Bill. We have taken the opportunity to consult fully with employer organisations and unions before finalising these policies.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para19"></a>I turn now to another major aspect of the Bill: the power to make money available for the purposes of union modernisation. I know this issue has attracted some criticism in the other place. So let me spend some time setting out the background and purpose of the fund.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para20"></a>We believe that unions have an important role to play in society. They are the collective voice of millions of workers throughout this country and they have a vital role to play in taking forward partnership at work. Modern efficient unions working closely with employers can help to encourage high-performance workplaces and a motivated productive workforce. Unions like other organisations need targeted support to enable them to adapt to the changing labour market, to modernise their operations and to meet the needs of their increasingly diverse membership.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para21"></a>The union modernisation fund will help them on the path to achieving that. We are talking about a relatively modest sum of money&#151;£5 million to £10 million&#151;spread over several years, to support innovative projects that would not otherwise take place.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para22"></a>I should like to set the record straight at the outset and say that the fund is not to be used to support recruitment drives by unions or their day-to-day activities; and it cannot be diverted for political purposes. The law on the use of political funds is clear. Unions are not permitted to spend money on political objects&#151;including the making of donations to political parties&#151;unless they have a separate political fund for that purpose. The law prevents them using <P>


<a name="column_905"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 905</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>money from their general fund for such purposes or from transferring money from that fund to their political funds. Monies allocated from the union modernisation fund will go into unions' general funds and therefore will be clearly ring fenced.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para23"></a>The allocation of funds and the monitoring of their use will be carefully controlled. We envisage that it will operate on similar lines to the partnership at work fund. If so, unions will be asked to bid periodically for funding, and their applications would be assessed against clear selection criteria. The process would be overseen by an independent supervisory body that could advise Ministers on the ranking of projects, and, more generally, on the fund's overall operation. We would from the outset develop a clear evaluation strategy to measure the effects of the fund and ensure it achieves its stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para24"></a>We intend to issue detailed rules on the fund for consultation with all stakeholders in the autumn. Informal prior consultations with key stakeholders have already begun.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para25"></a>I want to say a few words about the other key elements of the Bill. Part 2 deals with the law on industrial action. The evidence from the review is that on the whole the law on industrial action works well. All parties to a dispute want a speedy resolution; and the evidence is that the present law supports that. The review of the 1999 Act concluded that the eight-week protections are working adequately. Analyses by the Office for National Statistics indicate that 93 per cent of all industrial action lasts for less than eight weeks. The essential features of industrial action law will therefore remain the same. However, there are areas where we believe the law could be usefully clarified.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para26"></a>Noble Lords may be aware of the regrettable events at the Friction Dynamics plant at Caernarfon. Striking workers were prevented from returning to work and subsequently sacked by their employer. Although an employment tribunal found that they had been unfairly dismissed, the workers and their families have suffered unnecessarily; and we do not wish to see history repeat itself. The Bill clarifies that days when employees on lawfully organised official strike action are locked out from their workplace do not count towards the eight week protected period for striking workers.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para27"></a>It emerged from the Friction Dynamics case that the employer merely paid lip service to the procedures for resolving disputes. We are taking measures to ensure that does not happen again by clarifying the reasonable steps which employers and unions are required to take to resolve a dispute.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para28"></a>The review of the 1999 Act also concluded that the current law on information, which unions are required to provide to employers prior to industrial action, could be simplified and clarified. The Bill contains provisions to address that.

<a name="40429-06_para29"></a>Part 3 deals with an important set of rights, which stem from the 2002 European Court of Human Rights' judgment in the case of Wilson and Palmer. The judgment concluded that UK trade union law breached Article 11 of the European Convention on <P>


<a name="column_906"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Human Rights. We take our international obligations very seriously. We have examined the judgment in detail as part of the review and consulted with stakeholders on our proposals to amend the law. The provisions will make it unlawful for employers to offer inducements to union members to relinquish key union rights. They provide a clear entitlement for union members to use the services of their union, and will ensure that workers as well as employees are covered by these essential protections. We have also safeguarded key business concerns and protected the ability of employers to offer enhanced terms to key workers.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para30"></a>I draw the attention of the House to another very important provision in Part 3, which deals with the racist infiltration of unions by far right extremists. Unions are dedicated to the promotion of tolerance and equality. The actions of those who seek to undermine unions and use them as a vehicle to promote racism and xenophobia are deplorable. There is no place for such views within unions. I am pleased that we are bringing forward measures to address that. The Commission for Racial Equality supports those measures.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para31"></a>I have set out some of the Bill's key features. I shall mention very briefly some of the other measures. We are introducing a set of provisions to improve enforcement of the national minimum wage, as a result of a small consultation exercise that we carried out last summer. We propose to bring forward one further measure to enable enforcement officers to withdraw or amend enforcement and penalty notices where they have made an error or new evidence has come to light.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para32"></a>The Bill also clarifies the right to be accompanied at disciplinary and grievance hearings. It makes improvements to the procedures of the certification officer and will streamline union operations, as recommended by the Better Regulation Task Force.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para33"></a>Finally, we propose to bring forward an amendment to the Bill, which will provide protections from detriment and dismissal for employees who undertake jury service. The Bill will further our partnership agenda and build on the solid foundations laid down in the Employment Relations Act 1999. It does not make radical changes to the balance of trade union and employment law but brings forward a set of sensible provisions, which mainly improve the operation of existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para34"></a>We recognise that there are parts of the Bill about which both employer organisations and unions have concerns, but the measures being taken forward are based on extensive consultation. Overall, we believe that we have got the balance right. The TUC has welcomed many of the changes proposed in the Bill and the CBI has broadly welcomed the outcome of the review. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Employment Relations Act was intended to encourage the development of more dialogue and less confrontation at the workplace. The CBI strongly supports such objectives and the broad thrust of the Government's Review".

There is a wealth of expertise and experience in industrial relations matters in this House. I look forward to the debate on the Bill and to a constructive and detailed examination of it in Committee. I commend the Bill to the House.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, this is the fourth major Bill on employment relations that the Government have introduced since they came into office. That is, without all the references to the subject in other Acts, and to say nothing of statutory instruments too numerous to count.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para37"></a>Before us today we have another stage in the drop by drop dismantling of the employment legislation enacted under the previous government, which brought order out of the chaos of industrial relations that had resulted in the United Kingdom being rightly described as the "sick man of Europe".
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para38"></a>The Government are now introducing the Bill, which is very largely intended to take another slice off the salami of the industrial relations regime that served the economy so well during the 1980s and most of the 1990s. The Secretary of State told the other place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The recognition arrangements that we put in place in the Employment Relations Act 1999 have been a resounding success".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 14/1/04; col. 823.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para39"></a>
On the American principle of, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", why are we being asked to tinker with the recognition arrangements in the Bill? Answering myself&#151;I believe that it is further to strengthen the hands of the unions.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para40"></a>Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that the 1999 Act is based on the Government's White Paper, Fairness at Work, which was the subject of detailed and widespread consultation. Barely had the ink dried on the Act when, on 11 July 2002, the Government announced a review of it, and this Bill is the consequence. As originally presented to Parliament, this Bill contained 45 clauses and two schedules. As my honourable friend the Member for Edddisbury predicted at Second Reading in the other place, it could grow upwards and outwards rapidly. Indeed, it did. It began with 45 clauses, but like Topsy, it has just "growed" to 55 clauses.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para41"></a>Let me make it clear that it is not our view that everything in this Bill is bad, or that everything is unnecessary, as the noble Lord often tells me. On the contrary, just like the Curate's egg, it is quite good in parts. First and foremost, we join the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors, and others, in welcoming what is not in the Bill&#151;the decision not to extend the union recognition rights to small businesses. I suspect, from remarks made by some Labour Members in the other place, that might be just a temporary reprieve until the Government introduce yet another employment Bill. We welcome the fact that pensions are not included in this <P>


<a name="column_908"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 908</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislation, and the fact that the eight-week time limit of protection against dismissal of strikers has not been extended, except for adding on lock-out days.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para42"></a>The CBI, in giving a limited welcome to the Bill, points out:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The current legislation which is still new . . .  appears to be working quite well".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para43"></a>
It does, however, have some reservations about certain of the Bill's provisions, on which we shall be seeking clarification at a later stage. They include the proposed new consultation proposals. Why are these provisions, which are based on an EC directive, given effect in the Bill, rather than by a statutory instrument, as I believe is the usual practice? Also, my impression is that the Bill goes further than is required by the directive. Perhaps the Minister might comment on that when replying to the debate. If he cannot do so now, as he courteously offered to discuss any problems that I have in a meeting before the next stage, perhaps we can put that on the agenda.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para44"></a>The CBI, based on its members' experience, says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Recognition campaigns at the workplace are divisive and detrimental to performance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para45"></a>
The CBI has serious concerns that new proposed duties on employers to supply information to the unions, and the power of the Central Arbitration Committee to end the period for agreement about bargaining units, seriously erode the time frame for employers&#151;and to what end? What abuses of the status quo are these two further turns of the screw designed to remedy? Perhaps the Minister could address that when he replies.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para46"></a>We are also concerned that there is no qualification for the duration of union membership before a worker is qualified to be counted in a demand for recognition. It seems that he need not even have paid a subscription. We shall seek to remedy this potential abuse but we trust that in the interest of fairness the Government and the unions would agree that this is a proper safeguard. The Engineering Employers' Federation suggests:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each of the proposed changes may, in themselves, be relatively small, but the cumulative effect of all of them is potentially quite significant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para47"></a>
For example, the first part of the Bill, expanded into 20 clauses, deal with union recognition. Clause 10 amends two paragraphs of Schedule A1 to the 1992 Act by altering the words "pay, hours or holidays", to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all of the following: pay, hours or holidays",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para48"></a>
which the Bill now says will be called "the core topics". I should be grateful to hear an explanation of the significance of this distinction, which appears to be a distinction without a difference.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para49"></a>Of greater importance is the introduction of postal voting, for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"workers absent from ballot at workplace".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para50"></a>
On the face of it, it might appear to be reasonable for workers who do not attend at the designated workplace&#151;itinerant workers and workers seconded to other places of employment&#151;to be able to participate in the ballot. That would be subject to the caveat that the CAC should be responsible for <P>


<a name="column_909"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 909</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensuring that there are adequate precautions against fraud. It seems to me that some sort of cat was inadvertently let out of the bag at Second Reading in the other place. The honourable Member for Warrington, North asked the Secretary of State to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"look once again at the rules on trade union recognition ballots, as, in effect, they count abstentions as no votes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para51"></a>
The Secretary of State replied that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we shall be tightening up on that aspect . . .  under the current Bill".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 14/1/04; cols. 823&#150;24.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para52"></a>
I am advised that, in fact, Clause 7 does no such thing. Giving voting facilities to workers who it is known will be absent from the workplace is perfectly proper, but placing an interpretation either way on abstentions is something else and is entirely unacceptable. The only legitimate interpretation that can be placed on the fact that a person did not vote is that he did not vote. I invite the Minister to make it clear that that might have been an off-the-cuff remark of his colleague, not an interpretation of the Act by the Government. Such a clarification by the Minister today would save us the trouble of seeking it in an amendment.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para53"></a>I note that the CAC does not have procedural rules for its operations. This too is unacceptable, and we shall be calling on the Government to promulgate them, so that this powerful body has operating rules, like any other quasi-judicial body.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para54"></a>I will talk about the three important provisions that were introduced into the Bill during its passage through the other place. One was the change of the law as to dismissal during strike, which I have already mentioned. However, we will look to the Government to provide a clear legal definition of the word "lock-out", as distinct from any rhetorical term of abuse that is sometimes used in the course of a trade dispute.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para55"></a>Secondly, in Committee in the other place the Government introduced new provisions by means of convoluted amendments to the 1992 Act, which in effect enable unions to expel members for racism or for support for the BNP. We do not disagree with these worthy objectives, but care must be taken to ensure that this powerful weapon is not used by an unscrupulous leadership to get rid of political opponents, or even those who might campaign in opposition to their policies. We will need to look carefully at the clause, simply to see that it does not go too far, or further than the Government intend.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para56"></a>The third important provision, in Clause 51, is the provision of a hand out. The Minister said that it would be between £5 million and £10 million, but I am advised that it is probably £10 million to £15 million. That amount is just to start with, with possibly more to come. It will be given to the trade unions for what the marginal note euphemistically calls "modernisation". There is no ceiling or time limit on this open-ended fund. When you look at the possible uses of that money, your Lordships will see that it need not have anything to do with modernisation, for it can be used to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"improve the carrying out of any of its existing functions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para57"></a>
Does this include the provision of strike pay? It can be used to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"carry out any new function".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para58"></a><P>


<a name="column_910"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
How wide is the word "any"? Does it include political campaigning? I heard what the Minister said in his opening speech, but the Bill says that it can be used to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"increase the range of services it offers to persons who ... may become members".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para59"></a>
That does not look as if it cannot be used for recruiting&#151;in other words, to enable unions to offer inducements to persons to join the union.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para60"></a>Many noble Lords might have read today a report of Digby Jones' speech to the Institute of Directors conference yesterday, where he argued that taxpayers' money should not go to what he described as a lobby group. I think that he said something like an "irrelevant lobby group", but I was being more polite than that. The fact is that not just that subsection, but the whole of the so-called modernisation money could be nothing much more than a blatant bribe, unless all these points are clarified. In so far as a union uses the money, which it would have provided out of its own funds for its normal union services, by means of using it that way if they are allowed to, by means of some creative book-keeping, it would not be difficult to find that the taxpayers' money was recycled into political donations to the Labour party.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para61"></a>Perhaps it is indicative of the tenor of the Government's attitude to even-handedness in this Bill that when my honourable friends in the other place introduced an amendment against intimidation of employees in recognition ballots, it was negatived, and I believe that it was whipped by the Government. I note again what the Minister said today, and I am happy for him to correct me on that point if I have been misinformed about the result of the vote on that amendment. If it is not so, we will be introducing a similar amendment in Committee. But on the matter of intimidation, the Government have introduced Clause 28, described in the marginal note as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Inducements relating to collective bargaining"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-06_para62"></a>
which has the result of repealing Section 17(4) of the Employment Relations Act 1999. The Minister has actually mentioned that. That subsection permits a worker to make a separate agreement with his employer, whereby in return for performing additional services with a monetary value he can receive extra pay. The Government have used the cases of Wilson and Palmer before the European Court of Human Rights as their justification for that. The Minister did say that the Government do, of course, obey European rules and results of courts, and so on.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para63"></a>But the Wilson and Palmer cases related to agreements banning the workers&#151;banning them&#151;from trade union membership. Section 17(4) provided&#151;anticipating the ECHR decision by five years&#151;that such an agreement was excluded; I know that well. After the subsection was passed, the TUC denounced it and demanded that what it called "the Miller amendment" should be repealed. I was immensely flattered because no one has ever named anything after me, let alone an amendment&#151;especially not one on trade union law. But it is not for that reason that we want to see that we do something about that, because that was a negotiated compromise with the Government, which was reinstated and accepted by the <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government without a Division. I will not take up any more time on that now. We will doubtless have an interesting debate about that later.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para64"></a>The Bill contains provisions about information and consultation in the workplace, which implement another EU directive. The cost of that over a 10-year period is estimated at £258 million, although the IOD suggest it could be £430 million. The Birmingham chamber of commerce reported a survey among its members showing that 76 per cent were very concerned at the additional cost on business. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, described the provision as simply the imposition of new European work rules. But they are yet another instance of directions being given on how UK companies should run their businesses and in fact could interfere with business decision-making and give scope for all kinds of over-the-top rules in the workplace.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para65"></a>My honourable friend the Member for Eddisbury complained, quite rightly, that the Government will be adopting the job-destroying employment model that undermines labour flexibility. Earlier this month, Germany, once the engine of European industry, reported yet another increase in unemployment, which now stands at 10.4 per cent. So I hope the Government might look at that and see whether they really want it that way.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para66"></a>Perhaps it is not surprising that a survey last January reported that a third of 500 workers surveyed were worried about losing their jobs. Had they known that, 100 per cent of the workers at the 200-year-old factory of Terry's of York would have expressed similar fears since their jobs are being exported next year, including some to eastern Europe. That worry transcended worries about levels of pay or long working hours. Is it not the case that these regulations, along with the many others imposed from the EC, will do nothing to give people the confidence they need that they will be able to remain in work?
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para67"></a>In conclusion, the Bill has been most extraordinarily difficult to prepare for because it does not contain free- standing provisions that can be examined on their own merit. I see the Minister is nodding&#151;I hope in agreement. It is a large series of bit-by-bit amendments to another Act, which was a consolidating Act, which we may well need after the Bill is passed. The Bill is a series of tweaks, adjustments and fine-tuning, and substantial amendments of that other Act. Yet, despite the considerable impact and importance of those adjustments, the meat on the Bill is still not clearly visible, and it needs to be picked out from the effect on the other Act. That is illustrated by the particularly obscure Explanatory Notes, which compare most unfavourably with the outstandingly high standards of helpfulness of the notes usually prepared for Parliament by the DTI. I certainly do not blame the officials&#151;I can imagine that they had difficulty looking at all these Bills.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para68"></a>When the Bill reaches Committee we shall certainly give it the careful attention it needs and which the Minister said he welcomed, especially as the procedures of the other place often deny giving the same kind of scrutiny that we are able to provide in this House.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_time2"></a><H5>12.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-06_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for his introduction to the Bill. There is much to welcome in it. Trade union recognition is important, and means by which it can be achieved should be set out clearly in legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para69"></a>Furthermore, individuals who want to belong to a union, to benefit from union services and to be represented by a union should not be discouraged from achieving these very legitimate aims by employers who wish to avoid dealing with their employees in a civilised fashion.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para70"></a>Part 1 of the Bill sets out the procedures by which unions may acquire recognition and the right to bargain collectively for their members. The procedures have already been explained by the Minister in his opening speech. They are of great interest to me, since much of my union career was spent dealing with recognition issues. The union of which I was assistant general secretary&#151;then called ASTMS, now AMICUS&#151;recruited and organised in private industry as well as in some public services. In many of the industries concerned&#151;notably financial services&#151;there was often no tradition of union recognition, except through what were sometimes house unions.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para71"></a>In the 1970s, a number of these organisations joined the union, and we then had to secure recognition and collective bargaining rights from employers unused to dealing with unions and often extremely reluctant to do so. An earlier Labour government did introduce legislation&#151;the Employment Protection Act&#151;which was of assistance to unions, but that disappeared under a swathe of legislation introduced by subsequent Conservative administrations.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para72"></a>I was therefore very interested in the new procedures proposed in the Bill and I applaud the Government's intention to ensure that the procedures are clarified. I must say however, speaking personally and based on my own experience, that they do seem to be rather complicated. Part 1, which is almost entirely concerned with recognition, takes up about 22 pages. Of course, a great deal of it is necessary&#151;I do not dispute that. It is necessary to deal with bargaining units, the powers of the Central Arbitration Committee, what happens in amalgamations, and so on.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para73"></a>But why is it necessary to have a "suitable independent person", probably paid for by the union, in order for the union to communicate with the workforce? In my day, we used to campaign for recognition&#151;holding meetings on site or adjacent to the site, getting union representatives to put out material to non-members&#151;and we used the procedures to recruit more members, and why not? We certainly did not need a "suitable independent person" to assist with communication with the workforce.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para74"></a>I am not sure either about the QIP&#151;the qualified independent person&#151;to conduct ballots. ACAS has conducted ballots in the past, and indeed provisions <P>


<a name="column_913"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 913</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exist in the Bill for ACAS to have a balloting role in some circumstances. My impression is that the QIP simply adds to complication and cost.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para75"></a>On the ballot itself, why must the union's application&#151;if it is to be successful&#151;be supported by a majority of those voting, which is fair enough, but also by at least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote? Why the 40 per cent? Is a straight majority of those voting not enough?
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para76"></a>Then there is the limitation of the right to bargain to "core" issues. Pensions are quite specifically excluded. I note that there is provision for the Secretary of State to amend that by order. But as we all now know, pensions are becoming massively important. I certainly bargained about pensions in my union career. I occasionally meet retired members who tell me that they are very grateful for what the union did for them in those days. I see no reason to rule out pensions as an issue on which there may be bargaining.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para77"></a>The same is true of a number of other issues&#151;training, redundancy, redeployment, discrimination, bullying, and so on. I see no reason why these important issues&#151;important to many workers, and perhaps even the reason why some have wanted to join a union and get the backing of union support&#151;should be ruled out. It is wrong to limit bargaining rights in the way the Bill does.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para78"></a>I am however glad that the right to be accompanied by a companion in meetings with management is to be clarified, but it does not seem that the right to be represented by a companion has been effectively established&#151;that is something we shall pursue further in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para79"></a>There is concern that the legislation is limited when it comes to small firms. The TUC in particular has protested that firms with less than 21 workers are to be excluded from the legislation. Yet it is often in small firms that employees are most in need of union protection. Again, this is something to which we may return in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para80"></a>I acknowledge that the Government are attempting to deal with the well-known Wilson case in Clause 28. This was the case that arose because of the existence of legislation which allows employers to offer inducements to employees to give up their right to be members of trades unions&#151;the famous Ullswater amendment. I remember it well because I was very active in the House at that time. This has been held to be in breach of Article 11 of the ECHR.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para81"></a>The Scrutiny Committee has reported on the relevant clauses of the Bill. It has reached the conclusion that the proposed legislation in the Bill does not succeed in offering a secure protection for rights under Article 11. It has comments to offer on a number of issues&#151;whether there is an effective remedy for trade unions&#151;and on the matter of the employer's purpose it suggests that the words "sole or main" be omitted.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para82"></a>It is further suggested that the legislation should provide that each employee and trade union should be given both the right not to be offered inducements to give up Article 11 rights, and the right not to have better terms and conditions of employment made <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>available to other employees who have agreed to forego these rights. Furthermore, the legislation should apply whether or not the union is recognised. I hope that in Committee we shall be able to deal with some of these points.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para83"></a>On the matter of industrial disputes, I note that the Government are seeking to deal with cases which have arisen of dismissal of striking workers by excluding lock-outs from counting towards the eight-week period during which there is protection against dismissal. Any improvement is, of course, to be welcomed, but why retain the eight-week period at all? ILO conventions specifically protect the right to withdraw labour and our own law legitimises such action subject to prescribed procedures having been followed. At present it is possible for a stubborn and particularly obdurate employer to prolong a dispute until it becomes possible for him to get rid of some employees he would like to do without. Again, this is something we may explore in Committee. Perhaps we can get the eight-week period extended.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para84"></a>So far as concerns individual rights, I welcome the protection for employees seeking to exercise their right to request to work flexibly. This is becoming increasingly important. The Government freely acknowledge the contribution made by carers. They are mostly women, undertaking duties which otherwise would put a severe strain on overworked social services. Many employers are willing to co-operate in this regard and to make flexible working available; others should be encouraged to do so.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para85"></a>I am also glad to note that further steps are to be taken in regard to minimum wage enforcement. Most people were shocked and horrified at the fate of the Chinese cockle pickers on Morecombe Bay. Clearly they were being exploited and paid much less than the minimum wage for the dangerous work they were doing. Had there been an effective inspectorate, perhaps this would have been exposed earlier and lives might have been saved. I realise that this is part of the larger problem of illegals, who can be exploited by criminal elements because they are vulnerable. However, something should be done to stop this unacceptable exploitation, and a more numerous and powerful inspectorate could help.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para86"></a>Reverting to the main thrust of the Bill, which is about recognition, the TUC has been concerned to ensure that intimidatory tactics by employers to deter workers from supporting union campaigns for recognition should be dealt with. As a result, an amendment designed to deal with this was included in the Bill in the Commons. However, Clauses 9 and 12 apply to both employers and unions because the Government want an even-handed approach. But the management of a company and a union seeking recognition are not really in a position of equality.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para87"></a>Trade unions campaigning for recognition must obviously offer benefits of union membership as part of the reason why employees should join. Threats or bribes from an employer made to prevent the union from gaining support&#151;which is what the clauses aim to deal with&#151;are by no means the same as the union <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>benefits on offer as part of a recognition campaign. As the clauses stand, it would be open to an employer to complain to the CAC that the union was making offers even though it was doing nothing more than setting out the benefits of union membership. I think we must look again at this issue in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para88"></a>Another clause introduced in the Commons seeks to amend the laws on exclusion or expulsion of workers from unions where a member behaves in a way that is contrary to union rules. I understand that the TUC is seeking to broaden this to include the union's objectives. This is important. Whatever their rules may say, most unions have very strong policies against racial discrimination. Therefore, the replacement of the present wording,

might be more appropriate. Again, we would want to explore this issue further.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para91"></a>I repeat what I said at the commencement of my remarks: there is a great deal to welcome in the Bill&#151;it contains many improvements, which we are very glad to see&#151;and I look forward to exploring it further in Committee.

<A NAME="40429-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon on her detailed and careful assessment of the provisions of the Bill, with which I agree. In particular, I agree with her comments about the costs of its imposition to business; the cumulative effect of the provisions; the question of resignation, with which I shall deal; abstention on votes and funding. I am using telegraph to save time but the House will know, having listened to my noble friend's speech, what she had in mind.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para92"></a>I do not question the careful criticisms of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, to whose practical experience the House will no doubt, as usual, defer. So why should someone who some 40 years ago, when in opposition, set up and chaired the first Conservative committee on trade union law and employment relations&#151;on which, informally, it sought and obtained the continuing advice of the trade union leaders, without which it could not have operated&#151;presume to speak in this debate from these Back Benches at no one's behest?
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para93"></a>The reason is that the Government's policy, as reflected in the Bill, is not in the interests of the rank-and-file membership, the employer or the conduct of business; it is not conducive to the better order of employment relations in the national interest. The Bill is a deal between the Government and the TUC. In the current climate of industrial relations, it is not in any sense able to serve to sweeten the symbiotic relationship soured by the distrust and disillusion which is about to manifest itself, again, in June at a meeting to be attended by UNISON, the RMT, the <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Transport and General Workers' Union, ASLEF, the Fire Brigades Union, and so on, and the rank-and-file membership, at which an adverse vote is predicted.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para94"></a>No matter of current common concern to the public and to the unions is addressed by this Bill, such as the want of improvement to our public services, on which £20 billion has been spent each year for seven years without improvement. No attempt is made to deal with the problem of common concern to the public of disproportionate disruption. The Long Title inhibits requisite reform. Long before 9/11, the Iraq war, and the EU constitution, which some people refer to as "events", such requisite reform&#151;long overdue on such matters&#151;was recognised by the Prime Minister. He gave an undertaking to deal with them. That undertaking has not been met, and cannot be implemented under this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para95"></a>The work of that committee, incidentally, was not implemented by the Heath administration, who did not like it much. It was implemented much later in the Thatcher reforms, the broad substance of which remain. This Bill disturbs the long-established balance to increase the powers of the leadership and puts it to an advantage, while putting employers and industry to a disadvantage, which inevitably slights the prospect of employment.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para96"></a>Within the remit of the Long Title, there is a need not only for a broader appointment to the Central Arbitration Committee, but also for procedural rules on discovery to include all branch records, for evidence to be taken on oath, for cross-examination, for safeguards to avoid jeopardising the conciliation process, and to avoid destruction of confidentiality. There is also a need, as expressed by an employers' association, for the CAC to have clear procedural rules in view of the new responsibilities concerning enforcement of their practices during statutory union ballots, and enforcement of the new information and consultation regulations. As far as the latter is concerned, it is considered that this new and very different set of enforcement responsibilities means that the CAC should have a broader spectrum of members, and in particular that its membership should include employer and employee representatives who have had practical experience of information and consultation arrangements in a non-unionised environment, and that the addition of the detailed requirements about behaviour during conciliation and mediation proceedings is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para97"></a>There is no doubt whatever, having listened to the previous speakers, that in Grand Committee this Bill shall receive meticulous examination such as was not afforded to the Trojan stalking horse, and that due note will be taken of the Tenth Report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the question of compatibility. I shall not take time on that on Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para98"></a>The constraints of time also preclude an analysis of Clauses 1 to 16 of Part 1, regarding recognition of collective bargaining, supply of information, union communication, postal votes in ballots, notice to bring an end to bargaining arrangements, and so on. Quite simply, a recognition dispute arises either at the instigation of a single union or as a result of an inter-union dispute. The first attempt at regulation was <P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Barbara Castle's Industrial Relations Bill 1971, which, in effect, on this aspect, was implemented by the Heath administration. It worked extremely well, and I remember Vic Feather saying to me that it worked well to general satisfaction&#151;the only trouble was that it was a branch of the High Court. Of course that objection was removed long ago. We have heard today, as my noble friend Lady Miller pointed out, that not only in another place but elsewhere everything is working extremely well.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para99"></a>What is it all about? Why has this aspect of the longstanding balance to be disturbed? I think there is some explanation due, if everything is working satisfactorily, as to why this burden of complexity has to be imposed. Why, in subsection 2G inserted by Clause 21(4), should the union be entitled to determine who is to vote in a ballot? Why, in Sections 145A to 145E inserted by Clause 28, should the employer be prevented from offering an inducement to a worker which the worker is entitled to accept on pain of penalty, because it puts the union at a disadvantage relating to membership taking industrial action, or the provision of services? Why, in new section 145F(3), should the worker be deprived of resort to the High Court on a sort of ouster clause? These are only examples, and one could pick out all sorts of things, but there is not time to deal with them. Lastly, in Clause 47(1) and (2), why, on appeal from a decision of a certification officer, should the extant right to have an appeal on any question of fact be restricted to a matter of law, which in fact effectively stifles an appeal?
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para100"></a>Finally, and in conclusion, what about the consequences of this Bill&#151;and my noble friend Lady Miller touched on this in her speech&#151;on the burden on business? What about the consequences on the prospects of employment? Those prospects are entirely dependent on demand of profitable business, save for some sort of state intervention or subvention, such as when 160,000 jobseekers have been shifted onto benefits where there is no obligation to seek work. But that is rather a one-off situation, I hope.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para101"></a>There has been a steady fall in productivity over seven years, as well as the mammoth shift in manufacturing, business, banking, communications, IT and other services towards cheap labour abroad, and the benefit of lower taxation. This is a commercial fact of life on the Internet which cannot be forestalled and is bound to accelerate. We stand on the threshold of a more massive spending which cannot be met without further borrowing and taxation. There is an immovable mountain of government and personal debt. Those are the circumstances in which this new burdensome tide of bureaucracy, with statutory impositions of penalties for non-compliance, is to be imposed on the employers.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para102"></a>You have only to read the papers to see that industry struggles with redundancy. When these provisions seep through the clogged sieve, it is not the leadership of the trades unions that will suffer from want of employment&#151;it is the rank and file.

<A NAME="40429-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I want to return to the approach taken by the Minister in introducing the Bill, because I rather feel that subsequent speakers on the other side so far have missed the point.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para103"></a>The Bill has been criticised because it modifies, adjusts, changes at the margin and adds at the margin, to the Employment Relations Act 1999. Of course it does&#151;this is the way we approach legislation in all subjects now. We certainly do it in matters involving the law, prison reform and health service reform. We introduce Bills and modify what happened in the past, and then we pass on. That has to be understood.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para104"></a>I was glad that the Minister went through the past&#151;what was done in the 1999 Act, what we are attempting to do now and what may have to be done in the future to extend the legislation and provisions for regulation of the labour market. This is a continuous process now.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para105"></a>It is true, of course, that in the past seven years since my party has been in office, there has been a succession of Acts. You can argue about how you count them up&#151;my counting is not quite the same as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for example. I make it seven Acts in seven years&#151;three general and four special, the most important of which was the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. There was also the legislation on dispute resolution, on public disclosure, and so on. In rough terms, you might say that we have been legislating every year. In addition, because we agreed to scrap the opt-out negotiated by the previous Conservative government, we have not held up&#151;in fact, we have encouraged&#151;the implementation of a series of directives from Europe. That, too, will continue.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para106"></a>In any case, it is very strange for people on the Opposition Benches to complain about this, because that is exactly what Mrs Thatcher did. It is true that if you take her first seven years, I do not think she introduced more than five such Acts. There were two concerning employment, one about trade unions, one about wages and one about sex discrimination. But they all moved on from the previous piece of legislation&#151;that is what you do nowadays. The critical difference is the balance.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para107"></a>We took the view then and we take the view now that what was wrong with the successive Acts passed by the previous government&#151;and they did not stop after seven years; in fact, the pace escalated and got more radical&#151;was that the balance was one-sided. Two thirds of the proposals in the Bills introduced in the first seven years restricted the right to organise, the right of trade unions to run their own concerns and the right to strike. That is not a good balance.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para108"></a>It was said at the time that two thirds of the proposals were anti-union. That is a crude way of putting it, but reasonable. It is true that the other third was sometimes pro-worker, but many of them took away the individual rights of workers. Those that added to the individual rights of workers&#151;most particularly, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975&#151;were introduced because there was no way out. The <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Conservatives were very reluctant to introduce a Bill which advanced workers' rights and they got rid of them by signing the Maastricht opt-out.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para109"></a>The basic difference is not the number of Acts but their content and balance. The Government have been trying to restore the balance, and that will be maintained. When we consider what is being suggested in this Bill, the balance is being maintained. There are some further restorations of trade union rights&#151;that is right and proper. Some of us on this side of the House do not think that there are enough, but that is another debate. This is a further restoration of the balance.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para110"></a>There were also extensions of individual worker rights, such as unfair dismissal, maternity provisions, discrimination, and so on. They have been provided and will continue to be provided because we accept the need to extend individual worker rights. There is, in fact, an essential need to do this. If we take the view that trade union organisation and the extension of collective bargaining is becoming increasingly difficult, you must have some alternative. The only alternative we have so far found is individual employment rights. That movement, therefore, will continue. There are still gaps, as I said. My noble friend Lady Turner mentioned some of the things we think must be done. The Bill contains quite a few of them.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para111"></a>I shall concentrate my remarks on one major gap in the Bill because I am rather worried at what has been said so far. It concerns protection against discrimination in actions short of dismissal against trade unionists. It goes back to the first time a government attempted to do something about this, in the Employment Protection Act 1975. Section 53 effectively provided for the first time that there must be some restriction on the right of employers to use action short of dismissal&#151;not dismissal&#151;in order to discourage trade union membership.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para112"></a>Part of the trouble has been that for all their expertise, the Government are not very good on history. They do not go in for history very much. The central point for them to understand is that this is the oldest trick in the world. If you read the Webbs, G.D.H. Cole and Askwith in Industrial Problems and Disputes, in the First World War, employers divided into three groups. There were the good ones who encouraged trade union membership; there were the bad ones who sacked anybody who joined a trade union; and there were those in the middle who thought they were decent chaps. They did not sack their employees for belonging to trade unions but they did not encourage them. They shifted them on to slightly better work; they promoted them to foremen; they moved them on to established status; they gave them executive washrooms; and, above all, they gave them extra money.
<P>

<a name="40429-06_para113"></a>This was the kind, nice way of dealing with trade unionism and it is as old as the hills. It is a good thing that we have tried to deal with it by law, but we cannot do so entirely. Old Adam will always be there and there will always be employers who give trade unionists executive washrooms to bribe them out of the union.

My noble friend Lady Turner has mentioned it. I do not know how many noble Lords who are here today were here then, but I can remember the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, standing at the Dispatch Box.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord explain who is bribing whom? I never come across that kind of thing in trade union affairs. I may have misheard. What is going on?

<P>
<A NAME="40429-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I think the noble Lord is referring to washroom bribery.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, the most traditional and common way of seeking to give trade unions less influence and power and fewer members was to offer privileges to trade unionists on the condition that they became non-unionists. One of those privileges was better conditions and better washrooms, but, above all, more money. I hope that is clear.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para0"></a>Matters came to head with the Ullswater amendment was tabled in 1993 at 3.45 p.m. However, the Government now have a chance to deal with the problem. They have received a clear edict that the amendment runs contrary to international obligations to which this country is committed. They have received three reports from the Joint Committee. I am a little surprised and upset that we have not yet heard a word on what the Government intend to do now. A member of the Government is to sum up. The Government must tell us. If they cannot tell us now, they should give us some indication that they intend completely to revoke that amendment, on the strength of the four concrete suggestions advanced in the latest report from the Joint Committee. Those suggestions are clearly spelt out. Words are required. If the Government do not act, we shall be back to international legal conflict. We shall be back to tribunals and courts if we do not accept the committee's findings. The only option now is to accept the decision. Of course, it will not stop executive washrooms, but it is a start. It is just an attempt to go back to the simple principles of the Employment Protection Act.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para1"></a>I end by going into the future, just for a few moments. Since it is a Bill of bits and pieces&#151;and there is nothing wrong with that&#151;there are a few positive reforms to employment protection. That is partly because it is an evolving issue, but also because, although both parties have improved employment protection, no party has so far thought about the scope for employment protection in a period when trade union organisation is falling but job insecurity is rising. What should the Government's policy be? For the most part, successive governments have been pushed into employment protection legislation by <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>external factors. The Labour Party&#151;I make no apologies for it&#151;has been pushed by trade unions. Trade unions have stated that they should have certain employment rights. The Labour Party, as well as the Conservatives, has been pushed also by particular groups; for example, women's groups. It was not trade unions that won women's employment protection rights&#151;until they found a friendly Minister&#151;so much as women's groups. That was also the case with race discrimination and disability rights and so on. For the most part, changes have been brought about by external groups, when they have not been brought about by an even more external group; that is, directives from the European Union.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para2"></a>The Government should be thinking now about what they want to see as a government in terms of employment protection. They should be doing so not in this Bill, which is probably the last important Bill before the general election, but beyond the general election. If one looks in detail at employment protection, it is very uneven. For example, we enforce the minimum wage in one way, but we enforce most other employment rights in a quite different way. We set up ever-bigger commissions to suggest improvements in certain kinds of employment rights, such as discrimination rights, but we have no body of comparable size or importance to look at the most common case to go to industrial tribunals; namely, unfair dismissal. There is a considerable amount wrong with the way in which we deal with unfair dismissal, but nobody tries to think about a new policy. After all, the outcome of the 90 per cent of the cases that result in a positive award by the tribunal is not reinstatement, but dismissal with compensation.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para3"></a>I could continue, but I do not want to. It is time for the Government to think about a more coherent policy for unfair dismissal. The Government would be party to it because they had thought it out, in part, in their own election manifesto. But perhaps that is a debate for another day and another place.

<A NAME="40429-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I echo my noble friends Lady Turner of Camden and Lord McCarthy in their broad support for the Bill. I shall begin by giving some historical context to the Bill's significance. It concerns the pattern of collective agreements versus the role of the law in employment relations.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para4"></a>If we look at not just the European but the whole international picture, this country has been relatively light on individual legal protection for the reasons that my noble friend Lord McCarthy has indicated. It has also been light on rules governing collective representation. For various reasons, collective agreements have now been supplemented by what one might call benchmark collective rules on representation.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para5"></a>The Bill is historically interesting because, broadly speaking, we now have three levels of legal regulation. A debate has been taking place for the past 50 years that has resulted in the third level of regulation being built into the Bill before us today. I shall explain what I am referring to.
<P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para6"></a>The first rung of legal representation is the individual right of the worker in all companies to be able to raise a grievance and to have some rights of due process in any disciplinary hearing. In some ways, that is the most important step forward. But it cannot be isolated from the context in which trade unions play their role, which is not only at the level of representation in a grievance or disciplinary procedure, if the individual worker so wishes, but also in the balance of interests which determine the culture of the workplace&#151;often where not a great number of workers are actually members of the union.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para7"></a>I have described the first rung of representation. I should just like to mention, before I come to the second rung, the third rung. This is trade union recognition through the procedure of the Central Arbitration Committee, of which I happen to be a member, through the 1999 Act, following a framework agreement between the TUC and CBI. The historic change of this Bill, and why I am glad it is on the face of the Bill rather than being introduced through regulation, is that we have the results of a framework agreement between the TUC and the CBI, against a background of the European Directive on Information and Consultation. The directive is a framework agreement at two levels. It is a classic framework agreement under the Social Chapter in Brussels. There have been some remarkable achievements since the Labour government signed the Social Chapter as one of their first acts of government in 1997. Those who think that nothing of practical benefit to workers has come from the Social Chapter, that it is all bureaucracy in Brussels, could not be more wrong. Workers have four weeks' holiday: many workers, from the construction industries through to agriculture, had never dreamed of four weeks holiday with money up front. That has been an historic advance for workers in this country. There are pro rata rights for part-time workers. The more we want so-called atypical workers to be part of a thriving economy, the more there must be some framework right for them. That has been an advance through very flexible negotiations in Brussels, and is a simple collective agreement to be understood by employers and unions in industry. With regard to fixed-term contract workers, if they are going to be part of a modern labour market, are we saying there should be no minimum benchmark rules for those workers?
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para8"></a>We have still to crack the issue of agency workers. We have seen the recent exposure of the terrible chaos in the case of gangmasters in Morecambe Bay. Trade unions dealing with such agency workers in agriculture or construction on a daily basis in East Anglia know that this needs to be covered as well.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para9"></a>In some respects, the piece de resistance of the Social Chapter procedure has been the way it has reached a conclusion&#151;not without difficulty&#151;on the question of information and consultation. This was agreed in Brussels, and is a relatively short text that has now been transposed, you might say, into the recommendation for national law through the framework agreement between the TUC and the CBI. This Social Chapter procedure stands in sharp contrast to the procedure used if the employers and unions cannot agree to go down the road of social dialogue. I have in mind the endless criticism of the Working Time Directive. The significance of the <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contrast between that and the procedures we have in the Bill for information and consultation, is that one has a much more complicated text because it was done as a directive of Article 118a of the Treaty of Rome, health and safety provisions, and there has been a lot of difficulty in implementing it. However, the alternative, rejected by employers, was to have done it through a framework agreement. We have the framework agreement on information and consultation. If somebody wants to say it is a revolution I think that would be stretching language, but let us say that it is. It is a revolution because for the first time&#151;it is a debate that would have gone the other way in the trade union movement 50, even 25, years ago&#151;a collective system of representation should be open to election of workers' representatives by all of the people in the workplace. Unions can have slates of supported candidates, but there is certainly no guarantee that the union candidates will win the election.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para10"></a>There are a million reasons&#151;such as whether this could be an alternative to union recognition, or whether there could be manipulation by employers&#151;why some people have not, historically, been over the moon about that sort of approach. Now that the TUC and the unions have bitten the bullet across Europe, and this is part of the procedure, I want to say that this is an historic moment that we must welcome in order to see rung two of the employment relationship in place. It will apply to every company above a certain size. The argument about numbers began with 150, then 120; there can be arguments about the pace of progress on these numbers. But this has been a very important development, providing a context in which we are discussing this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para11"></a>I hope I am conveying a picture which is very different from that presented by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, when she said that this is a drop by drop dismantling of the Thatcher legislation and it reminds her of when we were the "sick man of Europe". I do not think that this is the most measured of her contributions on this topic.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para12"></a>I should like to mention the debate about the union modernisation fund. I cannot corroborate exactly what Digby Jones said&#151;according to this morning's press&#151;in his speech yesterday, but it would be a little rich if he wanted to describe the TUC as an "irrelevant lobby group", without somebody saying "touche". The fact is that social partners are the alternative to the sort of heavy legislation to which employers purport to be particularly opposed. On the actual substance of £10 million, over many years we have known that sums like £100 million, £200 million&#151;it all depends what you include, such as subsidies to training courses in industry&#151;go in the direction of the employers. There is squealing perhaps because the supposition that new Labour is about dismantling the trade unions turns out not to be true. I never thought that it was true. It is hard to believe that people seriously thought that that was the agenda. There is squealing now that we are trying to create a level playing field.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para13"></a>There is no doubt that we need to do some work on that level playing field. The pensions issue is one example. At the end of next month, I think, we will be <P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considering a Bill on that issue. Directors of FTSE 100 companies receive something like 80 per cent of the tax benefits from the present pension arrangements, whereas workers are often left with nothing&#151;as in the case of Allied Steel and Wire&#151;when a firm goes into liquidation. That has to be dealt with. There is no doubt that, despite the minimum wage, inequality in income distribution towards the top end of the distribution spectrum has grown by leaps and bounds.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para14"></a>The trade unions are the only bulwark for ensuring greater equality. All the OECD statistics show a striking correlation between the density of trade union membership and equality. If we want a tolerably equal society, it is in the interests of public policy that we have a strong trade union movement. Whatever the Government do, they cannot ensure that. However, small steps such as those in the Bill are very welcome. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, in winding up from the Liberal Democrat Benches, and having listened to a number of speeches from both sides, perhaps I may start by bringing noble Lords back to what I should have thought was common ground&#151;although it does not appear to be&#151;which is that the Bill makes relatively small amendments to the previous legislation. Having listened to a number of the speeches&#151;particularly that of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who saw fit to spend 16 minutes giving us a history lecture but does not seem to have time to be in his place for the winding-up speeches&#151;one might think that the Bill will lead to hordes of workers led by Arthur Scargill marching on Westminster. Having listened to the Minister, however, I have the impression that this is a relatively small Bill, building on the experience of the previous legislation. With one or two reservations to which I shall return, the Bill was largely supported by my party in another place, and it will be supported by my party in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para15"></a>I start with two general points and will then turn to the three specific areas on which we will want to touch in Committee. First, having listened to some of the language in your Lordships' House on reports this morning of comments made by Digby Jones on behalf of the CBI, I think it a great shame that, despite the fact that we appear to have probably the best industrial relations that we have had in my adult lifetime in terms of hours lost through strikes, we still seem to have coming from both the CBI and the TUC the rhetoric of confrontation that so bedevilled industrial relations in the past. As I think Malcolm Bruce said in another place either on Second Reading or in Committee, when the Government present their legislative proposals in this area, the press releases from the CBI and the TUC can almost be written in advance.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para16"></a>So I have some sympathy with the Minister as he tries to find a path between the two approaches of the CBI and the TUC. As someone not involved in any of those discussions or procedures, were I to be treating this as a football game, I do not think I would call it a score draw between the TUC and the CBI as regards consultation on the Bill. I should think that any <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>objective observer would say that it is a pretty significant away win for the CBI. The TUC came in with a large number of pretty radical proposals that it thought should go in the Bill, many of which the Government have rejected. So to those on this side of the House who seem to suggest that this is a deal between the TUC and the Government, all I can say is, "Some deal". If it was a deal, the Government have certainly played a much stronger hand than the TUC managed to do.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para17"></a>That is probably not something on which the Minister will want to comment. However, it would be unfortunate if we started off our deliberations on the Bill by characterising it as a radical attempt to change employment law. It is not. It is a small attempt to improve on the workings of the previous legislation. As I said, from these Benches we welcome most of the reforms.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para18"></a>The second general point will be relevant when we consider the Bill in Committee. It is becoming almost a characteristic of any Bill which the Minister introduces to this House that it has probably not had proper scrutiny in another place. The Bill was passed by another place under a programmed structure, and amendments of quite fundamental importance were introduced at Report and Third Reading. Far be it from me to say that it would have changed the course of history, but, because of the programmed nature of the debate, the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman was not even called on Third Reading to indicate my party's views and reservations. That is not the Minister's fault, and he will certainly not be criticised for it. However, it gives your Lordships' House greater licence to table amendments and to ask the Government to take our amendments more seriously than they would perhaps feel necessary if the Bill had had 100 per cent proper scrutiny in another place.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para19"></a>I see a number of heads on both sides of the House nodding at that. I hope that the Government will take those remarks in the spirit in which I intended them. From these Benches we certainly do not intend in any way to attempt to wreck the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40429-07_para20"></a>I should like to speak to three areas of concern on which we should like to probe the Government a little further in Committee. The first concerns Clause 39, which goes much further than simply tidying up the recognition and bargaining provisions in the previous legislation. It is the start of implementing the European directive of February 2002 requiring member states to establish national systems for informing and consulting employees in undertakings with at least 50 employees. Clause 39 gives the Government power to introduce regulations to implement that directive.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   It is Clause 31, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   I apologise, my Lords; it is Clause 31.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para0"></a>In view of some of the very high profile examples of failure to consult employees regarding closures and the fact that probably half of all private sector places of work are not unionised, the importance of these regulations and the likely future of industrial relations in this country as a result of these regulations cannot be overestimated. <P>


<a name="column_926"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 926</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Indeed, somebody at Warwick University thought that in due course the implementation of this directive will revolutionise the way in which industrial relations are conducted in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para1"></a>Liberal Democrats in another place wanted to extend the powers of the Government and take them a little further down the path of implementing this directive, and we will seek to bring forth amendments in Committee to this effect.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para2"></a>The second area in which Liberal Democrats in another place tried to see whether the Bill was satisfactory or if there was a gap in it that could be filled was that of unofficial strikes; and whether the law as it currently stands deals satisfactorily with the position of unofficial strikes, both in non-unionised workplaces&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord for not being in my place when he started.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para3"></a>I agree with him on the question that he raises, but it is without the ambit of the Long Title of the Bill. It cannot be extended to deal with strikes and unofficial strikes without amending the Long Title.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, it may well be that such a change to the drafting would be necessary, but in this Second Reading debate I am trying to deal with a point of substance.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para4"></a>In the light of recent experience of unofficial strikes in the Post Office&#151;to name but one organisation&#151;we on these Benches will seek to probe the Government on whether further improvements or amendments to employment law could be put into this legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para5"></a>The third area on which a number of noble Lords have touched&#151;and here we have considerable sympathy with the points raised by noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;is the provision of money for trade union modernisation.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para6"></a>If there is one area where your Lordships need to be absolutely certain that the section is in its correct form and the necessary safeguards have been put in before we pass it, this is it. I do not wish to make a wider point. But when a Labour Government&#151;who are significantly funded by the trade union movement&#151;use their majority in the House of Commons on a whipped vote to pass this particular clause, then your Lordships need to be certain that the appropriate safeguards are in place before passing it.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para7"></a>We do not disagree with public money being made available to trade unions for this purpose&#151;indeed we support the principle&#151;but your Lordships have a duty to the electorate in this area in particular to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I have listened attentively to the debate. As ever, it has been a debate among noble Lords with a huge amount of experience, <P>


<a name="column_927"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 927</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the quality of the contributions has reflected that. I am grateful to everybody who has participated in our discussion here today.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para8"></a>A number of important and telling points have been made and I will do my best to address as many of them as possible. But first I should like to make some general points about the Bill, to underline the core arguments made by my noble friend Lord Sainsbury in his opening remarks.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para9"></a>Let me remind the House of the significant achievements of this Government in the field of employment relations. This is a limited list. Among other things, we have put in place fair minimum standards and fair wages for all through minimum wage legislation; paid holidays, rest breaks and a cap on the working week; flexible and family friendly working, which has provided greater choice for employees, encouraged the retention of skilled and experienced employees, and enabled employers to cope with the changing demands of their business.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para10"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner asked for consideration of other areas of flexibility, and I have no doubt that there will be a discussion on those points.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para11"></a>We have also put in place new protections against discrimination at work on grounds of sexual orientation, religion or belief, and work is under way to provide new protections against discrimination on grounds of age. Trade unions now have the right to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes where the majority of the workforce want this. It is now unlawful to dismiss workers for taking industrial action within eight weeks of the start of that action, or after that time if the employer has not taken reasonable steps to resolve the dispute. I shall return to that point when I deal with some of the detailed questions that have been asked.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para12"></a>In reminding the House of these achievements and in summing up the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is right to say that it is a relatively small sequence of additions, precisely for the reasons given by my noble friend Lord McCarthy. This is a process that will continue. As the world of work changes&#151;and we all discussed change in that light&#151;it is inevitable that all the things that I have mentioned, and all that my noble friend Lord Lea mentioned about the gains that have been made over a period producing, as he put it, a very different picture, are matters of some importance to your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para13"></a>I remind the House that these achievements have been accompanied at each step by predictions that the policies were bound to lead to unemployment, would damage business and would encourage industrial unrest or worse. No doubt we will hear the same comments made about this Bill. The arguments will be as unfounded as they have been on other occasions.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para14"></a>As this is an issue of such principle, this is the right moment to take up one or two of the points about the big picture that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.
<P>


<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 928</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para15"></a>The cumulative effects of the legislation that has been introduced during the life of this Government can scarcely be liable to cause the damage that has been described on the one hand, and on the other be understood against a background of employment stability, the lowest rates of unemployment in living memory, and unprecedented economic progress. Those cannot both be true. I ask noble Lords to reflect on the likelihood that the rather draconian predictions are not likely to be accurate. I have the deepest respect for the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, put it, and I know that he has had a deep interest in these matters for many years, but none the less I put that point to him.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para16"></a>We believe that our policies make sense for employees, that they will lead to the tolerable equality that my noble friend Lord Lea mentioned and that they will be good for business and for the economy. Our record bears this out. As I have said, we are enjoying an unprecedentedly good period in economic and employment terms. All of those advantages lie at the foundations of sound government.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para17"></a>The Bill takes us one stage further. It builds on our successes and sets down solid foundations for the future: a future based on high performance workplaces and high quality jobs; a future where employers, employees and their representatives are informed, involved and committed, working together for mutual benefit.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para18"></a>Unions play a central part in taking forward the partnership agenda and contributing to greater productivity. That has been among their greatest accomplishments. We want unions, like businesses, to embrace new ways of working and to modernise. The union modernisation fund will help to achieve this goal.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para19"></a>I understand the point that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, made about wanting to ensure that the funds that go through it could not be diverted in ways that would be inappropriate. In his opening speech, my noble friend Lord Sainsbury made the point that that could not happen under political fund legislation. None the less, we believe that the modernisation issues are fundamental in ensuring that we have hard-working, stable industrial relations. I do not accept the argument advanced in the past few days by Digby Jones that 7 million organised working people constitute some kind of fragmentary lobby group. That seems to be a disparagement rather than an analysis and probably in due course he will think the better of it.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para20"></a>We want to ensure as a matter of sound law that the good work of unions can continue without being hindered by racists and xenophobes who seek to use unions to spread their vile message of hatred and intolerance. We have brought forward measures in the legislation to enable unions to address this. We have delivered on our commitment to review the operation of the Employment Relations Act 1999, and I believe that most of the evidence shows it is working well.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para21"></a>The statutory recognition procedure has been a resounding success. It has encouraged voluntary recognition in more than 1,000 cases and has contributed towards a new partnership approach between unions and employers. I <P>


<a name="column_929"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 929</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wonder whether I might pay my own personal tribute to Sir Michael Burton for his exceptional leadership of the CAC and the efforts his colleagues have made, which have unquestionably led to smoother and better relations. The Bill will make improvements to statutory procedure, which will enhance its smooth operation and ensure that the spirit of co-operation and fair play that has contributed to his success is not undermined either by a minority of employers or unions who prefer to use intimidation rather than play by the rules that have been established.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para22"></a>It is an essential feature of a fair and modern society that workers are free to belong to and to be represented by a trade union, and the Bill puts in place important protections for trade union members of the kind my noble friend Lady Turner described. They will ensure that they have clear rights to use union services and cannot be induced by employers to forgo their union representation.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para23"></a>I will turn to some of the points about the European consultation procedures, which are very important. No one wants to see a repeat of the most unfortunate events of Friction Dynamics. The Bill will strengthen protection for workers on legitimate strike action and will ensure that employers and unions take their obligations to resolve disputes seriously.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para24"></a>I shall now deal with as many of the questions as I can handle in the brief time available. First, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about the overall increase in employment legislation. Generally speaking, the point has been addressed by my noble friend Lord McCarthy. I will not elaborate on it&#151;we have needed to deal with matters as the situation has changed. It cannot be said that Europe is dictating employment law, as has perhaps been suggested. The original version of the directive presented by the European Commission would have imposed a single works council model on everyone. Changes were agreed by all of the member states to give more flexibility for employers and employees to agree arrangements suited to their particular circumstances. That was the basis on which the Government agreed to it.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para25"></a>We have been asked why we chose not to use statutory instruments but instead chose to use primary legislation. It is not possible to implement all of the agreed CBI and TUC framework under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act, as originally intended, without having a Bill that allows us to do so. The employment relations Bill is a timely vehicle to achieve that objective. The Bill will implement the directive. That is not in itself a convention&#151;we have opted to do it because this is the appropriate moment to do it.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para26"></a>We have been asked about whether this gold plates the directive in any respect. The framework and draft regulations have been agreed with the CBI and the TUC and, as both parties agree, no gold plating is involved. We have used a light and flexible touch in the implementation process. The wording used in the clauses of the Bill makes it clear that that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para27"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, understandably asks why the "Miller amendment" should not be retained. Having read about the Miller amendment for <P>


<a name="column_930"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 930</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many years, I am delighted now to sit on the Benches opposite its author. The amendment concerned the need to retain necessary employer flexibility when rewarding staff. Our proposals already adequately safeguard these key business concerns and protect the ability of employers to offer enhanced terms to key workers who they wish to retain for sound business reasons and not in a way that undermines collective bargaining. The Bill secures this in a way that balances employer interests against the necessary rights of union members.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para28"></a>The amendment inserted into the Employment Relations Act 1999, which pre-dates the European Court's judgment, is an important turning point. It was inserted in what is now Section 17 of that Act. That section has never been commenced and its provisions are superseded by this Bill and by the judgment.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para29"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked us to define "lock out". We are a little loath to do so. The definition would not necessarily be useful. The possibility has been considered. We believe that any definition would risk covering situations which it should not and failing to cover situations which it should. We believe that it is a matter best left to the courts and the tribunals to decide in the light of the situation on the ground. The term "lock out" has been used in this legislation for many years without further definition and I do not believe that the absence of a definition has itself caused legal difficulties.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para30"></a>We were asked why the procedural rules for the CAC were not set out in statute. We want to provide the CAC with the necessary freedom to determine its own procedures. It has done it very well so far and it has been a signal success. Its ability to operate effectively under a senior judge has been one of its greatest virtues.
<P>

<a name="40429-08_para31"></a>We were asked, with regard to Clause 3 and the provision of information to unions regarding proposed bargaining units, what abuses we are intending to address. The statutory procedure was designed to encourage the voluntary resolution of claims at every opportunity. The limited information which must be supplied to the union under Clause 3 is intended to facilitate agreement between the parties on what the bargaining unit should be. Such information is often revealed to the union in the course of such negotiations in any case.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, the House will forgive me for intervening. Could the noble Lord deal with a serious problem relating to the procedure of the court? Is he prepared to consider that evidence should be given on oath? Is he prepared to consider that there should be cross-examination? Is he also prepared to consider whether the discovery rules as to procedure should include branch discovery of records, which I am told do not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, it is probably as well if I try to address that immediately. It is a complex issue and I should be prepared to discuss it in much more detail in Committee.
<P>


<a name="column_931"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 931</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para0"></a>On the application to undertakings employing fewer than 50 employees, we are wary of imposing additional regulatory burdens on small firms unless there is an absolutely clear need to do so. The directive acknowledges this by giving the option of applying only to undertakings with more than 50 employees. In practice, the vast majority of UK employees&#151;about three quarters of them&#151;will gain new rights under the information and consultation legislation. But we will be considering good practice guidance on employee dialogue in small firms not covered by the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para1"></a>We do not intend to change the status of abstentions in recognition ballots. However, the Government are keen to ensure that as many workers as possible vote. It is obviously good for democracy and for the standing of the ballot result. Indeed, the introduction of postal votes, for example, in relation to industrial action ballots was designed entirely to accomplish that objective&#151;at least that was the argument put for it by the Conservative government at the time&#151;hence, the need to introduce the provision in Clause 7 to give workers a chance to vote by post in workplace ballots.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para2"></a>The significance of the changes in the wording of paragraphs 35 and 44, which are referred to in Clause 10, was discussed in the review of the Employment Relations Act. The review found that there was some confusion in the meaning of the paragraphs, which would be resolved by this kind of wording.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para3"></a>In all these cases, we are seeing sensible resolutions to outstanding issues. Having raised those matters, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is entitled to a serious answer to them. If I have missed any of her other points, I shall be happy to write to her in due course.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para4"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner raised several very important questions&#151;echoed, I believe, by my noble friend Lord McCarthy&#151;about the complexity of the procedures. I am sure that that matter will be discussed in greater detail, and therefore I would say only that the complexity is, without question, a reflection of the fact that ambiguities have been thought to exist in the processes as they stand. A great deal has been spent on legal advice in order to try to find a solid route through some of these matters, and one often ends up with as many pieces of advice as the number of lawyers to whom one turns. Even if the procedures are lengthy, the intention must be to ensure the greatest possible transparency for everyone.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para5"></a>To my answer to my noble friend Lady Turner, I would add that the use of a qualified independent person in ballots and suitable independent persons for the purpose of union communications is to give greater confidence to everyone involved that the matters have all been handled fairly and efficiently and so that every party can have confidence in the results.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para6"></a>Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that I do not intend today to go over the arguments and evidence on the 21-worker threshold or the 40 per cent ballot threshold. Much evidence relates to these areas, and I have no doubt that the matter will be discussed in Grand Committee. However, the evidence suggests <P>


<a name="column_932"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that those are not insuperable barriers in any respect and, in fact, they place upon everyone the need to work harder to produce sensible results.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para7"></a>The core bargaining agenda is important. What we have&#151;I shall not disguise it&#151;is the basis of an agreement between the TUC and the CBI about the core topics. There is no question that other matters may well be discussed by additional routes, but they will not themselves represent the greatest level of consensus that was achieved in those discussions, which I believe were hugely valuable. I make the same point to my noble friends Lord McCarthy and Lady Turner. Again, there is a great deal of evidence in relation to the whole issue of the eight-week rule in industrial action, and I believe that that is probably best handled in Grand Committee. In short, there is at least a degree of consensus on all those matters, even if the TUC and the CBI would like us to go further.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para8"></a>In going through many of those issues and in considering some of the others, in the brief time available I want to touch on just one other matter that was raised&#151;that is, the question of the JCHR report. The Government have prepared a detailed response to the concerns, which is available in the Library of the House. The memorandum explains why we consider the Bill's provisions on Wilson and Palmer to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and the implementation of the European Court's judgment in that case. However, I say openly that we shall look forward to discussing that matter in detail in Grand Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may get one matter clear. Is my noble friend telling me that he has written something new which we have not seen and that it is now in the Library?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I am saying exactly that. It is very recent and very new. Even yesterday, I myself was not aware of its contents but I am today.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para9"></a>Things are, in a general sense, working well. We were asked why we should change that position. As my noble friend Lord McCarthy said in making his point about incremental change, it makes the law more explicit and more effective.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para10"></a>In summing up, perhaps I may say that it is a privilege and a pleasure to be involved in this Bill. I look forward to the continuing and detailed discussions that we shall no doubt have in Grand Committee, where I am sure we shall receive the benefit of everyone's close and expert scrutiny. I completely agree with the point that any rhetoric of confrontation will not help that process. The measures contained in the Bill will take us further down the road of partnership and high-performance workplaces and will help to maintain the impressive climate of employment relations that we enjoy today, which are so fundamental to the well-being of our economy. I commend the Bill to the House.

<A NAME="40429-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 26 April be approved [16th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am pleased to move the Motion for this order on enlargement of the European economic area. As the House is aware, the Government have put tremendous effort into ensuring that our friends in central Europe, Cyprus and Malta are able to join the European Union this Saturday. This order is a formal step towards delivering that enlargement.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para13"></a>I apologise for the short notice in bringing the order before the House. EEA enlargement is due to take place with EU enlargement on Saturday, 1 May. However, unfortunately the Foreign and Commonwealth Office failed to take into account the Easter Recess when calculating the 21 sitting days required between the order being laid in the House and the subsequent debate. The command paper was laid in the House on 15 April, but we should like to secure ratification as soon as possible in order to co-ordinate with EEA enlargement. Approval of the order today would allow it to be considered by the Privy Council on 6 May. If the Privy Council approves the order, the UK will be able to ratify in the week of EEA and EU enlargement. Therefore, I apologise to your Lordships. It was, indeed, a slip-up, but I hope that it will not impede our progress.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para14"></a>The European Commission had prepared provisional administrative measures for the eventuality that not all member states would be able to ratify EEA enlargement in time for 1 May itself. I believe that the UK can be proud of the major part that it has played in ensuring that the conditions are right for EU enlargement to take place. We shall continue to promote and support reform in the accession states, helping those countries to fulfil their potential.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para15"></a>The subject of the order&#151;the agreement signed in Luxembourg on 14 October 2003&#151;together with four protocols, which are not the subject of the order, allow the participation of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic in the European economic area. The EEA allows our friends in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein to participate in the internal EU market, bringing benefits to them and to us in terms of trade and the free movement of people. An effective internal market is crucial to the success of the EU. We must ensure that the market embraces the accession states as soon as they join so that they will be able to trade as liberally as we, or any other EU member states, already do with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para16"></a>Through the EEA enlargement agreement, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein will make valuable financial contributions to economic and social reform in the accession states over the next five years. Under the terms of the agreement and four associated protocols, Iceland, <P>


<a name="column_934"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 934</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Norway and Liechtenstein will contribute £415 million over a five-year period to help to alleviate social and economic difficulties in the accession states. Moreover, Norway will contribute an additional £393 million to help to facilitate the integration of the accession states into the internal market.
<P>

<a name="40429-09_para17"></a>I believe that this is a positive measure for the United Kingdom, ensuring effective free trade between European partners. I am sure the House will agree that it is a welcome agreement that supplements part of the EU enlargement process, ensuring that the full benefits are available to all. I hope that we shall be able to approve the order today. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for explaining the order. Despite a small amount of confusion which has been apparent in the relaying of this SI, we do not propose to oppose its passage through this House.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para0"></a>As the Minister said, in essence this is a technical measure to translate the agreement on the European economic area signed at Oporto in 1992, to which the accession countries signed up in 2003, into a community treaty. We are pleased to see these accession countries moving forward to full EU membership at the weekend. That is something which we have always supported, and we support this measure, which is designed to allow accession countries fully to enjoy the benefits of sharing in the internal market.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para1"></a>However, I have a small number of points which I hope the noble Baroness can clarify. First, given that this SI relates to accession countries due to accede on 1 May, why is it being brought before us at this time so near to 1 May? What, if anything, does this SI and the translation from agreement to community treaty substantially change? Finally, when does the noble Baroness envisage that ratification will occur?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, we all welcome&#151;indeed, we are all going to rather too many parties welcoming&#151;the enlargement of the European Union which takes place this weekend. I have to accept that the Government must have found it rather easy to forget about the European economic area in all of this. The EEA is a leftover of an attempted negotiation in the late 1980s between the European Community and the European free trade area countries to provide them with an acceptable alternative to membership which did not impose on them the full obligations of participation in the European Union. As I am sure Members of the Conservative Party remember well&#151;they were then in government&#151;by the time those negotiations were concluded, the majority of members of EFTA had decided that there was no viable alternative to membership and that they were better off becoming full members.
<P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para2"></a>I am not entirely sure whether the Conservative opposition sees the relationship between Iceland and the EU, Norway and the EU or Liechtenstein and the EU as its preferred model for Britain's future association or whether, indeed, it would prefer to reject the EEA as well and take, perhaps, the Swiss position. I heard a Conservative on the radio the other day suggest that Norway was the ideal model for Britain's relationship with the EU. Therefore, I am very pleased that the Minister reminded us that Norway has agreed to become the largest contributor per head of financial assistance to new member states thus reminding the Conservative opposition that one does not entirely opt out of everything one does not want to have if one attempts to renegotiate. Indeed, I am well aware, as I have taken part in conferences both in Oslo and Reykjavik in the past 18 months, of an active debate within both those countries as to whether they would now be better to reconsider and become full members.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para3"></a>Having made that very slightly partisan point, perhaps I may say that we on these Benches welcome the agreement. The EEA is a useful minor part of the European Union's external relations. I hope that once we have got over the celebrations of enlargement, we shall have some time in this House to debate the wider issues of the European Union's relations with its neighbours. After all, its other neighbours are far more difficult than the three covered by this order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may add to the point that has just been made. In everything that is done in the European Union, not only in respect of industrial free trade but many of the regulations concerning public procurement, and so forth&#151;the list is very long indeed&#151;Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein do not sit at the table. Therefore, their interests are not directly spoken to at the time that such arrangements are made, and they are contributing to the funds of the European Union in the guise of the European economic area, which of course, has the characteristics described by my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para4"></a>Therefore, this is a very good opportunity to underline the fact that this would be a hopeless formula for a country such as Britain. I think we shall hear more of this question as the months go by.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lords, Lord Astor of Hever, and Lord Wallace of Saltaire, for the support that they have offered the Government on this order. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that we did not forget the EEA. As I attempted to say in my opening remarks, the delay in presenting the order to your Lordships was a miscalculation of the number of sitting days between the day the order was laid before the House and 1 May. I apologise again to <P>


<a name="column_936"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 936</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lords for that. I hope that that answers the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, about why this is so close to 1 May. It was not meant to be quite so close. As I have said, there was a mistake. I am grateful to both noble Lords for being so generous in passing gracefully over that point.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked what real difference the order would make. It does not make any material difference to the issues covered, but extends the relationship between the European Union countries which are full members today and the three countries concerned to the 10 countries which will join us on Saturday. So it is not a question of changing the nature of the agreement; it simply changes its geographical coverage. When all the EU members have been through their acceptance process, there will be ratification in the usual way and I would not expect that to present any particular difficulty.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, asked whether the arrangements for Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein might provide a model for the future. As noble Lords would expect, I agree very much with the points made by my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall. We would not be happy sitting in this position in relation to the rest of Europe, but perhaps that is a debate for another day.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para7"></a>I re-emphasise the comments of my noble friend Lord Lea. The British Government value the United Kingdom's excellent relations with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Clearly, they contribute far more than just an effective internal market. The figures I have been able to give noble Lords regarding the very generous contributions that all three countries are able to make over the next five years to the economic and social development of the accession countries speak for themselves. I think that her Majesty's Government would be very pleased to support any of the peoples and governments of those three countries were they to choose to apply for EU membership. We would support that wholeheartedly.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para8"></a>I believe that the House overwhelmingly supported the legislation ratifying the EU enlargement last year and by approving the order on the EEA today the House has had an opportunity to reaffirm its support for the inclusion of the accession states in the process of building a competitive and effective Europe. I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to this brief exchange for their support.

<a name="40429-10_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40429-10_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when we last debated Clause 4 of the Bill, the Minister laid down what I described as a veritable barrage of legislative <P>


<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>precedent in relation to his new provisions in Clause 4(7), giving the appropriate authority, by which is normally meant the Secretary of State, the power to direct the agency to have regard in exercising any of its functions to such aspects of the policies of the authority as the authority directs, and also the default powers, to persuade us that there was very good precedent for both aspects of the new amendments he proposed at that time. When the smoke cleared, however&#151;effectively after I had read Hansard subsequent to the debate&#151;it struck me that a number of questions remained regarding what the Minister had said.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para14"></a>There is no dispute between any of the Benches on the question of the default powers. They fall fair and square with virtually every other agency that the Secretary of State for Health has to deal with, whether it is the FSA, the regulators or many other bodies. It is really over the subsection (7) powers that there is some doubt.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para15"></a>When the Minister referred to the new subsection he referred to CHI&#151;I know that that is now called the Healthcare Commission, so one must remember to change our vocabulary as time goes on&#151;and CSCI, which I believe has not changed its name. These bodies have a very different role to that of the Health Protection Authority.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para16"></a>The Minister referred to chapter and verse. He referred to Section 131 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act as regards CSCI, and he referred to Section 132 of that Act, as regards the Healthcare Commission.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para17"></a>The Minister skated very lightly over one matter&#151;indeed, he did not mention it. This is the aspect that interested me when the smoke cleared. The FSA, which has much more analogous functions to the Health Protection Agency, does not have any power of that kind available to the Secretary of State. This is the dog that did not bark in the night. Perhaps the Minister would give us further background on the issue.
<P>

<a name="40429-10_para18"></a>The default powers are in Section 24 of the Food Standards Act 1999. There are other powers relating to international treaties, and indeed powers to remove members of the agency, which are quite interesting in the context of the HPA Bill. But there is nothing similar to subsection (7). That seems rather strange. Could the Minister explain why we are adopting this provision when no such provision exists in the case of the Food Standards Agency? I beg to move.

<A NAME="40429-11_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has such difficulty with my extensive explanation of our thinking on Report. Clause 4(7) is part and parcel of the revised powers of direction as to the exercise of functions, which we agreed to incorporate in the Bill on Report. I would suggest that removing it would not improve the Bill. It particularly goes together with Clause 4(8). So, they are part and parcel of the same approach.
<P>


<a name="column_938"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 938</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para0"></a>I shall not go through the extensive explanations that I gave on Report, but I should like to focus on one particular point. I shall return to the point about the Food Standards Agency. I would remind the House that Clause 4(7) is virtually identical in terms to the wording in Section 131&#151;subsection (1) in particular&#151;of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. Whatever else we did in the Bill, we combed through it extensively and had extensive debates on whether those provisions would unreasonably fetter the independence of those bodies and on whether it would put the Secretary of State in a position rather whimsically to give directions to the Healthcare Commission and CSCI. After our debates, the Act on the statute book had virtually identical wording to that in Clause 4(7).
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para1"></a>I reiterate to those who are concerned that Clause 4(7) will be used to prevent the agency carrying out an act that an appropriate authority did not believe to be appropriate, that that is not a backdoor way of maintaining the wider power of direction which we removed from the Bill on Report.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para2"></a>The fact that we have not followed slavishly the wording in the Food Standards Act means that we have not copied that Act. We have related the powers here much more to health bodies, and we have drafted the Bill accordingly. The noble Lord shakes his head. He may not like the elegance of our drafting or the wording or my explanation, but my account explains why we have framed this legislation in this way. The legislation on the Health Protection Agency, in terms of this reserved provision in relation to directions, is virtually the same wording as that used in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act. That is the position, and I suggest that it is not necessary to pursue the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has considerable chutzpah in coming back and virtually repeating word for word, except for a few excisions, the statements that he made on Report. Accusing me of saying that there were objections to the Government not having copied slavishly the Food Standards Act is fairly breathtaking. The point is not just that the Government have not copied slavishly the Food Standards Act; they have inserted provisions that were never contained in it. We have got away from the charge that is laid against me.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para3"></a>I accept the Minister's assurance that this is not a backdoor way of giving directions to the agency. It has been limited. I think that the Minister did listen. Whether he has gone far enough, we will have to judge on the actual behaviour of future Secretaries of State in the way they relate to the agency. We have on the record fairly adamant assurances at virtually every stage of the Bill that that power will be used properly and within the policy framework. The precise interpretation of the subsection no doubt will take place on a future occasion. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) But subsection (11) does not authorise a disclosure of information which contravenes the Data Protection Act 1998 (c. 29)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-11_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to the other two government amendments in this group, although they relate to slightly different issues.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para7"></a>Amendment No. 2 responds to a point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, at Grand Committee and on Report. I am extremely grateful to him for having drawn our attention to it. We all recognise that the Health Protection Agency, in order to discharge its functions, will need to handle confidential and sensitive information. Quite properly, information of this nature needs to be subject, as a general rule, to various restrictions on its handling. There will, however, be circumstances in which the agency will need to disclose information which it holds to the other bodies with which it works, in order for the agency and those bodies effectively to discharge their functions. There will also be circumstances in which the agency will need to receive information from such bodies, again in order for both parties effectively to perform their functions.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para8"></a>In very many such cases, there is already legislation in place, which requires such information to be protected and provides a basis on which it can be passed to, and received from, others with whom it needs to be shared.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para9"></a>However, it is not possible to say that whatever functions the agency takes on under the provisions in Clauses 2 and 3, and whatever the areas within which other bodies seek its co-operation, there will always be&#151;and in every circumstance&#151;a clear legal basis on which the agency and its partners can share the information that they need to share effectively to perform their functions. There may be restrictions on sharing some information that the agency and its partners need to share. It is for that reason that Clause 4(11) is included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para10"></a>Clause 4(11) disapplies from the agency and its partners restrictions on the disclosure of information. It allows the agency and its partners to disclose information to, and receive it from, each other in some circumstances where they would not otherwise be able to do so. In practice, as far as we can judge, occasions when Clause 4(11) might need to be invoked will not be common. However, it needs to be there, to ensure that the agency and its partners have a lawful basis for any necessary disclosures of information that would otherwise be subject to restrictions.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para11"></a>It is not the case, as was suggested in some of our earlier debates, that Clause 4(11) authorises the agency to disclose personal information to an unlimited number of bodies, or to everyone in those bodies. Clause 4(11) would authorise disclosure where it was necessary for one of the functions specified; but the disclosure would still need to be in the public interest, and it would need to be proportionate if European Convention rights were engaged.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para12"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the question of whether Clause 4(11) would override the requirements of the Data Protection Act. The Bill as currently drafted does provide such an override. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made the point that the Data Protection Act does not prevent the dissemination of personal data when that is necessary in the public interest. That is an important point, and that is why we have looked at the drafting of the Bill again.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para13"></a>My officials have worked closely on this with the Department for Constitutional Affairs, which is the custodian of wisdom on the Data Protection Act. They have also discussed thoroughly with the Health Protection Agency Special Health Authority and the National Radiological Protection Board&#151;the bodies that currently carry out the functions planned for the agency&#151;what those bodies think the practical implications of modifying Clause 4(11) might be. I am glad to say that in the light of this further work, we have come to the conclusion that it is not essential to disapply from the Health Protection Agency and its partners the requirements of the Data Protection Act. The government amendment therefore makes clear that the requirements of the Data Protection Act will apply.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para14"></a>Turning to the second government amendment in this group, on Report we replaced the words "one or more schemes" with "a scheme" at each point where they then appeared in Clause 8. This further minor change follows through the logic of that change, by making a similar change to the new material that we added to Clause 8 on Report.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para15"></a>Finally, the third government amendment is a purely technical amendment, which simply ensures that Schedule 4 reflects an amendment that we included in Schedule 3 on Report. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40429-11_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I intervene briefly to say how much I welcome Amendment No. 2, which is clearly the product of a great deal of deliberation by Ministers in a number of departments. I am grateful that the concerns that I raised at earlier stages of the Bill on the issues of confidentiality and data protection have been taken on board as seriously as they have been. The amendment resolves a great many questions, but I ask the Minister to say something about guidance on these matters.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para16"></a>The Data Protection Act 1998 is a carefully considered piece of legislation, but even its closest friends would concede that its effects and implications are not always self-explanatory. The fact that Clause 4(11) will be subject to the over-riding provisions of the Data Protection Act is welcome, but the interpretation of the subsection, at a practical level, may leave many people doubtful about what they may legally do and not do. It seems that guidance is required to clarify the principles involved here, not only as to the initial disclosure of personal information and the circumstances where disclosure needs to happen, but also as to what should happen to information once it has been disclosed.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para17"></a>If a local authority, in pursuit of its duty of co-operation, receives sensitive personal data of a medical nature, who in the authority, and indeed outside, should be entitled to read that information? How should it be stored? Suppose after a while there is no strict need to continue holding the data, because the matter has been dealt with, what should be done with the files? Should the local authority retain the data just in case, or should they be destroyed? All these questions arise as a matter of practice.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para18"></a>The Minister was helpful on Report in putting these provisions into the context of the Human Rights Act, but the duty of co-operation under Clause 5 extends far and wide. It is obvious that the more people who receive data relating to, let us say, HIV-positive men and women living in a particular area, the more scope there is for such data to permeate to unauthorised individuals unless we are particularly careful. The Health Service Control of Patient Information Regulations 2002 are clearly important in this context, but they are not referred to specifically here. It might be thought that they are overridden by the wording of Clause 4(11). I am sure that the Minister will tell me that that is not so, but it might be thought to be so.
<P>

<a name="40429-11_para19"></a>The Minister has gone to a great deal of trouble to listen to the concerns raised by noble Lords throughout proceedings on the Bill, and he has responded most constructively to those concerns by bringing forward government amendments. I am extremely grateful to him and to his officials for all that they have done. It seems to me that in several significant, albeit small ways, the Bill is now improved. Furthermore, our debates have clarified both the underlying principles and the practical implications of this legislation, which we all agree is to be welcomed. We wish the agency well in the important work that lies ahead of it.

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, very briefly, we wish to support and thank the Minister for putting forward this amendment. Issues now surround the Data Protection Act, and we have already had debates on Starred Questions about whether a review of the Act would be appropriate. Many of us believe that that would be a useful way forward.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para0"></a>As regards the regulations under Section 60 referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, the question of whether subsection (11) overrides the requirements of the Data Protection Act is important, since this has been the subject of considerable debate. This being Third Reading and the last opportunity to thank the Minister for his constructive engagement on this Bill, and for the amendments that have been made, I will do so. I join the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in wishing the agency well with the new powers that it will receive under this Act.

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, very briefly, I thank the Minister for having listened so carefully to all the points that have been made at previous stages of the Bill. I apologise that I was unable to be in the House the last time that the Bill was before us, but I formally thank the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, for the work that they did to ensure that the agency will work closely in collaboration with the service in Wales, and that the concerns have been allayed by establishing observer status on the board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the remarks made by a number of noble Lords. This has been a co-operative venture, in that we have tried to make this Bill as constructive and useful as possible for the new agency. I share their views. We wish the Health Protection Agency well.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para1"></a>On the issue of guidance in relation to the Data Protection Act, it will be open to the agency. I am sure that it will look carefully at what has been said in this House to issue guidance to staff about the way in which the Act should be interpreted and used, based on the plentiful guidance that has already been issued in relation to that Act, and is available to all employers.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para2"></a>Does Clause 4(11) override Section 60 regulations? Yes, it overrides restrictions on disclosure, but only in the circumstances that I outlined, which are specified there. I will write with more details to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on the relationship with the Section 60 provisions, and to my noble friend Lord Turnberg.

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Patel </B>   rose to move, That this House takes note of the report of the Science and Technology Committee on Science and the RDAs: SETting the regional agenda (5th Report, Session 2002&#150;03, HL Paper 140).
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am delighted to be able to present to the House the July 2003 report on Science and the RDAs by the Science and Technology Committee. The committee looked at how to improve, to mutual advantage, the interaction between the recently established regional development agencies&#151;the RDAs of the title&#151;and science, engineering and technology, normally contracted to "SET".
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para13"></a>While the committee took account of the longer experience of these matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, I should explain that our inquiry concentrated on the nine English agencies which were set up some five years ago. Strictly speaking, only eight of those are RDAs. However, the separately established London Development Agency is essentially the same. My and others' references to RDAs should therefore be understood to include the London body.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para14"></a>Alongside the report, we shall be considering the Government's December 2003 response to the committee's wide-ranging recommendations. Copies of the response are available in the Printed Paper Office, and will be published in a follow-up report after this debate. We shall also need from time to time to refer to the Government's December 2003 innovation report&#151;Competing in the Global Economy: the Innovation Challenge&#151;and the contemporaneous report of the Lambert review of business-university collaboration&#151;which helped inform the innovation report. Both of those reports acknowledge the influence of the committee's recommendations, and I am pleased about that.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para15"></a>I shall also be able to draw on useful material from the RDAs themselves about their actions in the light of the committee's and these other reports. The RDAs have found the report helpful and that is encouraging and pleasing. That material too is available in the Printed Paper Office and will be published in due course.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para16"></a>Before turning to the key points arising from the report and the Government's response, I should like to thank the Select Committee for the honour of chairing the inquiry, and the other members of the sub-committee for making that such an enjoyable experience&#151;most of the time. I am sure that they will join me in thanking the many people who helped us complete our task: those who provided in writing and orally much useful source material, all as published in the 349 pages of the evidence volume accompanying the report; all those involved in a valuable series of visits in England, Scotland and Wales which helped us to understand the position on the ground, as summarised in appendices to the report; our specialist adviser, Dr Marilyn Wedgwood, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan University, for helping us work through the inquiry's many interrelated strands&#151;her knowledge of RDAs is phenomenal, to say the least. And <P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to our Clerk, Roger Morgan, I give especial thanks as this was his last inquiry, and I, on behalf of the committee, wish him well in his retirement. We were also helped by the Clerk who followed, Christopher Johnson, and the scientific adviser, Jonathan Radcliffe. I thank them, too.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para17"></a>No modern economy can be successful without innovation. Much of that innovation is technological, involving the application and exploitation of SET. The English structures for encouraging innovation as a driver of economic growth were substantially changed in the late 1990s with the introduction of RDAs. The starting point of our inquiry was the effect this explicitly regional perspective is having on the national SET base.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para18"></a>I think it is fair to say that at least some sub-committee members started by doubting that the apparent fragmentation of influences on the national SET base could be beneficial. However, we were quickly won over by what we heard and, during our various visits, saw on the ground. RDAs' activities at the interface between economic development and SET can, when properly focused, be a potent force for good.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para19"></a>While the energy and enthusiasm of RDAs' board members and staff cannot be faulted, our emerging concern was that the framework within which they were required to operate meant that their activities were not always focused on the right things. To allow RDAs to focus their activities better, with consequent benefits to regional and national economies, we saw the main needs as greater coherence, longer-term perspectives and reduced bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para20"></a>To that end, the committee made 19 recommendations, addressed to the Government and others. These arise at various points in our report, but are, for convenience, collected together on pages 8 to 10. I will briefly outline the key points, and comment on them further in the light of the Government's response.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para21"></a>However, on a general point, it is a little disappointing that the Government's formal response deals only with the report's individual recommendations. Most Select Committee reports are more than the sum of their specific recommendations. They normally also represent a committee's considered reflection on a particular issue or area of policy. The response provides no introductory section giving the Government's overview of the role and future of the RDAs. It is therefore difficult to infer the Government's overview from the response, or to glean this from the various references in last December's innovation report.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para22"></a>I hope that the Minister, when replying to this debate, in order to set the context for his more detailed points, will be able to give a brief overview on the lines I have indicated. In particular, I would welcome his assurance that the Government plan to involve RDAs as vital partners in developing arrangements for the exploitation of SET.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para23"></a>Turning to the committee's detailed recommendations, we found that the principal handicap for the RDAs&#151;and others&#151;was the absence of coherent policies for the exploitation of SET. Accordingly, our key recommendation&#151;at sub-paragraph (a) on page 8&#151;was that the Government should involve relevant national and regional players in urgently devising and implementing a national policy <P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 945</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and strategy for SET exploitation that truly integrates national and regional perspectives. I am pleased that the Government's response fully recognises the importance of filling this major gap. It mentions various activities towards this end, and I wonder if the Minister is able to update the House on the progress made and the timetable for completion.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para24"></a>At the operational level, we recommended at sub-paragraph (b) the establishment of a forum to enable national and regional interests to address the impact of and synergy between national and regional SET investments and, as far as possible, harmonise them. The Government's response states their belief that the Steering Group for the Research Councils and RDAs will fulfil this task. My fear is that this body may not be at a level involving the right people to resolve the operational issues. What will the Government do to ensure that their expectations for the steering group are realised? Are there any incentives for the stakeholders more actively to strive for the highly desirable national/regional synergy?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para25"></a>Several regions made strong representations about the mismatch between the Government's emphasis on regional development and reluctance to increase their R&D funding outside the South East in areas that are far from scientific deserts. We illustrated this with 1999 figures, the latest year for which full data were available at the time. Our recommendation at sub-paragraph (c) on page 8 was that the Government should urgently publish the latest possible information about their R&D spend per region and keep this up to date as a performance measure of support for regional economies through nationally-provided SET.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para26"></a>The Government's comment that regions' success in attracting others' R&D funding might be more relevant&#151;and we accepted its value as a regional performance measure at sub-paragraph (f)&#151;I thought missed the point of our recommendation. However, I appreciate that there are more recent data for government R&D spend per region. Can the Minister again say whether later figures show any proportionate increase for regions outside the South East?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para27"></a>Our final recommendation relating to overall coherence&#151;in sub-paragraph (d) on page 8&#151;addressed the need for an analysis of the complex issues in the demand for and supply of SET, better to inform future policies on SET exploitation. The Government's response acknowledges that the thrust of the recommendation was on target, but I should be grateful if the Minister could say whether the activity outlined in the response is now yielding the necessary results.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para28"></a>I now turn to our recommendations on metrics and bureaucracy. Alongside the absence of coherent policies for the exploitation of SET, we found the other principal handicap for RDAs was the government-set framework within which they were required to operate. As noted in Box 4 on page 21 of our report, RDAs are subject to a bewildering array of performance measures. Although SET is both directly and indirectly relevant to a wide range of RDAs' activities, it is mentioned only peripherally in the definition of the eleventh Tier 2 outcome concerning innovation.
<P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para29"></a>Not only were the wrong things being measured, measurements are made over periods too short to allow necessary longer-term projects to show their worth. Moreover, all that was compounded by bureaucratic demands. RDAs operate under some 1,400 pages of guidance documents which, having been developed at different times and by different limbs of government, contain many ambiguities and contradictions. Accordingly, we made a series of recommendations, at sub-paragraphs (e) to (h) on page 9, about providing RDAs with a simplified and more relevant set of performance measures and reducing their bureaucratic load.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para30"></a>The Government's response notes these as covering similar ground to the National Audit Office's November 2003 report Success in the Regions. Of course, our report in fact predated the NAO's report, but I welcome the indication that the committee's comments will be taken into account in implementing the NAO's recommendations. Is the Minister able to say when he expects that work to be complete?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para31"></a>Specifically on SET, did the Government achieve their indicated target of developing a limited set of innovation indicators by the end of March 2004?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para32"></a>The committee made a number of subsidiary recommendations, addressed principally to RDAs, regional business and higher education interests, about boosting regional capacity and connections on SET-related matters. Time does not permit me to expand on those, although I am pleased to report that RDAs have welcomed these and are tackling them energetically.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para33"></a>There is, however, one particular issue that I should like to highlight before I finish&#151;that of public sector procurement. Small businesses are often the source of the most technologically-innovative products and services. Encouraging their growth is good for the economy and SET base at both regional and national levels. We were concerned to learn that public sector purchasing policies can actively work against such businesses. The committee heard from an Internet company that, solely on the grounds of turnover, was precluded from bidding for a project within its internationally-established competence. Another example was of a small company that could not sell its high-tech equipment needed by the local hospital other than through the German-based preferred contractor.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para34"></a>Accordingly we recommended, at sub-paragraph (p) on page 10, that consideration be given to the case for arrangements such as the USA's small company set aside scheme to help small firms participate in public sector procurements, either directly or as sub-contractors in larger projects. It seemed to us to be a win-win solution: small companies and their regions would benefit from the better opportunities; at the same time, the public sector would benefit from the innovation that is the characteristic of small SET-related businesses.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para35"></a>It is therefore disappointing that the Government rejected this recommendation, particularly as, from the limited steps described in their response to increase the success of smaller businesses in government procurements, they seem to accept that there is a real problem here.
<P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 947</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para36"></a>Two reasons are given for the rejection. The first is that such a move would run counter to the Government's objective of basing all public procurement decisions on value for money for the taxpayer. Neither of the examples I gave had anything to do with the price of the product. Even where that is an issue, however, is there not also a broader value for taxpayers' money in helping to develop a vibrant small company sector?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para37"></a>The Government's second objection was conflict with EC and WTO treaty obligations. However, they have presumably not stood in the way of the present limited initiatives. Can the Government really not explore whether any further elbow room might be available?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para38"></a>I have covered most of the recommendations and I hope that my colleagues on the committee will cover the others. I am aware of the time. I look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues on the committee and to the Minister's reply.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para39"></a>I conclude by observing that, as the relatively new RDAs have paid attention to the role of SET in their economic strategies, weaknesses and opportunities have become apparent in the structures intended to encourage and support SET-based economic development. While some of those weaknesses are matters of process, others are consequences of a deep-seated lack of coherence in the various policy levers. For the good of regional and national economies, all those weaknesses need urgently to be redressed. As indicated in the title of our report, SET needs to be an explicit and integral part of the regional agenda. Securing this now will help ensure our national prosperity in the increasingly challenging years to come. I beg to move.

The noble Lord was an inspirational and incisive chairman who kept us on the straight and narrow. We travelled to many places in the UK, but I have to admit some disappointment that the noble Lord was not able to get us to visit Dundee. I also have to thank the noble Lord because it was he who co-opted me onto the sub-committee for microprocessors during the next 20 years, which has led to me being on the Select Committee on Science and Technology itself, a role and a position for which I am truly grateful.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para41"></a>I thank Marilyn Wedgwood, our special adviser. As the noble Lord said, she has a phenomenal knowledge of RDAs, and she too was able to guide us through a difficult period of understanding how the various RDAs operate. I have to thank twice over our Clerk, Roger Morgan, for his superb work. I omitted to thank him when we had the debate on microprocessors.
<P>


<a name="column_948"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 948</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para42"></a>We have produced a jolly good report. I hope that those people who read it, particularly in the DTI but also elsewhere throughout the country, will take notice of what we have to say. We have made some powerful recommendations.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para43"></a>To be frank, I was left with a series of worries about the report itself. The first was whether we were looking at RDAs too early into their life. Many of them had been going for less than five years, and I wondered if that really was the period when we should be looking at them and seeing how they were doing. Sometimes I had the feeling that we were digging up the plants to see how they were growing. Perhaps we should look at the subject again in three or four years' time. How well are they doing? Well, I am not sure. The jury is out on this, but we certainly saw some encouraging aspects.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para44"></a>My other, perhaps more important, worry about the RDAs concerns how the RDAs themselves operate. I had this feeling that no sooner had they been incorporated than the normal corporatist trappings were being put into the way that they operate. The good and the great were associated with the RDAs: the directors of the public companies, the professors, the knights of the realm. But where were the entrepreneurs? Where were the real customers? We did not see very many of those, and I think that is a great pity. We went to a sumptuous dinner at the splendid offices of the Royal Society in Edinburgh. We had a superb lunch at AstraZeneca in Macclesfield. Speaking frankly, I would have preferred to have gone to the pub with the entrepreneurs in their t-shirts and jeans, and to have shot the breeze with them.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para45"></a>I have this overwhelming worry that the RDAs have become too posh, too grand and too out of touch, and I hope that they keep close to their prime customers, the entrepreneurs and the people who are in the regions. The job of the RDAs is to create the correct environment. It is not necessarily to back winners, and they must become accessible and not remote from the population.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para46"></a>The prime job, I suppose, of an RDA is to generate regional growth and regeneration, but at the moment that is actually happening before our eyes. In our major regional cities which, 10 or 15 years ago, were almost beyond hope, we are seeing some tremendous growth occurring. I think of Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow. Leeds is now a major financial centre in this country. There was an article in the Economist this week that indicated that, for the first time, more people are moving north than are moving south. House prices, as most noble Lords will know, are rising faster in the North than they are in the South. There are economic reasons that propel regional growth. It may even be said that things people might not think are important, such as the Commonwealth Games being in Manchester, or Liverpool being awarded the European Capital of Culture for 2008, actually are important, because they all demonstrate that the regional areas are nice places to live, and they will attract the key people and the key investments that we need in these areas. It is said that while 39 per cent of Newcastle University graduates used to stay within that region after they graduated, that figure is now <P>


<a name="column_949"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 949</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>close to half&#151;another positive move. So the RDAs are not pushing against a closed door. The moves are going in that direction, the regions are becoming much more attractive, and it makes the job the RDAs are doing all the more important.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para47"></a>It has to be said that one of the reasons why many of our deprived areas are doing well, the North in particular, is the strong economy in this country. I know it is the usual mantra that will be heard from these Benches, but the facts are true: the lowest unemployment, the lowest inflation and low interest rates. Indeed, a smile crossed my face just the other day to read that the inflation rate is dangerously close to 1 per cent, a point at which the Governor of the Bank of England has to write to the Chancellor explaining why inflation is low. I think that is all good news. We can scoff, if we like, at boom and bust&#151;and I know people do&#151;but stability and steady growth are absolutely key to regeneration, and they bring their own reward. To quote a phrase, "when the tide comes in, all boats rise", and I think that is what we are seeing in the north of the country.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para48"></a>One of the recommendations we make in the report concerns the funding gap. It is a perennial issue that has been discussed certainly as long as I have been involved in economics. The venture capital community in this country has revolutionised investment in the UK, but there are still problems, and so there are roles for the regional development authorities. There are not many angels around who make seed investments. That is a job for institutions, whether it is the University Challenge Fund, or any other body that is supported by the RDAs. But I have found from my own experience that venture capitalists are not really interested in investments of less than £5 million. It is too costly, it takes up too much time, and, who knows, it may be too risky as well. That is something we saw when we were in Silicon Valley on the microprocessor investigation. So it is important that the RDAs are able to fund this gap. How does my noble friend the Minister, who I know has an interest in this area beyond most people, see this issue and what changes are being made with respect to funding the investment gap below £5 million.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para49"></a>I want to draw attention to one recommendation. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, mentioned the small company set-aside scheme, which relies on the importance of government spending on pump priming with regard to small companies. Once more, in Silicon Valley, we saw the benefit. The US Government use their spending money to give a leg-up to small companies. It is hard for such companies to get government funds&#151;they do not know who to go to, they cannot fill out the reports, they do not have the infrastructure. We recommended in our report that the DTI should emulate US small company set-aside schemes. So I should like to ask the Minister a difficult question that I think he needs to answer.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para50"></a>This country is spending probably £10 billion on IT infrastructure investments&#151;in the NHS, Defra and the Ministry of Defence&#151;but I do not see any directive in that spending to support small companies. I should like to know why that is. I have heard the reasons, but I cannot believe them. The first is that when one tenders, <P>


<a name="column_950"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Europe insists on pan-European Union tendering, and somehow the small companies do not fit in on that. The second is that all governments have had a lamentable history on major projects in the IT sector that have gone wrong, and if small companies are brought in the risk will be increased. Somehow it is felt that we cannot fail again with the NHS, the MoD, and so on. Frankly, I find this all a little lame. We have got to be much bolder in what we do, and we must insist that large companies involve small companies in tendering.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para51"></a>Finally, we have heard about the DTI report on innovation; we have heard about the Lambert report on universities and business; there are various reports from the House of Commons. Is it not possible that these reports could be co-ordinated so that we could bring forward some recommendations that make sense across the board?

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   My Lords, I, too, pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for chairing the Select Committee, on which I was privileged to serve as a co-opted member. The noble Lord's patience, persistence and good humour are quite remarkable. I put it down to his having worked for more than 30 years with real patients in the health sector. For me, a humble accountant, not a scientist, serving on the committee has been a prolonged adult education course, learning more and more about the science base in this country and how government in the public sector can assure that we develop it, as the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, said, to be one of the most dynamic in the world, at the forefront of events.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para52"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, was being a bit too modest when he said that very soon after the Select Committee's report was published, a number of public sector reports were published. He seemed to imply that these came in parallel. I detect a good deal of influence exerted by the committee and by the report on a number of public sector reports, which I shall mention for the record. The National Audit Office's report, Success in the Regions, was published towards the end of 2003. The Treasury published Bridging the Finance Gap, and the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, referred, quite rightly, to the funding gap. There was also the DTI's innovation report and, of course, the Lambert review. All four reports drew in some measure&#151;some greater than others&#151;on the work of the committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para53"></a>I was impressed by the regional development agencies as we went around the country. The noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, in his typical fresh, invigorating style, said he thought that some of them were "too posh". The further north I went&#151;north of Yorkshire and Humberside, through the north-west, the north-east and Scotland&#151;the more impressed I became, particularly in the north of England, at how hard-working and how directly rooted those agencies were in the business community. I applaud what they have already achieved; I think their individual responses, which I am sure your Lordships will look forward to reading in due course, were very constructive.

<P>

<a name="40429-12_para54"></a>I hope that your Lordships will return, as a matter of discipline, to this subject again in two or three years' time. Parliaments have a great habit of writing reports, listening to the government's response and then all the papers get filed away in the Library. As a discipline, we, as parliamentarians, ought to return to the same subject and see what has and has not been achieved, otherwise the collective memory dissipates and our effect is diminished.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para55"></a>The three points I want to deal with have already been touched upon. I support what the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said about bureaucracy and metrics&#151;that is, the measurement of innovation performance and support. Secondly, I want to refer to the funding gap and the success that universities have in spinning out high technology, with or without the support of regional development agencies. Finally, I should like to say a word on the valuable recommendation made in the report about the relationships between universities and the regional development agencies.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para56"></a>On bureaucracy and metrics, it was interesting to read in the National Audit Office's report which was published after that of the Select Committee that the NAO said that the DTI must allow maximum delegation&#151;that is, delegation of responsibility to the regional development agencies. It said that the DTI,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must give the Agencies freedom to derive maximum benefit from their private sector leadership and regional knowledge".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-12_para57"></a>
Those, I believe, are very wise words.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para58"></a>My noble friend Lord Wade and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas&#151;whom it is very nice to see in his place&#151;both have a very deep knowledge of the work of the Northwest Development Agency, to which I pay tribute. In the agencies' response to the Government's report, they raised a very interesting point. They said that they believed that a wider approach to reducing bureaucracy should initially be dealt with at RDA chair and government Minister level. If the Minister could share his valuable experience and much appreciated work with the chairmen of the nine English RDAs, that would be much appreciated. Those discussions will surely complement what the noble Lord, Lord Patel, was talking about&#151;the introduction by March this year of performance indicators for the support of innovation.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para59"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, talked about the funding gap. Clearly there has been a problem in funding new start-up technology companies, particularly in the bracket which the noble Lord referred to&#151;between £250,000 and £500,000 and up to about £5 million, for reasons which he spelt out very clearly. That problem is both cyclical and structural. The Government are seeking to alleviate that problem. My understanding is that detailed bidding guidance was going to be given by the spring of this year on how companies can bid for what is described as a pathfinder round of new enterprise capital funds. I am not sure whether that guidance has been issued by Her Majesty's Treasury or the DTI. Such funds are set up to support the growth of small companies which might have been started up inside or outside university with debt finance coming from the Government to support equity raised locally or nationally. That is modelled on the United <P>


<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>States Small Business Investment Corporation. I am sure that many of your Lordships will have welcomed that initiative and the announcement when it was made in December last year, but we want to see some progress.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para60"></a>The only point I would add to what the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, said is that in addition to the funding gap, I think there is an entrepreneurial gap. It is very difficult for academics to make that transition from university to the tough world of making money to understand how an idea is translated into a profitable company and how an idea or invention is turned into a product that is needed by the world economy. The regional development agencies have a big role to play because they are rooted in the business community and the advice that they can give to universities in particular is much appreciated and necessary.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para61"></a>My final point is to do with recommendation (r) and the need for greater co-operation between universities and the regional development agencies in strategic working. Universities should co-operate more, in my humble judgment, on a regional basis, in interfacing with the relevant RDA. The RDA can identify the industrial demand&#151;what clusters of specialisation of industrial knowledge exist in the region and what, therefore, is needed in terms of support, not only from the universities within that region but also nationally. I greatly welcome the setting up of science and industry councils by the RDAs and their participation in them.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para62"></a>The Lambert review referred to the DTI needing to shift its pattern of regional support from projects which created jobs to those where there was an opportunity for collaboration between the regional development agencies and universities on important research and development products. It is the research and development as well as the creation of jobs which is very important. Anything the Minister can say on that would be appreciated.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para63"></a>I end by declaring a prospective interest. Along with Dr Kenny Tang and with Mr Ajay Vohora from Nottingham University, I am co-editing a book to be published this autumn on this very subject&#151;the development of spin-outs from universities and how the local business community can succour and support them. In advance, I thank the Minister very warmly for having agreed to write a foreword to the book.

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Methuen: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for introducing this debate on our report on science and the RDAs. He was an able chairman and we would not have achieved what we did without his help. It was an interesting inquiry. We much benefited also from the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, whom I am glad to see in his place. His experience as a sometime chairman of the North West RDA was absolutely invaluable to us. We would also have been lost without the expertise of our specialist adviser, Dr Marilyn Wedgwood, and the support of our clerk, Roger Morgan. Roger came into the House when I was sitting on EU Sub-Committee B. Between us, he and I contributed to no fewer than four reports to the House. We also represented the House at the Eureka conferences on <P>


<a name="column_953"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 953</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>three occasions. We had extensive meetings around the country, and were able to view the practical aspects of what had been achieved, not only in England, but also in Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para64"></a>Those visits brought home to me the disparate nature of the problems with which an RDA is faced. Let us take Advantage West Midlands as an example. Not only does it have the benefit of the leading universities of Birmingham, Aston, Warwick and Keele on its doorstep, but also the run-down industrial areas of the Black Country, with substantial ethnic minorities and unemployment. It has the diminishing ceramics industry in the Potteries, and the rural areas of Herefordshire and Shropshire. Similar circumstances apply for many RDAs, though perhaps less so in the south-east of England. That disparity requires different solutions to promote growth in the various parts of the region. One size does not fit all. A typical solution for rural areas is the enabling of broadband communications for the benefit of both private and commercial users. The RDAs can promulgate that.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para65"></a>The RDAs are a comparatively new creation and there was a substantial learning curve before they began to be effective in promoting science, engineering and technology in their regions. That was in part due to the lack of staff suitably qualified to promote SET, although that situation is now being rectified.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para66"></a>When we were in Newcastle, we had a meeting with the North East Science and Industry Council, which comprised local people who had the relevant scientific and industrial experience and who were committed to their region's future. Such councils have a central role to play in helping to steer the region's regeneration. That point was reinforced by the Government's response to conclusion (k) in our report.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para67"></a>However, the regions do not operate in isolation. They must form part of a national agenda. Cross-regional co-operation and co-ordination are vital and they are occurring. Correspondingly, the regions' relationship with the research councils needs to be optimised. The formation of the steering group for the research councils and the RDAs, as mentioned in the Government's innovation report, will go some way to meeting that necessity. However, I suggest that it needs to meet more than the once a year, which I understand to be the current proposal.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para68"></a>I shall emphasise some other local issues. The RDA has a vital role to play in ensuring that the regional education system, at all levels, produces people with the requisite skills for the regions' industries, particularly for the high-tech industries that are now emerging. We must also remember that we need the craft skills such as those produced by the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme; that is, we need a well balanced and well trained workforce. Those people will need employment in the region. It worries me that the start-up and university spin-off companies may achieve only a fraction of what is actually required, particularly in the regions of our old heavy industry&#151;the north-west and the north-east. Thousands of jobs have been lost there in mining and the heavy industries, yet the new start-ups and spin-offs are providing only tens of jobs each. The arithmetic does not add up.
<P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para69"></a>The regions can however maximise opportunities by providing premises for start-up companies and expert professional help during their initial years of operation. It has been remarked that many people in university start-up companies are essentially boffins and do not have the business expertise to do the job. Bureaucracy at the start-up stage needs to be minimised. We received several comments that the RDAs were too bureaucratic and too slow to respond at those early stages.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para70"></a>The RDAs should have a greater responsibility for identifying transport priorities and producing a regional transport strategy that covers both passenger and freight carriage by road and rail. Discussions with various RDAs suggested that central government took insufficient notice of an RDA's transport requirements; particularly for rail. A recent Commons Written Answer to Mr Philip Hammond MP stated that the powers of RDAs or regional assemblies&#151;when they come into existence&#151;would be limited to making proposals for schemes of regional importance to the Highways Authority or the NRA. It was emphasised to us that transport is vital to regional regeneration and the promulgation of science and technology. More note should be taken of an RDA's or a regional assembly's concerns to enable it to meet its objectives.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para71"></a>I am glad to see that the Government's response to our report indicates that they have taken some notice of our conclusions. I look forward to the Minister's comments.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-12_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for his chairmanship of an enjoyable and interesting inquiry. I declare an interest as I hold a university position in Cardiff. I had the honour of serving on the inquiry into science and RDAs and learnt much in the process.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para72"></a>The Welsh Development Agency welcomed a visit from the inquiry team. The agency explained how it promotes enterprise in conjunction with universities in Wales. I hope to illustrate how the WDA has worked towards the "five Cs" recommended by our report: coherence; connectivity; co-ordination; communication; and co-operation. Our report recommended that they should apply also to the English RDAs.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para73"></a>The Welsh Development Agency was established in 1976. Unlike the new English RDAs, it therefore has long experience of trying to serve the people of Wales by stimulating businesses to grow in vibrant communities and to become more competitive. It has been involved in community regeneration across Wales during the decline of traditional industries, being aware that only successful businesses could create the prosperity needed. Most Welsh companies were fairly small and unable to commit large sums to corporate research and development. Although the WDA played a role in supporting science, technology and innovation since the early 1990s, that activity increased considerably following the development of the Wales Regional Technology Plan in 1996. It is now a major strategic activity.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para74"></a>Since devolution, a close working relationship has been established at ministerial and official level between the WDA and the Assembly, especially <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with its Economic Development Committee. The Assembly's national economic development strategy, A Winning Wales, outlined the WDA's framework, identifying developments that are key to the future prosperity of Wales, such as the Innovation Action Plan. The WDA's board is private-sector led and it meets formally with the economic development Minister at least twice a year. It has adopted a "Team Wales" approach to bring together partners from academic institutions, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, local authorities, private sector providers and the Welsh Assembly government.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para75"></a>In Wales, the human dimension of personal networks, short lines of decision-making and responsiveness are particularly helpful drivers to a knowledge-based economy in an increasingly competitive world. Partnerships between public bodies and the private and voluntary sectors are assisted by Wales being, as Roger Jones, Chairman of the WDA described, "a two-telephone call economy". If you phone someone about a problem and they cannot give an answer, they will tell you whom to phone to get the answer. Most things in Wales are therefore two phone calls away.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para76"></a>Against that background, strategic links between the WDA and the university sector have developed for the benefit of all. For example, Cardiff University, which is a Russell Group member, has doubled its research income in the past four years.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para77"></a>The WDA supports applied and collaborative research and outreach to businesses through its Centres of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration programme, or CETIC. Six of these centres are hosted by Cardiff University, and the funding provided by the WDA enables the university to appoint commercial managers to work at the interface between industry and the academic research teams.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para78"></a>The WDA has been key to the development of strategic all-Wales initiatives based on a critical mass of high-quality research, such as the Wales Gene Park, which is one of the UK's genetic knowledge parks. The Wales Gene Park programme is led by Cardiff University, with links to other universities in Wales, and the university continues to work with the WDA towards developing the next phase of the Wales Gene Park, which will include a physical infrastructure. The Cardiff Institute of Tissue Repair is another example of the WDA being a catalyst for collaborative developments.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para79"></a>Cardiff University hosts one of the nodes of the UK Grid: the Welsh e-Science Centre. Through financial support from the WDA's Wales Information Society initiative, the Welsh e-Science Centre has been able to appoint specialist staff to bring the benefits of the grid to industry in Wales.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para80"></a>The WDA organises showcase events for Welsh R&D technologies, such as the BioWales and Technology Wales events. I went to BioWales 2004 last month. It is ground-level networking and enhances innovation, bringing together people with ideas and those who are able to put those ideas into practice.

<FONT SIZE=3>Wales. The journal always features articles from the university sector and is distributed widely in Wales and beyond, and through the WDA's offices overseas.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para82"></a>The WDA "field-force", the technology and innovation team, comprises some 65 staff who work closely with businesses. It includes 16 innovation and technology counsellors based across Wales, in Cardiff, Treforest, Swansea, Aberystwyth, Newtown and St Asaph, and also commercial managers in 20 Welsh institutions. The staff individually play an important role in alerting businesses to the expertise and specialised facilities available in our academic institutions, and in bringing opportunities for collaboration to the universities.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para83"></a>The WDA has financially supported academics attending international conferences and trade fairs, to facilitate international research collaborations and technology marketing, and has placed students with industry and businesses to form strategic partnerships. It has collaborated with neighbouring English RDAs where there are areas of common interest, such as with the north-west in aerospace development.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para84"></a>The WDA has also worked closely with universities in developing and funding the Wales Spinout Programme, to support the establishment of new enterprises from Welsh universities and colleges. Through this programme alone, which is now managed by the WDA subsidiary Finance Wales, Cardiff University has created 11 spinout companies since the scheme was launched in 2000. The Wales Spinout Programme works especially well in tandem with the Treasury and Wellcome Trust-funded University Challenge Seed Fund at Cardiff University.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para85"></a>The Technium concept is the brainchild of the WDA and Swansea University. The WDA-managed site provides administrative support and business advice to start-ups and spin-off enterprises as short-term tenants who can then move on as their business grows. Technium is now being rolled out across Wales as cluster-related developments. The optoelectronics sector development, OpTIC Technium, has developed in north Wales, where 40 per cent of the UK optoelectronics capacity is based. The Centre for Advanced Software Technologies was also developed in north Wales, with Objective 1 funding, and the Technium concept is now at the centre of Welsh economic development strategy.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para86"></a>The problems of metrics alluded to in the report have been addressed in Wales, as they need to be addressed everywhere. This is about measuring performance, and was highlighted by our inquiry because GDP and job creation are crude markers of success. Metrics are the subject of collaborative research between the WDA and Cardiff Business School.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para87"></a>Forgive me for continuing to talk about Wales, but this is just a taste of what the WDA has done over the years, to try to find locally relevant solutions to national and international development problems. I am confident that a warm welcome to the inquiry came from the confidence of experience over time and the history of having made a very positive difference to <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Wales. To use the analogy of the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, I personally believe that the WDA has taken root, and when we went to visit it we were not digging it up to see what was happening to its roots. I hope that the new RDAs can draw on the Welsh experience.

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Macclesfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for providing the opportunity for this debate. When I first met him, the proposed timescale was six months and that frightened the life out of me, because I knew how long it would take me to assess all the ideas about RDAs. However, we did it, although we could have overrun and still hit the target. I would certainly like to thank the special adviser as well because, like the noble Lord, Lord Patel, she taught me in four weeks what would have taken me four years to learn.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para88"></a>I should immediately declare I was not only a co-opted member of this committee but, from 1999 to 2003, I was chairman of the North-West Development Agency. This debate follows a list of complementary reports on RDA operations and involves, for example, reducing the growth rates between regions; the future of higher education, in as much as it involves RDAs; and the provision of support to industries and business&#151;all set up by the House of Commons. Our report predated those later reports, and it is interesting to note that, in general, they confirm our views and conclusions.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para89"></a>There are 350 pages of evidence, but I would like to concentrate on just one indisputable fact when it comes to research and development. It is on page 192 of the evidence, in case anybody wants to check it out. The north-west has the third largest expenditure by private business on research and development, beaten only by the south-east and eastern regions. In stark contrast, it has the third lowest public expenditure on research and development of any region except the north-east and Yorkshire and Humberside, which are the comparable regions in the north. Why is that true, and continue to be true? Does the private sector waste money in the northern regions, I ask myself? Or have we not invested sufficient resources in our northern universities?
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para90"></a>If that was true, how would we explain that the splitting of the atom, or the facility to random access computer memory, were invented in our Manchester University, to name just two examples? But these two examples changed the world as we know it. The importance of splitting the atom is self-evident, but RAM&#151;random access memory&#151;gave us what we today call computers, and was invented as recently as the 1950s. Without computers, much of the world would not be able to operate as it does now. It appears to me, and to many others, to be an example of academics' and civil servants' preference for universities in the south-east or eastern regions, with many of those civil servants and academics being trained by those universities, and now living in the south-east. Only government can change the distribution of public sector investment, and they should not be put off by the self-serving claims that it is all based on peer groups views on excellence. Only recently, a <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>couple of university professors in Manchester came to me, trying to raise money for what will be a global breakthrough in medicine. They were told that if they moved south, into the "golden triangle", funding would be no problem. I am glad to say they are not going to move, and their launch will be this autumn; it will be, yet again, of global significance.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para91"></a>We in the North-West Development Agency pioneered the setting up of Science Council, led by Tom McKillop of AstraZeneca, and including leading scientists and industrialists from diverse groups such as the National Health Service, BAe, Pilkingtons, Unilever, AstraZeneca, BNFL and many others. At no cost to the public purse, they provide those services free, and they are very busy men and women. Such science councils are being replicated elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para92"></a>We were told that science, engineering and technology in business clusters are the way forward for improving the region's GNP, and, moreover, that the DTI has all the necessary expertise in those areas. Accepting that the private sector apparently knew nothing about those areas of expertise, we asked for some of these people from DTI to be seconded to the regions. As recorded in our evidence, the DTI needed both notice of that question and time to reply. As far as I know, however, no one with such alleged experience was ever seconded to any of the nine regions of England between 1999 and 2003. I understand that that is still the position.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para93"></a>Only the Government can change the Civil Service's reluctance to change attitudes on regional issues, particularly within the DTI. MORI published a report on a national study of stakeholders' views on RDAs, commissioned by the DTI after RDAs had been operating for four years. The study addressed various issues. I have all the statistics but I shall not bore the House by providing them; but some are very relevant. To the question, "How would you rate the performance of your individual RDA compared with the government office in your region?", 51 per cent thought the RDAs were better and only 9 per cent thought them worse. To the question, "How do you compare that with the local authorities in your region?", 42 per cent thought the RDAs better and only 16 per cent thought them worse. To the question, "How do they compare with all other organisations providing funding and investment?", 52 per cent thought them better and 11 per cent thought them worse. To the question on European funding&#151;which is there for all RDAs to grab; this was the clincher in terms of funding&#151;60 per cent thought the RDAs better, but 72 per cent thought that the North-West Development Agency was better.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para94"></a>Forgive me for bringing to your Lordships' attention the fact that MORI described the north-west of England as the most successful of the nine English regions in those four formative years. The Select Committee was unsure about the new RDAs, and just five years ago the Conservative Party was totally opposed to their formation. However, the results speak for themselves.

<a name="40429-12_para95"></a>My conversion on the road to Damascus happened for two reasons. First, I got to know the industrialists and scientists who live in the great north-west, where 7 million people live. Although I had already been aware of it, I was again impressed by their intellectual input and commitment to the north-west. If we ever have a regional assembly, it will incorporate the RDAs and the private sector boards that make up the RDAs. It will have sole responsibility for economic development in our region. Although I know that some of my friends in the House will disagree with me on this issue, it is a fundamental point for me. I also have a lot of experience of the power and contacts of such boards. They have always given us excellent advice.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para96"></a>The previous speaker dealt with the Welsh experience. As a banker for 40 years I learned that, on development agencies, the Scots were way ahead of everyone else. However, when they were given a Parliament they did away with their development agency after which politicians dealt with those matters. The Welsh took a different line by embracing the private sector and all the knowledge of that sector. As your Lordships can probably tell from my accent, I am very pleased to see that the Welsh RDA is doing wonderful work.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para97"></a>Many people of Conservative views have been converted on RDAs. However, Damascus is a long way off for the DTI in Whitehall. We know where the policy is pinching. RDAs have never taken anything from local authorities, but their budgets and powers are continuing to come from Whitehall thanks to the effective support of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<a name="40429-12_para100"></a>In the 1970s and 1980s I was in the food export business. As a major supplier of British foods to the United States I was a member of the United States Cheese and Deli Association which brought together all those involved in that fascinating industry. On one occasion I went to the annual meeting which took place in Loews Hotel, in Dallas. We were given a major address by the then chairman of Federated Foods, an enormous conglomerate in the United States. At the appropriate time we all gathered in a vast auditorium&#151;there were many thousands; it is an enormous industry in America&#151;and waited for the speaker. While we waited, soft music played. A very seductive voice said, "Move forward. Move forward". So we were all ready for something very exciting. Finally, the curtains parted and on to the stage drove an enormous open-topped white Cadillac. Fastened to its front were the horns of an enormous beast. Out of it stepped a little fat man in a white suit. It was he. He walked to the front of the stage and said, "Always question the status quo". I have remembered that very clearly, as I was intended to do, ever since.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para101"></a>To question the status quo means innovation. It is the key to many successful businesses. It is the key to financial growth. It is the key to the growing economy and the extra wealth of our nation. It is brought about by science, engineering, technology and their application in business.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para102"></a>Such wealth creation is the reason why RDAs were set up in the first place. They were set up to ensure that each region of the United Kingdom could achieve the highest regional growth levels in the whole of Europe. To achieve that, there would have to be a higher growth rate in the north-west and other regions than there was in some of our wealthier regions. That could happen only by driving businesses to their limits and creating as much enthusiasm and ability in businesses as possible. That entails an understanding and knowledge at the local level. It is in small entrepreneurial businesses that the great innovation occurs that leads to benefits for products and consumers.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para103"></a>The message that came to me as we went through the evidence and discussed the various issues with the RDAs themselves and with all the various businesses and organisations that gave evidence to us was that the Government agreed and wanted to see growth in the regions but did not quite understand how to do it.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para104"></a>I was interested to receive yesterday a paper that has been brought out by the DTI in conjunction with the Treasury and Department for Education and Skills called Science and innovation: working towards a ten-year investment framework. They put down the problems and ask some questions, one of which is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"How can the Government and the Regional Development Agencies and their equivalents in the Devolved Administrations help integrate funding of science research on a predominantly national basis with development and delivery of regional economic strategies? In particular how can Government and RDAs strengthen partnership working to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer and research collaboration?"

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para106"></a>The first thing they could do would be to read our report, which would go a long way to explaining the answers. The key is talking at the right level, and giving authority at the right level.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para107"></a>As I listened again to the evidence, it occurred to me that there was too wide a misunderstanding between the power and the influence that the RDAs could bring about, and those in central government who wanted to achieve something but were not close enough to the operators to make it happen. If we want to achieve what both the Government and the RDAs want to achieve, they must give the RDAs more power to get on with things.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para108"></a>They should understand that innovation is not a one-off development that can be created, but is a continuous process; and that, while something might be innovative one year, there could be something entirely different that needs to be innovative the following year. That means that they have to be close enough to the various industries involved in these changes to see how the policy can be changed and new ideas introduced in order to encourage development and to be influential and definite at the local level.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para109"></a>Far too much regulation was placed on the RDAs and there were far too many frameworks for fitting in with government policy. These were not flexible enough and could not be adjusted at the local level in response to these changing needs.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para110"></a>I hope the Government will ensure that our report is not just read and dismissed, but read, considered and acted upon. I hope they will understand that the power of the RDAs to change so much of what they want to see happen&#151;and what needs to happen for our economy to grow&#151;lies in that advice. Let them get on with it; encourage new ideas; give them the resources; and ensure that by monitoring effectively over a period of time we can see more innovative and exciting business developments that are going to be the key to our success.

<A NAME="40429-12_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Oxburgh: </B>   My Lords, I add my thanks to my noble friend Lord Patel for his wisdom and skill in guiding this inquiry through to a successful conclusion. I, too, wish to add my thanks to our special adviser, Dr Marilyn Wedgwood and to our clerk, Dr Roger Morgan.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para111"></a>Duly respecting devolved authority, the inquiry was restricted to the English regions. However, we made very valuable visits to Scotland and Wales to learn from their experience. To ensure total impartiality, we selected our chairman from Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para112"></a>I must confess that before this inquiry got under way and we started visiting the RDAs, I was not entirely clear how they might play an effective role in the support and promotion of science and technology. But having seen first hand some examples of their work and visited them, I am converted and am an enthusiastic supporter.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40429-12_para113"></a>Arguably the most important single institution that any region that believes in exploiting its science and technology base can have is a science council. An effective science council can provide a forum in which representatives of all those in the region with an interest in science and technology&#151;whether from industry, commerce, SMEs or universities&#151;are able to meet each other and devise a science strategy for the region.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para114"></a>At the very least this may provide an opportunity for all to know what research and development is going on in the region, what particular needs exist, and what specialist facilities are available. More optimistically, it may offer the opportunity for the pooling of resources and possibly for preparing collaborative applications for funding to external organisations such as central government or the EU. It can make the region aware of opportunities to strengthen the regional science base to the advantage of local industry.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para115"></a>An excellent example of this was the decision of the North West RDA to provide some tens of millions of pounds to facilitate the merger between the University of Manchester and UMIST. In doing so it acquired for the region what must become one of the most formidable universities in the country, extremely strong in a number of important areas of science and engineering.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para116"></a>The same authority saw advantage in putting money into the famous Jodrell Bank radio telescope, recognising that this historic instrument was not only able to attract able scientists to the area but was also an important tourist attraction.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para117"></a>Although there is scope for many different ways of operating science councils and achieving the desired objectives, it appeared to us that a particularly effective model was one in which the council stood alongside the official RDA structure and was business led, but received some infrastructural support such as a secretariat from the RDA. We saw advantage in the science council being able to offer independent advice to the RDA but without the danger of being stifled by possible RDA bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para118"></a>It was a disappointment to us to see that the research councils found it difficult to interact with the RDAs. Occasional meetings do take place, but we got the feeling that their function was rather for the councils to announce from above to the RDAs what they had decided to do, rather than to enter into a constructive discussion.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para119"></a>From time to time the research councils have to make decisions about the location of particular research facilities or research centres. Sometimes there are very compelling scientific reasons why these should be located in a particular place, but on other occasions there may be several equally attractive sites. Given that such facilities invariably feel that they need more money than is provided for them, partnerships with a particular RDA that had a special interest and was prepared to provide a site or a building could offer <P>


<a name="column_963"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 963</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advantage to both the council and the region. I personally feel that this is an opportunity that the research councils are missing.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para120"></a>Although we came across great enthusiasm and a great deal of imagination, one could not escape the impression that some of the RDAs were in the losing game of picking winners when it came to selecting areas of technology that the region wished to promote. The trouble was that time and time again we saw the same winners picked: biotechnology, microelectronics, IT systems and so on, rather than looking for local niche opportunities. Experience shows that identifying and backing bright and energetic individuals is the way to optimise chances of success. To be fair, we did see examples of this where the regions were providing advice and inexpensive start-up incubator units in which new businesses spend their vulnerable years. In passing we discovered that one of the performance indicators used by the DTI in assessing the performance of RDAs was the number of new businesses started. Going forward, it would be much more informative to count the number that were still in business after five years. A 20 per cent success rate would be rather good.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para121"></a>I have just returned from Singapore, which I visit several times a year as a member of A*star, the Singapore governmental advisory committee on science technology and research. It occurred to me during my return flight that, given the population of Singapore at 3 million indigenous Singaporeans and 1 million residents from abroad, its three universities and various polytechnics and so on, it was about the size of a small English RDA, and I was a member of the Science Council.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para122"></a>The east Midlands region of England has around 4.3 million people. At a guess it has a score of universities and colleges, although it is hard to keep track in these days of multiple mergers. In both Singapore and the East Midlands the spend on R&D is about 2 per cent of the local GDP. Why should Singapore appear to be so successful and prosperous? I do not mean to suggest that the east Midlands is not, but I think that most people would agree that there is a bit of a difference. Why in Singapore is there a superb system of roads, an excellent underground system and a major international airport that is both architecturally and functionally outstanding? Why in Singapore do we see the startling developments of Futuropolis and of Biopolis? The latter is a complex of excellent buildings with state-of-the-art laboratories that are attracting research workers from all over the world. Indeed, I know that the Minister has visited at least some of those facilities in the recent past.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para123"></a>There is no time today to address the question of the success or otherwise of Singapore, but the point I wish to make is that great achievements are possible in a socio-economic-geographical area the size of our English regions. However, I make two observations. It is clear that while the RDAs are enthusiastic about stimulating economic growth in their regions, they feel that they are hampered by external bureaucratic <P>


<a name="column_964"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 964</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>control, whether it be in planning their road systems or other aspects of infrastructure, or, indeed, in being obliged by Whitehall to meet a series of key performance indicators that may have limited relevance to the problems of that particular region. They do not have significant control over essential resources.
<P>

<a name="40429-12_para124"></a>The RDAs would perhaps argue that although the research spend in their regions may in some cases be at the same level as that in Singapore, the difference is that they do not control it. In both cases more than half that spend comes from private industry and therefore it is not controlled by the region. However, the big difference is that government research spend is in the case of our RDAs virtually all controlled from outside the region and to a great extent without the needs of the region in mind. That makes an enormous difference. We know that there are very good reasons for some of the issues, but perhaps everything points in the same direction. If the RDAs are expected to stimulate economic growth in their areas, they must have the tools with which to do so. Those that they have at present are insufficient.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   My Lords, as a former Member of Parliament for the east Midlands, and perhaps speaking for Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Northamptonshire, I am not sure that Rolls-Royce, a Derbyshire company, would feel entirely comfortable about the noble Lord's analysis. Indeed, the same might be true in Northamptonshire, where we do not have a company of a similar size to Rolls-Royce.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para0"></a>As vice-chairman of the All-Party Group on Singapore, I am not sure that the noble Lord's analysis stands up in the manner that he suggests. Surely the difference is that Singapore is a unitary state. It is very single-minded under the leadership of a family business, with Lee Kuan Yew, BG Lee and the present incumbent. That leadership is very single-minded on what Singapore is about. East Midlands as a whole does not wish the regional development agency to be particularly successful; the east Midlands is very successful on its own.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Oxburgh: </B>   My Lords, I can reassure the noble Lord. I thought that I had made it clear that there was absolutely no reflection on the east Midlands area. Indeed, I endorse his comments about the businesses that he described. However, if he visited Singapore today&#151;I do not know how recent his experience is&#151;he would find it difficult to parallel the focused scientific energy that one finds there. I could not find it anywhere in this country. There is total commitment of the government and the people to get together and achieve something, and I simply say that our regions do not having anything like that. In a way, that was the point that he was making, but that does not mean that we cannot learn from Singapore.

<A NAME="40429-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the whole Science and Technology Committee for bringing to the <P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>House this very timely and good report. When it did so, I was not a member of the committee and I did not benefit from the visits that were made but, in the course of my academic life, I have spent a certain amount of time looking at some of the issues covered by the report. From that standpoint, I would like to make a few comments on the debate and, in winding up on it from these Benches, talk a little about the Liberal Democrats' stance on some of the issues.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para1"></a>The Minister and I were both present yesterday afternoon at a session held by the Institute of Biology that looked at the development of science policy. One issue raised there was that of university/industry links, and there was a very good presentation by Professor Gareth Roberts that looked at how we could measure the issue in the context of the research assessment exercise. In that presentation, he produced the old chestnut from which we all start; namely, that Britain is good at science&#151;by any measurement, we actually come close to the top of the league tables in the production of science&#151;but bad at exploitation. Somewhere or other along the line, we produce the ideas but do not manage to carry them through into new products and processes.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para2"></a>I started to think about what I was going to say in this debate, and I was amused to go back to the Waldegrave report. In 1992, John Major put William Waldegrave&#151;now the noble Lord, Lord Waldegrave&#151;into the Cabinet as the Minister for Science, and it was the first time that we had a Minister for Science since 1963. He took that core question&#151;can we explain why Britain is good at science but bad at exploiting it?&#151;to wide consultation before he brought out his White Paper on science and technology in 1993. Out of the White Paper came the whole exercise of foresight.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para3"></a>If we look at what happened to research and development in the UK between 1992 and 2003, we see that the proportion spent by businesses on it fell from 1.39 per cent of GDP to 1.24 per cent. If we look at the course of that instead of only those two points, we see that the low point was 1997, when the figure was 1.16 per cent. The hope had been that, by involving industry in the foresight exercise&#151;getting industrialists to sit down with scientists and government experts and have a look at different emerging areas&#151;it would be inspired to look to the future, which would help to promote R&D. In spite of that hope, it did not work. Other factors, perhaps macro-economic, had overridden this. Thanks partly to the leadership provided by the Government, we have seen an improvement since 1997. I pay tribute to the work of the Minister in being the champion for science and technology. We have seen a turnaround in that area.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, is correct in saying that there are new drivers in the system. In the 1990s, work was done on what was wrong with science and technology in this country and on what other countries were doing. There is a recognition that the agenda is moving on from wanting merely national leadership. Many countries are grabbing that leadership from below and moving it on.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para5"></a>In looking through the evidence, I saw a nice piece from our Embassy in the United States on a number of initiatives there and I want to quote the example of <P>


<a name="column_966"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 966</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Georgia. The initiative in Georgia was taken because it was missing out on development into a high-tech economy. It was stated that in the 1990s,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The State of Georgia . . .  invested $242 million in the alliance . . .  through research and development programmes at the six member universities, matched by $65 million in private funds. This investment has helped to attract over $600 million in additional sponsored research. At the heart of the programme has been the luring of 32 'eminent scholars' to chairs at Georgia universities. These scholars serve as a magnet for economic activity, as technology based companies seek to form alliances with the leading scientific talent, often resulting in the location of corporate R&D labs and operations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para6"></a>
That is precisely what we are hoping to achieve in Britain. Not only has Georgia been undertaking this work&#151;it was being undertaken in terms of Silicon Valley, the research triangle in North Carolina, Route 122 at Harvard and, in this country, the Cambridge phenomenon.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para7"></a>The great hope is that we will capture a new dynamism which can drive things forward and the concept of that new dynamism is welcomed by these Benches. We Liberal Democrats believe in constitutional devolution, but we also believe that full devolution cannot be achieved unless there is also economic devolution. The two run side by side and it is important that regional and local authorities have far greater autonomy to make their own decisions.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para8"></a>I am delighted by the degree to which the RDAs are grasping that nettle and I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, for the work that the North-West Development Agency has done, for example. However, on autonomy, the development agencies are poor relations to the state of Georgia, to California and to the German Lainder, for example, which are able to do their own thing.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para9"></a>Let us return to the age of entrepreneurship when cities such as Manchester and Birmingham were promoting their new tram and electricity systems and so forth. What did they do? They went out and borrowed that money to invest in assets which bore great fruit for many generations. Can the RDAs invest in such assets? The answer is: no; they have no such discretion.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para10"></a>I was very struck by the statement that came from the North-West Development Agency. One general conclusion that emerged from the discussion was:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whitehall tended to micro-manage the RDAs with over-concentration on short-term targets of questionable relevance. RDAs needed more freedom to pursue longer-term goals and might usefully assist Whitehall in devising more relevant measures for evaluating success".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para11"></a>
I know that that point has been brought out to a large extent by the report as a whole, but one should consider the amount of time that officials working for the RDAs have to spend filling in performance indicator forms. I believe that that point came through strongly from the evidence. Is it not a waste of time? Why cannot we give people more time to get on with doing the job? That type of task pervades all public services, does it not? I feel very strongly that the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, of greater autonomy for organisations to get on with doing their own thing is of vital importance.
<P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, talked about Singapore. I frequently make the analogy with Ireland. Ireland's great advantage was that it did not have the Treasury. I know that Ireland had many advantages with an enormous amount of structural funds going into the country.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para13"></a>I was also struck by a point that arose from the evidence from Northern Ireland. Perhaps I may quote a paragraph from the report because it is quite telling. It indicates the advantage of setting a long-term target and pursuing that target over a given period of time with leverage. Again, Northern Ireland has the advantage of having structural funds available. I quote from the evidence given by the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at the University of Newcastle. It said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We would draw the Committee's attention to the case of Northern Ireland, where the IRTU were able to mix a range of EU, national and local policies to revitalise their research base. A central focus of this activity was in improving the research performance of the University sector; ERDF [the European Regional Development Fund] for example providing support for recurrent costs, infrastructure costs and new research establishments which very quickly moved to win other funding, from EPSRC, Framework Programme and through the RAE, with the effect of raising their game.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para14"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The main benefit came from focusing on strengthening the research base".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para15"></a>
All those very important, long-term activities&#151;mutually reinforcing activities&#151;if pursued over a longer period of time really reap benefits.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para16"></a>The other point that I want to make relates to people. The noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, said that the RDAs are full of the great and the good. They have people such as Sir Tom McKillop of AstraZeneca. He is a fantastic person and I am delighted that he is leading the science council. However, they are dominated to some extent by the big investors&#151;the multinational companies&#151;and if we look at the miserable record of business R&D in Britain, the big problem does not lie with the big companies. We know that organisations such as the pharmaceutical companies, Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace are putting a great deal of money into research. The problem arises from the fact that our small and medium-sized businesses are not putting money into R&D. When they are pressed, they do not have the knowledge to go up-market. Instead, they go down-market, the competitive pressures are even greater and they go out of business. We know that small and medium-sized companies that have an R&D presence and can move up-market often succeed, whereas others fall by the wayside.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para17"></a>Therefore, one big question is: how can we get such small and medium-sized businesses to pick up and use the science base? They will not naturally go along to their local university and say, "Hi, I've got a problem", but it is vitally necessary that we pull them into the networks. The networks need to be wider than just our universities. We need to embrace our further education colleges, which have a lot of technical expertise. If we were in Germany they would be pulled in through the Chamber of Commerce. The small and medium-sized businesses would have access to this <P>


<a name="column_968"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 968</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expertise because they would meet side by side at the Chamber of Commerce. It does not happen in quite the same way here.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para18"></a>We have a large number of measures to promote R&D. Starting from the university sector, there is Higher Education Reach-out to Business and the Community Fund (HEROBAC), which used to be called HEROIC, and there are other measures that encourage links. However, we also have tax credits which encourage companies to undertake R&D. The UUK study on university and industry links raised the possibility that perhaps too much investment was going into the kind of measures which encourage capital investment and not enough into those which encourage people.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para19"></a>The Germans had a very good scheme, which they introduced in the mid-1970s, when they were worried about R&D in small and medium-sized businesses, which subsidised the salaries of those engaged in R&D in those businesses. By the mid-1980s they withdrew it because they reckoned that the problem was solved. They reintroduced it with a new lender in the early 1990s and it ran throughout most of the 1990s.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para20"></a>I wonder whether that might be an idea that we could consider in terms of trying to pull in small and medium-sized businesses. Certainly, this whole issue is a central one. There is a need for the RDAs to be involved in the skills and training agenda in pulling together these networks of support for industry within the region.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para21"></a>As I have said, we welcome the report, which is very much along the right lines. I hope that the Minister takes note of its recommendation.

<A NAME="40429-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, it is almost with fear and trepidation that I attempt to follow the superb contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. I am not a scientist or an academic, but her breadth of knowledge and enthusiasm has really added to the debate today.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para22"></a>I thank the Select Committee for this excellent report, which is informative, readable and commendably to the point. It is the second seriously punchy report to government that I have read in recent days. I highly commend the committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para23"></a>The report highlights the importance of innovation in many industries, including aerospace, pharmaceuticals, software, engineering, medical technologies, and so forth. I share the view that innovation is an important driver to economic growth. Accepting all of that, it is disappointing to read in the DTI's innovation report published in December last year that Britain still lags behind its competitors in R&D investment. Where the UK spends 1.25 per cent of GDP on research and development, the United States spends 2.06 per cent and Germany 1.75 per cent. If government expenditure on defence is excluded to identify only non-government business activity, the UK's investment level is even lower and is already less than the OECD average. That is not a good picture.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para24"></a>Bearing those figures in mind, it is necessary to examine why this lag exists. To that end, this report makes some important observations. At the heart of the report is the reality that for innovation to occur and for this to translate into commercial products and services that are competitive in the global marketplace, UK firms need to be able to harness our expertise in science, engineering and technology. For too many years and generations we have been the inventors without being able to convert that into product and profit for the nation.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para25"></a>In paragraph 1.5 the report concludes that while there is a great deal of activity at all levels encouraging the exploitation of SET for economic gain, that has been complicated by the introduction of the nine regional development agencies.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para26"></a>I shall turn to a few references within the report because I am anxious that the Minister should respond and say what the Government are doing about the report and its negative comments. The report has been out for nine months, so they have had time to think about it and to get the matter together.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para27"></a>On page 8 we have the five Cs, so ably outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, at the beginning of the debate. Where are we on that? On page 21, referring to RDAs and RDA targets, the EEDA and Universities UK comment:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Tier 2 targets remain a stumbling block for delivery of complex and strategic activity at regional level".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para28"></a>
That does not sound like a good omen. On page 22, paragraph 3.28 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"On the basis that what gets measured gets done, we recommend that the Government should work with the RDAs urgently to develop simplified performance measures that take better account of SET's [Science Engineering and Technology] importance in economic development, and accommodate both realistic timescales for results and the differing circumstances of individual regions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para29"></a>
The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, made the point that timescales are very relevant and that much of the Government's policies are too short-term. They have to become longer-term and more far-sighted, with better commitment to capital funding of one sort or another.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para30"></a>On bureaucracy&#151;the bane of any government's life, but this Government seem to be the worse yet for bureaucracy&#151;the committee states in paragraph 3.30:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, we heard many concerns that the bureaucratic demands to meet this accountability were unnecessarily burdensome and sometimes contradictory".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para31"></a>
That is followed through by a comment from SEEDA. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have to conduct our business in accordance with numerous guidance documents totalling some 1400 pages [which] have been developed at different times, often in isolation from each other and inevitably embody contradictions and ambiguities as they come from several departmental sources".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="column_970"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
What hope have the universities, RDAs and others of getting together with this sort of environment and background?
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para33"></a>The report continues on page 23 that the Better Regulation Task Force noted:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When we looked at the delivery process from Whitehall to the ground level, we found too many initiatives, confused accountabilities and overly bureaucratic monitoring and reporting systems. We recommend that the centre delivers a programme of reviews focused on local delivery issues which cross departmental boundaries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para34"></a>
What position have the Government reached on that issue?
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para35"></a>Paragraph 3.33 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regardless of developing the stronger bottom up approach to performance measurement . . .  we recommend that the Government should reduce the bureaucratic load on RDAs and work with them to ensure that its guidance is reduced to the essential minimum and is, in any case, made consistent".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para36"></a>
On page 32, on support schemes, the committee states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no shortage of support schemes . . .  Indeed, there are far too many schemes, leading to high transaction costs in applying for and administering them, and wasteful confusion and lost opportunities under complicated rules".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para37"></a>
Then there are the comments of Dr Keaton of Campus Ventures on the Better Regulation Task Force. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When we looked at the delivery process from Whitehall to the ground level, we found too many initiatives, confused accountabilities and overly bureaucratic monitoring and delivery systems".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para38"></a><P>

<a name="40429-13_para39"></a>If one goes on through the report, as I and I am sure other noble Lords have done, certainly the early part is full of such criticisms. They are real and objective criticisms. I am sure that the committee made them as objective criticisms to be tackled by the Government and by the department.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para40"></a>I turn to the section on public sector procurement. Other noble Lords have talked about the funding gap. On page 34, paragraphs 4.52 and 4.55 state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The growth of any sector depends on businesses securing orders . . .  We were concerned to learn from Mr Wren-Hilton that his Internet company was precluded from bidding for a project within its technical competence (and in which it had a good international track record) solely on grounds of turnover".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para41"></a><P>

<a name="40429-13_para42"></a>The day before yesterday, I was fortunate to have a meeting with a lady from the Ethnic Minority Business Group, and she told us that this was one of the major problems for ethnic minority business groups getting business. She told us that more than 50 per cent of ethnic minority entrepreneurs skipped round these barriers and took their business offshore using international agents. The cost of entry for innovative entrepreneurs is too high, and it is too high because of overregulation. The report makes that point abundantly clear.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para43"></a>However, all of the regional development agencies place an emphasis on SET in their economic strategies. Relationships are complex and widely varied. The report goes on to suggest that work is needed to rationalise activity to allow for better SET exploitation. It argues for coherent longer-term perspectives and reduced bureaucracy&#151;the points that I hope I have been making to your Lordships. In paragraph 6.37, the report says that <P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 971</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>national leadership is required on exploitation of SET to provide the right drivers and processes for the exploitation of SET for economic gain. The report calls for the five Cs, to which we have already referred. Looking specifically at RDAs, the report recommends a revision of current accountability and targets to take into account the importance of SET in economic development strategies. An incoming Conservative government will work with RDAs, business interests in the regions and local authorities to reform RDAs to create effective, business-led, economic regeneration vehicles in those areas where regeneration is required, and to focus the RDAs on innovation, capacity building, entrepreneurship and the skills base in those regions where this agenda is more appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para44"></a>In all cases the RDAs, if they are to provide a valuable contribution in the future, need to be genuinely business-led, but also need to be accountable to the communities they serve. There is a delicate balance to be struck, and Conservatives will engage with business and local authorities to ensure that the balance is right, so that properly restructured, business-led RDAs can play their part in addressing local needs.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para45"></a>One other point that I have not made is the possible introduction of regional government. That will increase the confusion and the bureaucratic complications, but that is not a point that I should be making from this side of the House at this stage. It is not part of this report, but it is yet another possible difficulty on the skyline for our business ventures.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para46"></a>In summary, this is a very worthwhile and interesting report. I hope that the Government will study its recommendations carefully. The Government's primary role is to provide the strategic direction and framework, which is the five Cs that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and his committee have laid down clearly. Their role is to ensure that the five Cs can be applied, and that SET can be harnessed for the economic benefit of local communities. If this is achieved, it will surely reap rich rewards for the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para47"></a>Just to refer once more to what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, noble Lords will know that I am a Northern Ireland man. I come from Northern Ireland, and I have experienced and seen at first hand the incredible growth of the Republic of Ireland. I have also seen what can really be done with a community of 1.3 million people, when the infrastructure is right and when the communications are right. There has been such growth, despite the terrorism and everything else that has taken place in the past few years in Northern Ireland, because it is a tightly-managed and tightly-knit community, with totally committed entrepreneurs, and close relationships with competent civil servants. I believe that it is an example. The Republic of Ireland has done the same, again for the same reasons. If the infrastructure can be got right, if the bureaucracy can be reduced to a sensible level, and if the directives can be held and contained to be positive and objective, we will have a great future in this field ahead of us. This report points out of all of this very clearly, and I congratulate the committee.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for his opening speech this afternoon and for drawing the attention of this House to the report on science and the RDAs, which was published last summer by this House's Science and Technology Committee. I also thank other noble Lords for their contribution and insights this afternoon. We have had a fascinating debate, bringing together two areas of key importance to the Government&#151;the growth of the UK science base and increased prosperity for UK regions.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para48"></a>The Government welcomed the conclusions of the report when it was published last year. I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that we have already responded to the report and have taken action where we think that is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para49"></a>I am very pleased that the committee has been converted to the value of RDAs and indeed converted to the view of the enormously important role they can play in innovation. That is a view that we have been pushing extremely hard in Government for the last four or five years, and I hope that the committee will go on communicating this message both to business and indeed to other political parties of which they are members, so that they too realise that the issues of RDAs and the RDAs' role in innovation are extremely important for the future of this country.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para50"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, said that we had had a lot of reports. I do not make any apology for that long list of reports, because that is how we convince people of the importance of innovation and of the science and technology agenda, and indeed of the importance of that to the regions. We have had a whole series of reports, going back to 1998. We started with one on biotechnology clusters, we then had Excellence and Opportunity, which set out the science agenda and what we needed to do, but which also made the point that that was all about innovation. We also started some of the initiatives on innovation.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para51"></a>We had the White Paper, Opportunity for All in a World of Change, in which we first set out that approach. That report refers to the need to change regional policy away from merely trying to create jobs of any kind to a strong focus on innovation as the means of improving regional prosperity. We have now had Investing in Innovation, which again deals with the people issues and how we support our best young scientists. We had various ideas on fellowships and improving science in schools. Recently we have had the innovation report. I make no apology for those reports. That has been a major campaign to change people's views and I welcome the committee's report supporting this general approach enormously.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para52"></a>I shall reply to some of the points made on specific issues, but I will first set out our policy on the UK science base and the role of the RDAs. Investment in the UK science base is at the heart of the UK's national economic strategy. We believe that in an increasingly global economy, science and engineering skills&#151;and a supply of new ideas&#151;are crucial to the UK's ability to compete in high-technology, high value-added sectors. We need to do that because increasingly in this global <P>


<a name="column_973"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>world we have to compete with countries such as China where the wages are 5 per cent of what they are in this country. We will not be able to compete on the basis of low costs. We have to compete on the basis of innovation.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para53"></a>The UK already has an excellent science base and this Government have taken many steps since 1997 to ensure that we do not fall behind our competitors. When we came into government the science budget was £1.3 billion; today it is growing at 10 per cent per annum in real terms and will be £2.9 billion in 2005&#150;06. So when the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, complains about the level of science spending by government in this country, he should remember that we would be a lot worse if it was not for the action of this Government. The previous Conservative government presided over a disastrous fall, not only, interestingly, in government research&#151;which as the noble Baroness said fell dramatically&#151;but also in business R&D, which fell from something like 1.5 per cent to 1.16 per cent over the last period of Conservative government. So it was not only government spending which went down; business R&D went down because the view was not held that that was where the future of the country lay. That situation has now changed. The figure came down to 1.16 per cent but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, pointed out, in the year that I became a science Minister it turned round and business R&D started to move up and is now at 1.24 per cent. That is still not anywhere near where we need to be but there are many policies in the business innovation report for increasing it.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para54"></a>We have also made significant investments to improve the scientific infrastructure of the UK which, in many cases, was falling apart. Over the next two years we shall move up to spending about £500 million a year on the scientific infrastructure, £350 million of which will be for ongoing development and £150 million to catch up on the nearly £2 billion shortfall in the scientific infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para55"></a>On the back of the growth in funding and the renewal of our science base we are now in a position to look forward to where we want UK science to be in the next decade. The Government will therefore be publishing alongside the forthcoming spending review their framework for science, technology and engineering research and innovation over the next decade. That, again, is a sign of the Government's commitment to spending on the science base.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para56"></a>In it we will set out the direction in which policy will need to continue to develop to make the most of our investment in the science base and to identify how this will contribute to economic growth and the Government's public service priorities. The framework will provide a clear lead to all those who invest, and want to continue to invest, in our science base, including universities, business and the RDAs.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para57"></a>We are extremely pleased at the way in which the RDAs in England and similar bodies in the devolved administrations have picked up the challenge of how we support science and innovation in the regions. In 2002&#150;03, the RDAs committed themselves to invest £240 million in science and innovation-related activities, some 15 per cent of their total budgets. Most <P>


<a name="column_974"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 974</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>RDAs have identified science and innovation as high priorities in their economic strategies, recognising the benefits it will bring.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para58"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Mitchell that this is an early moment to look at science and innovation policy in the RDAs; it is very much a developing story. The original task of the RDAs flowed very much from the bodies they took over, which were concerned with property and regeneration. We then established the innovation fund, which was the beginning of their use of innovation in their strategies.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para59"></a>My noble friend Lord Mitchell told us of his lunch at AstraZeneca. I should say to him that the whole story of science and industry councils started in the north-west. It was originally put forward by businessmen and scientists in the north-west as a result of Diamond Synchrotron. One of the suggestions to come out of that was that a science and industry council should be established, and I was very happy to persuade Sir Tom McKillop to lead it.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para60"></a>It is absolutely essential to the success of science and industry councils that they are led by either distinguished businessmen or scientists. That is what gives them credibility; that is what encourages other businessmen and the universities to take them seriously. Sir Tom McKillop has done a fantastic job for the north-west in this respect, as Sir Ian Gibson has done in the north-east. They have led the way in how to use science and industry councils to make these changes. We have encouraged all the other RDAs to set up science and industry councils on the back of that good performance, and I am glad to say that they are now all committed to doing so.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para61"></a>Any idea that my own department, the Department of Trade and Industry, was against this development and somehow held it back is quite wrong. The DTI took the lead in sponsoring innovation in regional policy and in the establishment of science and industry councils, and it is greatly to its credit that it did so.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para62"></a>The RDAs' approach to supporting regional science and innovation has been diverse in scale and direction, but that is how it should be, reflecting the different starting points of each region and their individual challenges. Some have funded the physical infrastructure of clusters, others have co-funded university research and supported technology transfer. Many of the RDAs have now established Science and Industry Councils, and they are all going to do that.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para63"></a>Given the historical concentration of research funding in the Golden Triangle in the south-east of England, some have argued that we are allowing our goal of world-class science supporting UK-based innovation to override the Government's regional economic goals to increase prosperity and reduce the gap between regions. I do not think this is the case. We have to balance these two objectives. On the one hand there is the need for excellent world-class research universities; on the other, getting money into the regions and supporting regional growth. I think we have done that in the right way, which is to give substantially larger budgets to the RDAs in the regions that have traditionally performed less well, so that they can use that money as they wish.
<P>


<a name="column_975"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 975</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para64"></a>Rather than having science and technology budgets, we have now adopted the strategy of the "single pot", which is about saying to RDAs that they have a single pot of money to use as they wish, and if they wish to spend it on science and technology, we support that. I think that is the right way to go. What we do not want to do is micro-manage it. If one is to devolve authority, one has to give money to people and let them make the decisions. They can then tension spending on science and technology against their other regional objectives. What is key to this whole issue is that the proper connectivity is achieved at a regional level.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para65"></a>In its report, the committee succinctly concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The main message of our Report is the need for coherence, longer term perspectives and reduced bureaucracy . . .  The primary need is for a clear sense of national direction and purpose to create the conditions in which all stakeholders can make their optimal contributions . . .  The message can be summed up in the five Cs&#151;coherence, connectivity, coordination, communication and co-operation. Applying these to the exploitation of SET will improve the growth of regional economies, with consequent benefits for the nation as a whole".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-13_para66"></a>
We very much accept that view.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para67"></a>I would, however, make one organisational point, one that comes from my experience in industry. If one has delegation or devolution, one has to stick with it. What always happens in these things is that people say "We will delegate to a particular division or region", which is immediately followed by people saying "Ah, but we have to have coherence. We have to co-ordinate everything." If one does that, one ends up with bureaucracy. So I do not think the committee can say that it wants devolution, delegation, coherence, co-ordination and no bureaucracy, because that is not the real world. Delegation means that some things will not be co-ordinated, as regions will do what they think is right for their region. We must have the courage to say that we believe in delegation, which will mean some things will not be co-ordinated, but people will have ownership and get the co-ordination and delivery right at a regional level. That is a more important objective.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para68"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, asked about the Government's approach to RDAs and regional innovation. Our overall approach is set out very fully in the innovation report, Competing in the Global Economy&#151;The Innovation Challenge. A whole section of that report is entirely about the regional innovation agenda, and in it we make a whole series of proposals that are directly about how we see science and innovation within regional policy, including a proposal about science and industry councils. It had important recommendations about regional selective assistance. Instead of simply concentrating on the number of jobs and using that as the only criterion for inward investment, innovation&#151;that is, research and development&#151;is now the measure. There is no point in having inward investment when it is a question of a <P>


<a name="column_976"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 976</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of low value jobs which will not have a great deal of long-term success. We want to import into the regions high value-added jobs which will contribute to their innovation and dynamism.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para69"></a>There were proposals about adding on to the manufacturing advisory service, which is delivered at regional level, services related to innovation and design. That is another way in which we can contribute to the regional agenda. The Lambert report contains many aspects which go in the same direction.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para70"></a>I think I have covered the points that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, raised about the integration of government policies. Let me say a word about the links with the research councils. We have a forum for the OST, RDAs and other key players to address the impact and synergy between national and regional SET investments. The steering group for the research councils and the regional development agencies was formed in 2003. It provides a high level of strategic advice to develop the relationship and to provide a communication channel between the RDAs and the research councils. To facilitate the development of outcomes from RCUK and the RDA meetings on RDA innovation, we have established a more operational level science and technology group, which includes representatives from the RDAs as well as from the OST and DTI.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para71"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, also asked about government statistics about government R&D in different regions. The figures for 2000&#150;01 show a proportionate increase for the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber, east Midlands and east of London. But there is a huge skewed distribution of government institutions across the country. This is an historical fact.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para72"></a>Very few new facilities are being built in this way. The whole move is towards putting the research much more into universities rather than stand-alone institutes. There are very good reasons why that is happening, although I shall not go into them now. So new research institutes are not being built. In addition, I do not think these are nearly as important to regional growth as what is happening in the universities. That is where we are seeing the most innovation and change which is relevant for regional growth.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para73"></a>While the RDAs are saying that we should put more research money into the north and the midlands, the South East England Development Agency is asking why they do not have a pot of money like they have so they can support knowledge transfer in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para74"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Patel and Lord Mitchell, both raised the major question of whether we should follow the USA and have a small company set-aside scheme. There are, I am afraid, very clear international reasons why this is difficult to do in the EU. More importantly, however, is the fact that we change our procurement policies at all levels to make them support innovation rather than an old, traditional view of value for money. The innovation report shows the importance we attach to procurement being changed to support innovation in suppliers. This applies to all levels of business.
<P>


<a name="column_977"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 977</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para75"></a>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Patricia Hewitt, is leading a cross-government team which is considering, as one of its main issues, how we change the £109 billion of government procurement so that it focuses more on innovation in suppliers. Of course, this is a major task because it is about changing around the whole way in which procurement is carried out to give value for money while also taking innovation into account. We have had the Small Business Research Initiative, which is again based on an American scheme, to bring money for research into small companies. That does not have nearly enough drive behind it, so we are changing it to achieve more.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para76"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Methuen, raised the question of transport. The Department for Transport regards the RDAs as customers rather than the people who will make transport decisions, but we all agree that transport is a key part of regional development and we must keep it under review.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para77"></a>I shall respond to a few other points that were made during the debate. My noble friend Lord Mitchell asked about regional venture capital. We have the regional venture capital funds, but I agree with him that the key area is business angels. They are still very unevenly spread across the country. We have a strong business angel community in some areas, but we need to extend it across the country.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para78"></a>In addition, the Enterprise Capital Funds are coming forward. I have a great personal interest in them, because I wrote a Fabian pamphlet in 1982, arguing that we should look at small business investment companies in America and see if we could copy them in this country. I was therefore delighted when the Chancellor said in the last Budget that he would look at them. It seemed that the Fabian Society motto&#151;"the inevitability of gradualness"&#151;was for once coming true. That move will give further support to that kind of small business.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para79"></a>I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, is writing a book on spin-offs. There is a very good story to be told of a dramatic change in British culture. Those stories relate in some sense to schemes such as science enterprise centres, to HEIF and to University Challenge, which, if nothing else, have changed the climate in universities.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para80"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and a number of other noble Lords drew attention to one of the most interesting aspects of the whole area of innovation across the world, which is the extraordinary performance of small countries with a typical population of 3 million to 5 million. That is true of Finland&#151;which has enjoyed one of the most dramatic changes&#151;Ireland, Israel and Singapore. That is the size of the average US state. The message seems to be that if one wants to co-ordinate matters and bring all the players together, one can do it more easily in a population of 5 million, whether it is a US state, an RDA or a small country. That demonstrates the importance of co-ordination at a regional level. It is why the RDAs are particularly successful.

<a name="40429-13_para81"></a>My noble friend Lord Thomas of Macclesfield spoke about strengthening capability of regions. I totally agree with him. We are looking at whether there is a way in which we could do that as part of our spending review.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para82"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wade, happily reminded me of a body that I thought had gone out of my life, which is the US Cheese and Deli Association. I thought that I would never come across it again in my life, so it was nice to make contact with it again. I have already alluded to his point, that delegation is not a "yes or no" issue. It is always about what you delegate and what you do not delegate. We are still trying to work out that relationship properly with the RDAs. It is quite a subtle relationship. We want to delegate to them, but it would be an absurdity if every RDA were to begin producing its own forward look on the biotech industry. That should be done centrally. There is otherwise always a danger of their going to a consultancy, which produces the North West Strategy for Biotechnology, promptly followed by the consultancy selling the same document to the north, the south-west and the east of England and so on. The overall strategy needs to stay in the centre, but we should delegate much more of the operational side. We are working on that.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para83"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, raised the question of picking winners. The RDAs started off picking very much the same areas. That has changed. They are now much more selective and much more inclined to look at where they have areas of strength, be it in aerospace or the chemical industry, and to realise that it is more important to make certain that those clusters are working efficiently.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para84"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, raised the question of business R&D. Suffice to say that it is now going up. We see this as one of the most important objectives, and in terms of the framework for science and innovation, it is one of the targets we will pick up from the innovation report. We want that figure to be a leading figure in the major countries of Europe.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para85"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, talked about the business support scheme. We inherited over 100 business support schemes when we came into government, and are now in the process of whittling that down to 10. That simplification is enormously valuable to industry.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para86"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, raised the issue of the dynamism of our economy. That is already beginning to take place. The noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, pointed to what is happening in places such as Manchester. Some very interesting figures have been produced by Citicorp, showing that we in this country have a rather strong position in terms of high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services compared to the rest of Europe. We are beginning to see the value of the flexibility in the British economy in enabling growth areas to progress very fast, and that is helping our industrial performance. On the ground, one can see the importance of science and technology innovation to our future success.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para87"></a>We have had an opportunity to air some very important issues this afternoon, and I am grateful for the inputs of all noble Lords. As your Lordships have <P>


<a name="column_979"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 979</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>heard, the Government have already taken action to implement many of the report's recommendations, and will continue to refer to its findings in the future development of policy. The UK has many scientific assets of which it can be proud. It is now up to the Government, RDAs, universities and businesses to make the most of them, and to ensure that they are connected fully to the regional and national economies.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Patel: </B>   My Lords, I could not have wished for a better debate, and I thank all noble Lords who have participated.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para88"></a>It is traditional at this stage to pick up on some of the points, but I shall not do that because we have had a full debate. All the speakers paid tribute to me as chairman. Let me pay a tribute in return: it was a pleasure to chair the committee. All the committee members, as evidenced in their speeches, are colourful characters. That made it a pleasure. I might regret my next comment, but if I were asked to do so again with the same membership, it would be a pleasure.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para89"></a>I sincerely thank the Minister for answering all the questions fully. We all know that he is a champion of the need to promote science and technology, and his answers, given at length, typified that. We are <P>


<a name="column_980"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column 980</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fortunate to have a Science Minister who has a full understanding of the issues related to the promotion of science and innovation.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para90"></a>Several noble Lords, as did the Minister, made the point that the RDAs are developing, and have been in existence for a relatively short time. It would be appropriate to have another look at the problems of RDAs in three to four years' time, and I am sure the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee has noted that.
<P>

<a name="40429-13_para91"></a>Lastly, a true entrepreneur never misses an opportunity, as demonstrated by the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, advertising his book&#151;not only naming the authors, but linking the Minister in promoting the book.

<a name="40429-14_para1"></a>Clause 33 [Preparation of permit schemes]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 100:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 15, line 6, leave out "him" and insert "it"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-14_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40429-14_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a very important amendment. I was advised by an eminent lawyer that my amendment would improve the wording. In my ever-helpful way, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We think that it is clear from the clause that it is the national authority to which the highway authority is required to submit its scheme. Nevertheless, we are happy to investigate the wording to see whether any change is desirable to improve the clarity of the clause. If my noble friend is content to withdraw his amendment for the time being, we will consider the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 101:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 15, line 14, leave out "and"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-14_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40429-14_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 101, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 102. As the Committee will be aware from proceedings during the previous sitting, we are talking about permit schemes.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para7"></a>The amendments are designed to ensure that, before a permit scheme is introduced, there is consultation. Noble Lords may think that that is superfluous, but it is always worth talking about, just to make sure that those who are bringing in the regulations consult. Some do it very well, but some do it less well.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para8"></a>As many noble Lords said on Tuesday, the key thing is that the scheme must work. It must be practicable, and it must balance the need to minimise congestion with the need to maintain and provide essential services from the utilities, as noble Lords said on Tuesday. The scheme must also take into account the needs of the highway authorities, the police and the emergency services, environmental health services, <P>


<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transport authorities, traffic managers and parking managers. We must ensure that the utilities and the local authorities conform in a fair way.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para9"></a>I have a concern about the permits. I suspect that we shall talk about them later. On Tuesday, we discussed cases in which there might be an urgent need to do something. I do not know whether it will be possible to get a permit by e-mail by return. There is also the fact that so many different people are involved. It is not just the utilities and the highway authorities. Many other organisations from within local authorities might wish to be involved.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para10"></a>I can give the Committee one or two examples. A utility might apply for a permit to work on a major road and, in the interests of reducing traffic congestion, the local authority might require the work to be carried out at weekends or in the evening and issue a permit accordingly. However, when the work is being carried out, the council's environmental health department can object to the noise. Who will claim off whom? Will the work go ahead or be stopped? There will be a row.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para11"></a>Again, a utility might apply for work in a busy street and traffic management controls agreed with the highways authorities to enable the permit to be issued. But, there is also the matter of the suspension of residents parking and parking bays that are managed by a separate department of the council. That department could object and could place quite separate restrictions on proposed works.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para12"></a>A utility could apply for a permit that may be approved, but due to illegal parking may not be able to carry out the work. In this Bill, I do not think that we are talking about utilities being able to tow away illegally parked cars. Therefore, someone else would have to do that, which could cause problems. I am sure that many other conflicts could arise, such as public transport, the needs of the police, public events and so forth.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para13"></a>This group of amendments is designed to ensure that maximum consultation takes place on permit schemes. A way around all those problems, and any others that the Committee may think of, must be found before the system is in place, in order that it works smoothly, with maximum local support, when it goes ahead. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Berkeley. Despite the somewhat negative attitude of Her Majesty's Government to an amendment that I sought to put forward earlier this week, I am still hopeful that, ultimately, permit schemes will be devised to exempt emergency works, minor works and so forth from the need for permits. I trust that some form of wording to that effect will be included in the Bill or in regulations. None the less, whatever is left for permit schemes to apply to, it is most important that they satisfy the understanding, comprehension and goodwill of the police, the utilities and the bodies mentioned in my noble friend's amendment, Amendment No. 102.
<P>


<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para14"></a>I dare say that the Minister may use a well honed answer to an amendment of this kind: namely, that consultation is bound to take place and, of course, there is no need therefore for an amendment of this kind. If only one could be so trusting that on all necessary occasions there would be consultation, that would be fair enough, but it would be better to have a limited, understandable and clear provision of this type in the Bill to ensure that there is consultation. We all know that that is properly legally interpreted as meaning a full consultation and not just some pretence at getting in touch with someone, but taking no notice whatever at what they say. Consultation in real terms is required. It may be helpful to have that in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said. He said it all. There is nothing that I need to add, except that I support the general thrust of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 102 and Amendment No. 102, which is consequential, would require authorities preparing permit schemes to consult and have regard to persons representing the police, undertakers and such persons as they think appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para15"></a>Clause 36(2) already provides for the permit regulations to set out procedural provision with which those preparing permit schemes must comply and provision as to the publicity to be given to permit schemes. Those provisions will enable the appropriate national authorities to impose requirements on authorities preparing schemes as to who they should consult.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para16"></a>I have listened to what has been said, in particular, by my noble friend Lord Borrie about consultation; namely, that there is a spirit of consultation that sometimes does not work and sometimes is not full consultation. But we are determined that the permit scheme should work properly. It would be preposterous to have a permit scheme which does not work and that people&#151;whoever they are&#151;do not like. So we have asked the working group of undertakers and authorities looking at permit regulations to consider whether the regulations should place such a requirement on authorities and, if so, whom they should be required to consult. The group will be talking to everyone affected, including the police, local authorities and representatives of the utilities. Moreover, our deliberations here, at Second Reading and on Report will illuminate its work because the group will read what is being said. I hope, therefore, that the worst fears of my noble friends Lord Berkeley and Lord Borrie will not be realised.
<P>

<a name="40429-14_para17"></a>As we begin to talk about permits, I think it is worth emphasising at the outset that the Government feel that they must get the permit system right. If they do not do so, the whole thing will not work. With that watertight assurance, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for that response. I have had good experiences of <P>

No doubt they will take into consideration what is said by noble Lords at each stage of the Bill. I shall read what he has said with great interest. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40429-14_para23"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 102A and 102B have been tabled in response to a recommendation from the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. For the sake of clarity, the amendments make it clear that where a national authority&#151;the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales&#151;makes an order approving an application from a highway authority to operate a permit scheme, the powers under Clauses 34 and 35 for that order to modify or disapply existing enactments apply only to the extent allowed for by permit regulations made under Part 3 of the Bill. Amendment No. 102A applies to schemes operated by local highway authorities, while Amendment No. 102B relates to those operated by national authorities themselves. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-15_para8"></a>The noble Viscount said: Amendment No. 103 relates to Clause 36 and permit regulations. The amendment refers to multiple schemes. We believe that multiple schemes could be an administrative nightmare for operators who would have to operate within different rules in different areas and would be subject to penalties for inadvertent failures to comply. I hope that the Government will see my amendment as a positive change that would ensure consistency, minimise confusion and allow the system to be more easily operated by all, thereby reducing costly and time-consuming disputes. It would also, and more importantly, allow the focus to be on reducing congestion.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para9"></a>In order to improve congestion, an electronic register of all works is essential to enable utilities to align their works with local authority works as well as with other utilities. In Standing Committee in another place the Minister agreed that the more standardisation there is, the better. The amendment addresses that concern. I know that some county councils are worried about having a myriad of schemes and advocate a national scheme that can be flexible in some areas to take account of local circumstances. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   It may be for the convenience of the Committee if we took my Amendment No. 103A with this because it is really just an alternative. Perhaps I should have been more alert, but as a Cross-Bencher I have not done this very often. Is it procedurally correct if I talk to it at the same time? It actually covers the same point. Would that be to the convenience of the Committee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Haskel): </B>  You want to group Amendment No. 103A with which amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I want to talk to Amendment No. 103A at the same time as Amendment No. 103.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Yes, that is all right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   The two amendments are trying to achieve the same thing. In fact, to save time, I will mention that Amendments Nos. 105B and 105C are all concerned with the same matter.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para10"></a>I have also been briefed that the problem is that one wants the maximum degree of standardisation possible between the permit schemes, not a lot of different schemes applying differently in different places. Mr McNulty, a Minister in the Department for Transport, said in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The greater the standardisation that the group can achieve, the better".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee A, 29/1/04; col. 166.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-15_para11"></a>
It would ensure the maximum level of consistency across the affected counties. Having the same permit scheme throughout is extremely important. Otherwise, there will be confusion. People will not know how to apply. If they move from one authority to another, they will have different sets of rules to learn. It just creates more work for everybody.
<P>


<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para12"></a>It has been said that different permit schemes should take account of local circumstances, and I see that point. On the other hand, any permit scheme should be flexible enough to take account of different types of roads and the different traffic conditions prevailing on them. It seems to me that, if we cannot simplify or co-ordinate across all the schemes, we are making a job creation scheme. Therefore, whether we accept Amendment No. 103 or Amendment No. 103A, the principles embodied in the amendment are very important.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para13"></a>In order to make it easier for people to deal with this, we are trying to implement electronic government and to move into the modern communications age. That is all that Amendments Nos. 105B and 105C are about. It is an add-on to the point to say that the registers for the permits should be kept electronically and that they should be available for everyone to see so that they can co-ordinate their works as well, if they want to. It would be a logical extension of having a standardised permit scheme.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para14"></a>I thought it was easier to talk to my amendment with this amendment. I thank the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The amendment appears to be intended to require that regulations made under Clause 36 would have to ensure a reasonable level of consistency between permit schemes. The regulations would have to set out certain standard provisions that would be common to all permit schemes, especially in relation to electronic noticing systems.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para15"></a>The Government agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that there should be some degree of standardisation between different permit schemes. It cannot be sensible to have dozens of entirely different schemes operating in different parts of the country. However, we do not want to be prescriptive about this issue and put in the Bill. It is an issue that we feel can be safely dealt with through regulations. The working group that we have set up to consider the details of permit regulations and the accompanying guidance has been asked specifically to look at the issue of standardisation. The question will be how far that standardisation should go.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para16"></a>The points that have been made this afternoon will be given to the working group, and we expect it to make its recommendations to us later in the year. We will then go out to public consultation on the way forward. A very important part of that will be how the permits are delivered: in traditional printed form or electronically. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that electronic delivery is the way forward, but that is just my view. That idea will be fed to the working group, and we will see what it says. I would be very surprised if it were not adopted.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para17"></a>I hope that I can reassure the Committee that the working group will do a good job. I am absolutely sure that everybody will see the benefits of standardisation as far as possible of the permits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-15_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful for that helpful answer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The utilities are worried that, when the highway authorities give out permits, they are also responsible for street works. There could therefore be a conflict of interests. An independent appeals mechanism is needed to ensure that disputes are fair, consistent, even-handed and done in a timely manner.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para23"></a>The Association of London Government's parking appeals process is a good example of how that is done. I have never been through it, but a relation of mine has. Many people have told me how good it is. It is very easy; one does not need lawyers; and it works extremely well. I do not know whether that would be the right model. My noble friend Lord Borrie will probably speak about what lawyers want. The important point is that there is a fear that, when Section 74 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 was introduced in 2000, many costly and time-consuming disputes arose where parties tried to understand the regulations. Many different disputes arose around the country, because there were different systems in each local authority area, and some ended up in court.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para24"></a>If the regulations in this Bill are to be introduced quickly next year, there is a fear that the same thing could happen. There must be a quick mediation process without the need for lengthy negotiations and arbitration using lawyers; otherwise, I foresee that the utilities will say, "These are all putting costs up; we will put our costs up in case we run into problems". They say that the costs of night-time work are around 35 to 40 per cent higher, certainly in the Greater London area, because of the shortage of suitable workers. All those costs will be added to the consumer's electricity or telephone bills, for example.
<P>

<a name="40429-15_para25"></a>Everyone would like a quick and easy appeals mechanism and, as has been said in respect of earlier amendments, at least some consistency in how the schemes are introduced across the country. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40429-16_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   This is an important amendment because it would add a provision to allow disputes to be settled by arbitration. As drafted, the Bill will lead to a situation whereby highway authorities give out permits while also being responsible for half of all <P>


<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>street works. An independent appeals mechanism is surely essential to ensure that disputes are resolved in a fair, consistent, even-handed and timely manner.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para0"></a>There is a provision in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 for dealing with arbitration. The Government have given no explanation why they feel there should not be an arbitration provision in this Bill. Surely, it would be a sensible safeguard; many utilities and local authorities work closely together but, occasionally, they do not. The National Utilities Group is concerned that some local authorities could seek to maximise the revenue-generating opportunities available in the exercise of permit schemes. They could dispute utilities activities even when it was unreasonable to do so.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para1"></a>An independent appeals mechanism would therefore provide some form of safeguard for both sides and would ensure that issues could be resolved not only even-handedly but in a way that did not incur large costs. That would enable the focus to be on reducing congestion rather than increasing contention with regard to street works. The Minister may say that there is somewhere in the Bill an opportunity for that; if there is, I would be grateful to him for pointing it out. However, it would also be helpful if he could say how, when in subsection (4)(b) it refers to conferring the right of appeal, how the appeal system would work. What is the mechanism? Who are they appealing to, and who will arbitrate in that appeal? That would aid the Committee in its consideration of this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We agree that some form of appeal procedure within permit schemes would be sensible. Clause 36(4) already allows for standard appeal arrangements to be set out in the permit regulations which will underpin schemes. The working group comprising representatives of local authorities and utilities, which will be considering the draft regulations and guidance, will look at what arrangements are desirable and will make recommendations to us. However, we are also considering whether further provision is needed to allow for certain other dispute resolution procedures, such as arbitration, to be provided for in regulations. The Government may, therefore, wish to table amendments on Report to allow for that.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para2"></a>I hope that, in the light of that reassurance and in the knowledge that amendments may come through on Report, the noble Lord will not only be able to withdraw his amendment but will feel happy to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-16_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before the noble Lord comes to that tumultuous decision, will the Minister answer my question about the current right of appeal in the Bill? He did not say how that is intended to work, or if there is a place in the Bill that explains the process or how the appeal mechanism would work. It would be helpful to have some clarity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I do not think that I will be able to give the noble Viscount clarity. The powers are very wide and we have yet to work out how <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40429-16_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I understand the conundrum in which the Minister finds himself. Perhaps I could just make a plea that while the Government make up their mind exactly what they are going to do, they might be kind enough to write before Report to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and myself to explain how the system works in the Bill at the moment and what they intend to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am surprised that my noble friend the Minister has not at least been able to say whether it is an appeal to a court or to somebody else. At the moment, Clause 36(4)(b) simply refers to a right of appeal without any mention of the person to whom the appeal should be made. Even if the Minister has not determined what level of court, at least he might say whether it is to be a court or not.

I am advised that the appeal will probably not be made to the courts, but at the moment I cannot give members of the Committee any more direction about where the appeals will be made to. Apparently, the current thinking is that the appeal will not be made to the courts.

<A NAME="40429-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am very grateful to my noble friend the Minister for his response.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-16_para6"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment aims to place the highways authority on a similar footing with the utility companies by requiring not only the utility companies but the highways authority to have a permit for works that it carries out&#151;in effect, issuing itself a permit. Alternatively, the amendment would allow the inclusion of the highway authority works in the register of permits, so that it could be held accountable by the public for the works that it does. At least, in that case, we would know what works are being done by the utilities and what works are being done by the highways authority. That would enable us to consider the data for comparison in terms of road disruption in either case.
<P>


<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para7"></a>We have had debates previously on why it would be difficult for a highways authority to charge itself. It seems to me that what a highways authority ought to do is, in the same way as a utility company, to keep a register of the works that it does. The simplest way in which to do that would be to keep it in the same permit scheme, so the public can have that consistency.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para8"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is in a similar vein. I am not sure whether my amendment is preferable to his&#151;his might even be preferable to mine&#151;but we are both concerned with the same point. It is an important point. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   May I express considerable interest in and sympathy with the amendment just moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor? Amendment No. 106, which is coupled with it and tabled in the name of myself and the noble Earl, Lord Errol, is slightly more detailed. However, it certainly has the same purpose&#151;of trying to ensure that the Bill will be applied equally, whether the work is being carried out by highway authorities, local authorities or utilities.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para9"></a>A great deal of the Bill relates to co-ordination. If there is one public grouse bigger than any other in relation to the nuisance caused by disruptive road works, it is that one minute the gas people are digging up the road, the next minute it is the electricity people, the next minute it is the water people, and that they do not co-ordinate the work. Parliament has tried before, and this Bill is meant to try, with greater success, to ensure that all that work is properly co-ordinated.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para10"></a>One aspect of co-ordination is surely to co-ordinate the work of utilities, whichever they are, on the one hand, and works performed by local authorities on the other. I do not see how street works can be co-ordinated unless utilities are able to align the work that they want to do with the work done by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para11"></a>Part 2 of the Bill, which we have already discussed in this Committee, requires local authorities to manage their works as part of their overall road network management duty. While the Government have claimed that the Bill is intended to be applied equitably, that does not really seem to be the case. Utilities are to be subject to charges for permits and to fines should they be in breach of those permits. Local authorities will not be so subject to charges and penalties.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para12"></a>As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and one of the Ministers pointed out, I have to accept that there is a dangerous circuity in fining government-related bodies. You take money from one government body and put it into the hands of another. Clearly, there will not be equitable treatment if one accepts that argument. When I proposed Amendment No. 70 during a previous sitting of the Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, my noble friend Lord Berkeley and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, all accepted the desirability of achieving in some way equity between local authorities on the one hand and utilities on the other.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para13"></a>I understand that a suggestion has been made by one of the working groups which has been established that there should be a points system. In the interests of harmonious working between the utilities and the <P>


<a name="column_GC131"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>highway authorities, I should like to suggest that such a scheme be given serious consideration and be applied to both the utilities and the highway authorities. This would have the additional benefit of ensuring that the new scheme is not tarred with the accusation of being a revenue-generating mechanism. The Government have been at pains to say that they are not engaged in such an exercise and it is right that they should seek to disabuse us of the notion.
<P>

<a name="40429-16_para14"></a>Naturally, the detail must be left to the consideration of the working groups, but I suggest that the Government should at least consider the adoption of this approach in, let us say, the first year after implementation so that all parties can work together to co-ordinate their street works and roadworks in a non-confrontational environment. My amendment, which goes into a little more detail than that of the noble Viscount, would make the provision of such a scheme straightforward because it would impose the requirement to maintain a record in the register required by the Bill as it stands of all instances of breaches of the conditions on street works, whoever is responsible for that breach. With those words, I have spoken to Amendment No. 6 tabled in my name as well as giving support to the amendment of the noble Viscount.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I believe that the best authorities are probably approaching the Bill in precisely the way outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I do not know whether he was part of the group which visited the London Traffic Control Centre, but we saw there an attempt to co-ordinate the activities of the different bodies. A diagram had been produced which showed all the various developers, contractors, utilities and boroughs&#151;which do most of the work of the highway authorities&#151;in a loop around the street works controller. Thus the controller aims to embrace all the different bodies working within his area.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para0"></a>However, I accept that there probably is a need within authorities to separate the highway authority that actually does the work from the person who is controlling street works and issues the permit. Is that the intention here? Even though the authority and the highway authority may be in the same place and part of the same body, are they to be separate people who do not live in each other's pockets? Can he ensure that there will be equality of treatment both for highway works and other works? I do not want to see a system that fines bodies for undertaking works, in particular if we are simply going to fine the highway authority. By doing so, money from hard-pressed council tax payers is taken by the Treasury in the form of fines. That will lead to a stupid and circular movement of money that is to no one's benefit.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para1"></a>However, I want to see the highway authority putting itself under the same discipline that will apply to other bodies which have a legitimate need to dig up the road. However, we must always accept that the highway authority represents everyone, whereas a utility will represent only a particular interest. Striking a balance between the different needs may be difficult.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I support the amendments. As I said in respect of Amendment No. 102, we must not forget <P>


<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that local authorities have many different departments. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, is right: the best ones will do it very well, as we saw when we visited Transport for London. Sadly, not all are the best. Protection and fairness must be introduced. I can envisage an environmental health officer putting a stop order on something and a dispute or arbitration arising to find out who was responsible. Ditto parking bay suspensions and cars parked in the wrong space. The scheme will work in theory, but I think that everyone would feel much happier if the process were open, transparent and seen to be fair across all parts of local authorities and the utilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I fully endorse everything that has been said so far. I added my name to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, as it seemed the better one to put on an equal footing all those digging up roads. If we do not, people will not be able to go to one place to get a unified view of what is happening and the disruption that might be caused. Such a unified view and a common permit scheme would help the traffic manager to carry out his duty of road network management.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para2"></a>Further to my comment that the information should be published electronically, it would be useful to include such a provision in the Bill, given that, despite the efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for the past 10 years to get Parliamentary Questions for Written Answers answered electronically, it has still not happened. Departments are very good at burying such issues if there is not a very strong incentive to carry them out. Some government departments are having a lot of trouble coming into the 21st century.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   As we have heard, both Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 are intended to enable regulations to be made that would set up controls on the carrying out of work by local authorities. In the case of Amendment No. 106, those would have to correspond to equivalent controls on utility works under permit schemes. In fact, we believe the amendment is not necessary. The interpretation provision in Clause 38(1) makes clear the scope of "works" means that permit schemes can include works under the Highways Act 1980 covering a wide range of works by authorities, including road maintenance works.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para3"></a>The regulation-making powers can enable those works to be subject to controls through a permit scheme anyway, including, in relation to permit registers, taking into account the unavoidable different considerations that apply in regulating the activities of public authorities and private companies. We wish to make absolutely clear our expectation that the permit scheme in any area would apply to both utility works and highway works. We have asked the working group of utility and highway authority representatives looking at permit regulations and guidance to consider how works carried out by authorities can be incorporated within permit schemes. The aim of permit schemes is to improve the management of all road works in the street, including highway authorities' own works.

<a name="40429-17_para4"></a>We take on board the very important point made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and other Members of the Committee that co-ordination is absolutely the central requirement.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para5"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked about keeping information in registers. Authorities must already keep a register of their own works and utility works. We are likely to say in regulations that they must keep permit information in the register.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para6"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked about the independence of the person controlling the permits. Some authorities, as he probably knows, already separate the function of controlling and co-ordinating activity on the road from the part of the authority doing the road work. That reflects the sort of independence that we are looking for in treating everybody in the same manner.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para7"></a>I hope that, with that answer, the noble Viscount will be able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   That was an interesting reply. It was helpful as far as it went, but I noticed that, every time that the Minister said, "We can include it in regulations", he said, "We are likely to say that local authorities must keep permit schemes in their register". I hope that, if the Minister does not want another amendment on Report, he will write to us before Report saying that it is the Government's intention that regulations "will" say it, not "might" or "could" say it. It is an important area, and we want to make sure that they say it.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para8"></a>The scheme must be open. The public must be able to see it, and utility companies must see what it is. Street works and utility works will often cross over and take place at the same time in the same place. There are always opportunities for confusion, so I hope that, between now and the next stage, the Government will be a little more forthcoming and say that regulations "will include", rather than "could include".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The only reason that I used the word "may", rather than "will" is that the working group is considering the matter now. It might be slightly arrogant of us to pre-empt their discussions by saying what we want. We will talk to the working group and write to noble Lords.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-17_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   Is that not the tail wagging the dog? I thought that Parliament was supposed to tell the executive what was permissible, rather than waiting for the executive to tell it what it wants it to do.

<A NAME="40429-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   What the noble Earl says is a travesty of what I intended to say.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-17_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: The Minister will doubtless recognise this as an amendment that was made to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill when the Government introduced the question of fees into it. I have lifted the wording from that, so it is probably rather imperfectly adapted to this Bill. However, the Government then made the point that, while giving local authorities greater scope to vary the fees they charge, they wanted to ensure that authorities would not run their planning departments as a profit centre. I was opposed to that and tried to get them to let local authorities run planning departments as a profit centre&#151;first, because local authorities need the money and, secondly, because they need a real incentive to make their planning departments efficient and ensure that they are staffed by good people. There are real problems in that area.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para12"></a>However, I lost that argument. I do not want to lose it the other way on the Bill, where there is no excuse for local authorities to be running this part of their activities as a profit centre. We have done away with the poll tax&#151;let us not have the hole tax. There will be scope for local authorities to ensure that they charge for every cigarette packet dropped on the road as a street works if they can make profits out of the permit that will be required by someone who needed to place it on the road. In order that the scheme be rational, local authorities must not have the incentive to try to use the fees regime to make money. Those of us who have occasion to park in Kensington, Westminster or similar boroughs know that that is what is happened with parking. We should not expect cash-strapped local authorities to resist the chance if we give them it.
<P>

<a name="40429-17_para13"></a>So on this occasion, I welcome what the Government did in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill and hope that they will do it in this Bill. I beg to move.

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Perhaps the fact that it was a government amendment to that Bill explains why I shall give the noble Lord a sympathetic answer.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para0"></a>Clause 36(5) allows for the levels of fees to be set out in regulations. Those provisions were discussed at considerable length in another place and my ministerial colleague undertook at Report to reflect further on the points that were made, with a view to providing more information during the Bill's passage through the House. We expect to do that at Report, but I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few things now.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para1"></a>The Minister also made clear that we wanted to allow the working group advising on the form and content of the regulations to consider whether those applying for a permit would need to pay a fee and, if so, at what level fees should be set. So we return to the point that we hit discussing the last amendment: a committee is considering that very problem and we look forward to hearing what it advises. No decision has yet been made on fee levels or on how permits would fit in with existing schemes, such as charging for overrunning or lane rentals for utility works. One option would be for a permit system to replace both of those schemes.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para2"></a>As I said, we expect to return to the subject at Report, but for the record I make it absolutely clear that we are not looking to load multiple charges or excessive costs on those carrying out necessary works. I hope that, with the assurance that we will return to the matter on Report, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="40429-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   Although in principle I have no problem at all with the notion that local authorities should in no way see this as a licence to print money, I caution against crossing wholesale from the planning regime to this one, for the simple reason that, far from making money on planning applications, local authorities were often running up huge bills. The scale of fees determined centrally often left local authorities receiving the same amount of money for large planning applications that had taken a lot of time and resource to resolve and for those that were much more straightforward.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para3"></a>There has certainly never been any question of local authorities making money on planning applications. So the two situations are not the same, but I look forward to hearing what the Minister says at Report, because it is important for everyone to feel fairly treated. Local authorities do not want to have to fight with the utilities or, possibly, the public every time they make what seems to be a proper charge, with accusations of overcharging.

<A NAME="40429-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, that there are different circumstances.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-18_para9"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COST OF PERMIT SCHEMES
<br>
 No fee in respect of any application for a permit or the issue of a permit under Part 3 of this Act shall be set at a higher level than that necessary to cover the administrative costs of&#151;
<br>
(a) responding to permit applications (other than applications by the authority itself);
<br>
(b) issuing permits (other than permits to the authority itself); and
<br>
(c) maintaining a register of permits."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-18_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, my amendment is similar to the amendment that has just been moved by my noble friend Lord Lucas. As a result of the reply from the Minister I shall be briefer in my introduction because some of the points have been answered. However, my amendment is slightly different because my noble friend Lord Lucas raised concern with the overall income, whereas my amendment is tighter. The amendment refers to the "Cost of permit schemes" and attempts to put a ceiling on any charges for permits at a level of reasonable costs that might be incurred to administer the scheme in terms of responding to permit applications, issuing permits and maintaining the register of permits.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para11"></a>In other words, local authorities must set up administrative systems on a reasonable basis; charges should be reasonable; there should be no additional charges; and unnecessarily large empires should not be created to deal with permits. When the Minister responds, perhaps he could respond to the rest of the points about charging in the way that he did for a previous amendment. It is important that we have an assurance from him that Amendment No. 107 will be considered, as well as Amendments Nos. 108 and 109 that are subsequent to it.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para12"></a>It is important that, from the beginning, there should be an understanding that there should be no cross-subsidisation on permits from one company to another, one scheme to another or, indeed, to a third party. Costs should relate solely to the administrative costs of the permit scheme with respect to that individual permit. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a similar assurance to that given to my noble friend on the previous amendment; namely, that these issues will be considered. I beg to move.

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want cross-subsidisation. Perhaps we may, at a later stage, have a little more clarification about how that situation will be managed. After all, this refers to co-ordination of work. It is very easy to envisage a situation where several companies will be working together at the same time. We need to get to grips with how those costs should be allocated, how one might then refer back on appeal and how one utility might respond if it felt that it had been overcharged. Those are issues to which we need to return.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 107 would confine the level of fees for issuing permits to being no higher than the cost to the highways authority of responding to permit applications, issuing permits and maintaining a register of permits. The Government are already giving careful consideration to all the issues raised by this part of the Bill, which were discussed at considerable length in another place.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para13"></a>The Government undertook to reflect further on the points that were made and to provide more information during the Bill's passage. We expect to do that on Report. I hope that that further information will be given to noble Lords well before Report so that they have plenty of time to consider it.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para14"></a>I also explained that we have asked the group looking at the form and content of the permit regulations to consider permit fee levels. All the points that have been made by noble Lords, including those of the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, will be passed on to the group. I hope that, before Report, I will be able to relieve any anxieties by providing the information that noble Lords require. In the light of those remarks, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="40429-18_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful for the assurance given by the Minister. I make only one plea: the term "well before Report" should not mean only 24 hours before that stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40429-18_para18"></a>Once the powers in Part 3 are brought into force, we will finalise and lay regulations before the House setting out certain standard arrangements for the running of permit schemes and issue guidance to authorities on their operation. It would then be for <P>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>individual authorities, or more than one authority operating together, to submit their proposals for schemes to Ministers for approval. Some authorities may choose to do this very soon after the powers are activated, while others may wait longer.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para19"></a>Assuming that the proposals are approved, authorities would have to ensure that sufficient time is left to allow those likely to be affected by schemes to prepare for their introduction before they could start operation.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para20"></a>As regards England, we will consider how best to monitor the use and effectiveness of these powers so that we can consider whether changes need to be made to the secondary legislation. We have undertaken reviews of lane rental and powers to charge for overrun, neither of which was inspired by a fixed date set out in legislation. We are likely to adopt a similar approach with regard to permit schemes.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para21"></a>I have no difficulty with the idea that we should formally review the operation of permit schemes after a period of time. However, given what I have just said about the stages to be gone through before the scheme starts and the fact that we do not yet know how quickly authorities are likely to take up the new powers, I do not believe that it would be sensible to set a fixed date for review of the primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-18_para22"></a>I hope that, in the light of those comments, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I will certainly think about what the Minister has said in response before coming back on Report, if at all. One of the problems we face in this House is that we concentrate hard on passing legislation, much of which will depend on regulations. At that stage we lose sight of it. Indeed, in its briefing published today the Local Government Association has said that there are problems with the implementation of bus lane enforcement resulting from provisions in the Transport Act 2000. That had escaped my notice, but it immediately made me feel hot under the collar. I become deeply annoyed every time someone zips past me on the left when I am being a good citizen on the right.
<P>

<a name="40429-19_para0"></a>Unless there is a mechanism to draw to our attention the way in which these complicated but nevertheless very important schemes that we care about deeply are working, then it is more than likely that we shall miss the opportunity to hold the Government to account and to encourage them to do better by way of regulations or enforcement. So I should very much like to see a provision in some form. Perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, has a suggestion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. As far as bus lane enforcement is concerned, the problem is that we are still waiting for the regulations to emanate from the department. In a series of Questions for Written Answer my noble friend Lord Bradshaw has been told that they are coming "soon", "imminently", and "shortly". This is a saga that goes back some two years. Having recently raised this question myself during Oral Questions, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, said that they would be dealt <P>


<a name="column_GC139"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with under the auspices of this Bill. So the problem is not one of holding the Government to account; we know that they are accountable. The problem is getting an answer out of them&#151;soon, shortly or imminently.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, is arguing that my amendment is the right one because whether or not the Government have promulgated the regulations and whether or not they have been brought into force is part of what we should be reviewing. I shall certainly think on what the noble Lord has said. He may well hear from me again. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40429-19_para2"></a>Clause 37 [Crown application]:
<P>

<a name="40429-19_para3"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 37 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I oppose the Question whether Clause 37 shall stand part of the Bill so as to try to understand what it means. I understand that the Crown will presumably include the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in relation to the roads in Royal Parks, which we talked about the other day. I suppose the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency also come under the Crown. In fact, everybody who cannot be got at probably comes under the Crown. I became interested in Her Majesty&#151;presumably we are allowed to talk about her because she is on the face of the Bill&#151;in her private capacity, and the Duke of Cornwall.
<P>

<a name="40429-19_para4"></a>I am no great expert on royal matters but I know that the Duke of Cornwall has done a lot of development and had many ideas for villages on the land he owns. Does that mean that because that is in a private capacity, he does not need a permit if he digs up the road and that he will not be fined for it? It certainly means that the Government do need a permit or will be fined. I believe that everybody should be equal. If it is good for somebody to delay traffic by digging up a road to which the public have access, everybody should be treated in the same way. I am sure that my noble friend will put me right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am not sure that I will put my noble friend right because I agree with the sentiment that we are all equal. Having said that, I must say that works carried out by or on behalf of central government will also require a permit from an authority before they can commence. However, works carried out by or on behalf of the Queen in her private capacity, through the Duchy of Lancaster or by the Duke of Cornwall would not require a permit under a scheme. Subsection 2 provides that any offence relating to permit schemes which may be created in regulations would not apply to works carried out by or on behalf of central government. I can see from the expression on my noble friend's face that that does not in any way satisfy him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Astor: </B>   Before the noble Lord replies, I must say that the Minister's answer leaves a lot to be desired. It <P>


<a name="column_GC140"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is difficult to see where Her Majesty is going to conduct street works in a private capacity. Perhaps we are talking about Windsor Great Park, which would be understandable. I understand that aspect of the clause. More importantly, it is entirely perplexing that it includes the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duke of Cornwall. The Minister did not cover that point in his reply. The Duchy of Lancaster is a very large landowner in the north-west of England. Can we have an assurance from the Minister that any works done in the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall are not precluded by Clause 37 of the Bill? If they are not precluded, what does this mean?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for his answer. He was trying hard. There are two issues here. One is the fact that the Crown, as government, must get permits but would not be fined. That is different from the position of local authorities which are, after all, also in the public sector. They need not apply for permits, and they would not be fined. Again, it does not seem right that there should be separate categories of those who would not have to pay fines. We have talked about that before.
<P>

<a name="40429-19_para5"></a>We may have to examine the matter again. The noble Viscount hit the nail on the head: where are Her Majesty the Queen, the Duke of Lancaster&#151;I do not know who the Duke of Lancaster is&#151;and the Duke of Cornwall&#151;I know who he is&#151;likely to do it and on what roads? We cannot let the matter go until we know whether we are talking about somebody's back-door entrance that needs a little tarring, which will not affect anyone, or will we find that half the roads in Lancashire or Cornwall are privately owned by the relevant duke, who will not need a permit? My noble friend might write to me, if he does not want to delay things now. On that basis, I will not oppose the Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Does the Minister wish to reply? He could be a little more explicit. Has he received further information on the clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   No, the noble Lord does not wish to come back to provide more helpful information. It is an interesting topic and I undertake to write to my noble friend Lord Berkeley and the noble Viscount to explain the matter further. I hope that we will not need to return to it on Report.

<a name="40429-19_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 107B will amend Clause 38(4) and make it clear that the first set of regulations underpinning permit schemes would be subject to affirmative rather than negative resolution in Parliament. Amendment No. 108A is consequential on that and simply makes it clear that subsequent sets of permit regulations would remain subject to the negative procedure.
<P>

<a name="40429-19_para13"></a>Having considered representations from various quarters, including the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, the Government have come to the conclusion that affirmative resolution for the first set of permit regulations, those which will lay down the broad framework for operating permit schemes and certain standard provisions relating to all schemes, would be appropriate. Subsequent regulations would then be subject to negative resolution. We believe that that strikes a reasonable balance in allowing for a greater level of parliamentary scrutiny when it matters most.

<P>

<a name="40429-20_para0"></a>The utilities industries were led to believe by the Department for Transport that the increase in fixed penalties would be minimal. However, the level of fines proposed is totally disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence and is likely to lead to an increase in serving notices for revenue generation purposes, <P>


<a name="column_GC142"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>despite Government assurances to the contrary. One might be forgiven for perceiving this as a stealth tax&#151;a tax that will be passed on to the consumer.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para1"></a>Clauses 39 and 40 are of concern for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they appear to be a crude attempt to generate revenue and have little to do with improving congestion. Although fines are legitimate performance incentives in some instances, the levels being proposed are totally disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Furthermore, the nature of the offences will in most cases have no direct impact on traffic congestion. Increasing fines to such levels will encourage over-zealous application by local authorities seeking to increase their revenue. That will not only be reflected in customers' bills, but may adversely impact on congestion and labour shortages if small firms are fined out of existence.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para2"></a>Let us consider fixed penalties associated with incorrect noticing. A typical nationwide utility sends out 1 million notices a year. If that utility achieves 90 per cent accuracy, it would still be subject to the fixed penalty notice for 100,000 notices. If the fixed penalty notice is £750, as proposed by local authorities and the joint fixed penalty regulations working group, the utility would pay £75 million. At £300 the cost would equate to £30 million. Even at £50 per fixed penalty notice, the utility would still pay £5 million per year&#151;a substantial sum in anyone's book. If the utility achieved 99 per cent accuracy, at £750 per notice it would still pay £7.5 million. At £300, it would pay 3 million; at £50 per fixed penalty notice, it would pay half a million pounds. No one can argue that 99 per cent is not exceptional, given the volume of notices and the differing and complex rules of their interpretation.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para3"></a>It is envisaged that fines will be levied based on information from local authorities' computer records. Experience of Section 74 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, which provides for overstay charging, showed that many charges were made as a result of spurious or incorrect records, resulting in time-consuming negotiations before the invoices were ultimately cancelled. Equally, with possible implementation as early as next year, system changes may be rushed and inaccurate data capture is likely while all parties get used to the new administrative arrangements and interpretation of the new legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para4"></a>Again, that will result in many disputes, with utilities being responsible for establishing the cause of failure, which may be due to the local authority or system provider inaccuracies, rather than a utility failure. That will be a time-consuming and costly process for all, involving protracted negotiations and possibly the magistrates' courts, which will distract both local authorities and utilities from addressing the real issue of minimising congestion.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para5"></a>The clauses are in direct contradiction to assurances given to members of the utilities industry by the Department for Transport. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   Briefly, I am unable to oppose the clause standing part. I am slightly mystified by the arguments advanced, which appeared to accept that the whole rationale for the Bill was <P>


<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>essentially the reduction of congestion&#151;in particular, that part of congestion played by unco-ordinated and often difficult street works. However, somehow they suggested that the fines for them need to be a light touch and not painful. If we go down that route, there is no incentive to take place.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para6"></a>So I am slightly mystified. With all due respect to the noble Lord, he seems to want it both ways. He wants a regime that incentivises the proper running of such matters but without the penalties that we all think necessary. We have tried doing it nicely for the past 20 years; the results are evident for everyone to see. It has reached the time when we have to be a bit tougher.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Perhaps it would be helpful if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 110A to 110C, to Schedule 3, because they are designed to achieve similar objectives while keeping the Bill intact. Basically, I tabled them to ensure that the amount of penalty bears some relationship to the congestion caused or the seriousness of the offence.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, cited some pretty horrendous figures, which I suspect are rather higher than would occur in practice. As the noble Baroness said, no doubt there needs to be more incentive for utilities to co-ordinate their work. But there is a great deal of difference between digging up Piccadilly or Whitehall in the middle of the rush hour and failing to spell Acacia Avenue with the right number of "a"s in the application. It was also suggested that people would receive a penalty if they failed to take down the sign on Westminster Bridge about the marathon at the right time.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para8"></a>The penalty must be proportionate, which is why I tabled the amendments. That is an important part of encouraging utilities to work together. When considering the proportionate cost, it is a little sad that the regulatory impact assessment of the cost of utility street work on the economy as a whole is 14 years-old. Many people have tried to estimate the cost of congestion. The CBI's latest figure is £20 million; other people will soon be producing some figures. Those figures can get out of hand. Although the utilities need to sharpen up their act, it will all end up as a cost to the consumer in the end, so it needs to be fair and proportionate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-20_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has spoken to his Amendment No. 110, which is not grouped, it may be convenient if I speak to it now as well. It raises the question of what rights the utilities have to appeal against penalty payments. It would help if the Minister could tell us what rights exist and where they are to be found in the Bill. Is there any possibility of adjudication if there is an appeal? If so, how will that happen and under what clause? Who would adjudicate?
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para9"></a>When we discussed appeal under a previous amendment, the Government&#151;extraordinarily, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, pointed out&#151;had not worked out whether there was to be an appeal to a court or to somewhere else. I should have thought that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>that was a fundamental issue that the department would have considered. So it would be helpful if the Minister could give us an answer to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley: whether there is to be an appeal system and, if so, how it may work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We believe that the existing regime for enforcing offences under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 in relation to utility street works is inadequate and needs to be revisited if we are to ensure that such works are carried out safely, to a high standard and with minimum disruption.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para10"></a>We are therefore adopting two related approaches to address this problem. The first is to address the question of maximum fines for offences. Those were set out in 1991 at level 3 on the standard scale&#151;currently £1,000&#151;for each of the offences under the relevant part of the Act, including offences relating to carrying out unauthorised works, failing to execute works to a high standard and not taking the appropriate safety measures. Authorities have frequently expressed concern to us that existing fines are far too low to provide an adequate deterrent&#151;a point that has been made this afternoon&#151;especially as these are maximum fines, and that, in practice, the fines imposed by the courts are generally lower still. So authorities' legal costs often outweigh the levels of fine available to the courts. On top of this, of course, the passage of time since 1991 has considerably reduced the value of £1,000.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para11"></a>The increases in fines were discussed with a working party of utilities and local authority representatives and the level of increases was broadly agreed with them. Obviously, this is a measure that targets the guilty and not the innocent. Therefore, law-abiding undertakers have nothing to fear.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para12"></a>Moving to Clause 40, as I explained in relation to the previous clause, we are introducing two measures in the Bill to help enforcement of undertakers' works. The second of these is to allow for certain offences under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 to be subject to fixed penalty notices, rather than being dealt with automatically by the courts.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para13"></a>This clause provides that the offences listed in Schedule 2 are the ones for which a fixed penalty notice can be issued. However, by making an order&#151;which would be subject to affirmative resolution&#151;the Secretary of State can remove offences from the list of those for which penalty notices can be issued or, alternatively, one or more of the remaining offences under Part 3 of the 1991 Act can be added to the list.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para14"></a>The offences listed in Schedule 2 which could be subject to penalty notices are generally those relating to the notification of works&#151;for instance, where an undertaker fails to give an authority advance notice of its intention to dig up the street. We do not envisage that it would be right for certain other offences to be subject to a penalty notice regime, most obviously those relating to safety at work. More detailed arrangements governing the rules for issuing fixed penalty notices would need to be set out in regulations, including stating what the authority would need to do with fine income paid and how fines should be paid.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para15"></a>I should like to make one thing very clear&#151;I am repeating what I said to the previous amendment. These measures are not intended as a revenue-raising exercise. On the contrary, they provide a simple and non-bureaucratic way of enforcing the law without necessarily having to involve the courts, a change that has potential benefits for all sides. Only if the undertaker chose not to pay the fine for an offence would the issue need to go to a magistrate's court. The clause allows for quicker resolutions without the two parties incurring significant legal costs and without putting extra pressure on the courts.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para16"></a>Clearly, the fine detail of the penalty notice scheme, to be set out in regulations, would need to be discussed with undertakers, authorities and others to ensure that it was balanced and fair to all sides. I stress that there will be a consultation period; we are talking; and we want a balanced and fair solution. As with the previous clause, the idea of introducing penalty notices was discussed with a working party of utilities and local government representatives, and which offences should be included in such a regime was broadly agreed with the group.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para17"></a>In response to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, the purpose of a fixed penalty system is that it should be easily administered and an efficient way of dealing with offences. I do not think that it would be possible to prescribe in regulations appropriate amounts to suit a variety of circumstances. It would also be difficult to prescribe an amount in accordance with the degree of disruption caused or likely to be caused by the offence. That would not be a simple calculation that could be easily measured in advance of an offence being committed. Giving authorised officers discretion to vary amounts would also make a system more complicated and could lead to imbalances in how offences are dealt with, both within an authority and between different authorities.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para18"></a>The likely outcome of the amendments would be a prolonged negotiation over what the suitable amount for a fixed penalty should be. For the system to be effective, it must be easily understood by those giving and receiving the penalty, with clear amounts set out for offences. I hope that answers the points raised by my noble friend Lord Berkeley and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor.
<P>

<a name="40429-20_para19"></a>On the appeals process, referred to in a question raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, Schedule 3, at line 12 on page 61, sets out, among other things, the provision for utilities to make representations against a fixed penalty notice. Local authorities can withdraw the fixed penalty notice, if they so wish.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-20_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister's answer on the appeal process was a statement of what is in Schedule 3, but it did not address the fundamental issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, in his amendment about an appeal. It is unclear to me what the appeals system is and whether there is a process of arbitration. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, wishes to join in the debate. Clearly, the Committee is striving to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>understand the issue. The noble Lord may be able to help us further today, or perhaps he will have to write to us. We do not seem to have got our minds around how the system will work.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Clearly, I have confused the Committee, for which I apologise. I spoke to Amendment No. 110A, which relates to Schedule 3. My Amendment No. 110 relates to disputes about penalty payments and proposes adjudication. We have talked about adjudication and appeals. With reference to line 12 on page 61, my noble friend spoke about how utilities could appeal. I cannot see such a provision at line 12 on page 61; perhaps I am looking in the wrong place.
<P>

<a name="40429-21_para0"></a>Nevertheless, having confused the Committee completely but having got on to the subject of appeals, perhaps it would be helpful to point out that there needs to be some kind of appeals procedure against fixed penalties. There is for parking, and there should be here. I have put forward one suggestion as to how it would be done, but there are probably many others. Clearly, it needs to be an appeal to a body that is independent of the authority making the penalty. I would be grateful to my noble friend the Minister for his comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am going to confuse the Committee even more, because I gave the wrong reference. The correct reference is page 63, line 6.
<P>

<a name="40429-21_para1"></a>The Bill provides for the utility to make representations to the local authority, which can, if it is persuaded, withdraw the fixed penalty notice. To put it mildly, that may not satisfy Members of the Committee, but that is the arrangement in the Bill at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before my noble friend winds up, I have to say that I do not believe that that satisfies either myself or the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. There seems to be a need for an appeal system, and I hope that the Minister will consider that matter between now and Report. It would save us all an enormous amount of work if his officials came up with an appeal system rather than us trying to draft one. Perhaps that is something that we could discus with the Minister before Report.
<P>

<a name="40429-21_para2"></a>Members of the Committee on all sides of the House feel that an appeal system would be beneficial, not necessarily for the benefit of one side or the other but because it would make the whole process work better. Anything that can encourage sensible, quick arbitration so that costs are kept down and issues are dealt with quickly and easily must be a good idea. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I entirely agree with the noble Viscount. There has to be some appeals mechanism. I know that some local authorities will perform with absolute perfection but, sadly, there will be others that will not. They will give the penalty and, as my noble friend said, clearly it will be fixed at whatever level is deemed appropriate, even if the name of the street is spelt wrong. There needs to be an appeals mechanism <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I would have thought that that was an absolutely gross injustice. As the noble Lord says, such a provision is provided everywhere else, so I am sure that in this case it is an omission. If the Government try to maintain their position at Report, I shall be very rude about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for what he said and shall take his response away to consider it. However, I am most interested in what he has to say about legal costs. It comes as no shock that legal costs can be greater than fines, so that is certainly a concern. People may not appeal because they will think it not worth their while, even if they consider that the fine was unfair.

<a name="40429-21_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: I would simply like to know how the two acts are going to work together. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My amendment is grouped with the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Lucas. They are similar in that they aim to ensure that an authority may not give a direction under this section regarding works for which a permit under Part 3 has already been issued. That is a small simple question, I hope. In fact, it might be a small complicated question, but it is certainly a small question. I look forward to the Minister's answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 111AA relates to the power under Section 56 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 for street authorities to direct an undertaker as to the times at which it can carry out street works. The amendment is intended to have the effect that a street authority should not give an undertaker a direction relating to the timing of one of its works where a permit had already been issued for that works. Amendment No. 111A would have a similar effect except that would apply only in relation to "subsisting" works&#151;that is to say, works which had already started.
<P>

<a name="40429-21_para20"></a>Clause 36(8) of the Bill provides that regulations made by the appropriate national authority may set out provisions that modify or disapply primary and subordinate legislation. Depending upon the exact structure of permit schemes, in the light of the consultation that we discussed earlier and the work of the working group, I would expect it to be necessary for the regulations to set aside certain sections of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 which currently set down how, where and when roadworks can be carried out. That would be necessary to ensure that we do not duplicate controls in certain areas.
<P>

<a name="40429-21_para21"></a>We have asked the working group of utilities and local authorities to consider which existing legislation should be dealt with in that way. Parliament will of course have an opportunity to scrutinise the regulations once they are laid. It may be that the power to make directions under Section 56 is one that we would want to set aside in cases where a permit has been issued, but this is a matter best left for the working group to consider and to report back on, rather than for us to be prescriptive in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40429-21_para22"></a>In the light of my comments, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I should be very grateful if the Minister would give me at least a preliminary view of which bits of legislation it is intended to set aside. I should also be grateful to know under which power in the Bill we shall allow regulations to set aside large parts of other Acts. I had missed that that was something that would be possible under this Bill. If the Minister could answer those questions, I shall be very grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-21_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The clause concerns the street work register. I have a number of general points to raise with the Minister. The street works register came in under the 1991 Act. This clause adds to that register. So that I have got it right, can the Minister say whether the Government regard the current register as being successfully kept and kept up to date? I assume it is open for public inspection so that the records are accessible. Does the clause include access to the Transport for London street works scheme? Does it have a register, or does that come under a separate part of the Bill? I would be grateful for a brief explanation.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The clause concerns the register which street authorities are required to keep containing information on the streets for which they are responsible. At present, registers have to contain, among other things, information on utility street works being carried out on these roads as well as authorities' own road works. The clause will allow the regulations to require that other information must also be kept on the registers, notably about skips and scaffolding which occupy the road and the position of apparatus buried beneath the roads. The clause also clarifies the fact that central registers can be set up containing information on more than one authority area and that the Secretary of State may require authorities to provide information on their streets to the body operating a central register.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para0"></a>Authorities already have a duty to co-ordinate all works that take place on their roads in order to help to reduce the disruption that they cause. Given that, we think it would be sensible to be able to require that other activities that can cause disruption, such as scaffolding from building works that intrudes into the road, should also be included on the register. It would also be sensible to ensure that those operating <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>centralised registers are able to obtain the information that they need, so that their registers are comprehensive. We would, of course, consult extensively with authorities, utilities and others before implementing any such regulations in order to ensure that we were not imposing unreasonable burdens on them.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para1"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked three questions, which I hope to answer. The first was whether these registers have been kept successfully. The answer that I have starts with the word "patchy". Some authorities are much better than others. The Government wish to see standards improved across the board. Secondly, registers are required to be open for inspection at reasonable times. Presumably, "reasonable times" means when the local authority buildings are open. In addition, Transport for London is covered by the same requirements.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will be interested to know that I very much hope that electronic delivery will be possible so that utilities and others can access necessary information from a website 24 hours a day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-22_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. I am always concerned when I hear the approach's success described as patchy, because it implies that accessing information electronically will perhaps be a greater task than one can imagine. If the success of the first approach is patchy, the next one could be very patchy. We shall have to see whether we wish to include a provision in the Bill to encourage local authorities to keep their registers up to date and to see what may be done. I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of the details.

<a name="40429-22_para7"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 111AC to 111AE. The amendments would ensure that records of all unexpected apparatus are held in a central place thus increasing safety. The Bill as currently drafted provides for a utility to be required to record any unexpected apparatus that it finds when excavating the street&#151;that is, unexpected to the utility as opposed to unexpected generally. When they find something that is not in the records and that they did not expect to find, that is important information for local services such as drainage authorities. Local authorities, as road network managers, should be required to keep those records when those excavating the street report such information to them. That could be achieved by regulations made under Section 79 or Section 53 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para8"></a>It seems eminently sensible that any person executing works in the street who happens upon unexpected things under the ground should be asked <P>


<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>to record to it. It also seems sensible that those records should be held in a central place. Indeed, proposed subsection (5) in Clause 46(6) allows for just that.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para9"></a>The Minister in another place, in Standing Committee, commented:
<P>
<br>

<a name="40429-22_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40429-22_para12"></a>To ask utilities to store as well as make records of apparatus that does not belong to them seems not only an inappropriate burden but would require a search of every utility's records of discovered apparatus to determine whether there was any. That does not seem the place for the records to be kept.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para13"></a>It seems sensible and logical for the local authority, as the road network manager, to be required to keep those records. That would not only further the Government's stated intention of balancing the need for record-keeping without unfairly burdening innocent parties, it would also increase safety and accessibility to relevant information for interested parties.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para14"></a>What could be unduly burdensome is a regime that requires undertakers and local authorities to keep those records. It seems sensible that they should be kept in one place. That must be the Government's intention, but it is not clear from the Bill, which is why I move the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The amendments would restrict the duty imposed on undertakers to keep a record of unrecorded apparatus that they find. The amendments would mean that they have only to make the record, not keep it.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para15"></a>Section 80 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 sets out the duties that a person carrying out street works must comply with, where he discovers apparatus belonging to another person that is not recorded or wrongly marked on existing records. It is important that the location of apparatus is accurately recorded. For example, the consequences of hitting a gas main that was unmarked or wrongly marked in existing records could be serious. So, where such apparatus is located, the opportunity needs to be taken to make an accurate record for the future. Even where such apparatus is found, it may not always be possible to identify the owner and so require them to amend their own records so that they are accurate.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para16"></a>Clause 46(4) substitutes a new subsection (2) in Section 80 of the 1991 Act. On reflection, we felt that the original Section 80 placed an unfair burden on the undertaker who accidentally located the apparatus, which is why the section has never been commenced. Clause 46, therefore, provides that, where a person finds unmarked or wrongly marked apparatus that does not belong to him and is unable to ascertain to <P>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whom it belongs after taking reasonable steps to find out, he must comply with requirements set down in regulations.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para17"></a>I shall give an example. A contractor in Scotland examined all the records from other utilities, after his team had hit a fibre optic cable while working. When the police and Army arrived, they discovered that they had hit the line between the White House and the US nuclear base at Holy Loch, which was not, for obvious reasons, marked on the records.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para18"></a>The regulations may prescribe that the undertaker who finds the unrecorded apparatus should make and keep a record of its location. Amendment No. 111AB would restrict that requirement, so that the regulations were able to prescribe only that the undertaker must make a record of the apparatus. Amendment No. 111AC is consequential and would restrict the provision in new subsection (2A)(a), as set out in Clause 46, which allows for regulations to set out the form and manner of records of unrecorded apparatus that is found. The amendment would mean that only the form and manner in which records were made rather than kept could be prescribed.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para19"></a>Amendment No. 111AD would delete the reference in new subsection 2A(c) for regulations to make provision that records of unrecorded apparatus can be included in records kept by undertakers under Section 79(1); that is, records of their own apparatus. Amendment No. 111AE would restrict the provision for regulations to allow for the establishment of one or more registers of information.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para20"></a>The purpose of the amendments appears to be to allow undertakers to avoid having a duty to keep any records of unrecorded apparatus that they find. The implication is that, once they have made a record, they would give it to a street authority, and it would be the authority's duty to keep the record.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para21"></a>As I explained, Clause 46 allows for the exact arrangements covering the finding of such apparatus to be set out in regulations. In deciding what they will be, we will ensure that they do not place an unfair burden on utilities that find apparatus, and the details will be discussed with utilities and authorities before any regulations are made.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para22"></a>It seems sensible that regulations may be made so that a record is kept by the undertaker who finds the apparatus, in the same way that an authority records unexpected apparatus that they might find in the course of their works. It is possible that a central register of unrecorded apparatus will eventually be set up, in which case it is likely that the undertakers would simply have to pass on the record that they have already made. However, given that they already have a duty to keep records of their own apparatus, it is not an unfair requirement to ask undertakers to keep additional records of unrecorded apparatus when they find it. There will be very few such cases, and keeping a record should not prove any more of a burden than making it in the first place. I hope that in the light of my explanation the noble Lords will feel able to withdraw their amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Astor: </B>   There could be an unfair burden here. If a utility discovers something unexpected, I understand that it should report it; there is no disagreement about that. The Minister accepts that the matter should be reported to the local authority. I am sure that when an undertaker is producing the plans of what it has done to a road it will have in its records what it found while digging the road or filling it in.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para23"></a>The Minister talked about a central register, but for the information to be useful it needs to be stored by the local authority; otherwise, how would anyone else find it? Someone would have to trawl the utilities to see whether they have records of anything unexpected. We ought to be somewhat prescriptive and place a duty on the local authority to hold those records so it is the first place anyone goes to conduct a search about what might be there. That is what I am attempting to do; I wish neither to put an unfair burden on the local authority nor to take away any responsibility from the utility. Once things are found, someone must work out where the information will be stored.
<P>

<a name="40429-22_para24"></a>Obviously a central register would be helpful, but, in the meantime, it is important that there is a duty on the local authority to keep these records. We do not want a situation where the local authority has not kept the record properly and someone carries out work in the street at a later date and finds something unexpected which creates a problem that results in delay, congestion and expense. I hope that the Minister understands the principles on which I base my remarks and can give me some comfort that these issues will be dealt with by regulations.

<A NAME="40429-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The Bill does not prevent the duty being placed on the local authority to keep these records. That may well be the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Astor: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister for that helpful reply. The Government need to look at whether there is a clear explanation of the duties of a local authority in this area, either in the Bill or in regulations. It would help local authorities to understand what their responsibilities are and it would be helpful to the utilities. I am grateful for his response and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40429-23_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 111AG. The amendments have been tabled in response to recommendations made to us by the working group of local authorities and undertakers. We asked the group to consider, among other things, what form of secondary legislation we should make in relation to the power in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, as amendment by Clause 49, which allows a highway authority to restrict further works being carried out in a street where they have carried out "substantial" road works.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para7"></a>On the first of these, the authority must notify in advance certain persons&#151;for instance, a person who has apparatus located in that street&#151;of the proposed restriction, so as to give them the chance to carry out any works of their own before the substantial works proceed and the restriction takes effect. The relevant persons must be notified at least three months before the substantial works start. However, having given that more thought, on the working group's recommendation, we believe that there is a strong case for allowing more flexibility to require more than three months advance notice to be given in certain circumstances. Amendment No. 111AF provides, therefore, that the advance notice given must be more than,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such period as may be prescribed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-23_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40429-23_para9"></a>On a related matter, the 1991 Act lists those persons who must be notified of forthcoming restrictions. At present that is limited to a relatively small range of bodies such as bridge, transport and sewer authorities. Again, on the working group's recommendation, we believe that added flexibility would be sensible here to prescribe certain other persons who should be notified&#151;for instance those persons living in, or those persons based in, the street where the restriction is to be introduced, and who might also wish to ask for work to be carried out before the restriction takes effect.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-23_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: The intention of the amendment is simply to tease out the Government's intention with regard to this part of the Bill. If a number of existing utilities are planning ahead and are told that the street will be off-limits, they need to know <P>


<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for what period that will be the case&#151;will it be six months, a year or two years, for example? In that way, they can bring forward plans that they have for particular developments under that road, the work all gets done in a nice and co-ordinated way and the street stays clean and pristine for whatever period the Government intend.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para18"></a>Let us suppose, however, that under that road we have the trunk for one of the new broadband providers, and a major customer half a mile away wants to contract with that provider for the provision of broadband services, which would require a fibre-optic cable to be put in from the trunk to his premises. Is the customer to be told that that cannot be done for two years because the street has just been polished? In that case, presumably, the customer would go off to BT, which has an existing trunk running up the required street. Will special provision be made for the eventuality, because there does not appear to be any arrangement here for anyone to be exempted unless by the good will of the local authority, which may care more for its street than the competitive difference between BT and some other provider in the provision of broadband services? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-23_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The amendment relates to paragraph 5 of the schedule, sub-paragraph (1) of which refers to paragraph 4, which refers to the direction restricting further works. The start of that paragraph gives the local authority power to restrict works in the street. Can the Minister give us some idea of how often that happens? Does it happen now, under the 1991 Act? Is it something that the Government expect to happen often? Is it meant for major trunk roads or can it be for minor roads? Are there any parameters, and will there be guidance on how the legislation is to be used, or will it be done by regulations?
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para19"></a>On the particular point made by my noble friend in his amendment, should there be a restriction? What happens to someone who needs to get connected? Has that happened, and what do they do about it? Is there any process by which they can go along and plead their case, if it is an important matter? I should like a little clarity on the effect of paragraph 5.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 111B would add customer connections, where no reasonable alternative method of carrying them out existed, to the list of types of works which could be carried out in a particular street, even where a highway authority had placed a restriction on any further works being carried out in that street for a period. In fact, paragraph 5(2)(c) of new Schedule 3A already allows regulations to prescribe other types of work that could be carried out during a restriction period. However&#151;and this is the important aspect&#151;we have charged the working group of utilities and local authorities looking at the detailed arrangements for introducing the new powers to consider what exemptions should be allowed for.
<P>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para20"></a>All of us with common sense can work out that, with the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, of the fibre-optic cable, it would be absolutely potty to restrict access to repairing it in order to give back to everyone in the street their access to broadband. So, for instance, the regulations governing the equivalent powers allowing highway authorities to restrict street works after substantial road works set out exemptions for, among other things, urgent works and customer connections which it was not practicable to carry out before the restriction began.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para21"></a>As yet we have not decided what exemptions it would be sensible to allow for in relation to the new power, and I am sure that the House would agree that it is sensible to retain the flexibility for which the Bill provides. The power is likely to apply to major roads only. As I said, the regulations will be able to exempt certain work, and the working group is considering what the exemptions should be. Given that we could all describe what we see as the right sort of exemptions, I am sure that the working group will come up with exemptions that will satisfy Members of the Committee.

<P>

<a name="40429-23_para29"></a>I do not place any particular importance on the drafting of these amendments. I am aiming to provide an illustration of what might be done to provide certainty to a utility or someone else digging holes in the road as to what their liability will be. If a connection is being put in for a customer, the company will want to charge the customer at the time, or ask the customer to bear the cost at the time of the works being done to make the connection. The company will not want to discover, five years down the line, that it suddenly has a bill for several thousand pounds from a local authority that has just decided to resurface the roads and has made a note that the company was party to damaging them.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para30"></a>That is not the sort of basis on which we can ask commercial concerns to operate. We ought to offer certainty, and there is no reason why it should not be a fairly generous certainty in terms of the contributions being made. It should be specified in some way so that a company knows how much a disruption to 100 yards <P>


<a name="column_GC157"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of street will cost it for resurfacing. The payment should be made or provided for on day one, so that the company can charge its customer or bill it to its own expenses, as it chooses. It should not be left with some unspecified liability hanging over it that its auditors will not know how to deal with in the accounts and that might amount to several times what the company expected, several years in the future. We should not impose that on utilities. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-23_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am not sure whether I agree with my noble friend's amendment as regards its effect on Clause 53. However, it raises an important issue that we must consider.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para31"></a>Clauses 53 and 54 give local authorities the opportunity to require utilities to either undertake or pay towards the cost of resurfacing the whole or part of a road, over and above their current statutory requirement to reinstate the area that they have excavated to a required standard. Clauses 53 to 55 provide for local authorities to require utilities to undertake or pay towards the cost of resurfacing some or all of a road at any time in the future. That is over and above their statutory duty to reinstate the area that they have excavated to the required standard.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para32"></a>Giving local authorities the ability to require utilities to carry out such works either immediately after they have undertaken the works or at any time in the future&#151;that is the important aspect&#151;could have a detrimental effect on utilities' operational planning and effectiveness. They will not know when or where they will be required to undertake such works.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para33"></a>Alternatively, local authorities can ask for a contribution at any time to the cost of full or half-width reinstatement undertaken by the authority itself, another utility or a contractor. The complexity of those costs and of calculating what each utility and the local authority might contribute could make the proposals unworkable, as there are so many variables&#151;for example, the current state of the road, its composition and the surrounding ground conditions; the type and number of vehicular movements on the road, whether cars or heavy lorries; the number, type and scale of excavations; and at what point the decision is triggered to resurface the road.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para34"></a>Such requirements will introduce regulatory and balance-sheet uncertainty, as utilities will be unable to assess when such costs may be due and how much they might be. They may have to add sums to their balance sheet without really understanding what their liabilities might be.
<P>

<a name="40429-23_para35"></a>There is a perception that these requirements could allow local authorities to get their roads resurfaced on the cheap at the expense of utilities. Resurfacing a larger proportion of the road than necessary will require lengthier and greater occupation of the road, causing more congestion not less. Of course we consider that a utility should be required to undertake to repair a road to the state in which it found it. But it is important that the local authority can use the requirement of reinstatement to put an unfair burden <P>


<a name="column_GC158"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on utilities, as ultimately those costs will be passed on to the consumer. That is why I support the thrust of my noble friend's amendment.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   The noble Lords who spoke gave good arguments about the difficulties involved. However, when water, gas, electricity and telecom apparatus runs along the same road, it will need to be resurfaced each time it is dug up. When local authorities come to carry out such works, drainage is the responsibility of the drainage authority but it is the local authority that installs gullies. I do not know where the difference lies, because gullies are usually installed at the highest point of the road so that there is a good flood. When the utilities reinstate a road after digging a hole, the result is usually a nice hump, causing yet further holes.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para0"></a>There is a minefield of problems. I hope that my noble friend has some solutions or that the working parties will produce one, because I envisage endless legal actions between different authorities and not much work being done on the ground. I hope that I am wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am sure that we all know situations where a street has been dug up over several years by a succession of undertakers and as a result looks very unsightly. My noble friend Lord Berkeley has given us a very graphic picture of such roads. As well as the visual effect, even if individual works are carried out well, such a succession of works can adversely affect the longevity of the road structure, especially with the increased risk of water getting into the foundations.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para1"></a>Furthermore, a series of trenches can lead to a very uneven road surface, which makes it uncomfortable, and possibly even dangerous, for cyclists and motorcyclists. As we have heard, several Members of the Committee are keen to ensure that the interests of road users on two wheels are kept in mind. I remember in particular my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham, who is not with us today. In such circumstances it is only right that those who have caused such effects should contribute towards the cost of rectifying them. Clause 53, along with Clauses 54 and 55, provides powers to achieve that.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para2"></a>The circumstances in which a street authority will be able to require an undertaker to resurface all or part of a street will be prescribed in regulations. We do not intend that that will be widespread but that it will be used where problems are serious. To be covered by this requirement, such an undertaker would have to have carried out works within a period that may be prescribed in regulations, to be currently carrying out works, or to have given notice that it intends to carry out works.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 111C to 111E would fundamentally change that position. In particular, Amendment 111D would exclude undertakers who had previously carried out works in the street in question and those currently carrying out works. That is not fair either to the undertakers who are covered or to the authority, which would have to pick up much more of the cost of resurfacing.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para4"></a>Amendments 111C and 111E would also give the undertakers the option of paying a contribution, to be prescribed, towards future resurfacing. That does not fit <P>


<a name="column_GC159"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the purpose of the clauses. The trigger for resurfacing will be that there is a problem now. It is not provision for future resurfacing that is needed but resurfacing now or when the current or planned works are finished. Clause 54 already provides for circumstances to be prescribed when an undertaker can decide not to do the resurfacing itself but instead pay a sum of money to the authority. Thus the principle of choice behind the amendment is already in the Bill but in the context of an imminent need to resurface rather than some future need.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para5"></a>I hope that, with that explanation, and with the reassurance that the regulations and guidance will be the subject of discussions and consultation with utilities and authorities, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendments.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para6"></a>I wish to respond to at least two of the questions raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I was asked about the uncertainty of some utilities and companies about whether they might incur costs some years later. It is right that utilities that damage the road should contribute to its resurfacing. We do not intend that that power will be invoked frequently, so the costs should not be unreasonable. It is not a means for local authorities to do their resurfacing on the cheap, if that thought occurred to any Members of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para7"></a>In response to the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that utilities may have to carry a liability on their balance sheet for many years, regulations can limit how long a utility can be liable to pay a contribution for a particular works&#151;for example, they cannot be asked to pay more than five years after the works took place.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para8"></a>I hope that in the light of those explanations the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-24_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws his amendment, may I say to the Minister that his response was helpful in principle but it concerns me that areas here will cause us difficulty. At one point he gave me great comfort when he said that resurfacing would be a requirement given at the beginning of the process or while the utility is doing the work. When he finished he then said that regulations may prescribe that it might be five years before it has to be done. The important point is when they will know. It is crucial to the utilities that, if they are expected to do a resurfacing, whether in one year, three years or whatever, they know when they are doing the original work that they will have to do it. It does not seem to be right that the utility could do the work, think that it had done it satisfactorily&#151;there would be no reason for it to assume that it had not&#151;and then someone comes along later and says that the road must be resurfaced. That is the point. I do not think that the Government intend this. I hope that the regulations will be able to deal with that point and that the Minister will be able to give me some comfort on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I hope that I can reassure the noble Viscount that the local authority will know that the road needs to be resurfaced only <P>


<a name="column_GC160"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when the conditions I described earlier are triggered. That is the first point. The second point is that this will be prescribed in regulations and it will be fair. It will not happen that a local authority will say to a utility, "Resurface this road because it is unsightly and you were working on it 10 years ago". I hope that when the draft regulations are available the noble Viscount will be reassured on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I hope that we will see these draft regulations before Report because the Minister said very little that I found comforting. As the Minister describes it, the situation is that at some point a road will clearly need resurfacing, at which point, under rather unspecified circumstances, it may be decided that utilities should bear a share. I would like some clarity, even an outline, of the Government's thinking on the circumstances in which a road will trigger this charge-back on utilities that have previously worked on the road. The Minister said a limit of five years. Is that what it will be? That would be helpful. He said that it will not be many roads. What will the main restrictions be? I do not require this answer today but I would like it in writing before Report because it will be a problem. Imagine if the Mayor of London were to operate congestion charging in this way: he would put cameras up around London and in five years' time he would say, "I am going to resurface Oxford Street. Any car using Oxford Street will pay me £5 for every time it has used it in the past five years". People would not be pleased suddenly to discover that they have a bill for £10,000 because they had been up and down Oxford Street and had not realised when they did it that it would require resurfacing.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para9"></a>There must be some certainty in these matters. A utility that does something to the road must know that it is likely to have to provide part of the cost of resurfacing it or that it is unlikely. The cost of resurfacing a road, even a fifth share, if that is what it turns out to be, may be several times the cost of the installation that the utility made to a customer's premises. These are very large sums of money that could entirely alter the commerciality of a particular connection. It would be extremely hard to get it back from the customer and will be extremely hard to provide for properly on balance sheets. Unless there is a very clear limitation, this could cumulatively have a significant effect on the viability of a commercial concern. All companies do not have balance sheets like BT. We must have more certainty on this before we come to Report. I hope that the Minister will be able to write to me.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-24_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak to Amendment No. 111F briefly. I believe that the resurfacing regulations must include the need to ensure that road markings and surface materials are replaced at least on a "like-for-like" basis, so that bus lanes, cycle lanes, cycle tracks and so forth should be reinstated. Road markings and surface materials are usually part of the legal requirements and signs on a road that give confidence to cyclists, motorcyclists, road users and pedestrians. I believe that if they are not there, that would be highly dangerous.
<P>

<a name="40429-24_para16"></a>There is slight worry that, with an incentive to carry out street works more quickly in order to reduce congestion for cars or motorbikes, corners might be cut. This is just a suggestion that the regulations should specify that suitable road markings and surface materials are put down quickly after the work is completed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 111F would write into the Bill a requirement that the regulations may in particular specify that all road markings and surfacing materials for bus and cycle facilities should be reinstated like-for-like when the resurfacing powers are invoked.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para0"></a>I can understand that the noble Lord wishes to ensure that where specific provision has been made for buses or cyclists, that is not lost when resurfacing is carried out under the new powers in Clauses 53 to 55 of the Bill. I am entirely in agreement with that intent.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para1"></a>As with existing requirements under the New Roads and Street Works Act for the reinstatement of utilities excavations, the intention is that there should normally be like-for-like resurfacing. That would include any special surface treatments and the replacement of road markings. That would apply to pedestrian crossings, to road markings generally and not just to those associated with bus and cycle facilities. To single out buses and cycles in the Bill would therefore be inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para2"></a>The regulations and guidance will of course be subject to discussion and consultation with all the interested parties. Bus and cycle interests will be able to have their say. I hope therefore that with that reassurance the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I am not terribly reassured. As a member of a local authority and someone who works with a number of others, it is often the case that utilities do not replace the white lines, nor do they replace or render completely usable surfaces that have been put in at significant public cost. This brings to mind the point <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who is no longer in his place. He spoke about the reasonable costs for reinstating roads and who should pay. Put simply, when reinstatement has to be done, someone has to pay for it. Therefore, the debate is whether it is fairer for the wider public purse to pay for it through council tax or whether the individual customer should pay via utility bills.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that intervention. I am partly comforted by what my noble friend said. I would refer him&#151;as I will many more times&#151;to this lovely book called, The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, which gives all the pictures. Noble Lords can obtain it from the Printed Paper Office if they want some bedtime reading. The key is that it has got colours, all the rules and both road markings and traffic signs. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness that these should be reinstated on a like-for-like basis. With those comments, I shall read carefully what my noble friend has said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) Guidance under this section shall provide for the funding of inspections by fees and permits to defray costs."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-25_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: I do not think that we have touched on this issue, but I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to it. In fixing fees and permits, I should like the Government to have regard to the costs to local authorities of issuing these permits, but, more particularly, the costs that would be necessary to carry out the inspections required under the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para9"></a>Currently, local authorities have few, generally badly paid people to inspect roadworks. They have a duty to inspect all roadworks, report any defects and have them made good. However, the people who go around and inspect utility works are very lowly paid officials. As such, those officials would be open to bribery. They are people who are paid very little money in the hierarchy of local government.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para10"></a>I am sure that all Members of the Committee have heard about people who look after building control and the enforcement of planning regulations and the little amount of that that is done. They may have heard how people have often said, "He must know someone who is a building inspector or a planning inspector. They must be in his pocket rather than the local authority's pocket".
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para11"></a>It is important that when we have a perfect system of inspecting street works, the people responsible for carrying out those regulations are properly informed about what is going on. They should not find out what is going on so long after the event that it does not matter. Inspectorates should be staffed by people who are adequately paid and motivated to do the job properly. In a moment, I shall turn to the issue of the people who enforce environmental controls.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para12"></a>The fines that are levied on people whose vehicles flout the omissions controls are so low that local authorities cannot afford to enforce the regulations. They cannot afford to pay the environmental health officers whose job it is to enforce the regulations, and the Government give no help. The same will apply to the people whose job it will be to inspect street works, unless they are adequately trained and adequately paid. I hope that the Minister can give us some comfort on this matter. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am a bit perplexed by this amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. He said that the inspectors should be adequately paid. Presumably, they would be part of the pay scheme within a local authority budget and standard. It seems to me that the matter should be dealt with on that basis. In Amendment No. 112 the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall provide for the funding of inspections by fees and permits"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-25_para13"></a>
also confuse me. It is difficult to know who will pay that and on what basis. I am a little confused about whether this will be an additional cost to the permit. Presumably, under the permit scheme that we discussed in earlier amendments, all local authorities will be able to charge reasonable and appropriate costs. It may be that I have not clearly understood the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, but I am a little confused. No doubt the Minister will probably have an explanation that will give us a third alternative when looking at this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   If I may assist the noble Viscount, the point here is that when the Government are setting the scale of charges and fees, we hope that they will take into account that part of the costs incurred by local authorities will be inspection of the reinstatement. If that is not taken into account, local authorities will simply not be able to afford to perform the inspection. In that case, much of this part of the Bill will be rendered useless.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para14"></a>That has happened with other elements of government policy, especially, as we heard from my noble friend, with regard to emissions testing. Because they are cash-strapped, authorities have a choice between doing a particular piece of work or doing something else. They would rather that did not happen with inspection of reinstated roads.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   As we have heard, the amendment would extend the power of the Secretary of State to make guidance for street authorities dealing with inspection of an undertaker's work. It would allow the guidance to provide that the inspections are funded by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fees and permits to defray costs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-25_para15"></a>
Section 75 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 sets out certain rules covering inspection by highway authorities of individual street works. Those inspections are carried out to ensure that they meet the relevant national standards, such as quality and reinstatement.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para16"></a>Section 75 also provides that:
<P>


<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An undertaker executing street works shall, subject to the provisions of any scheme under this section, pay to the street authority the prescribed fee in respect of each inspection of the works carried out by the authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40429-25_para17"></a>
The amendment is therefore unnecessary, as there is already provision to cover the funding of inspection of utilities works through a scheme set under regulations. Regulations made under Section 75 of the 1991 Act already provide that a street authority can inspect up to 30 per cent of utilities' works and charge a fee of £21. They can inspect more than 30 per cent, but cannot charge a fee, although they can recover their costs from an undertaker if a reinstatement defect is found.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para18"></a>Clause 36(5) allows for the level of permit fees to be set out in regulations. We have asked the working group, made up of representatives of utilities and local authorities, to consider whether those applying for a permit would need to pay a fee and, if so, at what level the fee should be set. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, raised the spectre of bribery and corruption. We will draw the committee's attention to his point through Hansard, so that it can form part of the working group's considerations.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para19"></a>The group will be considering whether part of the fee should cover the costs of ensuring that conditions of a permit are complied with. However, that will be a separate matter from ensuring that works are carried out according to national standards. There are already provisions to deal with the funding of such inspections. I hope that, in the light of my comments, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that reply. However, I am pretty dissatisfied with it. He reiterated that the fee is £21. If someone is pretty conscientious and goes round by car to perform, say, 10 inspections a day and fills in the necessary forms, the fee will not even pay his wages for the day. What local authority can be expected to take on extra people, whose wages they cannot pay? Highway inspectors are the lowest in the hierarchy, yet we still cannot afford to pay their wages.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para20"></a>That new sort of money&#151;£21&#151;does not constitute a reasonable amount. If you call out the gas man, or someone of that sort, someone to do a bit of plumbing, or something, he will charge at least £60 to come to your house, let alone to do any work.
<P>

<a name="40429-25_para21"></a>I would press the Minister very hard that fee levels should be adequate and should bear some comparison with the fee levels charged by other people who are called out to inspect other work. I do not expect profits to be made; I simply expect a reasonable sum of money to be raised so that local authorities can afford to pay people decent wages to do a decent job.

<A NAME="40429-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, it may be helpful to him, when he argues that the £21 fee is too low, to know that that figure is based on a recent study and represents the average actual cost of an inspection.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-26_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: We now turn to Part 5, which covers strategic roads in London and the initial designation by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para5"></a>I am anxious that in London&#151;this issue has been raised before&#151;we ensure that the Secretary of State sets out guidance to ensure that we know which roads form the strategic road network. We have referred several times today to forthcoming guidance. As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, has said several times and has been reiterated by other Members of the Committee, it is difficult to guess what will be in the guidance when it comes. In many cases, it will arrive some time after the Bill is published.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para6"></a>It is most important that the Secretary of State himself publishes guidance. In future amendments, we will turn to the issue of whether the Mayor of London, because he presides over a number of borough highway authorities, will be able to issue guidance in turn to those authorities, so that there is a hierarchy of guidance and some coherence of control over the strategic road network. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, on Amendments Nos. 113 and 114. As he said, the aim is to gain further clarification of the criteria that will be used to determine whether roads should be designated as strategic roads and, most importantly, the relationship between Transport for London and local authorities on the strategic issue.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para7"></a>We are grateful for having been given yesterday a briefing on the development of strategic roads in London. As I understand it&#151;I have probably got it wrong, because I am not very good at these things&#151;a steering group has been established to advise the Minister but, as yet, it has not considered the definition and/or the criteria for strategic roads.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para8"></a>As I also understand it, a consultation exercise is to take place after the mayoral elections in June that will last for another 12 weeks. I am bemused that the steering group has yet to consider the specific criteria, but must do so in the next four to six weeks and report back to the Minister. Maybe that is what they are doing, which is great news for us all because then the Minister can then come back to tell us what are the criteria. Can the Minister enlighten us on where the steering group is? Maybe it has moved on since yesterday and is about to consider the specific criteria, because I also understand that it now has the information that it needs to do that. If so, when will it be able to issue the guidance on the criteria to the Minister? Is my understanding of the timetable correct? Notwithstanding that, can the Minister also <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>answer the second point, to which I alluded earlier, concerning the relationship between Transport for London and local authorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   Briefly, I support the amendments. It is important that there are clear criteria. If there are no criteria, selection of the roads would appear to be arbitrary. The criteria must be sufficiently broadly defined so that the unique nature of London's roads, which we discussed in Committee on Tuesday, is properly recognised and so that the purpose of strategic roads can be implemented to the full.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I also support the amendments. I have one question for my noble friend. Presumably, a strategic road is also a street. As we have been talking about traffic, which includes cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians, strategic cycle routes could also be included in that network. TfL has produced an interesting and useful book on the strategic cycle network for London. I should be interested in hearing my noble friend's views on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Before I speak to the amendment, I reiterate that there is a briefing paper on the table on the development of strategic roads in London which has been provided to assist the Committee in its consideration of Clauses 57 to 60.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para9"></a>Amendment No. 113 amends Clause 57 so that before the Secretary of State uses his power to designate certain roads in London as strategic, he first issues guidance on the criteria for designating a road as such. Similarly, Amendment No. 114 amends Clause 58 so that the Greater London Authority must issue guidance on the criteria before designating a road as strategic. It is not intended that guidance will be issued on the initial designation of which roads will be strategic as the question of what will be considered strategic will be covered in the consultation document to be published prior to the Secretary of State exercising the power.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, mentioned that consultation, which is now taking place. Comments received will be taken into account before the Secretary of State makes his final decision on which roads should become strategic under Clause 57. The steering group has met twice already; the third meeting, which will be held shortly, will define a network. After June, when the work on that is finished, we will consult&#151;not necessarily immediately after the election, but shortly after.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   Can the Minister tell us when the criteria will be published? I understand that the consultation will be conducted in June, so obviously the criteria must be set by then.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   As I believe I said, there is no intention to publish criteria separately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   It would help enormously if we could understand what are the criteria. I think that that is what the noble Lord is asking for and it is <P>


<a name="column_GC167"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important that we should see them. Is there no chance of the Minister writing to us later with the criteria, in the light of our discussion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The consultation will provide a list of possible routes and will seek views on those roads. Given the way the process is going, it will go out to consultation on the routes. A decision will then be made by the Secretary of State in the light of the feedback he gets from that consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-26_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I think he now fully understands where we are coming from, and the fact that there is a need for this guidance. Since speaking earlier, I have obtained the paper issued yesterday, of which I was not aware. We await the publication of the guidance. I hesitate to repeat the word "shortly" because it has very unfortunate connotations. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>of the Bill and I feel that it is only fair, in following good governance, transparency and accountability, that Transport for London should have to publish the grounds on which it withholds consent.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para21"></a>As drafted, the Bill only requires the borough to notify Transport for London or a neighbouring borough of any works it is planning. That may affect strategic roads. Given that the provisions of the Bill seek to reduce congestion through the more effective planning of works, it seems sensible to place a similar requirement on Transport for London to notify the borough of any works it is planning to undertake on the Transport for London road network that may affect the new strategic road network. This would help to ensure that boroughs could undertake advance planning to overcome any traffic displacement resulting from Transport for London's own planned works.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para22"></a>There have been examples of situations where severe congestion has been caused on borough roads as a result of works on the Transport for London road network. One such example occurred in 2000 following the closure of two lanes on the A2 to allow works on a railway bridge at New Cross Gate. Those works were not preceded by any warning to the local authorities concerned. They caused severe congestion on the surrounding road network.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para23"></a>In light of the arguments for good governance, transparency, accountability and practicality, I support these amendments.

<A NAME="40429-26_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I rise only because of the last remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. He referred to the case of the closure of lanes on the A2 at New Cross Gate. The matter was set out in the Association of London Government briefing which has been sent to a number of noble Lords. Unfortunately, it is very wide of the mark. I have been informed that Transport for London was told on 21 March 2001 that they had received notification from Railtrack that the New Cross Gate bridge had a zero-weight loading on the two outside traffic lanes. Someone from Transport for London briefed the head of Lewisham Transportation on 18 April 2001. Traffic counts were carried out by Lewisham Council, letters were sent out to local MPs, ward members, Lewisham officers and 5,000 residents in the same month. Some 30 advance warning signs were erected and a Lewisham Direct team was then appointed as a contractor by Transport for London to install barrier restrictions on the bridge.
<P>

<a name="40429-26_para24"></a>It is a pity that the ALG is putting out information that is quite clearly wrong and misleading. I am afraid that I oppose these amendments on the basis that they are far too restrictive. They would make it impossible for the concept of the strategic network to function properly.

<A NAME="40429-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   These amendments seek to amend Clauses 59 and 60 respectively so that the GLA must issue the criteria that it will use when withholding consent for a borough to carry out works <P>


<a name="column_GC169"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on strategic roads. Transport for London can already prevent borough works which may affect GLA roads taking place under Section 301A of the Highways Act 1980 and Section 121B of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Under these Acts, criteria describing when TfL might prevent works taking place are not required and so it would be inconsistent with these existing powers to produce criteria for TfL to prevent works on strategic roads.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para0"></a>Amendment No. 117 inserts a new clause that intends that where TfL is carrying out works that may affect strategic roads, they should first inform the borough responsible for that strategic road. This amendment aims to achieve what is already covered by Section 59 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 where a street authority has a duty to co-ordinate with other street authorities where works in a street for which one authority is responsible affects streets for which other authorities are responsible.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para1"></a>I hope that, with this explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(c) make transitional provision."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-27_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of Amendments No. 117ZA, 117ZB, 117ZC and 128A is to deal with certain Highways Act 1980 offences which can become fixed penalty&#151;FPN&#151;offences under the Bill that are also covered under the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para9"></a>Clause 61 inserts new Section 314A into the Highways Act, which allows for certain criminal offences under the Act to be subject to fixed penalty notices rather than automatic criminal prosecution. Schedule 5 of the Bill inserts new Schedule 22A into the Highways Act, which lists the offences that can be subject to FPNs. Some of those offences relate to skips and scaffolding on the highway and can also become FPN offences under Schedule 4 of the London Act.
<P>


<a name="column_GC170"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para10"></a>The relevant overlap offences, as listed in new Schedule 22A, refer to the following sections of the Highways Act: Section 139(3), which concerns offences relating to the depositing of a skip on the highway without permission; Section 139(4), which refers to offences relating to failing to light or mark a skip or not removing it as soon as practicable once it is filled, or not complying with any conditions attached to placing it in the street; and Section 169(5) which refers to offences relating to obstruction caused by the placing of scaffolding or similar structures on the highway.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para11"></a>The Secretary of State has recently approved an application from the ALG that in London a number of FPN offences will be subject to a penalty of £100. That includes the overlap offences relating to skips and scaffolding. However, the Bill allows us to impose maximum penalty amounts of up to £300 for the skip offences and £1,500 for the scaffolding ones. A working group will be looking at appropriate amounts for the penalty, and we shall also be liasing with the Home Office and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. Setting the limits that high was intended to give us maximum flexibility, rather than as a statement of intent. However, the overlap presents a possible conflict of having two separate regimes for the same offences. Also there is the potential for the amounts of the overlap penalties in London to fall below those set outside London. The amendments give us flexibility to allow for different solutions to the possible conflict.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para12"></a>Amendment No. 117ZA inserts a new subsection into new Section 314A of the Highways Act. It allows regulations to make provision in London different to that in the rest of England. That could mean that we introduced FPNs under the Bill only outside London and left the London system in operation. In effect, there would be two separate systems for the overlap FPNs. The amendment also allows that if regulations brought into effect FPNs under the Bill they could disapply the overlap London FPNs. In effect, that would replace them with FPNs under the Bill. Transitional provisions could be made to deal with any changes from one FPN system to another.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para13"></a>Amendment No. 117ZB inserts a new subsection into Clause 61, which in turn inserts a new subsection into the London Act. This will give the Secretary of State a reserve power under that Act to make regulations to increase the rate of the overlap FPNs in London. It would be possible to make regulations as described above that could then apply the Bill's FPNs just outside London. Once such an increase had been made, it would not be possible for the London boroughs or Transport for London to set lower amounts for the penalties.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para14"></a>Schedule 6 allows for regulations which provide further details of the FPNs under the Bill. Amendment No. 117ZC provides for regulations to make different provision for different areas. That could be used, for example, to set a higher amount for the penalties in London compared to elsewhere. Amendment No. 128A amends a typographical error in Schedule 12 of the Bill <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>which repeals the financial provisions in the 2003 Act as far as they apply to the provisions relating to fixed penalty notices. It was not the intention to repeal these provisions.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para15"></a>The amendments give us flexibility to address the possible conflicts that I have outlined. They are intended as reasonable safeguards which can be used depending on the proposed amounts for the overlap offences. As well as liasing with other government departments, we would consult ALG and TFL before implementing any solutions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor: </B>   I thank the Minister for such a detailed and comprehensive explanation of his amendments. I struggled to keep up with it and I look forward to reading Hansard. However, since in the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, he has shown such extraordinary ability this afternoon in dealing with the complexities of this clause and his amendments, I am sure that he will not mind if I ask him a couple of questions.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para16"></a>The Minister explained that the amendments deal with Highways Act offences that can become fixed penalty offences under the Bill, and which are also covered under the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003. They relate to skips and scaffolding on the highway. The overlap of the Bill and the Act presents the problem of two separate regimes for the same offence. There is also a potential for the overlap to allow the levels of fixed penalty notices for London to fall below those set elsewhere. The Minister explained that the Bill allows the Government to impose a maximum fixed penalty of up to £300. But, if I heard him correctly, he said that this is for skip offences and that it is the intention of the Government to limit it to £100. I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong. He said that there would be a maximum fine of £1,500 for scaffolding offences and explained that these are set as maximums to provide flexibility rather than as a statement of intent. I am surprised. Penalties are normally fixed by regulations rather than in a Bill. If the Government ever want to amend them, whether up or down, as they may well do, they could do so by regulation rather than in primary legislation. I wonder whether the Minister has considered that. Can he tell us whether the Government have consulted on this issue and whether they have done any form of cost-benefit analysis on whether those using or responsible for skips could afford such fines? If they have not, will there be consultation, and under what criteria?
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para17"></a>As the Minister said, the amendments give the Government the flexibility to allow for different solutions to the problem of overlap, so that they can disapply the overlap and replace it with one in this Bill or raise the level of London notices and apply the notices in this Bill only outside London. I am somewhat nervous of leaving this issue unresolved and to be dealt with by regulation. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that there will be a full consultation before implementing any of these solutions. It is important that we have an assurance that there will be full consultation with those involved <P>


<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>before the Government use this flexibility to deal with the overlap. He gave me to understand that, but he will appreciate that his explanation of the amendments was somewhat lengthy. It would be helpful if he could deal with those few points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I shall deal first with the question of consultation. As well as liaising with other government departments, we will consult with the ALG and TfL before implementing any of the solutions, although I gather that the consultation will be much wider than that. I can assure the noble Viscount that consultation is the order of the day. In addition, there will be a regulatory impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para18"></a>I will write on the other matters. On the particular point made by the noble Viscount, I do not think I said that the Secretary of State has recently approved an application from the ALG that in London a number of FPN offences should be subject to fines of £100, with fines of £300 for skip offences and £1,500 for scaffolding ones.
<P>

<a name="40429-27_para19"></a>I went on to say&#151;and this is where the confusion starts and ends&#151;that a working group should be looking into appropriate levels of penalty. We shall liaise with the Home Office on that. It is my understanding that this is an interim arrangement made by the Secretary of State after an application from the ALG and may be modified when the working group produces a solution. However, if that is an incorrect or inaccurate answer, I shall write to the noble Viscount.

<a name="40429-28_para13"></a>Amendments Nos. 117ZD and 117ZE remove an ambiguity in the language of the provision made under the Bill for two different charging regimes: one to charge the owners of skips where the period they occupy the road exceeds an agreed period; and a second to charge them for the entire period that the skip occupies the road. This applies to the power for regulations to prescribe different charges according to different circumstances&#151;such as what proportion of the road the skip occupies, and provides that this applies consistently to both charging schemes.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 117ZF and 117ZG simply remove an inconsistency in the language of the provision relating to charges imposed where the period for which scaffolding, building materials or temporary minor excavations occupy the road for longer than an agreed period by inserting the terms "relevant period" and "relevant structure" which are used elsewhere in the clause.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40429-28_para31"></a>The noble Lord said: We have moved on to Part 6 dealing with civil enforcement. In moving Amendment No. 117A, for the convenience of the Committee I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 118A and 118B.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para32"></a>Subsection (2) lists four categories of road traffic contraventions subject to civil enforcement. They cover various kinds of parking, bus lanes, London lorry lane bans and moving traffic contraventions set out in Schedule 7. Bus lanes are specifically identified, but no reference is made to cycle facilities. During the various Commons debates on Schedule 7, an assurance was given that this provision would cover some cycle lane and cycle track contraventions. Since then, however, more detailed investigations have revealed various anomalies in cycle and other facilities.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para33"></a>For example, parking on cycle tracks would be subject to decriminalised enforcement, but not parking on segregated cycle lanes. Drivers stopping within the limits of zebra, pelican and puffin crossings would face penalty notices, but not for stopping on toucan, single-cycle or pedestrian crossings. Driving a moped&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, will tell us exactly what kind of vehicle that is&#151;through an alleyway with a "no motor vehicles" sign would attract a penalty notice, but not if it was signed with a shared separated pedestrian and cycle route. Moreover, drivers proceeding the wrong way along a one-way street with a cycle contraflow lane could not face a penalty notice for the one-way traffic scheme enforcement. I could cite several more instances.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para34"></a>The amendments seek to bring cycling provision contravenions up to the same level as contraventions in bus lanes. I hope that my noble friend will agree that it is just as important to ensure that fixed penalties can be issued to people contravening rules ensuring the safety of cyclists as they can for those which prevent bus delays.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para35"></a>The amendments cover the detail in a new Part 2A in Schedule 7. However, I have not been able to reproduce with my amendments copies of all the <P>


<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>coloured signs for reference. I will be able to do so upstairs if I can locate a colour photocopier. But the signage is listed in the amendments and is reasonably self-explanatory. With that short explanation, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-28_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I support sympathetic policing; that is where I am coming from. Cyclists are very important, and I could not agree more with the noble Lord that drivers should be policed on parking in areas where their vehicles can cause serious problems to a cyclist; for example, on a bicycle way. As a bicyclist and a motorcyclist I know that cyclists receive considerable goodwill from cars. It would worry me considerably if cars and the like were persecuted in a draconian way that set them against cyclists. I therefore suggest that any such provisions should be sympathetic.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para36"></a>Bicyclists do a very good job at jumping red lights and abusing other road regulations. Is the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, suggesting that policing should go both ways? If bicyclists have these great privileges, should they not go with balanced policing of their responsibilities? I am not sure whether the noble Lord is opening a can of worms that could backfire on bicyclists. I support the noble Lord in principle but raise a flag of caution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-28_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   Diagrams 1043 and 1044 in the Statutory Instrument show the box-junction markings. At Second Reading, I expressed suspicion that the markings shown do not cover roundabouts, which would mean that civil enforcement could not take place on roundabouts. I am not certain whether that is right, but if they can be part of it, the table could of course be used.

<P>

<A NAME="40429-28_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I agree entirely with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. Cyclists should not be above the law. They should obey traffic lights and comply with other road signals. If a way can be found to penalise them with a fixed penalty, that would be entirely fair. Similarly, however, one must respect the fact that motorcyclists, cyclists and moped riders are more vulnerable on the outside than cars. The green boxes or advance stop signs at traffic lights have been very successful. They are used illegally by motorcyclists also, but I would not object to that, because at least the motorist sees people.
<P>

<a name="40429-28_para37"></a>I tabled the amendments to open a discussion. I would be very pleased if I could have a discussion with my noble friend before Report, as I have probably got some of the numbers or letters wrong. In addition, noble Lords may have other ideas to contribute. It is important to recognise and to clarify, if necessary, some of the anomalies that I mentioned.

<A NAME="40429-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   There are two documents available to noble Lords. One is headed "Civil Enforcement of Traffic Offences (Completely New Enforcement Powers Provided in the Bill Are Highlighted)". The document, which will be handed out, outlines the new offences. We then have the pictures, referred to by my noble friend Lord Berkeley, of traffic signs subject to civil enforcement under Part 4 of Schedule 7. The documents are now available for all Members of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para1"></a>I start by dealing with the point raised by my noble friend Lord Simon. He said that box junctions did not cover roundabouts. The traffic sign regulations explicitly acknowledge that box junctions can be used at roundabouts. I hope that that satisfies my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para2"></a>The overall purpose of the amendment is to make driving in a cycle lane or on a cycle track an offence subject to civil enforcement. Parking in cycle lanes bounded by a solid white line, known as mandatory cycle lanes, will often amount to the enforceable contravention of a traffic regulation order made under Sections 1, 6 or 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Parking on advisory cycle lanes marked with broken white lines is not enforceable.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para3"></a>Part 6 of the Bill provides for the civil enforcement of parking restrictions on cycle lanes and therefore addresses the main complaint of cyclists&#151;vehicles parking in cycle lanes forcing them to move out into the main flow of traffic, from which cycle lanes are designed to segregate them.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para4"></a>Parking in a mandatory cycle lane is likely to be an offence under Section 5, 8 or 11 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and will therefore be subject to civil enforcement by virtue of paragraphs 3(2)(b) and 4(2)(b) of Schedule 7. Parking on a cycle track, an offence under Section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, is also subject to civil enforcement under the Bill by virtue of paragraphs 3(2)(g) and 4(2)(h) of Schedule 7.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para5"></a>Driving on a route for use by buses and pedal cycles only is one of the moving vehicle contraventions caught under the provisions of Part 4 of Schedule 7. The signs listed in Part 4 mirror those listed in Schedule 3 to the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para6"></a>Amendment No. 118B suggests the addition of a number of other signs to the list in Part 4 that would enable civil enforcement of contraventions of routes or lanes provided to benefit cyclists. I should point out that it is intended that enforcement of traffic signals should remain a matter for the police. It is important that the enforcement of advance cycle stop lines <P>


<a name="column_GC177"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column GC177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remains with the police because of the difficult judgment calls often raised. For example, sometimes a driver may be faced with the choice to continue over a junction or to stop, but only after they have inevitably moved into the cycle reservoir between stop lines. The driver who accelerates to clear the junction may cause a greater danger, but it may be the driver who brakes and decreases his speed who is caught by camera going over the first stop line on red. In such a situation, camera enforcement without appropriate analysis and discretion may have an adverse road safety impact.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para7"></a>The powers to enforce moving traffic contraventions in the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003 have not yet been used in practice. Their use will be piloted by six London boroughs, including Camden and Hammersmith and Fulham, for Traffic for London. The pilot is due to begin in June.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para8"></a>Against that background, our initial inclination was to gather some experience of the civil enforcement of moving traffic contraventions before expanding the lists of signs that can be enforced. However, I have listened carefully to my noble friend and would like to consider further the case for adding now to Part 4 of Schedule 7 signs that would enable the civil enforcement of the contravention of driving in a mandatory cycle lane. On that understanding, I invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429-29_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para19"></a>In 2002, the UK agreed to contribute &#163;900 million to the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional lending arm which is designed to meet the needs of the world's poorest countries. In addition to this contribution, the UK set aside another &#163;100 million to be provided on condition that a satisfactory framework was agreed to compensate the IDA for the costs of introducing grants under its 13th replenishment (IDA 13). Both the initial &#163;900 million contribution and the additional provisional contribution of &#163;100 million were approved by Parliament on 3 December 2002.

<P>

<a name="40429-29_para20"></a>I am pleased to announce that a satisfactory framework for compensating IDA 13 for the introduction of grants has now been agreed. Under this framework, donors will compensate IDA upfront for the administrative costs associated with providing grants, through making additional contributions to the next replenishment (IDA 14). (These are costs which arise early in the project cycle and, in the case of loans, would be covered by recipient countries.) Meanwhile, donors will compensate for the lost reflows from recipient countries as and when these would have fallen due. Given the 10-year grace period provided under IDA on repayment of loans, this would not have happened until 2013 at the earliest. Compensation payments will not therefore be required until this time, and the exact means of compensation will be discussed as part of future IDA replenishments.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para21"></a>An essential and fundamental principle of the agreed grants compensation framework is that donors should contribute to the cost of compensation in line with their share of IDA 13 (their "burden share"). If the UK were to contribute the full &#163;100 million set aside to cover the costs of upfront compensation, we would effectively displace the contributions of other donors. We have therefore decided to cover both our burden share under IDA 13, and the structural financing gap inherent in this replenishment (equivalent to 9.37 per cent of total resource needs from donors), making a total UK contribution for upfront IDA 13 grants compensation of &#163;64.8 million.

<P>

<a name="40429-29_para22"></a>The Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, as amended by the Boundary Commissions Act 1992 requires that the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland undertake periodical reviews of constituencies in Northern Ireland. The commission is required to submit a report to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland not less than eight or more than 12 years from its last report. The present review commenced on 16 May 2003.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para23"></a>The commission is announcing its provisional recommendations for constituencies in Northern Ireland today. The proposals are to be made available for public inspection at district council headquarters and electoral offices, public libraries and the offices of the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Commission to coincide with the formal publication of the provisional recommendations on 6 May. The commission is required to take into consideration any representations made within one month of publication of the proposals.
<P>

<a name="40429-29_para24"></a>I will, of course, report back to Parliament once the commission has made its final recommendations.

The goods will be used by the oil and gas industry to overhaul turbines that power pumps for oil and gas pipelines. The goods are military listed because they were originally designed and used for military aircraft engines. In this instance, the Government are satisfied that there is a minimal risk of diversion to a military end use and are prepared to make an exception to the UK national arms embargo. Other aspects of the application were considered against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.

<P>
<A NAME="40429-30_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I have today laid before the House a statement of changes to the immigration rules. From 1 May 2004, as a result of the accession of 10 new states to the European Union, nationals of those EU accession states will not require immigration leave to enter or stay in the UK. Consequently it is necessary to remove all references to the individual EU accession states in the immigration rules with effect from the date of accession.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para7"></a>We have also decided to amend the European Economic Area (EEA) national settlement requirements to enable those currently in immigration categories leading to settlement to aggregate time spent here under the immigration rules with that as an EEA national in the UK when making an application to settle. This ensures that new EU nationals will not have to spend a longer time in the UK to qualify for settlement than they would if accession had not occurred. This mirrors the practice followed in previous accessions.

<A NAME="40429-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para20"></a>The Ministry of Defence is continually examining ways of improving military capability and value for money for the taxpayer, including by keeping the size and location of our bases under review.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para21"></a>On 14 August 2003, I announced a review of the future basing requirement for the RAF's air combat service support units (ACSSUs), elements of the air surveillance and control system (ASACS) and some other minor units and the potential impact on the future requirement for RAF Boulmer, RAF Neatishead, RAF Sealand and RAF Stafford, should relocation of units currently based there be recommended.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para22"></a>The primary objective of this particular review was to meet the department's basing needs in the light of the move towards expeditionary operations. A number of options were identified on which my officials have consulted widely. A number of honourable Members have made representations. The review has now concluded.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para23"></a>I am now able to inform the House that I am inclined, subject to formal consultation with the trade unions, to accept the option which creates an ACSSU communications hub and a base for ASACS units at RAF Scampton and an ACSSU logistics hub at RAF Wittering. Implementation of this option as a whole would be over an extended period, beginning later this year and not complete until about 2012.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para24"></a>This option offers the greatest operational flexibility to our Armed Forces by collocating support units on <P>


<a name="column_WS42"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2004 : Column WS42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>main operating bases. It is also the most cost-effective solution. It would mean that communications personnel would relocate to Scampton from RAF Sealand (from 2005) and RAF Brize Norton (from 2005), together with ASACS units currently based at RAF Neatishead (from 2004&#150;05) and RAF Boulmer (from 2009), bringing the total number of people at the station up to around 2,400 by 2012. In the case of RAF Wittering, logistics personnel would relocate from RAF Stafford (from 2005). This would increase the number of personnel at the station to around 2,130 by 2006.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para25"></a>The Ministry of Defence has written to the trade unions to ask for their formal response to this option by 7 June 2004.
<P>

<a name="40429-30_para26"></a>I will make my decision when I have received trade unions' comments and will inform the House at that time.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answers by the Lord Davies of Oldham on 11 February (WA 166) and 21 April (WA 52), why they judge it desirable to impose more burdensome regulations on the carriage of gas oil on the basis of its flammability, when there is no recent history of gas oil bowsers catching fire.[HL2512]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   This change was introduced to implement the provisions of EC directive <sup>1</sup>  requirements for the safe transport of dangerous goods. Industry has been fully aware that this has been part of the international text for many years and that, in due course, Great Britain (GB) would be required to conform to international safety obligations. However, the new GB regulations <sup>2</sup>  allow a transitional period for industry to meet these requirements and, where existing bowsers will be used solely in the UK, a requirement to meet general safety requirements and be fit for purpose will be maintained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the withdrawal or withholding of nutrition and hydration delivered by artificial means from mentally incapacitated patients with persistent vegetative state and other similar conditions can only be authorised on application to the courts.[HL2453]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  The judgments in the House of Lords in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland stated that withdrawal/withholding of artificial nutrition and hydration in all cases in which the patient is in a permanent vegetative state should as a matter of practice only take place after the approval of the court has been obtained.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their policy on the withdrawal or withholding of nutrition and hydration delivered by artificial means from mentally incapacitated patients.[HL2454]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   An adult with capacity is able to refuse any form of medical treatment including artificial nutrition and hydration (except in circumstances defined by statute, for example the Mental Health Act 1983). Where the patient is incapacitated and has not made a relevant advance refusal, treatment will be lawful if it is in their best interests. Hence, if the treatment is not in the best interests of the patient it may lawfully be discontinued.
<P>

<a name="40429w01_para3"></a>Procedural safeguards can be found in professional guidelines, including the General Medical Council's guidance document, Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good Practice in
Decision Making (http://www.gmc-uk.org/standards/default.htm). Copies are available in the Library. In cases of difficulty, doubt or disagreement, the matter can be referred to the court for adjudication.

<A NAME="40429w01_wqn6"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many people have been charged with fraud in connection with the foot and mouth disease outbreak; and of them how many of these are farmers or slaughtermen.[HL2106]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  Six people have been prosecuted by Defra for fraud offences in connection with the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001. Three members of staff were prosecuted and pleaded guilty to making false subsistence claims. Three farmers were prosecuted for making false compensation claims;
one farmer pleaded guilty, two farmers were acquitted. There have been no prosecutions of slaughtermen by Defra for fraud.
<P>

<a name="40429w01_para4"></a>There are no outstanding prosecutions. There are also a significant number of ongoing disputes about contracts during the foot and mouth epidemic, some of which are the subject of legal proceedings.

<P>
<UL>How many of the 6,000 varieties of apples registered in national apple lists are still available in British supermarkets; and what percentage of apples sold in British supermarkets are British-sourced.[HL2400]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>  There is no definitive list of the number of apple varieties that exist as they, along with other fruit, are not subject to National Listing. However, over 2,000 varieties of apple are held in the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale. Only a few of these varieties are of commercial significance and regularly appear on supermarket shelves, though other less common varieties are sold periodically by some outlets who wish to offer their customers a wider choice. We estimate that, by quantity, about 30 per cent of the total supply of apples in the UK is home produced.

<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_wqn10"></A><B> Baroness Byford </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have issued any advice to local authorities regarding annual "Spring clean" or "Tidy up" days.[HL2496]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40429w01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Whereas a single day or weekend campaign can be effective in raising awareness we are convinced that more sustained campaigns are more effective. The 100 days campaign by Manchester City Council has been a great success and has mobilised the community. The Government provide advice to local authorities on how they can best discharge their statutory duties with regard to the management of the local environment.
<P>

<a name="40429w01_para5"></a>Defra funds ENCAMS (formerly the Tidy Britain Group) who work closely with local authorities on these issues. ENCAMS run a variety of training and best practice programmes, including their People and Places Programme, which is a unique partnership offering local authorities and other major land owners advice and support on effective action to be taken to solve many of the problems that blight our open spaces. In 2001, Defra allocated &#163;1 million to local authorities through ENCAMS for the LEQ Pathfinder Programme, to find new and better ways of reaching the diverse needs of local people in a number of places through 10 key areas, one being active citizenship.
<P>

<a name="40429w01_para6"></a>Following the Defra consultation, Living Places&#151;Powers, Rights, Responsibilities, Defra launched a website through the Improvement and Development Agency (IdeA) which acts as a strategic document for local authorities to serve as a guide to current legislation, available guidance and good practice concerning the whole raft of local environmental issues.
