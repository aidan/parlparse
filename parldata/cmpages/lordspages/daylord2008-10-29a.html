On 22 October, during exchanges on an Oral Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, on winter energy supplies, I asked a supplementary question about gas storage. On reflection, I should have declared an interest, which appears in the register of non-parliamentary interests, in a company called Canatxx Energy Ventures Limited.

The most recent projections show that 94,200 places will be needed by 2014 and we aim to provide 96,000 places&#151;hardly a great margin. If the end-of-custody licence scheme were to come to an end, we would need an additional 1,300 places.

The Mailing Preference Service allows householders to opt out of receiving addressed direct mail.

Your Choice allows householders to opt out of receiving unaddressed mail from DMA members. The Royal Mail also operates an opt-out service to stop the door-to-door unaddressed mail that it carries. The preference services that are in place allow people to choose, and cover approximately 90 per cent of addressed and unaddressed mail.</p>

A producer responsibility agreement was signed in 2003 to increase the levels of the industry&#146;s recycling of household waste caused by what we would call junk mail. Just last week it led to the signing of an industry-wide standard that was developed following a period of discussion with the British Standards Institution and is the first of its type in any commercial sector. It is expected that the standard will be published before the end of this year, and its adoption will support the drive to raise recycling limits within the industry.</p>

In 2007-08, &#163;31 million in capital funding was allocated to 17 projects designed to help to eliminate the inappropriate use of adult psychiatric wards for children and young people. This is a start. Additionally, the National Institute for Mental Health in England is undertaking a programme of works to support hospitals on this issue. The latest figures for 2008-09 show that the number of under-18 year-olds in adult psychiatric wards is at its lowest since the collection of figures started in 2005.</p>

The noble Baroness knows that a very large number of noble Lords voted to put into the Mental Health Act 2007 the requirement that the environment for children and young adults in mental hospitals should be suitable, having regard to their age. That was to correct a most unsatisfactory situation. We now want to put improvements into practice rapidly and effectively. Is the Minister aware that there are disturbing reports, for example in the <I>Times</I> of 1 October, that hundreds of children and teenagers are still being put into adult psychiatric wards? While I welcome the action to which the Minister referred&#151;it is a good start&#151;will she assure the House that she will monitor the situation and continue to press for action to complete the programme within the timescale laid down in the Mental Health Act 2007?</p>

I know that somebody called some amendments to the then Bill &#147;the Williamson amendments&#148;. We are committed to addressing the inappropriate use of adult wards for under-18 year-olds. We are carefully monitoring the use of adult wards and we are pleased to report that there have been significant decreases in recent times. However, until we can say that not one child or young adult has been put inappropriately into an adult ward, we will not have succeeded. We are on target for delivering this by April 2010. Investment is being made, and training provided, to ensure that the right facilities are provided that are age-appropriate for under-18 year-olds.</p>

For example, in the first quarter of 2006-07, 75 under-16 year-olds were in adult wards, whereas in the first quarter of this year the number was 16, and that figure is going down. The same figures follow through for 16, 17 and 18 year-olds. However, we do not rest at that. The noble Baroness gave the date of November 2010 but that is not the case; it is April 2010. All health authorities have to inform social services by 3 November what appropriate facilities they have for under-18 year-olds.

Before the Minister makes any claims about the likely benefits of the points-based system, would he not agree that the catastrophic rise in unemployment that is likely over the next 12 months is more likely to act as a disincentive to people arriving here to work than any changes in the immigration system?</p>

I doubt that many people from whatever part of Europe, or beyond, are coming to Britain for the weather. I agree entirely that those issues will be a reducing factor. At the moment, our unemployment register has too many members, because we want full employment, among whom some 8 per cent are from the migrant workforce. There has not been a disproportionate effect so far, but it is important that we put in hand timely endeavours to control the immigration factor as we go into difficult times. By sheer coincidence&#151;and on the basis of my previous excuse&#151;I can tell the House that 850 fines, worth some &#163;8 million, have been issued since 29 February 2008 to employers of illegal workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08102937000096"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 78TB. These probing amendments concern the implications of acts taken as a group. First, there is a disparity between the way acts or failures are grouped for the purposes of issuing contribution notices and for the defence. By virtue of paragraph 8 of new Schedule 9, the regulator has to look at whether the material detriment test is met in relation to a series of acts as a whole. However, in new Section 38B, in the statutory defence for a group of acts, sub-paragraph (9) requires that the person has to conclude that his actions were not detrimental in respect of each act.</p>

<a name="81029-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08102937000097"></a>My amendments would mean that where a group of acts was involved, it would be necessary for P to meet condition C if he had concluded that the group as a whole was unlikely to result in a material detriment. For completeness, I should also have tabled an amendment to delete sub-paragraph (10) of new Section 38B, because that, too, requires condition C to apply to each and every act of failure, but I failed to do so. I hope, however, that the Minister will respond on the basis of challenging the need to have regard to each act or failure in a group throughout new Section 38B. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08102937000098"></a><a name="81029-0002.htm_spnew58"></a><b><a name="81029-0002.htm_spnew59"></a><a name="08102937000317"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for enabling us to talk about these measures and the statutory defence. Before I respond to the amendments in detail, I take this opportunity to deal with some of the issues raised in our debate on Monday, which are also relevant to this group of amendments. I do not seek to resile from the comments about considering this again at Third Reading, if appropriate, but I hope this might obviate or reduce the necessity of further consideration then.</p>

<a name="81029-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08102937000099"></a>On reasonableness, we had a useful discussion about the concept of the Pensions Regulator&#146;s reasonableness and, in particular, its public law obligations, its duties and the constraints which are intended to ensure that it does not behave unreasonably. Both the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, expressed concerns about the extent to which the regulator must consider the employer or connected parties when deciding whether it is reasonable to use its powers. In effect, they were querying whether the nature of the regulator&#146;s objectives gave it something of a get-out-of-jail-free card when it came to behaving reasonably towards employers and other parties. I promised to write on this issue, but I hope that, in the interest of informing the rest of this afternoon&#146;s discussions, I can discharge that obligation now.</p>

<a name="81029-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08102937000100"></a>I emphasise that there is a legal requirement on the regulator to act reasonably with regard to those who do not feature in the main objectives set out in legislation. The public law obligation on the regulator means that it must not simply act reasonably toward those it was established to protect, but it must also act reasonably to other parties, including those it regulates. Furthermore, there are specific requirements on the regulator in legislation to behave reasonably; for example, Sections 38(7) and 43(7) of the Pensions Act 2004 both contain express provisions to consider the reasonableness of acting against a particular party. It is also important to remember that the regulator&#146;s decisions can be appealed at the Pensions Regulator Tribunal and in the courts. I hope that comment has proved helpful to the noble Baroness. I wanted to place that on the record.</p>

<a name="81029-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08102937000101"></a>The noble Baroness will also recall that we had some discussion about the operation of the word &#147;might&#148; in the statutory defence. The degree to which a person should consider the potential impact of an act on the pension scheme is a serious question, and it is one that we have considered carefully and discussed at length with stakeholders. The Government intend that the person should undertake a before-and-after comparison of the effect of the act on their pension scheme. We do not intend that the material detriment test and the defence which relates to it should necessitate a broad assessment of almost any adverse possibilities that could befall an employer and their pension scheme over a future period. The defence has been framed to require the employer to make a proportionate consideration of the effect of their act or failure to act.</p>

<a name="81029-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08102937000102"></a>It may be helpful to talk through the detail here. Condition A, at new Section 38B(3), requires that the person should consider,</p>
<ul><a name="08102937000221"></a>&#147;the extent to which the act or failure might detrimentally affect in a material way the likelihood of accrued scheme benefits being received&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81029-0003.htm"/>






<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1579"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1579</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08102937000192"></a>This is not a simple yes or no assessment. It requires serious consideration and contains two concepts: first, what is being considered is the extent to which the act or failure might have a detrimental effect&#151;the key is that there must be a causal link between the act and the detriment; and, secondly, the extent to which there might be such an effect. This should be a standard risk analysis: how likely an event is must be weighed up with its likely impact. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, was correct when he said that this should not be a straight 50-50 test.  A 20 per cent chance of a devastating impact on the scheme may be as serious as a 60 per cent chance of something with a more moderate impact. Industry should be comfortable and familiar with this, as it already forms the basis of most due diligence in the realm of pensions. </p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08102937000103"></a>Further, it does not necessarily require an assessment at the very edges of the possible. The statutory defence was designed, with stakeholders, to deal with concerns about hindsight. Condition A operates with condition C and that latter condition says that the person should make the assessment with regard to the prevailing circumstances at the time. Therefore, that would not include anything that the person could not reasonably have expected.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08102937000104"></a>Thirdly, and briefly, we had an interesting discussion resulting from the noble Baroness&#146;s query on why it was necessary for P to carry out due diligence themselves in circumstances that she described. I want to take the opportunity to expand on the points that I made on Monday. The legislation is clear that P has to undertake the due diligence but this does not mean that they necessarily have to mitigate the detriment themselves. The legislation requires P to take all reasonable steps to mitigate the detriment and it is intended that this obligation can be met by taking all reasonable steps to ensure that adequate mitigation is in place. I hope that that provides further clarity.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08102937000105"></a>Finally on these issues, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, suggested that the power at line 54 of the proposed new schedule is entirely contained in the power at line 89. That is entirely correct. However, there is good reason for these two powers to be separate. The power in line 54 is a prescribing power to add to the list of factors, providing flexibility to add those factors that should apply in the interests of the employer as well as the pension scheme. It is not a broad power to amend or remove the existing factors in primary legislation, and the list of factors is still constrained by relevance in a particular case. Therefore, in the usual way, regulations made under this power would be subject to the negative procedure.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08102937000106"></a>The power in line 89 is a power to amend the existing factors and the scheme obligation provisions. This is a wider power that is intended to provide the flexibility that we have already discussed. As that power would permit primary legislation to be amended, we consider it appropriate to be subject to the affirmative procedure. Hence, it is a separate power. I am grateful for the chance to put those further points on those matters on the record.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08102937000107"></a>I turn to the substance of the amendments. They would amend the provisions dealing with how the defence relates to a series of acts, and in particular a group of acts selected by the defence. The regulator  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1580"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1580</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can apply the material detriment test to a series of acts it selects. In order to be even handed, the party to the defence can similarly raise a defence in relation to a group of acts that the party selects. The amendments provide an opportunity to set out how the defence will operate in relation to groups of acts chosen by the parties.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08102937000108"></a>It is our intention that defendants should have the opportunity to demonstrate that their actions in relation to a group of acts, when taken as a whole, were reasonable. When considering conditions A and B it is possible to argue that due consideration was given to the cumulative detrimental impact of a group of acts and that reasonable steps were taken to eliminate or mitigate the potential detrimental effects of that group of acts. However, condition C requires that the defendant considers the relevant circumstances prevailing at the relevant time, so defendants are required to consider each act within the group individually when considering condition C.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08102937000109"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness opens up significant risk by removing any requirement that conditions A and B be met for the defence. I accept that it is a probing amendment in relation to a group. It also results in different requirements for acts that are dealt with individually and those that are dealt with in groups.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08102937000110"></a>In addition the amendments make the defence unworkable in relation to a group chosen by the party. It requires that condition C should be met by the group as a whole. However, as I have explained, condition C is based on having regard to the relevant circumstances at the relevant time. As the amendment does not address how the relevant time would be determined in relation to a group, it is rendered unworkable. This would make the defence fail to work when it was raised in relation to more than one act or failure. A party would therefore be restricted to raising the defence in relation to each act or failure individually, which is the other opportunity under the defence, even when the regulator could look at a series as a whole.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08102937000111"></a>The amendment effectively removes a desirable flexibility for employers and other parties who may wish to raise the defence in relation to a group of acts for efficiency reasons. I hope that that helps the noble Baroness. I have spent more than a few hours trying to get my head round the complexities of this process, and would be more than happy to meet her to share them with her. I have tried to explain why the test is set out as it is and why following the path she suggests would not work in practice.</p>

</ul>
<a name="81029-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08102937000116"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. They pick up on four small and rather separate points, and I shall not take too long about them. The first amendment emphasises how dangerous it will be if it becomes felt that the regulator will stray beyond the code into other matters. That would raise fears among individuals engaged in what appears to them to be ordinary day-to-day transactions with a peripheral possibility of an influence on the pension fund. They will for their own good reasons want clearance. For instance, directors involved in declaring a dividend might well feel that they have to get clearance for it if the company is in any danger of not being able to pay contributions to the pension fund at some time in the future. I hope that the Minister will give me comfort that he does not see that as a possibility. The amendment points up the provisions that we would need to put in place if that came about; otherwise we would find the regulator swamped with applications.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08102937000117"></a>The second amendment looks at the way in which the statutory duty of a director of a company to,</p>
<ul><a name="08102937000222"></a>&#147;act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08102937000118"></a>works with the obligations under the Bill. The amendment states that a contribution notice could not be issued in circumstances where a director had acted as the Companies Act requires him to act. I shall be interested in how the Minister enlarges on what he said before on the way in which the Companies Act and the Bill will work together in the obligations they place on directors.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08102937000119"></a>The third amendment looks at protecting professionals who come in to sort out a company in a difficult situation. If a pension fund is involved, it is necessarily a pretty hairy area and one where decisions have to be taken fast on a relatively rough-and-ready basis. Although there are people operating in that sort of business who are doing so in the hope of making millions of pounds for themselves, most of the people involved are just there for a crust. If they have been successful over the years, they may well have put enough by to have a nice home and something that it might be thought worth the regulator going after. I do not think it is the Government&#146;s intention that people who are doing the  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1582"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>best job they can to try to rescue a company should find all their assets, which have nothing to do with the company, gone after, particularly if they have to go back to the old wording &#147;acted in good faith&#148;. Professionals remain worried that trying to rescue a company with a defined benefit pension fund could turn out to be personally dangerous. I hope we will get some comfort from the Minister on that.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08102937000120"></a>The last point concerns new subsections (6) and (7), under which the regulator can issue directions to the trustees or managers of a scheme, requiring that money coming in is used in a particular way. Trustees owe fiduciary duties to their members in any event. They would have every incentive, without further legislation, to ensure that payment is applied in a way that best meets those objectives. I cannot see that new subsections (6) and (7) add anything useful except the possibility of inappropriate inflexibility. I beg to move.</p>

He has explained his amendments perfectly well, but I underline the points about individuals. A number of people have expressed concern about this. There is concern that the regulator would have the power to go after individuals. The power to issue a contribution notice is not limited to the amount of benefit. While the regulator has to take account of the benefit that is obtained by a person, the contribution notice can be for any amount. Individuals are concerned, first, that they might not even want to get involved in transactions. Secondly, will we end up burdening commercial transactions with a lot of indemnities, possibly even underwritten indemnities, with cost therefore being built into the system, which could then make it grind to a halt? These are important areas that need clarification.</p>

I recognise the concern that individuals may be subject to personal liability, but there are a number of assurances within the existing legislation which address the use of this power. It is already possible, under Sections 38 and 43 of the Pensions Act 2004, for the regulator to issue a contribution notice and, in some cases, a financial support direction to individuals. In most cases it would not be reasonable for the regulator to take action against an individual, and the recipient of a notice would more usually be a corporate body, such as the company that was party to the act. There may, however, be rare cases where it is appropriate to take action against an individual, be that a company director or otherwise, under the material detriment test.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08102937000124"></a>I remind noble Lords that the regulator&#146;s use of this power is subject to a number of checks and balances. First, the regulator must act proportionately and only where reasonable. This is a fundamental requirement.  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1583"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secondly, as I have already mentioned, there are specific safeguards relating to the material detriment power, including a statutory code of practice which will set out the circumstances for its use. Individuals, like corporate bodies, would be able to rely on this as a defence. Importantly, the government amendments would create two new reasonableness factors for the regulator to consider before deciding whether to issue a contribution notice; that is, the regulator must consider the reasonableness of the person&#146;s actions in the circumstances and, where relevant, the value of the benefits received directly or indirectly from the employer or scheme. This is set out in Section 38(7)(ea). Those two extra powers relating to reasonableness apply not only to the new provision, but to the two existing legs of the contribution notice arrangements</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08102937000125"></a>Finally, as with current practice, any determination to use this new test would be made only by the regulator&#146;s determinations panel, which is independent of those responsible for gathering evidence. The panel will hear both sides of a case. Only if the panel agrees to the regulator&#146;s case can action proceed. Whether or not to issue a contribution notice would of course remain a matter for the regulator. I would go so far as to say that the regulator must get over such a number of hurdles and build such a strong case before it can issue a contribution notice to an individual on the basis of the material detriment test that an individual would know that their intended act was far out of line with reasonable business practice and likely to attract the interest of the regulator.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08102937000126"></a>However, if an individual is concerned that they may be party to an act that could lead to them being subject to a contribution notice, they may of course seek clearance from the regulator. A clearance statement would give them certainty that their actions could not attract a contribution notice.</p>

That is an important ultimate safeguard for pension funds.</p>

He is right: individuals cannot be immune from these regulations, although the circumstances in which they are likely to be the subject of the contribution notice are properly constrained by these provisions.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08102937000129"></a>Amendments Nos. 78Y, 78AL and 78AM relate to the possible conflicts that could be faced by trustees who are also company directors as a result of the interplay of trust law, pensions law and directors&#146; duties under company law. The interaction of pensions law, trust law and company law is an important issue, and the Government&#146;s intention is that the duties in the legislation should rightly sit alongside each other.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08102937000130"></a>Taking the duties of directors under the Companies Act, I understand that noble Lords may be concerned that directors who otherwise act in accordance with duties under that legislation should not be liable to  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1584"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1584</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulatory action. Directors have certain duties to current employees, but under pensions legislation they also have duties to scheme members&#146; interests. It is of course a matter for directors to balance these duties along with their other responsibilities. Such situations are not unusual. It is not the Government&#146;s or the regulator&#146;s intention that, in the normal course of their duties, directors should be subject to a contribution notice under the new test, where their actions have no materially detrimental effect on scheme members&#146; benefits.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08102937000131"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 78Z relates to insolvency practitioners and similar experts. Section 38(3)(c) of the Pensions Act 2004 already provides an exemption from a contribution notice for an insolvency practitioner acting in accordance with his functions. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would extend this exemption to recognised experts in rehabilitating underperforming organisations, such as company doctors and turnaround specialists. &#147;Insolvency practitioner&#148; is a precise term set out in law, and such individuals are licensed to act by the Secretary of State and have a statutory duty to ensure that they treat all creditors fairly and equitably.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08102937000132"></a>As was touched on in Committee, the amendment, which is extremely wide and capable of varying interpretation, would extend the existing exemption to practitioners who are not licensed or acting in accordance with statutory duties. There is a genuine risk that such a provision would mean that the regulator&#146;s power could be circumvented. This could put members&#146; benefits and the PPF at risk.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08102937000133"></a>However, the Government recognise the need to protect people such as company doctors who have to make difficult decisions with wide-ranging impacts. The amendments to the reasonableness factors I referred to earlier are relevant here. In addition, a new factor would be introduced by the government amendments that would be particularly relevant to company doctors and others in similar roles; that is, the regulator should, where relevant, consider,</p>
<ul><a name="08102937000223"></a>&#147;the likelihood of relevant creditors being paid and the extent to which they are likely to be paid&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08102937000193"></a>in Section 38(7)(eb) of the Pensions Act. This will offer some protection to company doctors as it makes clear that, while pension schemes should not be treated worse than other creditors of similar status, equally, the amendments do not somehow make the pension scheme any type of &#147;super-creditor&#148;. Taken with the factor I described earlier, which requires the regulator to consider the reasonableness of a person's actions in the circumstances, I consider that this provides significant comfort to company doctors.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08102937000134"></a>First, where a company doctor has to make hard decisions in an attempt to save a company, these factors would protect the position of a company doctor who had to cause detriment to a pension scheme, which, in the particular circumstances, was reasonable in the context of the outcome for other creditors. Secondly, the regulator would need to take into account that, in some circumstances, decisions must necessarily be rapid, as the noble Lord has indicated, and perfect data to inform the decision may not be available. Provided that the company doctor has behaved reasonably and has not, for example, wilfully ignored available information or recklessly taken risks that a reasonable

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08102937000135"></a>It may be helpful if I give an example of how a contribution notice might operate in practice, especially in relation to individuals. There are concerns about the amount of a contribution notice and how the material detriment test would be judged. If a person has assets of &#163;5 million but profited &#163;50,000 from a detrimental transaction, the amount of a contribution notice has an upper limit under Section 39. This is the amount of the debt either due or estimated from the employer to the scheme under Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995, or a higher amount if the act itself reduced the debt. This amount is calculated at the time of the act or failure to act. Therefore, the amount of a contribution notice is, broadly, limited to the employer&#146;s obligations to the scheme and the amount required to ensure that members receive their benefits in full.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08102937000136"></a>If a person with assets of &#163;5 million profited &#163;50,000 from a transaction that was materially detrimental, the regulator would be required to look in the first instance at the amount of the Section 75 debt. If this was, for example, &#163;1 million, that would be the upper limit of the contribution notice. But the regulator would then be bound to act reasonably in its assessment of how much of this sum should be payable by the party to the transaction.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08102937000137"></a>The transaction itself and any benefit from it may not be the only factor here, and may not be the most important factor. Some factors may increase the amount that should be payable towards the upper limit; for example, the history of that person&#146;s involvement with the scheme or the employer. However, other factors might decrease the amount. For example, that person&#146;s degree of involvement in the transaction may have been limited, and there may have been other parties to the act. That person may be an individual who acted merely as an agent for a corporate entity that was party to the act, or other purposes of the act may have meant that the person&#146;s actions were reasonable in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08102937000138"></a>Another factor that is likely to be relevant is the position of the scheme following the transaction. Of course, considering what amount would be reasonable is entirely a matter for the regulator, who must examine each case on its own merits and is required to consider anything that is relevant, disregarding anything irrelevant. I hope that it is a comfort to know that simply having deep pockets should not make a person the target of a contribution notice. It is more constrained than that.</p>

<a name="81029-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08102937000139"></a>I am afraid that I have gone on for a while, but I hope that I have given a degree of assurance on some very important points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08102937000144"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall be brief. Amendment No. 78AN would delete parts of paragraph 14 of proposed new Schedule 9. This is a probing amendment, designed to focus on the concerns of private equity investors. The amendment concerns the financial support direction provisions of the 2004 Act. The Bill changes that to allow the question of inadequate resourcing to be determined in the context of the aggregate value of connected or associated persons. The Minister will be aware that the definition of &#147;associated and connected persons&#148; is a broad one in the 2004 Act.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08102937000145"></a>I am sure the Minister is also aware of ongoing concerns in the private equity world and elsewhere that companies within a portfolio of investments could each be exposed to the regulator&#146;s powers, even though individually they do not operate on a connected basis and the ownership arrangements do not even involve common control. Private equity arrangements often involve such things as limited liability partnerships, which potentially bring together even more unrelated persons.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08102937000146"></a>I understand the present practice is not to draw in de facto unrelated parties, despite the de jure effect of ownership structures. I have tabled the amendment to give the Minister the opportunity to say how he expects the private equity and loose arrangements within portfolios to be dealt with under the provisions? I beg to move.</p>

A financial support direction may be issued where the employer in relation to a pension scheme is a service company or insufficiently resourced. It can direct persons who are associated or connected with the employer to put in place financial support for the pension scheme.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08102937000148"></a>As a result of the way the Act is drafted, the direction may only be used if there is a single person who meets the test of being sufficiently resourced. Once the test is satisfied, the direction could be issued to any of the associated or connected parties, subject to reasonableness. This means that the direction could be avoided simply by dividing resources between the associated and connected parties so that no single party was sufficiently resourced. The Government&#146;s amendment tackles this problem by providing that a direction may be issued if there are two or more connected or associated parties who between them meet the test of being sufficiently resourced.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1587"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1587</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08102937000149"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness would remove the regulator&#146;s ability to show that a group of associated or connected persons are between them well enough resourced to meet the test. I understand it is a probing amendment and am sure the noble Baroness will agree that it is wrong that a group of companies could potentially take advantage of a loophole and arrange matters so that they avoid meeting their pension responsibilities. The CBI, for example, supports the change we are making.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08102937000150"></a>Some concerns were expressed in the consultation that an unrelated investor or company could be exposed to greater risk of a financial support direction as a result of the proposed changes. It is unlikely that an otherwise unrelated company in another venture capital portfolio who is strictly connected and associated with an employer but remote from the employer and its scheme could find itself liable under a direction for another group&#146;s pension deficits. The current legislation already requires the regulator to consider all relevant facts, which can include the value of any benefits received from the employer, the company&#146;s relationship with the employer including whether it controlled the employer, and the company&#146;s connection or involvement with the scheme. It would likely be unreasonable for the regulator to issue a financial support direction where there was no persuasive evidence of such benefit, relationship or involvement.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08102937000151"></a>Crucially, none of that is affected by this amendment, which simply relates to the closure of a loophole for triggering the financial support direction, not the range of persons to whom the financial support direction could be issued. It does not change the range of people who could be reached. I hope that puts matters clearly on the record for the noble Baroness and has reassured her again in an area where I know there are some concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08102937000157"></a>We have listened to noble Lords&#146; concerns about the challenges that some women and carers have faced in building up entitlement to the state pension and the discrepancy in pension outcomes between today&#146;s new male and female pensioners. I recognise the genuine strength of feeling on this important issue.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1589"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1589</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08102937000158"></a>I must start by paying tribute to my noble friend Lady Hollis for her tireless campaigning and for raising awareness of these difficulties during the passage of the previous Pensions Bill and in our deliberations on this Bill. We have always been sympathetic to her arguments, but to date we have struggled to find a well targeted and affordable way to help the people whom we are concerned about to plug gaps in their national insurance record.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08102937000159"></a>I acknowledge the acute disappointment expressed here and in the other place at our failure to find a solution so far. However, I am pleased to say that this amendment proposes a way forward that meets those tests of targeting and affordability. I am particularly pleased that, as I understand it, it has the full support of my noble friend. To ensure that help is targeted at those who need it the most we propose, first, that contributors will be able to buy six additional years of class 3 national insurance contributions&#151;for years from 6 April 1975&#151;over and above those permitted under the current time limits. That targets women currently approaching state pension age who have gaps in their records. Our evidence shows that the majority of those women require up to six years beyond those currently available to get a full basic state pension.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08102937000160"></a>Secondly, we propose that the right to buy additional contributions be limited to those reaching state pension age between 6 April 2008 and 5 April 2015. We have chosen April 2015 because by then 90 per cent of women reaching state pension age will be able to qualify for a full basic state pension if they take advantage of today&#146;s class 3 rules. By then, far fewer women from these cohorts could benefit from buying the extra years allowed for by this amendment.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08102937000161"></a>Thirdly, we propose that an individual must have 20 qualifying years for state pension purposes on his or her national insurance record, taking into account full years of home responsibilities protection, before he or she can buy the additional contributions. That enables us to target help to those who have already made a significant contribution and are genuinely seeking to plug small gaps in their records.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08102937000162"></a>With these three measures in place, we believe, the 110,000 people whom we estimate will benefit from buying additional contributions will be those whose pension outcomes noble Lords are the most concerned about.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08102937000163"></a>As regards affordability, it is intended that the price of voluntary class 3 contributions will be increased. This will reflect the fact that the value of these contributions will increase after 2010, when an individual will need only 30 qualifying years to get a full basic state pension, which, of course, will be uprated by earnings in due course. It will also ensure that this special extension of the rules does not place new demands on the taxpayer. The Government usually announce the national insurance rate at the Pre-Budget Report, and they intend to increase the price of class 3 NICs to ensure that the overall package is cost neutral.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08102937000164"></a>There are many more details to be resolved. I hope that noble Lords will recognise the commitment that I am making today and will bear with us as we flesh out those details over the coming weeks and months. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08102937000165"></a><a name="81029-0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81029-0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08102937000329"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, I am so very glad to support this amendment today. I was never quite sure that this day would arrive. This will, in future, help women like Pam, who fostered more than 70 children for Surrey County Council and did not get a stamp for any of those years. It will help women like Carol, with two children of her own, who also cared for her grandmother, who was bedridden for 10 years with arthritis, a frail mother-in-law and a father-in-law suffering from dementia, and also fitted in voluntary work in a hospice. Such lives of quiet heroism.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08102937000166"></a>By being able to buy back an additional six years of national insurance, many women coming up to retirement will, as my noble friend said, now be able to build a full state pension&#151;and others a pension much enhanced. Even if women, or men, took out a loan, the pension increase would more than cover the cost of that loan. In this climate of financial tsunami, a secure state pension matters even more to the lower paid.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08102937000167"></a>Of course, I would like this to go further. Ideally, it would be back-dated for older women who had already reached state pension age. I also noticed that my noble friend said that the price of voluntary NI contributions needs to rise, irrespective of this amendment, because from 2010 its value will go up by 50 per cent for men and, therefore, it is reasonable to adjust the price accordingly. The 20-year rule announced by my noble friend is also very sensible, as it excludes the casual Australian backpacker but will help all those women who, for example, can do better from buying back than on the married women&#146;s dependency stamp, or who would otherwise be better off on pension credit.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08102937000168"></a>No doubt other noble Lords will wish to press my noble friend on further details. I shall just spend a last moment or two to say thank you. First, I thank the press, from the <I>Daily Mail</I> through to the <I>Guardian</I>, and particularly to that inner group of friends and colleagues from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Age Concern, Help the Aged and Carers, which built a broad coalition of support, including the Federation of Women&#146;s Institutes and the Federation of Small Businesses, from NAPF to the trade unions to the Fawcett Society. Furthermore, I thank the DWP, which, as my noble friend said, has always been sympathetic in so far as it was allowed to be&#151;and, above all, my right honourable friend James Purnell, Secretary of State, who in last year&#146;s and this year&#146;s Bill together will help to transform the situation for women&#146;s pensions. He has been a true friend to women.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08102937000169"></a>Finally, and above all, I express my gratitude to your Lordships tonight. Thanks to your support all round the House, 500,000 women will be able to build a decent state pension. They will find it worth saving; many now will not need to turn to income-related, means-tested benefits; and all of them will have a decent recognition of the contribution that they have made to society through caring and family responsibilities. Without your Lordships, it would not have happened. Indeed, I rather doubt that it could have happened in the other place at all. It is a really good and special thing that we together have done&#151;and, if I may, on behalf of 500,000 women, I thank you all very much indeed.</p>

<a name="08102937000170"></a><a name="81029-0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81029-0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08102937000330"></a>Lord Clarke of Hampstead:</b> My Lords, I have not been a regular attender during the passage of this Bill and, until last Sunday, I had no idea of the problems that a minority will face when this measure goes through. It would be churlish not to recognise the sterling work of those who pursued this matter for so long and, in particular, my noble friend Lady Hollis. However, I draw the House&#146;s attention to an anomaly. Some of your Lordships may have read about it in the <I>Daily Mail</I>; my noble friend has just mentioned that it has been supportive.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08102937000171"></a>The <I>Daily Mail</I> published a report on Monday about Felicity Hammerton, who falls outside the 6 April deadline and will not be able to get the full benefit. At this very late stage&#151;although I know that I cannot change anything&#151;in his consideration of further details, will the Minister not lose sight of the fact that there is a need to go further? I understand about affordability and that there are difficulties, but I also understand the plight of women such as Felicity Hammerton who, through no fault of their own, fall outside the advantage that has been given to the large number of women to which my noble friend Lady Hollis referred. My plea, as much as I can muster any plea at all, is that that is not lost sight of and that, if it becomes affordable and if things change, it will be revisited with a view to extending the potential beneficiaries in the way I described.</p>

<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="08102937000172"></a><a name="81029-0004.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="81029-0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08102937000331"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, I referred in Committee to the fact that your Lordships&#146; campaigns eventually become law, so I am sure that everyone in the House will join me when I say how delighted I am to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. Her perseverance in this matter has been quite outstanding even by the standards of your Lordships&#146; House, where many of us are dedicated to seeing a particular injustice eradicated, and I am sure that no government concession has ever been more deserved. The battle has certainly been hard won. Right up until last week there was little indication that the Government would ever accept that the inequality which persists between the sexes in attaining full eligibility for the state pension warranted a move of this kind.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08102937000173"></a>The battle has also been protracted because of the ever present concern for cost. The Minister has managed to present us today with a package which he claims to be cost-neutral. There is no doubt that if such an apodictically beneficial result as the one sought by the noble Baroness could have been delivered without regard to cost, we would have wrapped up the issue long ago.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08102937000174"></a>That brings me to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Clarke. When one is making changes to social security benefits&#151;in essence, a state pension is a social security benefit&#151;there are always, alas, cliff edges. The trick among policy makers is to make sure that the cliff is as low as possible. I am afraid that I cannot remember a single occasion in the years that I have been studying this matter when there has not been a cliff edge of some kind in any changes that have been made. Perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will be able to correct me on that statement.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08102937000175"></a>The Minister has stated that the price of Class 3 NICs will be raised soon anyway to account for the fewer years that will now be needed to qualify for a full  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1592"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1592</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>state pension. As I understand it, the 110,000 or so people who might benefit from the move initiated by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will be included among the many more who will benefit from the new requirement to pay NICs for only 30 years rather than 39 or 44. I cannot express absolute, totally unqualified approval because, although these amendments are claimed to be cost-neutral as regards the government purse&#151;which was my objection to the original suggestion of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, last year&#151;they will not be cost-neutral for contributors. No doubt more people will be receiving a full state pension, but they will have paid for such a benefit themselves.</p>

<a name="81029-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08102937000176"></a>I would not be doing my job if I did not ask several more questions that need to be asked on this matter. In particular, by how much does the Minister envisage the price of Class 3 NICs rising? Can he confirm that this price rise will be implemented in the next Budget, or will it be implemented in 2010 when the operation starts? Will the rise be extended across all classes of NICs or just be restricted to one? Above all, can he assure us that the increased revenue the Government will receive will be no more than the extra payments they will make? If this is not to be the case, then what we are seeing here is not a cost-neutral proposal but a revenue-raising one cunningly attached to the delivery of a genuinely praiseworthy aim. Are we therefore&#151;I hope to goodness we are not&#151;looking forward to another stealth tax?</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08102937000177"></a>I would also be interested to hear from the Minister how much of a saving the Government expect to make on pension credit payments as a result of these provisions. I am interested to hear how many of those eligible to make these contributions the Government are expecting to participate. Concerns have been aired in the media&#151;after all, it is too much to expect that such a positive news story for the Government would be postponed until Parliament had heard of their intentions&#151;about both too high and too low a take-up. Not only have commentators noted that some who would benefit from making these extra contributions might be unable to find the money to do so, but quite rightly there is a real possibility that some of the 40 per cent of pensioners likely to be eligible for pension credit might waste their money on voluntary contributing, only to realise that that will result in no additional retirement income. We often raised this subject in the early stages of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08102937000178"></a>I hope that the Minister will go into some detail about what kind of information campaign the Government intend to wage to ensure that neither of these unwelcome outcomes comes to pass. Who will conduct it? Will it be the pensions agency or some other body? Will the Minister also confirm that all the restrictions that currently apply on who may buy Class 3 NICs will be extended to these extra contributions as well? Will those with the married women&#146;s stamp or those who contracted out even for a short period be able to take advantage of the provisions?</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08102937000179"></a>I realise that I have spoken for quite a long time but these questions need to be asked in order to make a proper assessment of this welcome outcome.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08102937000181"></a>I fear that it is in the nature of concessions that, the minute one is made, and a good one at that, people always want more. The noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Clarke, have spoken about that. There will, of course, be women who are bitterly disappointed that they are being left out. Some thousands of women&#151;men as well as women, but mostly women&#151;will certainly benefit if they can afford to buy the missing years outright or can take out a loan to do so and have 20 years&#146; national insurance contributions already under their belt. However, the Government have set the bar quite high. There are many more thousands, mostly but not exclusively women, who are not able to access a higher pension because they have no chance of fitting in 20 years of national insurance contributions.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08102937000182"></a>One other group for whom the door has been firmly shut is those who are already over 60, even if they have not yet picked up their pensions. I again refer noble Lords to the case reported in the <I>Daily Mail </I>on Monday concerning one lady. Are the Government prepared to look again at this situation? After all, it cannot affect that many women.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08102937000183"></a>I should like, finally, to draw attention to some sage advice by the pensions guru, Dr Ros Altmann, which also echoes what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has just said. She warns those with an incomplete national insurance record to take expert advice before they buy back extra years, because they might qualify for means-tested pension credit. She also warns those who do not have good health to take advice before buying extra years.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08102937000184"></a>This brings me back full circle to the importance of the availability of good financial advice, rather than just general information, for those about to retire. As time goes on, such advice becomes more and more important. I hope the Government will keep us informed of the measures they are taking in that matter.</p>

I also congratulate the Government on the real improvements that they have introduced in the Bill following the Turner report&#146;s recommendations, particularly the improvements for carers, the majority of whom are women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08102937000186"></a>We should always remember that women are among the poorest pensioners. It remains shaming that only 30 per cent of women compared with 95 per cent of men currently retire on the full basic state pension. By 2010, however, that percentage will have increased to 75 per cent, even if it is likely to be as far away as 2025 before men and women reach the state retirement age with an equal entitlement to the full basic state pension. This pathway all too clearly illustrates, once again, the considerably greater sacrifice that women have made and will continue to make.

Sadly, although I thank everyone who spoke to my amendment, there was not sufficient support for it from either the Government or the Opposition. Nor indeed have the women's organisations got their act sufficiently together on this issue to press it forward, although I look forward to developments there, too. Ironically, this justice for women, on which we are rightly congratulating the Government and especially the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is another illustration of why that other continuing, blatant annuities discrimination should and could have been remedied in the Bill.</p>

I should like to thank her for the legacy of vital information contained in the speech that she made in Committee on 14 July this year in support of my amendment. The material in that speech alone is enough to reassure me that the argument for sex equality in annuities will eventually be won.</p>

Both those things are wonderful so I thank him very much. Of course, like everyone else, I must thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. I first came into contact with her when we were in government dealing with pension splitting on divorce some 13 or 14 years ago. I realised then what a formidable person we had and how lucky we were to have her in this House. Ever since then, she has done by quiet determination some things that all of us try to do but do the wrong way, so well done to her. She thanked everybody for the cohorts of support she received&#151;from the Federation of Small Businesses, the Women's Institute, Age Concern and so forth&#151;but none of that was likely to come together in a voluntary manner without her constant, gracious, charming but determined impact.

However, under the circumstances and given the very great strength of feeling that there was on all sides of the House last year, this is a pretty disappointing outcome. I am afraid&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made some of the same points&#151;that the costs and prices are very unclear. Women are being offered a tempting meal, from a menu without prices, in a restaurant that they may not be able to afford. How can it be possible to remedy what we all agreed was a major injustice to women on a cost-neutral basis? Can we be told how much extra women will have to pay, over and above the increases that the noble Lord was talking about, so that this can be achieved on a cost-neutral basis? Who is going to pay? Will the cost of buying back these added years be prohibitive for women? What are the numbers? At the moment, women born before 5 April 1950 can make a voluntary class 3 contribution of &#163;421 to buy an additional state pension worth &#163;121 a year. That is clearly very good value. As noble Lords have already pointed out, in quite a few cases people will lose pensions credits. We must make sure that the advice gets through properly. In particular, what is the extra cost going to be?</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08102948000008"></a>I must comment on the way in which last week&#146;s announcements were handled. There was no problem for James Purnell with the favourable publicity: he was there in the centre of the photograph when he was claiming credit. However, when there was any question of what the bill would be, he was airbrushed out. On a matter such as this, where feelings are so strong, I would have thought that the Government would have told us what the bill and the extra costs will be. The strength of feeling in this House and in the country is such that it is disappointing that the Government have been allowed to get away with taking the credit at no cost. We on these Benches would have been happy to support more money being put in. We think that, for women, this is at the moment a bit of a pig in a poke.</p>

I am also grateful for the praise that has been universally, and quite rightly, heaped on my noble friend Lady Hollis. I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, that I have shared his experience of being defeated by the noble Baroness. One trepidation I have is that, now that this campaign is won, what on earth is my noble friend going to move onto next? Perhaps I will think about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08102948000010"></a>My noble friend talks about these things not in terms of aggregates and numbers, but how they will affect real people&#146;s lives. I know that is what drives her passion. She makes the point also about the importance of a secure basic state pension. I will come to the issues around the price of class 3 contributions. Irrespective of this measure, post-2010, people will be able to buy one thirtieth of a year with a year&#146;s contributions, rather than a forty-fourth or a thirty-ninth, as at the moment. This means that there should be an adjustment in class 3. However, this should not be seen as an increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08102948000011"></a>I am grateful for my noble friend&#146;s comments about James Purnell, who was pensions Minister when we debated this, in relation to the Pensions Act 2007. He is now the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08102948000012"></a>I say to my noble friend, Lord Clarke, that I understand his point, which I believe the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, dealt with in part. When changes are made in legislation&#151;and the changes we made last year will be a very significant improvement in the pensions outcome for women&#151;there is always an issue about the extent to which you apply resources and effort to unpicking the inequalities of the past. One issue we looked at was whether we could apply the 2010 rules to all existing pensioners. However, noble Lords will remember that the price tag for that was very substantial, and unaffordable. Inevitably, there will be a cut-off point and some people will fall one side of it rather than the other. However, I am mindful of my noble friend&#146;s comments and am certain that we will do all that we can to help people who fall outside these provisions. In particular, we will ensure that they are able to benefit fully from the reliefs and pension credit that would otherwise be available.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08102948000013"></a>I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said that we were reluctant to recognise the inequality in the pension system. However, the whole thrust of the Act that we passed last year was to dramatically change the landscape for women whose working lives would be wholly or substantially under the new regime. We are very proud of that, although the noble Lord made the point that changes such as this inevitably produce cliff edges. He asked several questions. Certainly, the measures that will make the change cost-neutral will be applied only to class 3 national insurance contributions. They will be applied to all class 3 contributions, which I think is what he asked. He also asked when this would all take effect. The detail is still being worked on but it is ultimately for the Treasury to deal with these matters and I expect them to do so in the normal way at the Pre-Budget Report.</p>

<a name="81029-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08102948000014"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Oakeshott, pressed me to say what the cost will be. Initial modelling suggests that the price increase will be around half the existing rate, but I should also stress that the existing rate is a substantial reduction on the actuarial value. The current cost of a class 3 contribution is &#163;8.10 a week but its current actuarial value is something like &#163;45, so there is still a substantial gap between the two.</p>

If you took away the adjustments for the class 3 contributions, the present net value of the cost would be about &#163;600 million, which is about one-third of the figure that we talked about in relation to the original proposal. However, I stress that there will in any event be a need to adjust the class 3 price simply because the deal changes post-2010, and only the

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08102948000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made the point that it will not be right for everyone to take up this opportunity. Those who have, or are heading for, pension credit could spend money but get just a net nil out of it. He is absolutely right about that, as he is with regard to the importance of an information campaign to ensure that people have the right information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08102948000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about reduced rate contributions. The right to use class 3 contributions to buy back extra years for the periods when reduced rate contributions were paid is not available. It is not permitted under the current rules and there are no proposals to change that. Therefore, if someone paid a reduced rate contribution for an earlier year, they could not now replace it with a class 3 contribution. However, that is not a change; it is the existing law.</p>

I look to the Box, from where some help may be coming down on that, and in the interim I may move onto another point. I think that the noble Lord was asking about people who have contracted out of the state second pension. Class 3 national insurance contributions only help people to build up entitlement to basic state pension and bereavement benefits. They do not help people build up entitlement to state second pension, so on that issue this amendment would have no impact on such entitlements and it makes no difference whether somebody is contracted out of the state second pension.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, was supportive of this and on behalf of my noble friend I am grateful for her comments. On cost, for the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, I think that I have dealt with that. The net present value, subject to class 3 changes, is &#163;600 million. Issues around pension credit are important, for we need to get information out so that people do not take up that opportunity if it will not benefit them.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08102948000050"></a>Amendments in this group follow discussions in this House and relate to human admixed embryos. The Bill sets out a clear definition of human admixed embryos, and ensures that all such embryos are regulated and may not be created without a licence.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08102948000051"></a>The Government have listened very carefully to arguments from the scientific community about the need to create admixed embryos for research. This matter has been closely scrutinised by parliamentary Select Committees, and voted on in both Houses. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority also ran a public consultation on this issue last year.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08102948000052"></a>One motivation for allowing this research to go ahead is the limited availability of human eggs for advancing techniques in cell nuclear replacement, a process used in therapeutic cloning. Scientists are hoping to use as a substitute rabbit or cow eggs, which are abundantly available. There is clearly a wide spectrum of embryos that could be created using human and animal genetic material. The Bill captures the creation, keeping and use of those embryos that are at the human end of the spectrum&#151;in other words, with predominantly human genetic make-up. Research using embryos at the animal end of the spectrum has been undertaken for some time in this country, and regulated by the Home Office under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08102948000053"></a>Amendments Nos. 50 to 52 make consequential changes to Schedule 2 to the Bill to bring the new category of human admixed embryos into line with other categories under the Bill, so that the creation, keeping and use of any admixed embryos to which the Bill applies could be licensed by the HFEA. Amendment No. 29 is consequential to Amendment No. 50.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08102948000054"></a>Amendment No. 1 is minor and technical, to ensure consistent use of the term &#147;keeping or using&#148;. This phrase is used in existing Section 3(3)(a). The amendment ensures that the term is used consistently throughout the Bill, by amending new Section 4A(3) to ensure consistency in the wording.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08102948000055"></a>Amendment No. 4 relates to definitions in the Bill. The 1990 Act defines an embryo as a live human embryo. It also states that references to embryo include an egg in the process of fertilisation. The Bill defines an egg as a cell of the female germ line at any stage of maturity, but not including an egg in the process of fertilisation. This is because the definition of an embryo expressly includes an egg in the process of fertilisation. To ensure that these definitions work together, it is necessary to clarify that the general definition of an egg does not apply to the definition of an embryo. The definitions in Clause 1 do not cover the section relating to human admixed embryos. Therefore, the term &#147;embryo&#148; needs to be defined independently in the human admixed embryo provisions and the same exclusion of &#147;egg&#148; in the definition of embryo needs to be made. The Bill as it stands does not do so and Amendment No. 4 is a minor technical amendment to rectify this. This amendment ensures consistency between the definitions in the two clauses of the Bill and ensures that they work as they are intended to.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08102948000056"></a>Amendment No. 54 is a technical amendment to ensure consistency. Under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3 to the 1990 Act, a person&#146;s consent to the use of a human embryo can specify use for the purposes of any project of research, whereas under new paragraph 2(1A) of Schedule 3, as introduced by the Bill, a person&#146;s consent to the use of a human admixed embryo must be for the purposes of use in a project of research.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08102948000057"></a>Amendment No. 54 clarifies that a person can give a general broad consent to a human admixed embryo, created using their cells, being used in research, if they choose to do so. Using the word &#147;any&#148; makes it clear that consent does not have to be project-specific, although it can be if the donor chooses and removes any doubt about whether a general consent can be given. The amendment ensures consistency with the wording used in relation to human embryos. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08102948000061"></a>Amendment No. 2 adds a new regulation-making power.

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08102948000065"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 2A tabled in my name straightforwardly seeks to enshrine in the new law the principle that, before any animal-human admixed embryo is created, it must be established that alternatives do not exist. This proposition was advanced in your Lordships&#146; House by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, who has a hospital appointment which coincides with this debate. It was also the subject of amendments in another place at Report stage, tabled by Mr. David Burrowes, Member of Parliament for Enfield Southgate. As the debate in another place was guillotined, the amendments were never reached, so the House of Commons did not have a chance to debate this principle. The only way in which such a debate could occur is if your Lordships agree Amendment No. 2A.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08102948000066"></a>At earlier stages of our debates on this issue, the issue was often referred to as the &#147;Hunt test&#148;. It gained that description from some words used by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in our debates on whether we should allow the creation of embryonic stem cells for the purposes of cloning. In that debate in 2001, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that it would be licit to use embryonic stem cells only if it could be demonstrated that no other alternatives were available.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08102948000067"></a>We should not underestimate the phenomenal public unease about some of the provisions of the Bill. More than 30 major public meetings have been held throughout the United Kingdom, attended by thousands of people; almost 2 million protest cards and letters have been sent to Members of another place; and many significant public figures have spoken out against the mass manufacture, manipulation and destruction of human embryos. This is not, as I know your Lordships will agree, a trivial matter.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08102948000068"></a>The argument has been put persistently throughout our debates that experiments on the human embryo and admixed embryos will bring great benefits in the form of treatments for diseases which at present are incurable. Yet, since 1990 not even one treatment has materialised to help the sick, compared with more than 80 treatments using ethically acceptable adult stem cells. There has been scandalous over-hype and playing on people&#146;s fears and desperation.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08102948000069"></a>Our obsession with experiments on human embryos has led to a failure properly to pursue the alternatives. That in turn is having a disastrous effect on both our ability to develop life-saving treatments and to develop good science. Some scientists have also been coming to the same conclusion. A report in last week&#146;s <I>Sunday Times</I><I></I>stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="08102948000228"></a>&#147;A leading British scientist is leaving the country to work in France after claiming that British science gives too much priority to embryo experiments over &#145;more ethical&#146; alternatives&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000175"></a>An article in the <I>Times Higher Education </I>supplement of 23 October states that Colin McGuckin, professor of regenerative medicine at Newcastle University, and an expert in adult stem cells, believes that UK funding agencies and his university have prioritised embryonic stem cell research above work with adult stem cells. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="08102948000229"></a>&#147;You would barely know adult stem cells exist&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000176"></a>He added:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="08102948000230"></a>&#147;A vast amount of money in the UK from the Government has gone into embryonic stem cell research with not one patient having been treated, to the detriment of (research into) adult stem cells, which has been severely underfunded&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000177"></a>Those are his words.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08102948000070"></a>It is tragic that Professor McGuckin feels that he has to leave the UK to go to a country which he says,</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000235"></a>&#147;offers a much better environment&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000178"></a>both&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000236"></a>&#147;to cure and treat more people&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000179"></a>and &#147;to do good work&#148;.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08102948000071"></a>Amendment No. 2A simply seeks to insist on what Professor McGuckin calls,</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000237"></a>&#147;a much more reasoned balance&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000180"></a>between the use of human embryos and the alternatives.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08102948000072"></a>As the Bill is currently drafted, government Amendment No. 2 requires that a</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000238"></a>&#147;licence cannot authorise keeping or using a human admixed embryo in any circumstances in which regulations prohibit its keeping or use&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000181"></a>At first glance this may seem eminently reasonable, but in reality, these words merely assert in a painful piece of tautology that it is not legal to allow something that is illegal. Surely, before authorising the creation and use of animal/human hybrid embryos, we should insist on more rigorous criteria and safeguards.</p>

<a name="81029-0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08102948000073"></a>I therefore propose that this should be extended to cover, in the words in the Marshalled List,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08102948000074"></a>Some may protest that the law already contains criteria that achieve this effect. However, if it does, I should be grateful if those who believe it would kindly cite the relevant clauses and demonstrate how they

By contrast, I remain unaware of anything in either the current Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act or this Bill that has parity with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, in which the relevant imperative is in the legislation, explicitly requiring,</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000240"></a>&#147;that the purpose of the programme to be specified in the licence cannot be achieved satisfactorily by any other reasonably practicable method&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000182"></a>That is a perfectly reasonable, logical thing to do. If it is right to do it in the case of animal experimentation, why is it not reasonable to ask for the same thing for human embryos?</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08102948000075"></a>What objective criteria are employed by the regulatory authority in determining whether the use of embryos is necessary and desirable for a particular purpose? As discussed during our earlier debates, it is especially noteworthy that the HFEA has ultimately never refused any licence application. It has therefore been argued that the HFEA may have found it very difficult to say no. Even as we have been debating the Bill over the past 12 months, there have been extraordinary breakthroughs that mercifully and happily will ensure that these dilemmas and decisions will no longer be necessary. I refer to the breakthroughs made by Jenny Thompson and Professor Shinya Yamanaka in Japan using IPS cells&#151;induced pluripotent stem cells&#151;and getting them to run backwards, using our skin rather than creating human embryos to manufacture embryonic stem cells, which is extraordinarily exciting science. It enables good science and good ethics to march hand in hand.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08102948000076"></a>I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Winston, in his place. I was struck by a programme that he broadcast over the summer in which he demonstrated that a huge amount of hype has gone into the claims made about various forms of stem cell technology. We have to keep this in the kind of perspective that the noble Lord rightly described in that broadcast.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08102948000077"></a>As the HEFA comes to consider licence applications, I hope that it will also keep these things in proper perspective and look at the alternatives. Regardless of my previously expressed repugnance at the manufacture of human embryos&#151;my consistent position&#151;there is nothing in this amendment that automatically prevents the creation of so-called human admixed embryos for research, as long as the purpose of the proposed research cannot be achieved by any method not entailing the use of human embryos. The amendment requires that embryos that combine human and animal material should be used only if there is no other means of achieving the same ends. I find it hard to see how anyone could reasonably object to this amendment if they truly believe that a particular project of research is necessary.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08102948000078"></a>The licensing authority and scientists should be duty bound to explore the alternatives, not only due to the ethical concerns but also because of the finite resources. Interspecies cybrid embryos were argued for on the basis that we supposedly need an alternative to using excessive numbers of human eggs for cloning research. These are finite resources that often bring complications for women&#146;s health, as we discussed at earlier stages of the Bill, through hyperovulation syndrome.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08102948000079"></a>My amendment also brings the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act into line with paragraph 8.3 of the International Society for Stem Cell Research guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="08102948000231"></a>&#147;The project proposal should include a discussion of alternative methods, and provide a rationale for employing the requested human materials, the proposed methodology and for performing the experiments in a human rather than animal model system.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000183"></a>That is all my amendment seeks to do. I hope the House will consider this amendment carefully and will pause to reflect on what message it wishes to send not only to the British public but to the wider world. Are we to be so ideologically wedded to experimentation with all manner of human interspecies embryos that we blind ourselves to the alternatives, especially when they seem to achieve the same purported ends far more efficiently?</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08102948000080"></a>I invite the House to vote in favour of a modest provision that prohibits nothing, but insists with the full force of law that a case must be made that no alternatives are available before permitting the creation and destruction of the human admixed embryos authorised by this Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="08102948000081"></a><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08102948000518"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, I remind my noble friend Lord Alton that issues relating to the use of cells derived from human embryos and the use of adult stem cells were fully and extensively debated in this House many weeks ago. In this group of amendments, we are dealing with human admixed embryos. When the Bill was debated in this House, we made it clear that the purpose behind the development of such admixed embryos was to be able to clone cells derived from the tissues of patients suffering from diseases such as diabetes, Parkinsonism, dementia and many other conditions in order to be able to study in a research method their nature and ways in which they might ultimately be treated or cured.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08102948000082"></a>At that time, the purpose was to have admixed embryos in which the nucleus of a human cell derived from a patient with one of those diseases could be implanted in an animal ovum from which the nucleus had been removed. The only reason this was felt to be a crucial research tool in the study of disease processes was that it would be preferable to implant those cells&#151;say, a skin cell from someone with one of those diseases&#151;into a human ovum from which the nucleus had been removed, but there is, reasonably, a shortage of human eggs. However willing and public-spirited a woman may be, for her to donate eggs may require the insertion of a needle through the vagina in order to remove eggs from the ovary. That is not a trivial procedure. The Bill makes it absolutely clear that once a human admixed embryo is created, it could under no circumstances be implanted into a human being or animal. It can only be used to study the process of the disease from which the individual whose cell was originally taken was suffering.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08102948000083"></a>At the time of our debate in your Lordships&#146; House, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, was concerned about the definition of human admixed embryos. I understand that he has subsequently had extensive discussions with the Academy of Medical Sciences and others involved in this area. This has led to this series of amendments from the Commons making  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1607"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1607</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that definition much clearer. Commons Amendment No. 3, which we have not yet come to, adds a category of human admixed embryos where the animal DNA is not predominant, thus returning, including and embracing within this clause the type of admixed embryo which has been legal for many years under the Animal Procedures Act, and enabling it to be used for research purposes.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08102948000084"></a>I believe that the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is unnecessary. Why do I say that? Work involving admixed human embryos is extremely difficult and time-consuming. It occupies a great deal of effort on the part of the scientist. If alternatives to that type of research are available, I have no doubt that scientists will take them and use them wherever possible. This amendment is quite unnecessary. I congratulate the Government on the Commons amendments, which have been so carefully and expertly framed. They will improve the Bill and happen to meet most of the concerns, ambiguities and uncertainties which remained in the Bill when it left your Lordships&#146; House. For that reason, I cannot support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="08102948000085"></a><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08102948000519"></a>Lord Winston:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for the customary moderation with which he moved his amendment, which is important in this debate. Sadly there has not always been moderation outside the House. Today we heard, unfortunately, of &#147;Nazi experimentation&#148;. It is good that we are not indulging in that kind of language, which very unwisely polarises this debate and does not usually lead to much light.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08102948000086"></a>I would like to correct what is, I think, a misapprehension of the noble Lord, Lord Alton. I declare an interest as a member of the UK Stem Cell Foundation, which is the main funding body purely for research into stem cells in this country, and which works in a close relationship with the Medical Research Council. Therefore, it is the leading body funding medical research in this field. The noble Lord&#146;s comments about the professor of regenerative medicine are surprising to me. He claims that, in this country, we are not doing anything other than prioritising embryonic stem cells. I have to tell the noble Lord that the UK Stem Cell Foundation has not so far funded a single grant towards embryonic stem cells, nor have we ever had a grant application from this particular professor. I do not think it is unreasonable for me to say that in this Chamber. It is difficult to assess his work, so I do not know why he is leaving this country, but it is certainly not because he has had a grant application turned down because of the prioritisation suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. It is important to put that on the record at the start.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08102948000087"></a>The noble Lord kindly referred to my television programme on the hype surrounding embryonic stem cells, with the extraordinarily sad death of the child of 10 who was hawked around the world. I simplified the story; not only did that child go to Argentina and the Dominican Republic, but also to China and Siberia for treatment. Some people are unfortunately misguided enough to do that because of their desperation. That is another reason why we must be extremely moderate in presenting the work that we do.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1608"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08102948000088"></a>It is important, in that context, to make clear that I showed on that television programme that none of the adult stem cell treatments worked either. As far as I am aware, the only adult stem cell treatment that really works and has been shown to work is where we replace bone marrow cells, usually in children with leukaemia. It is a relatively uncommon disease. A few exceptional other diseases can be treated with bone marrow, but we must make it clear that adult stem cell treatments have been equally unsuccessful. The area is still under development. That is the crucial issue for the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08102948000089"></a>The problem is that we can never be certain in any kind of research. The beauty of the Large Hadron Collider is that we do not know whether we will find the Higgs particle, or what other particles we might discover; nor have we any serious idea of what future applications there might be for physics or engineering. To some extent, that is always true in biological experiments. We cannot say absolutely that embryonic stem cells will definitely provide cures for the range of diseases that the noble Lord has listed; it is simply not true. Nor could we say so for adult stem cells.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08102948000090"></a>We must be quite cautious and make judgments about how this research is directed. Therefore, we accept that a regulatory authority has to make the best assessment of that research. We cannot absolutely say that it will definitely work but the current expert opinion, which may change, strongly suggests that it is the case.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08102948000091"></a>Incidentally but remarkably, the professor of regenerative medicine to whom the noble Lord referred has not been working with adult stem cells. According to his publication record, which I checked only this week, virtually all of this work has been on foetal stem cells, mostly in umbilical cord blood. Again, that is a different area of science which is still extremely vague, and has largely been rather unsuccessful in helping treatment of patients so far. Equally, however, it holds hope, as we hope that it will do in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="08102948000092"></a><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08102948000520"></a>Lord Patten:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Winston. I am particularly interested by his suggestion that things are interesting in science and must therefore always be pursued, looking specifically at the CERN experiment. I wish it well; I hope that it is back on the road&#151;or, rather, underground and rotating&#151;during next year. However, whether it is successful or not, as far as I know it does not raise any great ethical issues. Physics has in the past raised ethical issues, such as nuclear and other related matters, but CERN does not. I do not doubt that, for many scientists, work on embryonic stem cells is extremely interesting, but it comes up quite hard against some difficult ethical questions. I know that the noble Lord recognises that, and I agree with him that we must be moderate in how we discuss these issues.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08102948000093"></a>That is why I strongly support the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in his amendment for two reasons that I shall state briefly, as befits us at this stage of the consideration of the Bill. First, it is reasonable and proper to ask science to demonstrate that there are no alternatives before using admixed cells in this way. To the best of my knowledge, no one has been able to stand up and say that there are no alternatives. That phrase often  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1609"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fell from our lips in another place on economic matters, but I do believe that no alternatives have been demonstrated in this area.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08102948000094"></a>The second reason is that I am told&#151;perhaps the Minister, with his characteristic courtesy, will confirm this point or correct me&#151;that there is nowhere in the world any existing cure, properly approved by the relevant regulatory authorities in that territory, which uses embryonic stem cells, whether admixed or not. There is nothing that is actually working so far.</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="08102948000095"></a><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08102948000521"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> My Lords, I cannot possibly support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton. That is not because I do not respect the noble Lord&#151;I always have done. He used the word &#147;repugnance&#148; about this sort of research, but he should remember that a lot of us feel repugnance&#151;I certainly do&#151;at not doing research that may help people with terrible chronic illnesses that they have no way of curing. It is repugnant to me that we are denying people the chance of a better life.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08102948000096"></a>The noble Lord referred to the mass manufacture and use of human embryos. I do not really think such a sentence is terribly helpful. By no stretch of the imagination could this research be termed &#147;mass manufacture&#148;, and it is not helpful to the general public to use such words.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08102948000097"></a>The noble Lord and I are founder members of the all-party group on cord blood. It is very clearly stated that we want to encourage the collection of cord blood but definitely not for exclusive research on stem cells from cord blood. We believe that all forms of research should be pursued. We cannot possibly know where research will go or whether it will be any good until we have pursued it. That is the major point&#151;we must follow all lines in the interest of ultimately curing human diseases.</p>

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="08102948000098"></a><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81029-0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08102948000522"></a>Lord Patel:</b> My Lords, I was hoping that we would not have to rehearse all the lengthy discussions we had in Committee and on Report, but it looks as if we might have to. I support all that has been said by my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant and others who have spoken, although, with all due respect, I do not agree with the amendment.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08102948000099"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, said several things about alternatives. Alternatives for what? Alternatives for research? Alternatives for therapy? In the United States, Professor Yamanaka and James Thomson have done research on induced pluripotent cells, taking an adult somatic cell nucleus and reprogramming it so that it behaves like an embryonic stem cell. The advances in matters of direct reprogramming of human somatic cells, without the use of oocytes or early embryos, is an exciting and welcome development. However, this work is at a very early preliminary stage. The current technology involves engineering the cells in a way that raises a number of safety issues that will need further refinement before these cells can be used in the clinic. It is only by studying the human embryonic stem cells and their behaviour that we know that the induced pluripotent cells behave in exactly the same way. Even Professor Yamanaka, who now does some of his work in California, is continuing to work in embryonic stem cells.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1610"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08102948000100"></a>The really important point of any application of these so-called induced pluripotent cells must depend on the understanding of basic human biology, and that demands comparative work with both embryonic stem cells and IPS cells. One can only conclude that we should work with IPS cells only if we are interested in direct application, but if that is pursued without an understanding of the basic biology, it is like, to use the analogy I gave last time, comparing gold with material that looks like gold, but we cannot be sure until we have understood that the properties are exactly the same. Yes, IPS cells may be the future but we cannot work with them until we better understand how human embryonic stem cells behave.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08102948000101"></a>In the debate last time I said it is important at this stage to allow research to continue on all types of stem cells&#151;adult, umbilical cord, cord blood, amniotic and embryonic stem cells, and admixed embryos. Why do we need research with admixed embryos? My noble friend Lord Winston and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, briefly mentioned the availability of human oocytes. Obtaining human oocytes is not without risk and they are also in short supply. To get good stem cell lines you need fresh oocytes, which makes it even more difficult. Just now we are trying to understand the path of physiology and the biology of embryonic stem cells derived from human tissues that carry the genes of a particular disease, so that we are better able to understand how that disease develops from an early stage, are able to modify that and to develop and test drugs in vitro, and so on. Without embryonic stem cells derived through admixed embryos, we will not be able to do this research. It is necessary for research purposes. There are no alternatives but to do research on all types of stem cells.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08102948000102"></a>On therapy, my noble friend Lord Winston mentioned that we have tremendous therapy in bone marrow stem cells for treating leukaemia. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that there are other therapies using adult stem cells but they are few and far between. They are mostly autologous therapies&#151;cells taken from one person used for the treatment of that person. Adult stem cells will never be the answer for mass treatment of people with degenerative diseases. Where are we with embryonic stem cells? In research terms we are at a very early stage. In understanding the biology through using embryonic stem cells, the pace has been accelerating quite a bit. We only managed to understand and do induced pluripotent cells because we understood how embryonic cells behave. If we had not, that work would never have come to fruition.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08102948000103"></a>On treatment, there is no treatment today using embryonic stem cells but there are treatments using them at an early stage of trial on animals. There have been some early human trials and it is likely&#151;I hope it will happen&#151;that by the end of next year or early 2010 in the United Kingdom there will be first-phase trials using human embryonic stem cells for age-related macular regeneration. Some 3 million people in this country suffer from, and 30 per cent of people aged over 65 develop, some degree of age-related macular degeneration. I hope that research will come to fruition. None of the stem cell research is likely to have an overnight success. It may not ever happen but we will not know unless we study every type of stem cell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08102948000104"></a>On funding, I declare an interest. I have declared several interests before, being not only a member of several professional organisations but also a chairman of the United Kingdom National Stem Cell Network. I am also a member of the Medical Research Council. In 2007, 424 grants were awarded&#151;at a rough estimate some &#163;56 billion, excluding charity funding. The majority of grant applications were from the MRC, the Wellcome Foundation and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The MRC&#146;s awards were 50:50 adult stem cell research to embryonic stem cell research. Some 90 per cent of the Wellcome grants were for adult stem cell research. The trend is towards adult stem cell research and towards more research on induced pluripotent stem cells. Grants are awarded to people who submit the best science; that is how it should be. They should not be awarded for poor science that is not judged good by peers. If there is any evidence that grants are awarded for poor embryological science, let us hear about it. In my view, it does not happen.</p>

<a name="81029-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08102948000105"></a>I hope that I have made the case for why it is necessary to carry out research on all types of stem cells, including admixed embryos. Without it, we will not progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08102948000109"></a>I will not go over the ground covered by the noble Lords, Lord Walton and Lord Winston, and the previous speaker, but I re-emphasise that we have legislation; we have a committee on human fertilisation and embryology; we have procedures that look very carefully at these matters; and we have research grants and a process for choosing the best that works well. Ultimately, to put it bluntly, the purpose of this amendment is to impede a certain class of research within that, and that is why I oppose it.</p>

I want to focus on the implications of its wording. It concerns human admixed embryos alone. The purpose of admixed embryos has been driven largely by the difficulty of obtaining human eggs. The implication of the amendment is that there should be no other available method of achieving the

It seems possible that human eggs could be used for embryonic research of this type and that, since the use of admixed embryos is the result of our inability to get human eggs, this amendment would drive research towards using human eggs. I cannot think that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is trying to achieve, therefore this amendment should not be agreed to.</p>

I suppose one might ask, then, what I have to add to this debate. It seems to me that, whereas science has a role in saying whether we can, Parliament has a role in determining whether we should. That seems a pretty simple role, and on that basis I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in his amendment. Characteristically, he is asking the House and those in the parliamentary process to think again, to pause for thought. That is wise. As I have gone through this Bill, as well as the excellent briefing papers that are available in the Library, I have tried to absorb the material&#151;but the complexity of the issues at stake is bewildering. For that reason, considering matters again more carefully is very important.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08102948000112"></a>As well as giving due consideration, another protection in this process is the use of language. It is critical that we say what we mean. When we use terms that are euphemistic, such as &#147;admixed embryos&#148; when we are talking about human-animal mixes, clearly that can lead people to draw different conclusions to those they would come to if we were more explicit about what they meant.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08102948000113"></a>Having made those two points, I support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08102948000115"></a>Like other noble Lords, I commend the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on the very temperate way in which he introduced his amendment on an issue on which he feels very strongly. It helps the quality of debate if he is able to move amendments as he has today. However, he has not answered the query that some of us addressed to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, who is unfortunately not here today, when she raised a very similar issue at an earlier stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08102948000116"></a>I take it in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment&#151;and he will correct me if I have misunderstood it&#151;that when he says,</p>

<p><a name="08102948000184"></a>by &#147;purposes&#148; he means outcomes. In that case, my question remains how you know until you have done it. You will know the outcomes of this procedure only when you can compare it with a result by some other means. Unless you follow all avenues, only then do you know which is the more fruitful; what you cannot do is a series of linear experiments, because at that point you cannot know what hurdle you seek to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08102948000117"></a>This amendment presents a post hoc ergo propter hoc argument. You already have to know the outcome you would have achieved without doing it so that you therefore know you can get to the same outcome by some other way that you can take. Forgive me, but that is no way in which to conduct research, and certainly not scientific research.</p>

The debate has rather turned into a conception of the amendment as an attack on all embryonic research, which plainly it is not. It does not seek to make the world rotate in the reverse direction.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08102948000119"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Walton and Lord Patel, have both described the amendment as unnecessary&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Patel, because scientists are so fixated on purity that they would not do anything other than what the amendment suggests. I have to say that that is not my experience. The noble Lord, Lord May, thinks that acceptance of the amendment would somehow inhibit research, which was a point not agreed on by his colleagues. I want to broaden the debate and talk about what the amendment seeks to do and what effects it might have.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08102948000120"></a>We have been told&#151;and, therefore, most journalists and members of the public believe&#151;that most future cures lie with embryonic stem cell research, that there is a shortage of human eggs necessary for such research and that, therefore, we should use animal eggs to create admixed human embryos. There are still big doubts about whether these cells will yield any treatment at all and it is my contention, which I hope to demonstrate, that the proposals are unproven, unnecessary and unethical.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08102948000121"></a>First, they are unproven. Embryonic stem cells are difficult to obtain, develop and maintain. They are unstable, and mutate in culture. The fact that they produce cancerous tumours when transplanted into animals has led to an understandable reticence in using them in any human therapeutic trials. It is clear that clone cells, used to address the problem of immune rejection, are not normal cells. That is why it took 277 attempts to produce Dolly the sheep and why no one has yet grown a human clone to a stage mature enough to harvest stem cells from it.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08102948000122"></a>Secondly, embryonic stem cells obtained from animals are unnecessary. The ethical alternative of adult stem cells is already used to treat more than 70 diseases and, similarly, umbilical cord stem cells are being used in treatments and are easily and cheaply harvested. The website of the National Institutes of Health this month shows 2,170 clinical trials involving adult stem cells, 125 of which involved cord blood stem cells, but not one clinical trial in humans involving embryonic stem cells. That says volumes and it is not an exceptional month. Adult stem cells require limited, if any, manipulation and are readily available from a number of sources, comparatively at least. They are already providing cures in humans and there are no ethical concerns in their use, making them acceptable to virtually all patients and healthcare providers.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08102948000123"></a>A number of people have referred to the fact&#151;and I return to it now&#151;that the use of embryonic stem cells is believed to be unethical by large sections of the British community, including scientists, who regard human embryos as vulnerable human lives worthy of respect and protection. Many believe that the production of animal-human hybrids crosses a moral Rubicon and, of course, a species barrier, and that the &#147;end&#148; of providing treatments, if it were technically possible, does not justify the &#147;means&#148; of destroying human life even at its earliest stage.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08102948000124"></a>The morning after the other place had voted to allow the creation of animal-human embryos, Mark Henderson, the science correspondent in the <I>Times</I>, who led a vigorous campaign for cloned animal-human embryos, struck a note of sober caution. He wrote that,</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000242"></a>&#147;admixed embryos ... are not going to lead to immediate medical breakthroughs ... any insight they might offer into diseases such as Parkinson&#146;s and Alzheimer&#146;s are probably years away&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000185"></a>But,</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000243"></a>&#147;they could be used to investigate how diabetes and motor neurone disease progress and to develop and test new drugs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000186"></a>Those are valuable things. But if Mark Henderson, the enthusiast, is now so cautious, we may conclude that some of the claims made in this House and in another place have been somewhat overstated. In this connection, I go back to a debate held in this Chamber around 15 years ago, when the promises were extravagant and imminent.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08102948000125"></a>Finally, in these uncertain economic times, but also in any good stewardship, we should be investing most heavily in those research avenues which are most likely to produce cures in the foreseeable future with fair certainty. It is not simply a matter of keeping all avenues open but of putting our money into research that is likely to yield results affecting people and not necessarily extending the boundaries of human knowledge as an end in itself. I strongly urge noble Lords to lend their support to Amendment No. 2A.</p>

The House has voted and has made its position clear, the issue has also been debated and voted on in the other place, and Members of that House agreed to the position in the Bill as it left this House. Therefore let us be clear that the current position in the Bill on this issue reflects the agreed position between the two Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08102948000127"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, seeks to restrict the use of human admixed embryos for purposes of research. The effect would be that embryonic stem cell research using human admixed embryos could be carried out only as a last resort. Before any research project involving the creation or use of human admixed embryos could be licensed by the HFEA, it would have to be satisfied that the use of human admixed embryos is necessary. This means that if there were any other way of carrying out the research without using a human admixed embryo, or human embryo, the project could not be licensed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08102948000128"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, would ensure that a human admixed embryo was created or used if the research could not be achieved by any other means. At best, the amendment is unnecessary, because of provisions already in the Bill that ensure that research projects can be licensed only if the creation of the human admixed embryo is necessary. However, at worst, the amendment could force researchers down the route of using human embryos in preference to human admixed embryos. That would also mean that scarce human eggs would be used over animal eggs for some projects, and would be a significant obstacle to research.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08102948000129"></a>A major issue in embryonic stem cell research is the shortage of human eggs to be used in the creation of embryos. Scientists and the Government have listened carefully to arguments from the scientific community about the need to create admixed embryos for research. As I said earlier, the matter has been closely scrutinised by parliamentary Select Committees, and voted on in the other place and in your Lordships&#146; House. An amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, concerning human admixed embryos was debated on the Floor of this House on Report and defeated by 268 votes to 96.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08102948000130"></a>At present, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority must assess whether the use of embryos or human-admixed embryos is necessary to achieve the purposes of research projects. The research must also be necessary or desirable for one of the statutory processes set out in Schedule 2. Amendment No. 2A would mean not only that the use of human-admixed embryos for the purposes of the research should be necessary, but that the research was unable to be achieved by any other method. This would be contrary to the purpose of using human admixed embryos, which is as a means of researching serious diseases while overcoming the problem of the scarcity of human eggs.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08102948000131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked whether we are aware of such research leading to a cure anywhere in the world. We are in early days. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, pointed out, if we do not do the research, we will not be able to find that out. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, eloquently referenced a number of promising early research results. The Government want to see research moving for all sources of stem cells. The country leads research in this field.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08102948000132"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to a scientist who was leaving this country. For every scientist leaving, many have been attracted here to do research in this field, one of whom is Stephen Minger, who has come to the UK because of the legislative framework in place in the UK.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08102948000133"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked whether the HFEA has ever refused a licence. It has never done so, because the HFEA executive works with the licence applicant to ensure that the application is satisfactory before it can reach the licensing committee. At the same time, the HFEA requires the applications to be peer-reviewed to ensure that they are necessary and desirable, and meet the criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08102948000134"></a>We have debated this matter in both Houses. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment but I invite the House to resist it if he presses it.</p>

Indeed, I am grateful to everyone who has participated in it, especially to my noble friend Lord Tombs, who I am pleased to see back in his customary place. I am grateful also to the noble Lords, Lord Patten and Lord Bates, for their support for my amendment.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08102948000136"></a>The House will be relieved to know that I will not detain noble Lords for long. I will briefly deal with some of the arguments raised. I have not, in this amendment, invited the House to return to the debate mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, which we had nearly a year ago. This amendment would not prohibit embryonic stem cell research. It would not prohibit the creation of animal-human hybrids. It invites the House to require the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to seek from every licence applicant, and from the licensing authority, an undertaking that, before using admixed embryos, alternatives had been explored.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08102948000137"></a>I come to the point properly raised in our previous debates by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. I agree that this is not about trying to predict outcomes, but about methodology. It is not unreasonable in these changed circumstances&#151;and they have changed even as we have considered this Bill, because we now have induced pluripotent stem cells, which are embryonic in nature, created from our own skin and do not require the creation of human embryos&#151;to say that this is a satisfactory alternative with which all of us can live. We should therefore require the authority simply to consider that question; not the creation and use, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, said, of more eggs; not the creation of human embryos, as the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, said; but the use of adult stem cells, and, through them, the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells as a legitimate alternative to the manufacture of human embryos. I use &#147;manufacture&#148; not in a pejorative or rhetorical way, but I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that 2 million human embryos have been destroyed or experimented on, either through IVF or experimentation&#151;these figures were given earlier in the debate&#151;since we authorised the creation of human embryos in 1990. If any Member of the House could say that this has led to cures, it might lend legitimacy to the argument. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Patten, and others have pointed out, it has not. It is not unreasonable, in 2008, to say that if this is still just about hope, it is not something on which we should place too much reliance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08102948000138"></a>I will be happy to give these papers that have been passed to me to the noble Lord, Lord Winston. I can give him a copy of a briefing produced by Professor David Prentice, in which he lists, as the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, has done, more than 70 different conditions that have been successfully treated using adult stem cells. It is true that some treatments have been by bone marrow, but there have been other examples, too. I chaired a briefing in the Moses Room of your Lordships&#146; House in which Professor Carlos Lima came from

A television programme, <I>Miracle Cell, </I>was produced using that material. These are some examples.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08102948000139"></a>The noble Lord, Lord May, agreed with me&#151;there is common ground here&#151;that none of us should overhype the potential of these cells, whether they are from embryos or adult stem cells, because there are many people suffering from debilitating conditions for whom this must seem like a tantalising solution, when it is still probably a long way off. I will be happy to share that information.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08102948000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Winston, and others made a point about the comparative amounts of money allocated by the Medical Research Council to these two areas of research. I have the figures here and am happy to share them. In 2005-06, &#163;17.4 million was made available by the Medical Research Council, of which 43.6 per cent was spent on adult stem cells and 56.4 per cent&#151;significantly more&#151;on embryonic stem cells. I say to my noble friend Lord Patel that, instead of the trend being in that direction, the reverse is true. In 2006, the figure was 46 per cent spent on adult stem cells and 54 per cent on embryonic stem cells. There is every indication that the work that Professor Colin McGuckin has undertaken at Newcastle has, as he said, been discriminated against. I think that we should take that seriously, but those are not the arguments that your Lordships are being asked to vote on this evening.</p>

<a name="81029-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08102948000141"></a>The amendment is very clear. It states:</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000244"></a>&#147;in any circumstances where the purposes of the proposed research can be achieved by any method not entailing the use of human admixed embryos&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000187"></a>Therefore, it would be down to the person applying for the licence and for those sitting on the licensing authority to satisfy themselves of those facts before they proceeded to issue such a licence. I think that this is a moderate amendment and I hope that noble Lords will be prepared to support it. I wish to seek the opinion of the House.</p>

I shall also speak to their Amendments Nos. 5 and 30. These amendments follow discussions in this House and relate to human admixed embryos.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08102948000147"></a>The Bill sets out a clear definition of human admixed embryos and ensures that all such embryos are regulated and may not be created without a licence. Government Amendment No. 3 amends the definition of human admixed embryos. The Bill uses the term &#147;human admixed embryo&#148; as an umbrella term for all four embryo types containing human and animal genetic material. These range from those that are, in simple terms, 99 per cent genetically human through to those that are 50 per cent genetically human. The Bill also contains the power to amend these categories of human admixed embryos should new scientific advances be made.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08102948000148"></a>However, by not providing a catch-all definition of &#147;human admixed embryo&#148;, the Bill raised concerns as it passed through this House. In particular, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, tabled  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1620"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an amendment seeking to add to the Bill a fifth, more general definition of &#147;human admixed embryo&#148;. This definition, developed in collaboration with the Academy of Medical Sciences, provided a clear statement that a human admixed embryo is any embryo containing human and animal genetic material where the animal material does not predominate. The Government undertook to consider this amendment further in the other place.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08102948000149"></a>Amendment No. 3 captures the essence of the noble and learned Lord&#146;s amendment. It adds a general category of admixed embryos, where,</p>
<ul><a name="08102948000245"></a>&#147;the animal DNA is not predominant&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08102948000188"></a>thereby giving a clearer idea of the range of entities caught by the Bill. This new category will replace the existing regulation-making power to create new categories of human admixed embryos. However, as there is an additional regulation-making power introduced by Amendment No. 2 to amend the existing categories in the light of scientific advances, this will not impede future flexibility. Amendment No. 5 would make consequential amendments to ensure that the power to amend the categories of human admixed embryos applies to the new catch-all provision. Amendment No. 30 is a consequential amendment to the removal of the regulation-making power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08102948000150"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has tabled an amendment to Amendment 3, to which I shall respond after he has moved it.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08102953000002"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I begin by doing something that the Minister may not necessarily expect of me&#151;expressing my appreciation for government Amendment No. 3. At earlier stages of the Bill, my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay, with his characteristic succinctness, expressed considerable misgivings about the wording in Clause 4(5)(e) which was designed as a catch-all provision, but which seemed to him and to many of us unsatisfactorily vague and inappropriate in terms of the language that it employed. Government Amendment No. 3 is a distinct improvement on the original wording and I thank the Minister for having considered the matter so constructively.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08102953000003"></a>My concern is that the government amendment before us, although it is undoubtedly a step forward, may not be quite good enough. Noble Lords may remember that in Committee I pointed out a lack of legal clarity in relation to the interface between this Bill and the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. There appeared to be an unsatisfactory grey area in terms of whether human/animal admixed embryos were covered by one piece of legislation or the other. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, has just put the issue very well, as he did at Third Reading, when he said  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1621"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Bill should ensure that the HFEA regulates human-animal embryos at the human end of the spectrum. We should, therefore, try to ensure in the legal definition of a human admixed embryo that any new form of embryo that may be developed containing human and animal DNA, and where the human DNA predominates, is subject to HFEA regulation.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08102953000004"></a>The wording in Amendment No. 3 attempts to encapsulate that idea. However, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding pointed out in Committee, science is not always as simple as we might sometimes like it to be. The difficulty here relates to the way in which hybrid embryos can develop. My noble friend quoted part of Professor Robin Lovell-Badge&#146;s evidence to the Joint Committee. The professor said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="08102953000025"></a>&#147;You may start off with an embryo which is 20 per cent human and end up with something which is 60 per cent human or vice versa&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102953000005"></a>We need, therefore, to deal satisfactorily with those cases where the human DNA might only comprise a minority proportion of the total DNA at the beginning of the life of the embryo but would end up predominating.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08102953000006"></a>I am not clear that the wording of government Amendment No. 3 would cover an embryo of this type. Such an embryo would evade regulation under the Bill, because it would not have predominantly human DNA within the first 14 days and could, therefore, in theory and perfectly legally under the 1986 Act be implanted into an animal, and perhaps be taken to mid-gestation without even requiring a licence for the research project. The additional words that I propose at the end of new paragraph (e) would bring under the ambit of this Bill all embryos deliberately created whereby it could be reasonably predicted that the animal DNA would not ultimately predominate. However, if such an embryo were implanted and, under the 1986 Act, allowed to develop in an animal, and be found subsequently to be predominantly human, all future such embryos would come under the ambit of the HFEA, because the ultimate outcome would be known.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08102953000007"></a>My second concern is slightly different. We could imagine a situation, as science moves on, whereby an animal embryo is created with a predominantly or entirely human brain. The DNA of the entire embryo could still be predominantly animal. However, Parliament might wish in the future not to permit the creation of a human-animal embryo of this kind. Rather than leave this and other unforeseeable scenarios to the mercies of the Home Office, it would be preferable to leave the opportunity open to Parliament to take a decision in specific cases that are particularly ethically sensitive.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08102953000008"></a>The role of the Home Office would not be interrupted. However, in exceptional cases, should there be objections among the general public or in Parliament to a particularly sensitive type of chimeric creature, such as a non-human primate or large animal with, for example, a largely human brain, the second part of my amendment would provide a regulation-making power to deal with that situation. I am sorry that in the process of improving this part of the Bill the Government decided to jettison the regulation-making power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08102953000009"></a>I very much hope that my concerns on these issues are misplaced and that the Minister will be able to reassure me on them. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08102953000010"></a><a name="81029-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81029-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08102953000028"></a>Lord Mackay of Clashfern:</b> My Lords, I should, first, thank the Minister and his colleagues for the further consideration that has been given to this matter since the Bill left this House for a somewhat prolonged sojourn in another place. Here it is back with us with an amendment in almost the same terms as the amendment that I originally proposed.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08102953000011"></a>When the draft Bill was before the committee examining it, it contained a catch-all clause after listing the four examples that remain in the Bill. Unfortunately, none of the experts that gave evidence to our committee could understand the clause. If they could not understand it, we thought that on the whole it was not adequate for the purpose of defining the entity that we had in mind.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08102953000012"></a>When the Bill ultimately came to your Lordships&#146; House, that portion had been deleted altogether, and in its place had been put a regulation-making power of somewhat ambiguous import. In other words, the Government had given up the idea that they could define in a catch-all way what they meant by this type of embryo. I felt, as did other noble Lords, that that was not satisfactory and we should do what we could to agree to a satisfactory catch-all definition that would not interfere with the four examples in the Bill, but demonstrate in essence their characteristics, as an explanation of the concept of an admixed human embryo.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08102953000013"></a>I should perhaps have mentioned that originally a different phrase was used. The phrase &#147;admixed human embryo&#148; was adopted during the passage of the Bill through this House. It is not a self-evident expression. An ordinary person will have some difficulty understanding the phrase. I believe&#151;this may be the general view in the House&#151;that it would be useful to produce what, in effect, is an explanation of the phrase at the same time as a catchall.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08102953000014"></a>There are a number of ways of approaching the matter. One is to say that everything that is not caught by the Home Office would be caught here, but unfortunately the approach of the Home Office in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is quite different: it concerned pain to animals. If human material is involved, there does not seem to be any particular criterion about the importance that that extra fact confers on the embryo. Therefore, here we have successfully defined the human end of the spectrum of mixture.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08102953000015"></a>It would be highly desirable for the rest of the spectrum to be looked at from the point of view of appropriate regulation. I do not think that the 1986 Act, which, after all, is a little elderly, is adequate to deal with the kind of considerations involved when less than 50 per cent human material is introduced into animals. Many people to whom I have spoken or who have spoken to me about the Bill did not know that such an end of the spectrum existed and has existed in practical terms for some time. The Government would do well to consider whether a different form of control or regulation is required at the other end of the spectrum.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1623"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1623</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08102953000016"></a>Perhaps because I had some part in framing this definition, I think it is entirely satisfactory. The use of the word &#147;predominant&#148;, a word we hit on in the discussions to which the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, has referred with the eminent scientists who were willing to talk to us about it, is a general word which covers the whole period of an embryo's existence. Therefore, you look at whether the animal DNA is to predominate. If it does, it leaves this definition and, if not, it stays within it.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08102953000017"></a>My view is that the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Howe is not necessary. However, we discussed it before and it is important to raise it now so that the precise scope of the word &#147;predominate&#148; might be discussed at this stage which might help in any future matter which may arise in court or in some other way. I thank the Minister very much for what he has said. I certainly support government Amendment No. 3 and I say that Amendment No. 3A tabled by my noble friend is not necessary, although I believe this discussion is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="08102953000018"></a><a name="81029-0009.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81029-0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08102953000029"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the Government on Amendment No. 3, which is a very worthy attempt to deal with the issues which were so cogently argued by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, when this matter was last before the House. I am sufficiently attracted by certain features of the amendment now proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but at the same time I agree very much with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, that it does not seem to be necessary.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08102953000019"></a>Amendment No. 3 as it stands is the outcome of detailed discussions between the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Government and deals with a fifth category of admixed embryo. It relies on an alternative regulation-making power in new Section 4A to amend the five categories to catch any other entities. The only problem is that it still is not totally and completely inclusive in one respect: the Amendment No. 3 approach is not entirely clear in that it does not specify precisely how an embryo is to be treated where the proportion of animal DNA varies such that it may predominate at some point but not at another. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, will deal with that in his reply.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08102953000020"></a>One example of that&#151;I have received a two-page briefing from Professor Robin Lovell-Badge&#151;is the issue of tetraploid complementation and diploid complementation, but I do not understand those sufficiently to be able to impose the details on your Lordships' House. Therefore, I leave that matter in the worthy hands of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. I hope that he can deal with the issue as to why, in some respects, this amendment, which is very satisfactory in many ways, is not totally complete and must be kept under review by the Government in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08102953000022"></a>To confuse the matter further, all the evidence from animal studies suggests that for tetraploid complementation, mentioned by my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant, to happen the two species have to be very close. For example, tetraploid complementation will work in sheep and goat embryonic cells, but not in those of mice or rats. For it to work in humans, therefore, it will have to be a closely related species such as a chimpanzee. The transfer of an embryo into an animal will require a Home Office licence and that will not be permitted. If such an entity were created at some point, not too far along in the development of the embryo, it would grow faster than the embryonic tissues, so it is important to know at what point we are talking about. If, for example, it was in a human, I believe&#151;I might be wrong&#151;that could occur at what we call gastrulation. I think the Minister understands what I mean. In humans it would be about 14 days when organs are beginning to be defined. However, for the purposes of this Bill and the research, embryos will not be allowed to be experimented on beyond 14 days and for the purposes of obtaining stem cells, we are talking about four to six days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08102953000023"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has some issues to be discussed but they may not be directly applicable to this Bill. The fact that the Government in the Commons retained a regulation-making power in new Section 4A(10) which allows existing categories to be amended, may mean that, in future, if necessary, we could discuss this again.</p>

I shall try to explain that. I can appreciate why the noble Earl may think this is necessary, but I can assure him that the provisions in the Bill already address this situation.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08102957000012"></a>If it were considered that an embryo was to be created in which the human DNA would ultimately<I></I>predominate, an application for an admixed research licence would have to be made to the HFEA at the outset. This is because a licence is required to bring about the creation of a human admixed embryo. If a researcher was intending to create an embryo that would at some stage be predominantly human, for however short that time might be, they would need a licence to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08102957000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, also referred to tetraploid complementation where the cells of an early animal embryo are altered so that they contain twice the usual complement of DNA. These cells could give rise only to extra-embryonic tissue&#151;for example, a placenta&#151;and any human cells placed within it could give rise to the embryo proper. It would be an admixed embryo for the purposes of the new catch-all category that the Bill is adding to the definition of human admixed embryo at Clause 4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08102957000014"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, adds a regulation-making power to the categories of human admixed embryos to enable the definition to be extended. That was the position the Bill was in when it was last considered by your Lordships' House. We listened to persuasive arguments at that time that such a provision was too open, and we therefore replaced it with a category proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, of any other embryo containing animal and human DNA where the animal DNA does not predominate. In the case of an embryo in which the brain might be predominantly animal, it is worth reminding ourselves what we mean by &#147;predominant&#148;. We refer not only to the percentage of the DNA but also to its location and functionality. If that entity had a human brain, that could clearly have a predominant function so, by definition, it would be at the human end of the spectrum of human admixed embryos and would require an HFEA licence.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08102957000015"></a>The amendments are therefore not necessary and could lead to a lack of clarity in the Bill as they overlap with the current provisions. I invite the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="08102957000016"></a><a name="81029-0009.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="81029-0009.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08102957000159"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, that was a very helpful reply, and I am grateful to noble Lords who spoke in this short debate. As the Minister will appreciate, my worry was that it did not seem to me to be totally clear from the wording of the Commons amendment that embryos that would alter their composition to contain predominantly human DNA post-14 days would all be captured. The Minister reassured us that the word &#147;predominate&#148; will cover all scenarios, but my problem is that the word &#147;predominate&#148; relates to an embryo, rather than a foetus, which is the term that would relate to the embryo at a later stage of its development where the proportion of animal and human DNA changes during development. A mid or late gestation foetus would definitely not be classified as an embryo. My amendment, which is inserted at the end of the government amendment, retains all the careful wording that my noble and learned friend helped to develop and clarifies that no matter how late in the potential development of the organism, which could be as late as the point of birth, if the human DNA ultimately predominated, it would be included as a human admixed embryo and thus would not be allowed to develop to that stage. After listening to the Minister&#146;s reply, I am not totally secure that he has covered that point because of the use of the word &#147;embryo&#148; rather than &#147;foetus&#148;.</p>

<a name="81029-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08102957000017"></a>I listened with care to his helpful answer on the second part of my amendment. He clarified that the amendment covers not only the percentage of DNA, but also the functionality of the tissue. I had not appreciated that, and I do not think I could have been expected to from a bald reading of the wording of the amendment. It is valuable that that will go down in <I>Hansard</I> to be read. Unless the Minister wants to come back to me on the point I made about &#147;embryo&#148; as opposed to &#147;foetus&#148;, which is a significant point, I will bow to his reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08102957000029"></a>During passage of the Bill through this House, debate took place on the use of embryonic stem cells, derived under a research licence, in therapeutic applications. The Government subsequently wrote to all Peers involved in those discussions setting out how, in the Government&#146;s view, embryonic stem cells derived under an HFEA research licence could be used in therapeutic applications.</p>

<a name="81029-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08102957000030"></a>These amendments were made in the light of that debate to ensure that research centres deriving embryonic stem cells, where those stem cells are intended for therapeutic use, are required to abide by the quality and safety standards set out in the European Union tissue and cells directive in relation to the stem cells and the embryos from which they are derived.</p>

<a name="81029-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08102957000031"></a>The directive lays down standards of quality and safety for human tissues and cells intended for human application, including gametes and embryos. The relevant requirements already apply to embryos used in reproductive treatment as a result of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Quality and Safety) Regulations 2007. Stem cells derived from embryos are also regulated under the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations 2007. It is important that these standards are also applied to the embryos that are used to derive stem cells to be used in human application to ensure the necessary levels of quality and safety of any tissue to be used in treatment.</p>

Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are purely technical and ensure consistency with the wording of the new Section 13(6) of the 1990 Act, as inserted by Clause 14 of the Bill. The amendments replace the words &#147;the woman being treated&#148; in the new Section 13(6B)(a) and the words,</p>

<p><a name="08102957000034"></a>This is to make clear that the reference in new Section 13(6B)(a) and (b) refers back to the woman mentioned in new Section 13(6A).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08102957000035"></a>Amendment No. 13 is simply a minor drafting amendment, removing the superfluous words &#147;any of&#148; in reference to the three paragraphs of new Section 31ZD(3) in connection with the disclosure of information to donors. Amendment No. 32 makes a minor drafting correction to Clause 40. It is purely technical and changes the words in the clause to &#147;the man&#148; instead of &#147;a man&#148;, as currently drafted. I turn now to Amendments Nos. 33 and 35. In Clause 43 the woman being treated is referred to as &#147;W&#148;. Amendment

Amendment No. 35 makes a similar correction to Clause 46; the amendment replaces a reference to &#147;the woman&#148; with &#147;W&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08102957000036"></a>Amendment No. 37 relates to Clause 50, which makes clear what a civil partnership is for the purpose of Clauses 35 to 47. This provision is equivalent to the provision in Clause 49 relating to marriage. The clause makes clear that a civil partnership is one which has been subsisting, unless a separation order is in force, and it includes the parties to a void civil partnership if either or both parties reasonably believed it was valid. Currently Clause 50 applies the definition to &#147;the&#148; reference to civil partnerships, but it needs to apply to &#147;any&#148; reference to civil partnerships at any time in Clauses 35 to 47. Amendment No. 37 is therefore a grammatical correction to Clause 50, which ensures that the meaning of civil partnership applies to any reference to civil partnership in Clauses 35 to 47 of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08102957000037"></a>Amendment No. 40 makes a minor amendment to Clause 55, which provides for the Secretary of State to be able to make regulations relating to enactments about adoption. Clause 55(3) lists what the enactments about adoption are. Amendment No. 40 makes a technical change to Clause 55(3) to ensure that it reads consistently with Clause 55(1) by changing &#147;enactments relating to adoption&#148; to &#147;enactments about adoption&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08102957000038"></a>Amendment No. 56 is a drafting amendment to ensure consistency in situations where consent is required. This amendment is consequential to the embryo training provisions in the Bill, which allow embryologists to train using donated embryos. Provisions in the Bill ensure that before an embryo is received by any person, effective consent to the use of that embryo must be in place. Under the Bill, this consent could be to treatment, research or both. This amendment adds that consent could have been given for the use of an embryo in training. The person receiving the embryo must ensure that consent to one or more of these purposes is in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08102957000039"></a>Amendment No. 95 corrects the amendments in Schedule 6 to the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 so that reference to &#147;that person&#148; is replaced with &#147;the woman concerned&#148; to reflect the definition inserted into Section 10(1B)(b)(i) of &#147;a woman concerned&#148; as a parent of a child by virtue of Clause 43 of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 are also technical and correct the amendment to the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965 so that the references to &#147;other parent of the child&#148; and references to the &#147;person&#148; are replaced by &#147;the woman concerned&#148; to reflect the definition inserted into Section 18B(1) of &#147;a woman concerned&#148; as the parent of a child by virtue of Clause 43 of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08102957000040"></a>Amendments Nos. 96, 97, 101 and 102 make technical corrections to ensure that the Bill refers to the formation of a civil partnership and not the time of the civil partnership. This is because Section 1 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 defines a civil partnership as the relationship, not the ceremony. Therefore, references to entry into marriage cannot be translated to civil partnerships. Amendment No. 100 is a drafting correction to change the reference in Section 18B(3)(b) of the

However, at present the 1990 Act is not as conducive to this as it could be. For instance, it prohibits the HFEA from disclosing identity information about patients, even where the patient consents to such disclosure. We regard this as too restrictive. In particular, it is not helpful for follow-up research into the effects of infertility treatment on patients and their children. At present, such research could not draw on information from the HFEA that identified the patient, even if the patient was very keen to see the research take place and had consented to the disclosure of their information.</p>

<a name="81029-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08102957000046"></a>To help this, Clause 25 introduces a provision that allows the HFEA to disclose information from its register of treatment with the consent of the people identified. Following the debate in this House and amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, we gave further consideration to the detail of the new provision. In particular, we have looked at the relationship between disclosure and consent in certain situations. As a result, we have identified where the Bill could benefit from greater clarification. The amendments that we have tabled address this. The group of amendments provides that disclosure of identifying information about a person aged under 18 must have their consent or, if they are not competent to consent, the consent of someone who has parental responsibility for them. This is important, as researchers may well want information about the child in order to undertake follow-up research into their health. This could be a sensitive issue for the child and it is only right that their consent to the disclosure of information is obtained.</p>

<a name="81029-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08102957000047"></a>The amendments also ensure that the consent provisions do not allow for the provisions in the 1990 Act and the Bill for the disclosure of identifying information about donors to be inadvertently circumvented. Those specific provisions in Section 31(3) to (7) of the 1990 Act, and carried forward by new Sections 31ZA and 31ZB in Clause 24 of the Bill set out the circumstances in which the HFEA can disclose identifying donor information. They provide, for instance, that identifying information about donors can only be provided to a relevant person aged 18 or over. The amendments ensure that this remains the correct route by which identifying donor information, with all its associated sensitivities, is disclosed by the HFEA to people who may be born as a result of such treatment. The amendments make these circumstances exceptions to the new provisions for the HFEA to release information with the consent of those identified. In doing so, they remove, for example, the risk of parents putting pressure on the HFEA to approach a donor for consent to his identifying information being released to them and their child. I beg to move.</p>

If the summons is not complied with, it is an offence under the 1990 Act. This is set out in Section 41(7) of the Act, which states that if there is not a reasonable excuse as to why the summons for evidence has not been complied with, a person is guilty of an offence. The Bill has the same power for an appeals or licence committee to require evidence but does not, as currently drafted, make it an offence not to comply with the request. These amendments would ensure that the power under new Sections 19B and 20B could be enforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08102957000054"></a>Clause 21 introduces two regulation-making powers, at new Sections 20A(3) and 20B(2), to make provision for the proceedings and membership of an appeals committee, and procedure in relation to reconsideration of licence decisions. It was deemed appropriate to make these provisions through regulations rather than in the Bill so that the detail could be consulted upon. Both regulations are subject to negative resolution under the Bill. Amendment No. 28 makes these regulations subject to the affirmative procedure, and follows discussions on this issue during Public Bill Committee in another place. In light of these discussions, and taking into account the likely interest and importance of these regulations, I believe that the affirmative procedure is more appropriate. The Department of Health will consult on the detail of these regulations in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08102957000077"></a>Given the lack of opportunity for scrutiny of Clauses 42 and 43, and attendant concerns that questions will be asked about our parliamentary process, I have been more than happy to table the amendment in my name that seeks to provide opportunity for greater scrutiny of these two clauses. I will first outline some of the problems of these provisions before focusing on the consultation proposed in my amendment.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08102957000078"></a>Currently, at the point of conception, every child has a chance of having a father as a parent during their childhood. I stress the word &#147;chance&#148; because there is no right to have a father than the law can guarantee. In this regard, there are at least two scenarios which we need to keep in view. First, disaster might strike; tragically, some fathers are killed before the birth of their children. Secondly, we must have regard  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1635"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1635</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for women who become pregnant either naturally or by IVF, with no immediate prospect of a present father who can input into the child&#146;s life. At the point of conception, however, both have the chance of having a father because in the first instance, we do not know that the father will die, and in the second, the fact that a woman is not married or living with a partner when she becomes pregnant does not mean that it is intended that she will remain that way for the duration of the child&#146;s childhood. She may marry at a later stage, and then the child would enjoy access to a social father for a period.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08102957000079"></a>While the law cannot guarantee a present father, it would surely be quite wrong, in my view, for the state to put in place a legal framework to allow for the deliberate creation of children with the intention that they should be denied the chance of ever having a father throughout their childhood, yet this is precisely the effect of the clauses before us.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08102957000080"></a>In making this point, I am keenly aware that some will say that with gay adoption legal, the point of principle has been conceded, and Clauses 42 and 43 simply outwork its implications in the context of IVF. This, however, is completely untrue. When a child is conceived who is later adopted by a lesbian couple, they have the chance of being parented by a father and may well have been parented by a father for a period. These children were not deliberately created with official sanction of the intention that they should be denied a father for the duration of childhood. While an argument can be made that despite the evidence suggesting the importance of fathers, it is better for children to be looked after by a loving same-sex family than for them to be in an institution, it is not appropriate&#151;given the balance of research which clearly demonstrates the importance of fathers to the well-being of children as well as the importance of children&#146;s rights&#151; deliberately to create children with the intention that they should be denied a father for the duration of their childhood.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08102957000081"></a>When I was at school, we were told how bad things were for children in the 19th century. We were told how the upper classes suffered under a regime in which they were to be seen and not heard and how the lower classes were sent up chimneys and down mines. Since then, our teachers told us, things have improved, and in many ways they clearly have. But this legislation causes me big concerns. It shows a preoccupation with the rights of adults and would-be parents and loses sight of the importance of the rights of the child. In highlighting this point, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who has prepared a legal opinion on the parenthood implications of the Bill. The opinion concludes that the changes proposed in the legislation,</p>
<ul><a name="08102957000154"></a>&#147;introduce an imbalance of human rights protections as between same-sex parents and the child. It is often said that in matters such as adoption, the best interests of the child are paramount. I do not see how the best interests of the child are served by the introduction of these changes&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81029-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08102957000082"></a>Given the problems with Clauses 42 and 43, not least in relation to human rights, it seems only appropriate that we should pause before implementing these extremely controversial proposals. As well as revisiting the human rights arguments in light of the balance of current research about what is in the child&#146;s best interests, I also think it is vital to listen to the views of children  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1636"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1636</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and young people specifically. It is interesting that the consultation process that went before the Bill&#151;the 2005 review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act&#151;managed to construe some key questions without even mentioning the child directly. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_112"></a><a name="08102957000150"></a>&#147;The Government seeks views on whether the status and legal parenthood provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act should apply to same-sex couples who do not form a civil partnership. If so, how would automatic recognition of parenthood be achieved, given the lack of legal ties between the couple?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102957000108"></a>It is almost as if the child were not there.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08102957000083"></a>The provision of an appropriate focused consultation exercise with children and young people would be entirely appropriate given the Government&#146;s commitment to consult with children and young people in the Children&#146;s Plan. Indeed, it seems to me that if the Government are to consult with children and young people on anything, they must surely talk to them about controversial proposals such as these which seek deliberately to create children with the intention that they be denied a father for the duration of their childhood and are vulnerable to the accusation that they have been developed out of regard for the interests of adults rather than children.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08102957000084"></a>I very much look forward to hearing the views of other Members of your Lordships' House on this important issue. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="08102957000085"></a><a name="81029-0011.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81029-0011.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08102957000178"></a>Lord Waddington:</b> My Lords, the House will be relieved to hear that I do not look upon this as an opportunity to rehash all the arguments about why, when treatment is being considered, regard should be had to the child&#146;s need for a father. But in view of the fact that there was no debate in the other place of Clauses 42 and 43, I think some brief comments are appropriate.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08102957000086"></a>We often discuss in this place the rights of children, and I find it absolutely astonishing that we are being asked to sanction the deliberate creation of children with the intent that they be denied a father for the duration of their childhood, completely ignoring those children&#146;s rights. That seems so obviously wrong that there is no need for further words of embellishment. But how can it be seriously argued that the right of two women to have a child is so strong that it completely overwhelms and drives out of court other people&#146;s rights, in particular the rights of the child they insist on bringing into the world?</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08102957000087"></a>One of the purposes of the Bill is to ensure that same-sex couples may produce a child by donor, the arrival of the child being the very object of the exercise. I believe that its human rights are as important, if not more important, than the rights of the same-sex couple. I shall certainly support the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment, but must say that I find wholly objectionable the idea that by a legal fiction, a child should find itself with two women as its parents instead of a father and a mother. I do not believe that such a child&#146;s human rights are being properly protected.</p>

If we vote for this amendment today, that will at least result in the issue being sent back to the other place and then, I hope, in the provision of a proper debate by the elected Chamber on this far-reaching issue. I believe that that is our responsibility, regardless of what we think of the issues.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08102957000089"></a>As previous speakers have pointed out, there is all the difference in the world, from the perspective of the rights of the child, between allowing a child to be adopted by a same-sex couple in preference to their remaining in an institution and for the state to provide for their deliberate creation with the intention they be denied a father for the duration of their childhood. It is not clear to me how we can sanction this without allowing the rights of the would-be parents to trump the rights and best interests of the child. As the right reverend Prelate noted, to this degree Clauses 42 and 43 invoke the failings of previous ages albeit in new contexts.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08102957000090"></a>We need to pause. The Government need to study carefully the legal opinion of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan. We need to at least consider and carefully analyse how children themselves will feel about the future, deliberate creation of children with the intention that they be denied a father. There is an undeniable moral argument that, however powerful a Government may consider themselves to be, they should not embark on such a blatantly unnatural procedure as this Bill proposes. Since moral arguments seem to have less consequence today&#151;not least within the higher echelons of new Labour&#151;let me look briefly at a purely social contradiction.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08102957000091"></a>It is a social requirement&#151;I agree with it&#151;that errant fathers should be pursued and legally obliged to provide for the upbringing of their children. How can that obligation possibly be sustained when the Government are today willing to decree that children can be denied a father? What is the essential difference to a child between its father avoiding the responsibility of fatherhood and the Government nullifying its right to have a father? Both are effectively the same. This Bill will create an absolute paradox as it currently stands. Nor do I hear any cogent case to support this contradiction coming from society in general.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08102957000092"></a>Returning to my original point, it is absolutely clear that we must vote for this Motion and provide the opportunity for a debate on the Floor of the other place on the deliberate creation of children with the intention that they be denied a father. We owe this much to children here in the United Kingdom.</p>

On this issue I can say to him, &#147;No surrender&#148;. I agree with everything he has brought to your Lordships&#146; attention. I will not repeat the views I have expressed earlier in Committee and on Report, although it is a sad reflection on the state of participatory democracy that, as the right reverend Prelate said in his splendid introductory remarks, another place did not find the time to discuss something of rather fundamental importance. History will look back sadly and judge this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08102957000094"></a>That said, I have two points to make. First, I recall not points that I made earlier but the whole drift of debate here in Committee and on Report from those who supported this approach. They have been highly utilitarian about supporting the needs, desires and wants of parents who choose not to include a father; they should have those desires satisfied now. No consideration at all has been given to possible adverse effects on children years or decades down the line. Those arguments were rather brushed aside as not being worthy of consideration in the times we live in now. I think that is sad. I am sure that if this particular provision passes into law, sociologists and others will quite quickly be starting generational studies to see what happens to children brought up in this way and how they turn out in 10, 12 or 15 years. I cannot predict the results of that but there are serious issues of concern in proceeding in this way.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08102957000095"></a>Secondly, I genuinely support the Government&#146;s approach over the past 10 years to wider consultation. It has been good. It is sometimes hard to understand or interpret the results, but that is not the Government&#146;s fault. The Government have been exceptionally good at consulting. There is a lesson there for future Governments. Yet I find it extraordinary that this Government, who are so keen on consultation, should choose not to consult children about this key issue. These are their rights. The children we would consult may not be born under these circumstances but when I have consulted those who are called children&#151;albeit statistically a small group&#151;they cannot believe that this sort of thing is happening without their opinion being sought.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08102957000096"></a>It is extraordinary that the Government do not pause and think again on this issue. As the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, said, we should send this back to another place so that they can look properly at it. They can at least demonstrate that they have given some consideration to something which in future years will be seen to be extraordinarily dismissive of the rights of children in a way that flies in the face of so much else that this Government have done concerning the rights of children.</p>

I am well aware that we are discussing something rather less than the rights of children. We are talking about the advice given to would-be parents going through the process.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08102957000099"></a>I have experienced in my previous life extremely good care being exhibited by single-sex parents, both male and female. I also care about the situation in which two men who may exclude women from their lives as I do about two women who may exclude men. We need to bear in mind the fact that if we take out the word &#147;father&#148;, the message that goes out to the public is that fatherhood&#151;and to some extent perhaps motherhood&#151;matters less than I would have thought this Government thought it did.</p>

I say that to make the point that the amendment of the right reverend Prelate is unnecessary for a number of reasons. His amendment to delay the implementation of these two clauses is effectively a wrecking amendment. It takes away the recognition of a woman who is a civil partner of a woman who had received treatment until there has been an 18-month consultation with young people. I will return to the nature of the consultation. To begin, I point out two things.</p>

<a name="81029-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08102957000101"></a>First, on 19 and 20 May, the whole of the House of Commons, on the Floor of the House of Commons&#151;before the Bill was debated in Committee&#151;discussed the issue we have come to know as the need for a father. They did so and, happily, reached the same conclusion as Members of this House: this legislation should reflect the fact that we now have civil partnerships in this country and that there are families of same-sex couples with children.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81029-0012.htm"/>


<a name="81029-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08102957000102"></a>The amendment is unnecessary for another reason: this provision was debated extensively in your Lordships&#146; House. Many noble Lords took part in debates at Second Reading, in Committee, on Report and at Third Reading, where some made Second Reading speeches also. The matter was given a great deal of time. I say that to make the following point. Members of this House decided earlier this year that we should have legislation that acknowledges the existence of those families. It did not do so lightly or without consideration of the best interests of children. Members of this House bothered to read research findings that were presented to them. Some of it, such as the dossier provided by Christian Action Research and Education, turned out not to be research at all but merely anecdotal opinion. The sociological studies that the noble Lord, Lord Patten, mentioned have been going on for some considerable time. Professor Susan Golombok and other colleagues at Cambridge, who are the foremost academics on research into families and fatherhood, presented information that was made freely available to all noble Lords. Some of us, who are diligent enough to believe that it is our duty to look after the best interests of children, read that research and arrived at a conclusion.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08102957000103"></a>Some Members of this House do not accept the conclusions that the majority reached and would rather that civil partnerships did not exist. I think that some Members of this House would rather that gay people did not exist, but they do. They do. The whole point of this legislation was to ensure that children born into those families receive the same legal recognition and protection as other children. What will be achieved by doing what the right reverend Prelate asks? It will defer indefinitely protection for a very small group of children who live in families, meaning that they do not have the legal protection of both their parents. They will not be able to inherit property and financial support as other children do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08102957000104"></a>The right reverend Prelate talks about consultation. Which children and young people would he consult? What would he ask them, and what would he do with the results of the consultation? If we have learned anything over the past 10 months, during which we have looked into all the matters in the Bill, it is that it is very easy for two groups of people to present the same issue completely differently and to elicit from the public diametrically opposite results. I do not believe that that is how we should treat matters of such importance. It is the role of Members of Parliament to consider all the best evidence before them and to come to what they believe is a legislative framework that will look after the rights of children.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08102957000105"></a>We are where we are today in our society. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, was right to remind us of Section 1 of the Children Act. The rights of children are paramount, and some of us who disagree with other noble Lords who have already spoken have kept that to the forefront of our mind throughout debates on this legislation. We have come to the conclusion that it would be right to reflect civil partnership in all its implications and to ensure that children who at the moment do not have the opportunity to grow up in stable and secure families can do so. I hope that noble Lords will recall our earlier discussions and resist the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment.</p>

I was moved by what the right reverend Prelate said and cannot help thinking that nothing said since has successfully rebutted what he alleged at the very beginning of this debate. I simply cannot understand why it can be right in any circumstances to put the child&#146;s interests last; to my mind, they must be put first, as established in previous legislation. In this case, the legislation does not do that; it puts them in a secondary position. We all know how dangerous it is to break with an acknowledged fact&#151;in this case, for instance, that children are very important and should be considered as such because they often have no voice of their own. Once we have agreed that, how can we go back on it? That is what we are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08102959000011"></a>I wish to make one further small point&#151;it seems a big point to me. Surely we are denying children the right to a father not only during their childhood but throughout their life. I have found on many occasions, and many noble Lords will know this from their own family, how a young person over 18 can have as much need and love for his father as a much younger child. I cannot accept this.</p>

I will not repeat the arguments I rehearsed at Second Reading and will be as brief as I can. A couple of years ago, I attended a course in child development. After one of the lectures I asked the lecturer his view on the very question that we are debating this evening. He said that he had no view but added that he was treating a young man who had been brought up in a same-sex partnership, by lesbian parents. He was treating the young man because those parents did not like men.

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08102959000013"></a>I hope that that is a one-off situation, but it is an interesting coincidence that the one time I asked the therapist that question, he pointed out that he was treating a young man who grew up in a same-sex partnership and had those issues. I would appreciate reassurance from the Minister. There must be a concern that at least some of those same-sex parents will have antipathy to the other sex. Does it not really reinforce the argument for ensuring as far as possible that there is at least a father figure for a son to turn to if he grows up in such a situation. That causes me concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08102959000014"></a>I recognise that this is a very complex matter. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, raised the issue of how you implement legislation in this area. Emphasis should be put on the need to struggle with parents to get them to consider what the needs of the child will be if, for instance, a son is born to two mothers. What additional support will that family need in terms of having a male figure to take an interest in the son?</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08102959000015"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked how one would consult children on these matters. I understand that these things are difficult to do well, but the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, Professor Sir Al Aynsley-Green, is well equipped to do that sort of consultation, and Dr Roger Morgan of Ofsted is well used to doing that for young people in care.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08102959000016"></a>I recognise and am grateful for the work of the Cambridge researchers in this area, Professor Susan Golombok foremost. This is clearly important work. However, to the best of my recollection, it was rather a small sample of families and the age range of children examined was only up to the age of 18. I think that it was observed that, within the two groups&#151;the control group with non-same-sex couples and the other group with same-sex couples&#151;incidences of young people having same-sex relations as they were growing up occurred within the group that had same-sex parents, but did not occur in the couples that were a man and a woman together. I remember the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, saying some time ago that we can always find a report to support whatever view we wish to put forward. I am sure that intentions here on all parts are of the best. This is a very emotive issue, but we need to be careful not to take just the evidence that suits us best to achieve our objectives.</p>

It is a very hard struggle to make a change in this area, as they are starting from such a low base, but the achievements of the Acts on children needing care, and schemes such as Quality Protects and Care Matters, are so important for these young people. I hesitate to criticise the Government in this sort of area because of those achievements. I listened this morning to the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, giving evidence on the future of children in care and the Government&#146;s strategy on that. The key thing is that there will now be children in care councils, and children who are in the

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08102959000018"></a>The suggestion from the right reverend Prelate that we should take the opportunity to consult children on this matter, which will concern them very much, is a helpful one. This is a vexed and difficult issue, but I hope that the Minister can offer me some reassurance, particularly about the scenario of two women bringing up a son when they do not particularly like men. If the Minister cannot provide me with reassurance on that point, I regret that I shall have to support the right reverend Prelate if he decides to divide on this amendment.</p>

It is highly important that the views of children on this matter are taken.</p>

The amendment does not seek to wreck the provisions, as some noble Lords suggest; it is calling for further reflection and consideration and seems entirely appropriate. The matters that we are debating today I regard as by far the most serious that we have considered. We have spent a lot of time talking about planning and pensions, which are huge matters&#151;but what is at stake here are pure definitions of life, origin and family.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08102959000021"></a>To follow on from what the noble and learned Lord said, a key issue here will be one of coherence. It is worth reflecting for a second on what Clause 45 as currently worded actually states, which the amendment seeks to change. The clause is entitled, &#147;Further provision relating to sections 42 and 43&#148;, and says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113"></a><a name="08102959000072"></a>&#147;Where a woman is treated by virtue of section 42 or 43 as a parent of the child, no man is to be treated as the father of the child&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102959000071"></a>I may not be a scientist, but as a father I am pretty aware that that cannot be true. There is a father to the child; the question is whether that father should be acknowledged or not. The father will be acknowledged over the age of 18, when the child will be entitled to seek out that person&#151;so at that point he will be there. The question is whether the factual existence of the father is acknowledged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08102959000022"></a>When this legislation was first introduced, it was as a necessary amendment to the 1990 Act in this area, which stated very clearly that various factors had been taken into account, including the need of that child for a father. I am not sure what has changed since 1990 that would make it necessary to delete that sentiment and that fact from the legislation. On the contrary, much of the legislation that has come forward in the Children Act, as well as the Child Support Agency, puts huge pressure on fathers to take on board their financial and moral obligations to children. So we need to be very careful in all legislation that is passed through this House to ensure that we send out the right message. The message that is encapsulated in the

<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="08102959000023"></a><a name="81029-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81029-0012.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08102959000273"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 36A, 36B and 36C have been tabled by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham and look to delay significantly the enactment of the clauses of the Bill which enable a child born as a result of assisted reproduction to a same-sex couple to have two legal parents.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08102959000024"></a>The Bill seeks to ensure that civil partners and other same-sex couples are recognised as the legal parents of children conceived through the use of donated sperm, eggs, or embryos, in line with married couples and unmarried heterosexual couples. In addition to this, the Bill amends the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 to enable the second female parent to be named on the birth certificate. This is consistent with the wider government policy on promoting equality, as evidenced by the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and the national legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08102959000025"></a>The provisions relating to the recognition of the female second parent are set out in Clauses 42 and 43, which bring the provisions for female civil partners in line with those for married couples, and the provisions for other same-sex couples with those for heterosexual couples who are not married. These provisions enable a child born to a same-sex couple to have two legal parents, which, I am sure your Lordships will agree, must be in the best interests of the child.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08102959000026"></a>Amendments Nos. 36A, 36B and 36C would significantly delay the enactment of these very important provisions. The idea that we have had no time to debate this issue seems to me nonsense; the principle of same-sex parents was debated at length in the context of the need for a father, from the 1990 Act. This specific issue was debated on the Floor of the House in another place for almost three hours; it was also debated at length in this House and many noble Lords took part in those debates during that period. I remind the right reverend Prelate that this is something that has been subject to considerable valuable debate; the House has voted and made its position quite clear. The issue has been debated and voted on in another place and Members of that House agreed to the position in the Bill as it left this House. Therefore, let us be quite clear that the current position in the Bill on this issue reflects an agreed position between the two Houses. As your Lordships are aware, the purpose of today&#146;s debate is to consider those changes made to the Bill in another place, not those issues on which the House has already decided.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08102959000027"></a>I shall recap what these changes do. Clause 42 brings the provisions for female civil partners into line with those for married couples. The Archbishop&#146;s amendments&#151;sorry, I mean the amendments proposed by the right reverend Prelate. I am giving him a promotion that I am sure he deserves. His amendments would delay, perhaps significantly, the commencement of the Bill&#146;s provisions, but would enable both members of the same-sex couple to be recognised as the legal parents of a child born to them following assisted reproduction. To delay this would be unfair to the

I shall turn to some of the studies referred to in a moment, but the Bill protects the interests of the child by ensuring that it has two parents named on its birth certificate. A provision that would not give the child a father is simply removing the child&#146;s second parent. This would not be in the child&#146;s best interest and the Government are content that these provisions are compatible with the convention.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08102959000028"></a>Noble Lords may not approve of same-sex couples being parents but the fact is that they are parents, and they are good parents. The suggestion which has run as an undercurrent through this debate, that same-sex parents are of less value than mixed-sex parents, is quite offensive and incorrect. We have had these discussions many times and we know that opinion on these issues runs high in your Lordships&#146; House, but it is sad to suggest in this day and age that having two women as loving parents is somehow to deny a human right to a child.</p>

<a name="81029-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08102959000029"></a>Clause 43 makes parenthood provisions for female couples who are not in a civil partnership where one of the women gives birth to a child following assisted conception treatment at a UK-licensed clinic. If valid female parenthood conditions are in place with the partner at the time of the conception of the child, the other woman will be treated as the parent of that child. The provisions in Clause 43 mirror those for unmarried heterosexual couples where the woman has a child as a result of assisted conception with donor sperm in a UK-licensed clinic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08102959000030"></a>The effect of the amendments proposed by the right reverend Prelate would delay the enactment of these important clauses, which have been debated extensively in this House and at length in another place. I encourage the right reverend Prelate to withdraw the amendment, but if he decides to move it, I invite the House to resist it.</p>

Evidence presented to the Joint Committee of both Houses, for example, demonstrated that the emotional well-being and other aspects of development of children growing up in lesbian families are comparable to those in heterosexual families. Many noble Lords, including the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, have suggested that what is important is that children are brought up in loving, supportive families. It is unrealistic to suggest that that is an undesirable situation when that is what happens. We need to make sure that such children are not disadvantaged by the legal process through not having legitimate parents entered on their birth certificates. That is what the amendment is about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08102959000042"></a>Amendment No. 38 relates to Amendment No. 36 as discussed in the previous group. Amendment No. 38, together with Amendment No. 36, ensures that children born to civil partners following assisted conception treatment will be treated as legitimate in the same way as if their parents were married.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08102959000043"></a>Amendments Nos. 39, 47 and 94 relate to the registration of the birth of a child born by assisted reproduction to a same-sex couple. At birth registration, some statistical information is currently collected under statute by the registrar. This relates to the age of the mother and father and, if they are married, the date of marriage, whether the mother has been married previously and the number of children born to the mother. The information that the registrar is required to collect is set out in the Population (Statistics) Act 1938. Following the Bill, the questions that would be asked when registering the birth require amendment. The existing wording would be inappropriate for same-sex couples. Amendments Nos. 39, 47 and 94 make the necessary changes to the Population (Statistics) Act 1938 to allow for the collection of information relating to the age of the same-sex parents and the date of any civil partnership, where applicable, so that same-sex parents are treated equally to other parents.</p>

It is important that there are organisations to which they can turn for support and advice if they choose to consider surrogacy.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08102959000048"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 to 45 relate to surrogacy organisations and the aspects of their services for which they may charge. Clause 59 amends the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 to clarify the position in law of non-profit making surrogacy organisations. It makes it clear that they may charge for certain aspects of their services on a non-profit-making basis, and enables them to advertise the services for which they may charge.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08102959000049"></a>These bodies have a useful role to play in initiating negotiations with a view to making surrogacy arrangements and compiling information about surrogacy with a view to its use in making or negotiating a surrogacy arrangement. We recognise, however, that it is difficult for a surrogacy organisation to provide such services for the small number of people who seek advice and help with surrogacy in the UK if they are not able to make a charge to recoup the cost of providing them.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08102959000050"></a>The amendments to Clause 59 state that such organisations may charge for certain activities, but only if they do not make a profit&#151;in essence, if it is not undertaken on a commercial basis. They may charge for initiating negotiations with a view to the making of a surrogacy arrangement such as enabling interested parties to meet each other to discuss a possible surrogacy arrangement, and compiling information about surrogacy with a view to its use in the making or negotiation of a surrogacy arrangement&#151;establishing and keeping lists of people willing to be surrogates, or intended parents, for example.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08102959000051"></a>These provisions would enable not-for-profit organisations to charge for putting couples in touch with each other, but not for any more direct intervention in discussions. The amendments in the Bill to the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 are not seeking to turn surrogacy into a commercial industry. The 1985 Act took firm steps to ban any commercialisation of surrogacy and that principle has not changed.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08102959000052"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 to 45 deal specifically with the issue of cross-subsidisation by surrogacy organisations. There was debate in the other place about the potential for cross subsidisation&#151;surrogacy organisations charging more for the activities for which they are able to charge so that they can undertake those activities for which they are not able to charge. It is our intention that surrogacy agencies should not be permitted to charge more for the activities for which the Bill allows reimbursement in order to subsidise the cost of providing other activities for which charging is prohibited. Amendments Nos. 41 to 45 are necessary to ensure that this position is clarified in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08102959000065"></a>Consent forms one of the cornerstones of the 1990 Act. A person&#146;s gametes cannot be used to create embryos without their express consent. Schedule 3 to the Bill amends the consent provisions in the 1990 Act bringing them up to date with new techniques for creating embryos, for example, by requiring consent for the use of cells to create embryos.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08102959000066"></a>The Government listened very carefully to concerns raised in this House about this framework for consent in relation to the use of stored cells and cells from children with serious diseases, but also made it clear that any exceptions to the requirement for consent needed to be compatible with convention rights. The government amendments in this group provide for certain exceptions while also providing safeguards in recognition of those rights.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08102959000067"></a>With regard to stored cells, the government amendments apply only to cells taken and stored before commencement of the Bill&#146;s provisions and the exception applies only if the HFEA is satisfied that the cells are anonymous and thus the donor cannot be identified, or that the licence holder cannot reasonably trace the donor. If the researcher can identify and trace the donor, then unless the donor consents themselves their cells cannot be used. If the person identifies the donor, and they are found to be deceased, consent would be required from a person, for example a close relative, as set out in a hierarchy modelled on that found in the Human Tissue Act 2004. Before the cells can be used, the HFEA must be satisfied that scientific research would be adversely affected to a significant extent, if the only cells that can be used are cells that consent has been obtained for.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1651"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1651</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08102959000068"></a>The amendments reflect the fact that rare or well researched samples are a valuable asset better to understand and treat serious disease. We have weighed the burden of being unable to use those cells against the rights of the person who originally donated them, and believe we have struck the right balance in the terms of the suggested amendments.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08102959000069"></a>Further amendments tabled on Report in the other place rectified concerns about the interaction of clauses relating to the use of cells from deceased donors, and untraceable donors. The amendments enable a researcher to use the cells of untraceable donors where there is reason to believe they are dead, where no relatives can be traced to consent to use of the cells. The amendments also allow cells to be used if a donor&#146;s family can be traced but it is not known, only reasonably believed, that the donor is dead. In these cases, a person in a qualifying relationship can now consent to use of the cells in the same way that they can when it is known the person is dead. In these cases, the HFEA must still be satisfied that the other safeguards are fulfilled before the cells can be used, including the significant adverse impact upon science test.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08102959000070"></a>Regarding consent to the use of cells from children, these amendments apply where those children would never be able to give their consent because of age or a lack of capacity. This is the case with children affected by certain aggressive forms of diseases such as muscular dystrophy, Batten disease and spinal muscular atrophy. To this end these amendments propose that children with such conditions who are too young to consent or lack capacity should be excluded from the requirement for effective consent, if a person with parental responsibility gives consent. This exception is subject to strict safeguards which ensure that a child&#146;s cells cannot be used unless the HFEA is satisfied that the child suffers from a serious medical condition; that the research is intended to increase knowledge about that condition or about its treatment; and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out using the cells of a person who could give their own consent.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08102961000003"></a>On further consideration of the exception for cells from children, it became clear that it was also desirable to make provision to enable the use of cells from an adult who lacked capacity in very limited circumstances. This would be to address situations where, for example, rare genetic conditions lead to the sudden onset of lifelong incapacity. Following the precedent of the Mental Capacity Act, the Government&#146;s amendments propose that in such cases the researcher would need to approach an individual&#146;s carer and consult them on their views about the wishes of the person.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08102961000004"></a>The Government felt, for several reasons, that it was appropriate to extend the provisions to adults who lack capacity: first, for the sake of consistency. Without the provisions, cells could be taken from a &#147;child&#148; of 17 if they were unable to consent, perhaps because of illness rather than a lack of understanding, whereas tissue could not be taken from someone who was a year older in the same situation. In addition, if this provision was not made, researchers might favour using tissue or cells from children rather than adults when researching these serious medical conditions,  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1652"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because exceptions were made only for these circumstances. It is my view that this would not be appropriate.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08102961000005"></a>Again, the exception relating to cells from adults who lack capacity is subject to a number of stringent safeguards. The HFEA must be satisfied that, at the time, the adult lacks capacity and is unlikely to have capacity again; that the adult suffers from a serious medical condition; that the proposed research is intended to increase knowledge about that condition or about its treatment; that there is no evidence that the adult would have refused to participate; and, most importantly, that there are reasonable grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out using the cells of a person who could give consent themselves.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08102961000006"></a>In all cases, it will be for the researcher to provide evidence that satisfies the HFEA that all the conditions have been met before a licence to undertake the research may be given. The safeguards set out in the Bill are modelled on the protection provided under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Research involving people who lack capacity, and the use of their tissue to create embryos, are excluded from the Mental Capacity Act by provisions in the Bill. This prevents any overlap between the two pieces of legislation.</p>

<a name="81029-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08102961000007"></a>These amendments follow the precedent of the Mental Capacity Act and set out stringent safeguards that must be adhered to before the research can take place. Specifically, there is a requirement for the researcher to approach a carer of the person who lacks capacity to consult them on their views about the wishes of the person.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08102961000014"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, there can surely be no dispute that the subject we are debating, touching as it does on life and death, conscience and ethics, with the losing of freedoms and rights that we once thought were ours without question thrown in, is one of monumental importance. I am not alone in the view that, in a matter of such gravity&#151;and there can be few subjects of greater gravity&#151;this House and the other place should have been granted more time to debate and consider exactly what we are being asked to sanction in what is before us.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08102961000015"></a>Amendment No. 92 is very long indeed. It stretches over six and a half pages and its very first words have a shadow of menace when they refer to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_174"></a><a name="08102961000097"></a>&#147;Cases where human cells ... can be used without consent of person providing them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000042"></a>This amendment is the main amendment allowing researchers to create cloned human or animal-human embryos from a person&#146;s cells without their consent. In its new and extended guise, it has never been debated on the Floor of either House until now. Until now, it has been the common view that one&#146;s body is one&#146;s own and others have no right to take it over against one&#146;s will. I am prepared to believe that, buried in various places in this lengthy amendment, there might be some good and just measures. However, because of the extremely limited time allowed to us for investigating and debating this possibility, I felt that there was nothing for it but to seek to delete the whole amendment; not only to preserve the rights that should be ours, but to bring more clarity and purpose to the Bill. That is why I challenge the whole of this sinister and unwieldy provision. More time might have permitted some parts of it to be agreed, but we shall never know.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08102961000016"></a>Sub-paragraph (2) of new paragraph 15A states that permission to use a person&#146;s cells can be granted because the patient was,</p>
<ul><a name="08102961000115"></a>&#147;likely to develop, a serious disease&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000043"></a>Well, any one of us might become seriously ill at any time. None of us can bet that we will not. Surely, only a medically qualified person in full possession of our physical record and details of our parentage can say with any authority that anyone is likely to become ill. As I understand it, the decision on whether that person is likely to become ill will not be made by a doctor or a nurse or anyone medically qualified, but by a researcher. However, a researcher is surely anxious to go ahead with his or her research. I can envisage the temptation to get the raw materials by the simple means of expressing the view that the patient might get ill.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08102961000017"></a>Why is there no sanction of a doctor&#146;s opinion? All that seems to be necessary in the case of an under-18 year-old is parental agreement that the patient might get ill. That is not enough. If the young person in the frame were not competent to deal with the issue of consent for the use of his body, no one should believe for one moment, or act on the premise, that that person does agree; he has never been asked the question. People who are mentally or physically incompetent should be protected, not used against their will.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08102961000018"></a>I have spoken previously in this House about the use of the word &#147;reasonable&#148;. I have vivid memories of my time in another place, where Ministers refused to have that word in legislation because it meant all things to all men. What is reasonable to one person may be totally unreasonable to others. The word is sloppy and unclear and should be avoided. However, it comes up eight times in this amendment alone. This brings me to another point. In sub-paragraph (2) of new paragraph 15D, it says that the researcher must take &#147;reasonable steps&#148; to identify a person who is engaged in caring for a patient, or who is interested in the patient&#146;s welfare. The patient in this case is an adult who is said to be lacking capacity. Well, anyone can say that they are interested in a person&#146;s welfare. I am interested in the welfare of all noble Lords: I can sincerely say that. Anyone can allege that they are caring for somebody else. A researcher anxious to begin his research may take the easy option by accepting statements to this effect, which this amendment permits him to do.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08102961000019"></a>Why is this so casual? Why is the researcher not required to check or to get proof of what is being said? If there is no adult at all whom the researcher can claim to be responsible for the incapacitated person, then, according to the amendment, the researcher must take reasonable&#151;there is that word again&#151;steps to find someone or other who will take responsibility. If such a personage does not come easily to mind, the researcher can choose someone else. He is allowed to choose someone who will allege that he is interested in the patient, but surely he can shoo in anyone at all to say that. It is not enough to state that the person must have no connection with the project. He or she, chosen by the researcher, could very easily be the researcher&#146;s husband, wife, friend or aunt or someone working in the same laboratory on another subject. There is no problem there. That colleague would not need to be told the rhyme or reason for the use of the cells, as he would know that already; nor surely would he be likely to stand in his colleague&#146;s way. There is no requirement whatever for him to know anything at all about the patient or the views of the patient; he would just need to say something in front of his fellow researcher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08102961000020"></a>Sub-paragraph (3) of new paragraph 15G makes it possible, just because there is a supposition that an individual is dead, to permit the use of that person&#146;s cells for what he or she may have regarded as a repugnant purpose. Surely that is also wrong. If we accept that, surely we are saying that a person&#146;s body may be used in any way once he is dead. That has always been opposed. So far as I know, no one has ever said that it would be right to use a cadaver in any way that a person wished, and the thought that we are now asking to do so concerns me greatly. Again, surely it would be wrong to claim that, just because a person who may or may not be dead never said that he did not want his body to be used to create half animal/half human embryos, he would not mind if such a thing were done. Even if that person had agreed that his body parts could be used after death for transplants to help sick people, that is a very long way from agreeing that those parts should be utilised to make animal/human embryos. This is a matter on which many people have strong views, and I claim that they have every right to

In fact, sub-paragraph (1) of new paragraph 15G does not require that the research be medical but simply scientific, and scientific research goes much wider than medical research&#151;far beyond the straightforward pursuit of curing disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08102961000021"></a>If I read new paragraph 15G carefully, it suggests that &#147;any&#148; of the conditions listed will be sufficient for the authorisation of research, and I ask the Minister whether that is correct. Will just one of them be sufficient or is it necessary to accept that they are all relevant and applicable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08102961000022"></a>As I understand it, the whole of Amendment No. 92 has been acknowledged by the Government as interfering with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In fact, the present Leader of the House, in an earlier incarnation as a Whip with responsibilities towards this Bill, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_175"></a><a name="08102961000098"></a>&#147;If a child is incapable of giving consent to the creation of a human or human-admixed embryo themselves, because they are too young to do so, it would be wrong for any person, including the parents, to make that decision for them, given the significance of creating an embryo using their genetic material&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/08; col. 52.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000044"></a>The noble Baroness the Leader of the House also said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08102961000116"></a>&#147;even though the original cells may have been taken from the donor with their consent to research in general, the use of their genetic material to create cloned embryos or human admixed embryos is exceptional, and requires its own express consent. To provide otherwise would be incompatible with the convention rights ... It would also be incompatible with the Human Rights Act&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/08; cols. 46-7.]</ul>
<a name="81029-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08102961000023"></a>I have the greatest respect for the integrity and sincerity of the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, and I have absolutely no doubt that she meant every word that she said. However, since then, the Government&#146;s position has changed. They now claim that, after all, this is justified. But is it? Queen&#146;s Counsel Mr Aidan O&#146;Neill, who has been asked to provide a legal opinion on the matter, agrees with the Government that the use of human cells for the creation of human embryos and/or human admixed embryos does indeed engage the Article 8 rights of the donor. He also agrees with the Government that removing the requirement for consent would interfere with this right. However, his legal opinion is that the provisions before us today in this amendment are not compatible with the convention because they do not give proper weighting to the interests of those whose genetic material is now being used.</p>

<a name="81029-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08102961000024"></a>The scientific need for these provisions on consent has, so far as I know, never been demonstrated. So far as I am aware, there is not a shred of evidence that creating animal/human creatures will bring about cures or even palliatives to assist sufferers from recognised diseases. If Ministers are serious about adhering to the important human rights convention, they simply cannot pass this part of the Bill. I listened with great care to what was said earlier in the debate on that very matter, but the question which has not been addressed until now is that it may well be in direct contravention of human rights.</p>

Unless we are ready to deny this right, we cannot allow Amendment No. 92 to pass into law. Removing these consent provisions will return the Bill to the state that it was in when it previously left the House.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08102961000026"></a>It is a serious misuse of Parliament to curtail debate and proper investigation into this vital matter, but that is what is happening at the moment. I was shocked to hear that so strict was the curtailment that MPs in another place were given no time at all to debate on the Floor of the House the amendments dealing with consent. I earnestly hope that the Government have put no Whip on their Members and that they do not troop into the Lobby to vote against this amendment without having listened to the arguments, but I fear that such a Whip is in existence. If human rights mean anything to the Government, they must not allow them to be trampled on to please one section of scientists, however well intentioned.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08102961000027"></a>Finally, so little time has been available for public knowledge to be disseminated about this debate that so far very few comments have had time to surface. However, I want to quote Professor David Jones, who is the director of the Centre for Bioethics and Emerging Technologies&#151;which are very important in this context&#151;St Mary&#146;s University College. He says that this is retrospective legislation, allowing the use of tissues that were not donated for that purpose. I do not think that we have touched on his concern. He says that it would be very counterproductive to allow the most controversial kind of research without the safeguards of effective consent. How can people trust scientists, if their cells can be used without their consent for research to which they are strongly opposed?</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08102961000028"></a>If effective consent is not restored to the Bill, there is a real danger that public confidence in tissue banking will be undermined, to the great detriment of scientific research. I have no wish whatever to halt or harm scientific research. I do, however, deeply care about the rights of human beings. I beg to move.</p>

I want to concentrate on one single point: the human rights convention and Article 8 thereof. We are looking at three categories of cases; parents giving consent on behalf of children, consent where an adult lacks capacity and the use of existing cell lines. A Minister told us on 21 January that it was not possible to allow consent in all those cases as that would all be contrary to Article 8 of the human rights convention.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_176"></a><a name="08102961000099"></a>&#147;In essence, the Bill sets out a framework which ensures that, if a person&#146;s gametes or cells are used to create an embryo, effective consent is in place beforehand. In the case of cell lines, even though the original cells may have been taken from the donor with their consent to research in general, the use of their genetic material to create cloned embryos or human admixed embryos is exceptional, and requires its own express consent. To provide otherwise would be incompatible with the convention rights. We have done a lot of work on this issue. It would also be incompatible with the Human Rights Act&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/08; cols. 46-47.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08102961000031"></a>Later&#151;and the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, has also referred to this&#151;the Minister dealt with the other two cases, of children and adults, saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_177"></a><a name="08102961000100"></a>&#147;No one can give consent on behalf of an adult who lacks capacity, and, for the same reasons, I do not believe that a child&#146;s cells should be used to create embryos or human-admixed embryos without that child&#146;s own consent.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_178"></a><a name="08102961000101"></a>If a child is incapable of giving consent to the creation of a human or human-admixed embryo themselves, because they are too young to do so, it would be wrong for any person, including the parents, to make that decision for them, given the significance of creating an embryo using their genetic material&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000045"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, then referred to the powerful arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and by my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant, but she concluded that,</p>
<ul><a name="08102961000102"></a>&#147;the Government take the view that we should not, in any circumstances, presume that a person&#146;s cells can be used in the creation of embryos without their consent or knowledge&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/08; col. 52.]</ul>
<a name="81029-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08102961000032"></a>That position came on 21 January this year from a Minister speaking on behalf of the Government. Ten days later came the first sign of the U-turn, in a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. Making no reference whatever to the passages that I have just read, he sent a letter to all those, including myself, who spoke in the debate on the earlier stage of the Bill. The letter dealt entirely with the use of existing cells. The hour is late, but the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, made it clear that, since the debate on 21 January, the science community had been arguing why that valuable archive was a tool that they really wanted to use. From their point of view, I entirely understand what they were seeking to achieve.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08102961000033"></a>In his letter, the noble Lord began by saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="08102961000117"></a>&#147;further discussions with scientific researchers have more clearly identified the scientific need to use existing cell lines&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000046"></a>so, there was more factual evidence. He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_179"></a><a name="08102961000103"></a>&#147;A compelling case has been made that the requirement for express consent could, in certain circumstances, impose a significant burden on research in this field. On this basis the Government takes the view that it would be possible to make an exception to the requirement for express consent, provided that stringent safeguards are in place. We would expect that such an exception would focus on situations where the inability to continue using existing cells would have significant adverse effects on research, where such research would be in the public interest. The detail of such safeguards to ensure compliance with Article 8 requires further consideration&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81029-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08102961000034"></a>That was the first hint we got that there was going to be a change. It was followed up in paragraph 16 of his letter, which dealt specifically with the human rights situation. The noble Lord wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_180"></a><a name="08102961000104"></a>&#147;In considering whether the interference can be justified and proportionate to a legitimate aim the Government considered the concerns of the scientific community. Specifically the issue is whether the issue can be justified on the basis of &#145;the protection of health&#146; under Article 8(2)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000047"></a>We can see what has happened: the evidence from the scientists has come in, showing a &#147;scientific need&#148;&#151;a term the noble Lord used in the early part of his letter&#151;and that is transmogrified and put forward here in altered garb as the protection of health under Article 8(2).</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08102961000035"></a>That is how matters stood. Then we had the amendments in the other place, on which the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, has commented at length. I shall not go into the detail of that. The noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1662"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Darzi, then wrote another undated latter, which we received just before today&#146;s hearing. That letter does not mention Article 8 at all, but the Minister referred to the Explanatory Notes to the Commons Amendments&#151;and if we look at them, &#147;scientific need&#148; comes back into the picture in paragraph 57. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_181"></a><a name="08102961000105"></a>&#147;Although removing the requirement for consent would interfere with this right&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000048"></a>the Article 8 right&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08102961000118"></a>&#147;the Government is satisfied that, in the limited cases provided for by the amendments, such interference can be justified on the basis of scientific need. The amendments include significant safeguards&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000049"></a>The term &#147;public health&#148;, which is used in paragraph 2 of Article 8, is not used at all but &#147;scientific need&#148; is. No argument is advanced at any point as to why all the hard work done before 21 January, which put the Minister in a position to say, &#147;This is not possible under the convention&#148;, has been turned around to become very possible; an escape route has been found through the reference to health.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08102961000036"></a>If matters stood there one would be complaining about why we have had no straightforward explanation from the Government as to why they held the original opinion, and why they have now changed it. Are we to understand that they did not originally consider the possible exceptions to the basic provision of Article 8.2? Anyone advising on whether or not the article applies will look at the exceptions. However, the matter does not stop there. We have received an opinion, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, referred, although I do not know how widely it has been circulated because I received it only yesterday. The opinion is that of a well known Queen&#146;s Counsel, a Scottish silk who works in Edinburgh, whose work I have come across in other contexts, but I have never met him. He is a highly professional and skilled lawyer. He concludes, at paragraph 3.9 of his opinion:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_182"></a><a name="08102961000106"></a>&#147;In sum it seems to me that the provisions dispensing with or substituting consent if passed could well be the subject to successful challenge for their incompatibility with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08102961000037"></a>In particular, he focuses on the charter of rights, which your Lordships will recall from the many days that we spent discussing the treaty of Lisbon and its adjunct, the charter of rights. It is a familiar text to us all. Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights states:</p>

It opened for signatures

Some 23 nations have ratified the convention among the 34 which signed. The UK has not signed, as well as other countries, including Germany, Russia and one or two others. Most countries have signed. The provisions that matter are Articles 1, 2, 5 and 6. Article 1 states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08102961000040"></a>Article 2, &#147;Primacy of the human being&#148;, is important. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_187"></a><a name="08102961000111"></a>&#147;The interests and welfare of the human being shall prevail over the sole interest of society or science&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08102961000041"></a>Article 5, the &#147;General rule&#148;, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_188"></a><a name="08102961000112"></a>&#147;An intervention in the health field may only be carried out after the person concerned has given free and informed consent to it.

The person concerned may freely withdraw consent at any time&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000052"></a>which is contrary to the Government&#146;s proposals. Article 6 on,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08102961000054"></a>In other words, all of those provisions are aimed at protecting the rights of the individual and are a direct objection to the proposal now being made. They add weight to my first contention that we do not know why the Government have changed their mind on the scope of Article 8. We have now received the opinion and provisions that I referred to, which we need to consider calmly, and send the matter back to the other place.</p>

When I was president of the GMC, we struggled for years with the problem of informed consent. However, there is no question but that the medical profession accepts that the principle of informed consent lies at the core of medical practice. It is absolutely right that a doctor may recommend to a patient the appropriate treatment for his condition but it is up to the patient, having fully appreciated the circumstances relating to the treatment recommended, whether he should accept such treatment. Therefore, he must give his informed consent. Within the law and within medical practice, he is fully entitled, if he so wishes, to refuse that consent, even if it results in death.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08102966000009"></a>The same principles were adumbrated in the General Medical Council&#146;s advice about medical research. It was made absolutely clear that an individual patient could be involved in medical research only with his fully informed consent. However, the issue arose of

If the child was not, the issue arose as to what would be the proper course of action in relation to such research. Although I wholly appreciate the valid points made by my noble friend Lord Neill, the GMC recommended, and that recommendation still holds, that it would be proper for a parent to give consent on behalf of a child to participate in research if it could be shown that the research in question could lead to developments that would be to the benefit of that child as an individual. I think that that remains at the core of this problem.</p>

An additional safeguard, which is essential in such cases, is that there must be reasonable grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness could not take place with cells from a person who could consent. That is the important issue in relation to research involving children.</p>

They drew particularly on the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to frame appropriate safeguards, including a requirement to consult carers and a requirement that the adult is suffering from or is likely to develop a serious disease or serious disability about which the proposed research is intended to increase knowledge. Again, the important issue is that the research in question would be likely, ultimately, to be to the benefit of that individual.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08102966000012"></a>The issue of cells or cell lines stored before the legislation is brought into force is one that has been raised for many years. I was much involved in the discussions in your Lordships' House on the Human Tissue Act 2004. It was clearly stated then that archival material stored over some time and derived from an individual for whom it is no longer possible to give or withhold consent, can be used for research purposes. It is now quite clear that where a cell donor cannot be identified or traced or has died since the cells were stored, the requirement for effective consent can reasonably be waived subject to the criterion that, in the view of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, research would be adversely affected to a significant degree if the cells or cell lines cannot be used. Where the cell donor has died and can be traced, consent would be required from a person such as a close relative as set out in the clear hierarchy modelled on that found in the Human Tissue Act.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08102966000013"></a>I do not believe that the amendment so carefully and explicitly moved by the noble Baroness would be to the benefit of patients at all. I therefore strongly support the amendments tabled by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08102966000015"></a>These major changes were discussed for just two hours in the Public Bill Committee and were never discussed at all on the Floor of the House of Commons. An amendment to remove them was never reached; and it was without debate and with the use of a three-line Whip that these new proposals were added to the Bill. If we reject these changes we will be doing a service to the House of Commons, because for the first time there will be an opportunity for the other place to discuss these matters properly. I have heard from far more erudite and informed people than myself on the merits of the proposal, so I shall spare the House my views; but I hope that noble Lords take the point that I have made. It is surely our duty to see that the House of Commons considers these matters properly, which it has not done so far.</p>

I have listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, and I think that he has possibly overlooked the point that, in relation to the children and adults who lack capacity, the amendment does not require that the research should be for their benefit. It is possibly for the benefit of those suffering from the same or a similar condition. That is what the amendment says, not the terms that the GMC thought were appropriate.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08102966000017"></a>I want to concentrate on the use of existing cell lines which we are told were lawfully stored for research purposes immediately before the commencement date, or which are derived from human cells which were lawfully stored for those purposes at that time. They were given for those purposes, so why are they not used for such purposes? The force of the amendment shows that the Government consider that the consent given for research purposes is not adequate to cover research using human admixed embryos. I do not understand how those cell lines could be useful in connection with human admixed embryos. Whatever may happen in the future, I understand that the present position is that human and mixed embryos are used in the process of research because of the scarcity of human eggs. To get over that difficulty admixed human embryos are used, using cattle&#151;cows or some other animal.</p>

<a name="81029-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08102966000018"></a>That has nothing to do with stored cell lines as I understand it, so this is a different situation which should be covered from the consent that was given. It is extremely difficult to say that this is in any way consistent with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is difficult to connect the scientific purpose that has been the foundation of this amendment with the use that is to be made in connection with human admixed embryos. The purpose is to supplement the difficulty arising from the scarcity of these eggs.

However, the ultimate purpose of the amendment is to deal with a case where there is no possibility of consent under these provisions. The ultimate test of this amendment is a case in which there is no consent to allow the person using the material to go beyond the research purposes for which it was originally given. I originally took the view that if it was given for research purposes, then it is being used for research purposes after the commencement of the Act, but the Government&#146;s approach shows that they consider that the consent given for research before the commencement of the Act is not sufficient to cover the research to which they now wish to put this tissue. Therefore, I regard it as extremely doubtful whether this could be regarded as coming within the proper confines of the Human Rights Act and the convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08102966000020"></a>I follow the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, in emphasising the importance of parliamentary scrutiny. Your Lordships' House is regarded as the guardian of our legitimate rights and as probably the only place&#151;it is certainly the case in this instance&#151;where issues of this sort can be properly and thoroughly scrutinised. Some 260 new lines have been added to the Bill. They were not part of the Bill when it left your Lordships' House, and they were added after the assurances we were quite sincerely given by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, who we all respect. She told us emphatically that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_191"></a><a name="08102966000113"></a>&#147;The Bill sets out to ensure that human and human-admixed embryos may only be created for research purposes, and only where the person to whom the cells belong gives their explicit consent&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/08/; col. 52.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102966000107"></a>There is no doubt that that was said with sincerity on the Floor of the House, and it was repeated, in effect, in the letter that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, sent to us in January. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_192"></a><a name="08102966000114"></a>&#147;This is likely to include a person&#146;s right to determine under what circumstances their genetic material is used to create a human embryo or human admixed embryo&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102966000108"></a>Referring to Article 8, he wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_193"></a><a name="08102966000115"></a>&#147;The use of a person&#146;s genetic material, without their express consent, to create embryos and their subsequent use and storage would interfere with a person&#146;s rights under Article 8 of the convention&#148;.</p>

The Bill was guillotined and a three-line Whip was used to see it through. That is no way to make legislation of this kind where these hugely important questions are involved.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08102966000022"></a>We have been told about the legal opinion given by Aidan O&#146;Neill QC. A further opinion has been given today by Mr James Bogle of 10 Kings Bench Walk, Temple, who reaches the same conclusion. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_194"></a><a name="08102966000116"></a>&#147;For all the reasons that I have canvassed above, I consider that there is good reason to consider that a successful challenge could be mounted against the presumed and substituted consent to research provisions of the Bill and I am not satisfied that the government&#146;s claims, upon advice, that these provisions, without the inclusion of any further and/or better safeguards, are all Convention-compliant is sufficiently well-founded&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102966000109"></a>This level of advice and the conflicting views we have heard about the compatibility of Article 8 make it doubtful whether the words on the very face of the Bill stating that it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights are accurate. That should surely make us want to consider this further. We would not be doing our job properly if we did not now take the opportunity to send this part of the Bill back to another place so that they have the chance to debate these provisions, to look at their compatibility and decide how best to proceed.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08102966000023"></a>I conclude simply by reminding the Minister of what happened in my own city of Liverpool at Alder Hey children&#146;s hospital when science went too far. Presumed consent was believed to be in the interests of patients and organs were taken from children. It brought a wonderful children&#146;s hospital into total disrepute. The National Health Service had to think again, very thoroughly, about these questions. This could jeopardise the whole altruistic and well-founded movement of people providing organs and tissue for medical purposes, if they believe that the state is taking on the vestiges of an authoritarian entity that decides it knows best. The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, is right to remind us of the importance of these questions. I hope noble Lords will support her amendment.</p>

Secondly, there are those, and I am one of them, who have decided in their wills to leave their bodies for medical purposes.

I am moved to speak by the use of the word &#147;sinister&#148; by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree. I repeat something that I have said many times: I thank the noble Baroness for raising these issues, as she has consistently over the years, in order to bring them to the attention of your Lordships&#146; House and the public.

That is not so. Noble Lords should remember that the noble Lord, Lord Patel raised these matters in your Lordships&#146; House in Committee and on Report. Fourteen Members of your Lordships&#146; House, including the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans, took part in that discussion.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08102966000026"></a>We are suffering to an extent from a very partial portrayal of the events that have led up to this moment. There is partiality in that people have forgotten that this House and another place spent a considerable time&#151;not only in their Chambers but in a Joint Committee&#151;looking at the issue of consent when the Mental Capacity Act was going through. There was detailed consultation on that matter with a wide range of bodies, ranging from the Catholic Church to disability organisations. They were specifically asked about that issue. It was the considered opinion of another place and your Lordships&#146; House that, with very strong and explicit caveats and safeguards, people who lack capacity should, in certain circumstances, be able to take part in research. I well remember Members of your Lordships&#146; House who have a disability talking movingly about the need to make sure that people who lack the capacity to make some decisions should still be allowed to decide to take part in medical research.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08102966000027"></a>The other partiality this evening is the proposal that the Government said emphatically on 21 January that they would consider this no further. That is not true. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, read out an extensive excerpt of what the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, said that night. She also said that she heard the sentiments in this House and would take these matters away for further consideration. It is for the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, to explain the Government&#146;s thinking to us. I happen to agree with Members of this House who think that the processes in another place are deficient. I agree that there has been a lack of scrutiny by elected Members, but I do not believe that it has been to the degree that has been indicated this evening or that there has been some kind of conspiracy.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08102966000028"></a>I return to my original point: it is not a matter of being sinister. In fact, the scientific community raised these issues. They raised the issue of the existing stem cell bank. They raised the issues of children who lack capacity and have life-limiting diseases to the extent that they will not reach adulthood. They raised the question of adults with mental capacity issues. Why? Because they wanted those issues to be brought before Parliament and for legislation to be properly formed. When we come to make our decision on this, we should do so in a way that sets out the proper background to the point we are at.</p>

That is what gives point to our deliberation this evening. It has been and is being a fascinating debate because it has a sort of hybrid character, with little Second Reading paragraphs coming in and Committee points being raised. Then we have the whole question of the constitutional procedure, on which I shall add a word to what my noble friend Lord Waddington said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08102966000030"></a>As a second Chamber with a watching brief on constitution and procedure, we must be aware of what is happening in the other place, even if we are not entitled to express our opinion to it. What has happened in the other place colours our reception of what arrives here from there. A large and, for laymen&#151;such as most of us on this matter&#151;complex series of paragraphs has been introduced which has elicited speeches, such as that of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, crying out for a discussion in Committee. I would like to ask questions about our friends &#147;C&#148; and &#147;P&#148; in particular, who have very chequered histories through the paragraphs in Amendment No. 92; they are ill in all sorts of ways, incapacitated in others and finally dead, but still contributing to the human species. All of them give their human, although not their other, selves, I see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08102966000031"></a>One could make those points in Committee, but not in a debate like this. I regret that we are being asked to deal with these fundamental, important and complex matters through a procedure that does not allow one, as I have been reminded this evening, to speak after the Minister as one can in Committee. Most of one&#146;s real questions bubble up following what the Minister has said in reply. If the reply is inadequate, one cannot say so. One cannot test it. It is there, then followed by a whipped vote and the matter is closed. I ask your Lordships to support my noble friend not only for the merits of the amendments under consideration, but for the important procedural points that accompany them.</p>

The previous amendment I had tabled in Committee was directly related to the archival material that could be used for research. I do not want to re-rehearse the whole argument, because it took hours then and the time is late now.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08102966000033"></a>Why do researchers want the ability to use this archival material obtained from children and adults with serious diseases? In the case of children, I have used the examples of diseases such as Batten disease, lissencephaly and nonsyndromic renal hypodysplasia. These diseases and others cause abnormalities in children&#146;s brains and kidneys. The majority of those children die in the first two years of life. We do not understand why brain cell development in these children is abnormal from the very beginning. What genetic and biological mutations occur so early on in the development of an embryo, maybe, to cause these defects? The only way to study these is to take the archival material from these children and, now that we have the ability, put it through to create pluripotent stems cells using these tissues, and begin to understand the fault that lies in the early development of these neuronal cells.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08102966000034"></a>The other example I used was in adults, with material collected, over many years, of conditions such as muscular dystrophy, some of which is genetically related. After many years, we have collected only 50 such samples; they are in a tissue library in the United States. All this material was given with consent for medical research, lawfully obtained. The ability to take these tissues from people who suffer from this particular type of muscular atrophy and to learn what goes wrong at an early phase of development is very

It is not that research is not being done on these tissues; it is that research is not allowed to be done by first converting the tissues into early-phase stem cells. That is the difference. That is why we require the government amendment to be passed. Whether this comes under human rights legislation or not, I will leave noble and learned Lords to advise us. All I can tell you is why research in this area is so vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08102966000036"></a>I will attempt to address all the issues raised by noble Lords. I must first address the question of whether the Government&#146;s position has changed on this issue. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, my noble friend had said that she would take this away and consider it. Very often in your Lordships' House, noble Lords are pleased when the Government do that and then decide on a different course of action. We regard that as one of the things we are very good at. I will go through the reasons why we did that; we have, of course, taken advice.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08102966000037"></a>Throughout the progress of the Bill, we listened carefully to the debate and considered our position accordingly. We reviewed our position on using cells in exceptional circumstances to create embryos for research without specific consent. The issue of interference with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights was the position we revised on further information we received and which concluded that interference in this case was justified and proportionate.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08102966000038"></a>We identified that the use of cells to create embryos raised human rights issues under the article, and our view is that the principle of that has not changed. However, under the convention, interference with Article 8 can be lawful if justification can be shown for such interference which is necessary and proportionate. When this issue was first debated, the Government were not aware of sufficient evidence that would justify the removal of consent. However, following the evidence that emerged as a consequence of the debates in your Lordships' House and consultations with the Academy of Medical Sciences, the MRC, the Wellcome Trust and medical research charities, it became clear that the justification for an interference could be made provided that this was subject to stringent safeguards and limitations and that the exceptions to consent would be carefully drafted to reflect this. In short, the Government&#146;s analysis of the convention has not changed but the evidence and the guidance available have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08102966000040"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, was concerned that the researcher has to be satisfied that the person has a serious medical condition. The researcher would have to satisfy the HFEA that all the conditions were met before a licence would be granted. It is not that some researcher dreams something up and then goes ahead with it. A large number of conditions have to be fulfilled, which are outlined in the Bill. That is why it is quite a lengthy amendment.

A child&#146;s tissue can be used to create an embryo only in limited circumstances, as I have previously set out. In other circumstances the use of tissue from children can also be used with the parents&#146; consent under the Human Tissue Act. That is not unique to this legislation. The noble Baroness drew attention to the fact that the word &#147;reasonable&#148; was used eight times. It will be for the HFEA to determine what is reasonable; for example, the reasonable grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness could not take place. I repeat again: this will not be for the researcher to determine but for the HFEA.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="08102966000042"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, raised the issue that the amendment does not require that this will be of help to the person from whom the tissue has been taken. The person from whom the cells are derived may be seriously ill and may die before they could benefit from any treatment. Yet the Bill requires that it must be used to develop treatment for someone with a similar condition. This provision mirrors that in the Mental Capacity Act. The noble and learned Lord also raised the issue of stored cells and human admixed embryos. Cells that are stored from someone with a particular condition could be used with an animal cell. This could enable stem cells to be derived which could be studied to learn more about the process and mechanism of the disease.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08102966000043"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, raised the issue of the donation of her body to science. I hope it will help to allay her fears that an objection can be registered to ensure that tissue is never used to create embryos for research. One of the conditions under paragraph 15G is that cells cannot be used to create embryos if the researcher has any information at all which suggests that the donor would have objected.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08102966000044"></a>These amendments are important for those rare exceptions where it may be appropriate for research to be carried out on tissue from someone who is not able to consent. To prevent this research would place unnecessary limits on finding potential cures. The stringent safeguards are appropriate and will ensure that this research will take place only where absolutely necessary. The provisions were debated previously in this House and also during debates in Committee in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08102966000045"></a>These amendments were tabled in response to the compelling arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and others in this House. They are also supported by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, which provided briefing for today&#146;s debate.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08102966000046"></a>These exemptions are rooted in exceptional circumstances. The potential for benefits to sufferers of serious conditions is too great to overlook, and any research that can be undertaken in the hope of better treating or curing these conditions must be allowed to continue.</p>

<a name="81029-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08102966000047"></a>On that basis, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment, and, if she presses it, I invite the House to resist it.</p>

There are 211 new lines in the Bill that have not been discussed by another place. It is groundbreaking stuff, which many of us do not understand and on which many in the House of Commons ought to be able to give a view.

I thank those who have supported me in this debate. I share the respect held for the noble Lord, Lord Walton, in all parts of this House. He said, perfectly correctly, that the medical ethics committee of the BMA had debated the consent exemptions for children and for tissue already in storage and considered them to be reasonable.

Section 7 of the 1990 Act requires the HFEA to produce an annual report. Section 7(1) requires a report covering a year that runs from August to July, reflecting the fact that the HFEA came into operation on 1 August 1991.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="08102966000073"></a>This statutory instrument enables the Government to effect the provisions in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the TCE Act, which widened the pool of candidates eligible for judicial office. I will begin by discussing the changes to judicial eligibility set out in the TCE Act, some of which have already been implemented, and the reasons behind them. I will then go on to talk in detail about the content of the statutory instrument we have before us. I will do my best to explain what it does and how we put it together. I will then go on to discuss what some of the benefits of the changes will be. I hope not to be too long in moving this particular statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="08102966000074"></a>I would like to begin by providing some background to the statutory instrument. The Ministry of Justice is currently implementing Sections 50 to 52 of the TCE Act 2007. These sections change the eligibility requirements for judicial office in three key ways. First, they introduce a new judicial-appointment eligibility condition. In the past, individuals were usually eligible for judicial appointment if they held rights of audience for a specified period. There was no requirement that they had actually practised in the law or gained any relevant experience. That has now been changed, so that individuals wishing to apply must satisfy the judicial-appointment condition. That means that they must hold a relevant qualification and be able to show evidence of post-qualification legal experience in relation to most judicial offices. For these purposes, a relevant qualification is held by a person if he is a solicitor or barrister or holds a qualification specified under the order-making power in Section 51 of the TCE Act 2007. This change came into force on 21 July 2008. It supports quality by ensuring that all those applying for judicial office have some relevant experience in the law.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="08102966000075"></a>Secondly, the TCE Act reduced the number of years post-qualification legal experience required for judicial office from 10 and seven years to seven and five years respectively, depending on the appointment, by amending the relevant pieces of legislation providing for judicial appointments. The change opens up judicial appointments to a wider range of individuals than were previously eligible. That also came into force on 21 July 2008.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="08102966000076"></a>The third change is the one that we are here to debate today. Section 51 of the TCE Act introduced order-making powers to enable the Lord Chancellor to extend eligibility to holders of qualifications issued by the Institute of Legal Executives, and other qualifications issued by authorised bodies under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 in relation to judicial offices specified in the order. The Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys and the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys are authorised bodies for these purposes. Qualifications specified under this power will be relevant qualifications for the purposes of the judicial-appointment eligibility condition which I mentioned previously.</p>

I will explain the policy principle behind these changes. The key purpose of this package is to support diversity by widening the range of people who are eligible for judicial appointment, and to ensure that all those with the requisite qualifications, skills and experience can apply.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="08102966000078"></a>The Government are committed to increasing public confidence in the justice system, and one way to support that is to have a judiciary that broadly reflects the society it serves. Women are under-represented in the judiciary and in fact make up less than 20 per cent of the courts&#146; judiciary in England and Wales. The comparable figure for the number of women in the population of England and Wales is 51.3 per cent. Similarly, 7.9 per cent of the UK population is from a BME background, but only 4 per cent of the English and Welsh judiciary fall into this category. It is essential that we take steps to ensure that we recruit judges from the widest possible pool of available talent. That is what these sections of the Act seek to do.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="08102966000079"></a>With regard to the statutory instrument, the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act introduced order-making powers to allow the Lord Chancellor to extend eligibility for judicial office to members of certain bodies. The changes set out in this statutory instrument will, for the first time in England and Wales, open up judicial office to qualified legal practitioners other than barristers and solicitors.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="08102966000080"></a>I will say a word about legal executives. Only fellows of ILEX may describe themselves as legal executives. They are qualified lawyers who specialise in a particular area of law. Practitioners have to pass the ILEX professional qualification in law, in an area of legal practice, to the same level as that required of solicitors. To be allowed to call themselves legal executives, members must have spent at least five years working under the supervision of a solicitor in legal practice, or in the legal department of a private company or of local or national government.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="08102966000081"></a>Trade mark attorneys are qualified legal professionals who specialise in national and international trade mark law. To be registered with ITMA, members must pass examinations in the legal procedures regarding trade mark law, not only in the UK, but also in more than 20 foreign countries. Members of ITMA must also undertake continued professional development.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="08102966000082"></a>Patent attorneys have expertise in the field of intellectual property. They work to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights. All patent attorneys require a scientific or technical background, followed by practical legal training in a patent attorney&#146;s office, alongside academic studies. Patent attorneys must register with the CIPA, pass CIPA examinations and then complete a set training period. It should be clear from these descriptions that there is a great wealth of talent within these three professions that could be of benefit to our judiciary.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="08102966000083"></a>It was considered that the current eligibility criteria were too limiting, as they were based on the assumption that only qualified solicitors or barristers could demonstrate the qualities and abilities required of a judicial office-holder. Once this statutory instrument  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1678"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is made, other legal professionals will have the opportunity to compete for judicial posts on the same terms as solicitors and barristers.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="08102966000084"></a>The statutory instrument sets out which posts the fellows of ILEX, registered patent attorneys and registered trade mark attorneys will be eligible for. As regards the range of posts, a guiding principle shaping the content of the statutory instrument was that, in the first instance, fellows of ILEX, registered patent attorneys and trade mark attorneys should be eligible for more junior level judicial posts. These have been defined as posts roughly analogous to district judge level, first-tier tribunal posts or posts requiring five years&#146; post-qualification experience. This was considered to be an appropriate initial level, to give time for the changes to bed in. The Lord Chancellor has the power to make further orders in future, should he consider it appropriate, to expand the list of qualifications and posts set out in the statutory instrument. For example, if fellows of ILEX are competing successfully alongside barristers and solicitors for judicial posts, the Lord Chancellor may consider it appropriate to extend the list further.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="08102966000085"></a>At every stage of the process, the Ministry of Justice has been working with others to ensure that the list of posts is appropriate. A project board was set up to draft the statutory instrument and to implement the related sections of the Act. There was also a full public consultation. The Government formally consulted a wide range of interested parties and specifically contacted groups that represent particular diversity interests in the legal and judicial professions.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="08102966000086"></a>Most of the respondents to the consultation were broadly in favour of the proposals. There was some disappointment in ILEX that their members would not be eligible for district judge posts until 2010. ILEX considered that this staged approach was not necessary. However, the phased implementation of the office of district judge reflects the policy that candidates for that office must usually serve for two years as a fee-paid deputy district judge before applying to become a district judge. In practice, therefore, we believe that the phasing will have very little impact on the eligibility of fellows of ILEX. Apart from that issue, ILEX was supportive of the proposals.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="08102966000087"></a>A further outcome from the consultation was that we agreed to review the operation of the policy in two years&#146; time. This was requested to ensure that we continually monitor the effectiveness of the policy and its impact on diversity. We were happy to accept that suggestion.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="08102966000088"></a>To sum up, the statutory instrument as drafted grants the fellows of ILEX eligibility for a wide range of more junior level judicial posts. In due course, they will be eligible to apply for the office of district judge and thereafter circuit judge. Registered patent attorneys and trade mark attorneys will become eligible for specialist roles in recognition of their experience.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="08102966000089"></a>We believe that the changes set out in this statutory instrument will help to increase the diversity of the judiciary in terms of professional background. They will support the judiciary in further reflecting the diverse make-up of our society, which we trust will ultimately increase public confidence in our justice system. They will enhance the quality and reputation

<a name="08102966000091"></a><a name="81029-0017.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81029-0017.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08102966000293"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, I shall be very brief but I wish to make one or two small points. I have no problem of substance with the order; it is merely a question of process. First, I commend the Ministry of Justice for the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the order. Some Explanatory Memoranda are not that helpful or revealing. I thought that the explanation in this document was extremely clear and extremely well done, so I should like to place on record that this represents, in effect, best practice.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="08102966000092"></a>I wish to make a very minor point with regard to process. As the Explanatory Memorandum makes clear and as the Minister has touched upon, the process of consultation with affected groups seems to have been well done and it is well explained. My only query concerns paragraph 7.6, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_201"></a><a name="08102966000123"></a>&#147;The level of public interest in the policy has been minimal&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102966000111"></a>The way that that is expressed is refreshing, but it goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_202"></a><a name="08102966000124"></a>&#147;No individual members of the public responded&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08102966000112"></a>That may be partly due to the mode of publication, which is principally the website. Even if there had been more widespread dissemination, I suspect that public interest would still have been minimal, but it raises an important point of principle. One needs to reflect on how one goes beyond the affected interests to let people know what is going on and at least give them an opportunity to comment if they wish. That is the only real point that I wish to pick up on but I do so in the context that I find this a very good Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="08102966000093"></a><a name="81029-0017.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81029-0017.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08102966000294"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister in particular for his admirable brevity in introducing the order. I wish to say a word or two about timing. The Minister will know that when we originally discussed when we would debate the order, we agreed that it was to be in the dinner hour. Then the dinner hour ceased to exist and it was to be at the end of business. However, we were all assured that the end of business would be somewhat earlier than it turned out to be, which is rather unfortunate. I do not know whose fault that is. If it is the fault of the Government Whips Office, I shall get my revenge in the usual way in due course. It may be the fault of the usual channels. I have been part of the usual channels and I know that sometimes they get things wrong. It may be my own fault in naively accepting the original deal as to when the order would be debated. Whatever has happened, it is unfortunate that we have had to delay dealing with the order as much as we have, particularly as we were assured that it would happen somewhat earlier.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="08102966000094"></a>I turn to the substance of the order. Like my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth, I, too, was grateful for a very clear Explanatory Memorandum. Sometimes when one gets an order one cannot understand it at all. One turns to the Explanatory Memorandum but is left in  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1680"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column 1680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>even greater confusion about what is going on. On this occasion, the whole thing was clear and we were grateful for that.</p>

<a name="81029-0017.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="08102966000095"></a>Secondly, and again like my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth, we were grateful for the level of consultation that took place on this order, particularly in the light of some of my past comments to the Minister about consultation on Titan prisons, or whatever. That a large number of bodies were consulted, both within government and outside in the voluntary sector, is listed in paragraph 7.7 of the Explanatory Memorandum. We are also grateful that the Government took some note of the consultation that took place, in that a point that the CBI put to them about whether certain fellows of ILEX might not have enough experience to sit on employment tribunals was taken into account.</p>

<a name="81029-0018.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="08102966000096"></a>I understand that the CBI was concerned about another tribunal, and on that occasion&#151;I forget which, but the noble Lord may be able to remind me&#151;the Government did not accept their concerns. Will the Minister deal with that point, and say whether it would also have been wise to have listened to the CBI on that concern? Having said that, we have no objection to the order.</p>

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="08102966000097"></a><a name="81029-0018.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81029-0018.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08102966000295"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, your Lordships should know that I have always been a supporter of the Institute of Legal Executives, because from the time I started in the legal profession I realised that there were many people of great talent whose background had prevented them qualifying in the usual way. One problem with the legal profession was that it set up barriers that prevented people fulfilling their talents. For many people, the Institute of Legal Executives was a major step forward in opening the door to a professional qualification. I am pleased to have been a part of the process of seeing their chances and opportunities developing.</p>

<a name="81029-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="08102966000098"></a>The Minister may recall that, during the passing of the Bill, I spoke in favour of these proposals and said I did not believe there should ever be a ceiling for legal executives. There should be no doors closed, and no ceiling, but at the same time there have to be standards. It is important that we remember, at all times, the principles for judicial appointments: independence of the judiciary, appointment on merit, equality, openness, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness. The judiciary, very properly, have high standards because they serve the public, who have to have confidence at the levels of both district judges and first-tier tribunals, which is how these proposals are now framed.</p>

<a name="81029-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="08102966000099"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and support fully the aim of the order. I look forward to seeing many people, from all sorts of diverse backgrounds&#151;people who have, in the past, been prevented from giving their talents to the service of the public&#151;coming on board the judiciary and playing an important part in the legal life of this country.</p>

Sometimes,

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for supporting that view of the memorandum in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="08102966000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, referred to the lack of public interest in the consultation. He will know that consultation papers were set out on a website and we would be very interested to know if he has some thoughts about how better and more widely we can give information about such an important consultation in future. Perhaps the noble Lord would be good enough to let us know. It is a matter of some interest. He will know also that a wide group of bodies were consulted. He can imagine who they were and I have a copy of them here. We are grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="81029-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="08102966000102"></a>I am grateful also to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for his support and his comments. He mentioned the concerns of the CBI. Concerns were expressed by the CBI and the TUC that fellows of Ilex would not possess the necessary skills and experience to act as judges in employment tribunals. There was some lengthy consideration and negotiation with all those involved and with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which has responsibility for policy on employment tribunals. It was decided that employment tribunals should remain on the list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="08102966000103"></a>Finally, but not least, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who has for many years been a keen supporter of the widening of eligibility

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000011"></a>The noble Lord said: The Police Act 1996, as amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, contains power for the Secretary of State to make regulations as to the government, administration and conditions of service of police forces. Today, in an effort to further improve the arrangements for dealing with issues of unsatisfactory performance or misconduct relating to police officers, we are introducing these three statutory instruments.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000012"></a>The statutory instruments establish a new set of procedures governing police disciplinary matters, in response to the recommendations of the Taylor review. The Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008 establish procedures for taking action in respect of misconduct by police officers and special constables. The Police (Performance) Regulations 2008 establish procedures for dealing with issues of unsatisfactory performance and attendance on the part of police officers&#151;apart from senior officers&#151;and special constables. The Police Appeals Tribunals Rules 2008 provide for appeals to a police appeals tribunal against the findings and specific outcomes from both the conduct and performance regulations.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000013"></a>These instruments have been prepared following the passing of primary legislation in the recent Criminal Justice and Immigration Act and enjoy the full support of the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales and the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000014"></a>It may be helpful to the Committee if I set out the background to the making of these instruments. The Taylor review of police disciplinary arrangements was the review conducted by William Taylor CBE QPM, a former commissioner of the City of London Police and former HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, into the effectiveness of disciplinary arrangements for police officers. The programme board that guided and  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>informed the review consisted of all the main police stakeholders and other invited organisations: the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Police Federation of England and Wales, the Police Superintendents&#146; Association of England and Wales, the Chief Police Officers&#146; Staff Association, the National Black Police Association, representatives of Special Constabulary, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, UNISON, Liberty and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000015"></a>The key recommendations of the Taylor report&#151;there were 19 in total&#151;include the ones that I will highlight today. They are that the police officer disciplinary arrangements are most appropriately determined by Parliament, after extensive consultation; that a new single code should be produced to be a touchstone for individual behaviour and a clear indication of organisational and peer expectations; and that, although regulated, the new procedures should be based on the ACAS code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures. The report also recommended that conduct issues should be separated into two distinct groups&#151;misconduct and gross misconduct&#151;in order to promote proportionate handling, to clarify the available outcomes and to provide a better public understanding of the policing environment; that the police service must manage the disciplinary arrangements dynamically in order to drive through changes to the internal culture of the organisation and to promote acceptance of responsibility at all levels of management; and, importantly, that the procedures for dealing with the unsatisfactory performance of a police officer should be reviewed. The recommendations contained in the report were accepted by the programme board and Ministers and led to the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales being asked to take forward the process of implementing the recommendations.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000016"></a>There are five points that I should like to emphasise about the new regulations. First, the Taylor review found that the current system of dealing with police misconduct can be both slow and disproportionate and gives little or no encouragement to managers to deal swiftly and proportionately with low-level misconduct matters. Disciplinary hearings were seen as being more akin to criminal court hearings and even low-level misconduct matters were decided by a three-person panel of senior police officers. The new system ensures that police managers are given the responsibility and ability to deal with misconduct in a fair and proportionate manner at the local level. Also, timescales are built into the process to ensure timeliness in all misconduct and gross misconduct cases. An independent member, appointed by the police authority, will also sit on gross misconduct panels to bring a public perspective in holding police officers to account.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000017"></a>Secondly, as I said, the Taylor report proposed that there should be a new single code, which should be the touchstone for individual behaviour and a clear indication of organisational and peer expectations. We, together with all stakeholders, have produced the new standards of professional behaviour for police officers, which form part of the conduct regulations. The standards set out clear expectations of the behaviour that the public and colleagues expect of all police officers.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000018"></a>The Taylor review also proposed that the new misconduct procedures should be based on the ACAS principles, which would modernise the system and make it easier for individual officers and the police service generally to learn lessons and improve their service to the public. One of the key points to emerge was the need to shift the emphasis and culture in police misconduct and unsatisfactory performance matters from blame and punishment towards a focus on development and improvement.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000019"></a>Fourthly, the report stressed the importance of carrying out a full assessment of the alleged conduct at an early stage with a view to implementing a proportionate response. The new procedures have incorporated the requirement for this objective assessment to take place at an early stage.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000020"></a>Finally, the report recommended a review of the existing unsatisfactory performance procedures that deal with individual poor performance and attendance of police officers. This recommendation has been implemented through the new performance regulations, which set out the procedures for dealing with the individual poor performance or attendance of police officers.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000021"></a>The Police Appeals Tribunals Rules provide for appeals against the findings and specific outcomes relating to cases considered under the new conduct or performance regulations. Appeals should be dealt with in a timely and proportionate manner; timescales are built into the new rules to ensure that this is the case. The police appeals tribunal chair will have the power to dismiss appeals at an early stage, where there is no real prospect of success and no other compelling reason why the appeal should proceed. The tribunal will have the power to overturn the finding of the original panel that considered the conduct or performance case and to amend the sanction imposed.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000022"></a>In addition to our statutory duty to consult the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales, the new procedures have undergone extensive consultation with all chief constables in England and Wales, police authorities, police staff associations and non-police bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality, which is of course now the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and the Equal Opportunities Commission. In addition, in accordance with our statutory duty, we have consulted the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council on the draft Police Appeals Tribunals Rules.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000023"></a>The response to the consultation has been broadly supportive of both the policy behind the changes to the misconduct and performance procedures and the detail of the regulations and rules themselves. Stakeholders and other organisations are keen to move to a system that deals with misconduct and poor performance in a more timely and proportionate manner. The Home Office and the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales have considered each of the responses received and made appropriate changes to the policy and the instruments. These changes have been made with the approval of all those organisations represented on the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000024"></a>The Police Advisory Board working party has met 29 times over 33 months to take forward the implementation of the Taylor recommendations. The working party has overseen the various consultation exercises that I have set out. It has fully approved the policy underlying the new procedures. That is what these instruments seek to achieve and I therefore commend them to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08102944000026"></a><a name="81029-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08102944000112"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I thank the Minister for that comprehensive introduction of the rules and regulations. They were debated independently and separately in the other place, but I am happy that they should be considered together today. They form a composite part of the reform of the disciplinary and performance proceedings for police officers, so there seems no reason to separate them out.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000027"></a>As the Minister said, the regulations arise out of the important Taylor report of 2004, which was undertaken against a background of concern over the overly ponderous proceedings&#151;they were slow, as the Minister said&#151;for dealing with complaints about police officers, either from the public or internally, and/or the poor performance of officers.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000028"></a>We support these regulations. They are sensible, in our view, and sensible ways have been found to turn what were completely adversarial proceedings in front of a panel into a much more measured response, particularly for the less serious matters. Those can be dealt with by an immediate line manager in the first instance, following, as the Minister has said, an assessment of the alleged conduct.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000029"></a>The changes to both the misconduct and the performance procedures are seen as a means of identifying lessons to be learnt from what has happened, both for the individual and for the service, and to provide guidance for the officer&#146;s development and future behavioural performance. I see how guidance can be given on the latter&#151;that is, the future behavioural performance of an individual&#151;but how are the lessons learnt from an individual case to be promoted into one for the service? As I understand it, under Regulation 58 of the conduct regulations, the records of either the misdemeanour or the poor performance will have to be kept by the senior officers of an individual force and, consequently, will presumably be monitored. Will those then be collated by the Home Office or by some other body for further action? Since Parliament has been quite specifically made the keeper of the procedures, is it intended that a report will be brought from time to time to both Houses on the nature of the complaints and their outcomes? Perhaps the Minister could give us a response to that.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000030"></a>My second main question arises from one raised by my honourable friend David Ruffley in the other place, which bears consideration again today. It concerns the training that will be available to the managers who will now have the responsibility for handling discipline or performance issues. In essence, those managers may be only marginally more senior than the person about whom the complaint has been made. In most organisations  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where this form of handling matters is the norm&#151;by and large it is the norm across the public service&#151;the department of human resources first ensures that the procedures are well understood by all staff and then makes certain that anyone who has to implement them has been formally trained in how to do so, to ensure that they are impartial and that they carry out the procedures in a proper manner. What guidance will be issued to that effect? I appreciate that the code is going to be brought forward, but this is a specific implementation of that code.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000031"></a>I know that since 2004, when the Taylor report was finalised, considerable discussion has taken place within the service to ensure that the final legislation before us today is largely accepted and agreed, allowing for the fact that amendments had to be made to it. We are fortunate in this country to have a police force that is made up of officers who are wholly committed to providing a service of integrity and discipline, who are on duty day in and day out&#151;they are never wholly off duty&#151;and who largely deal with what comes about in a professional manner. We are therefore talking today about a relatively small number who do not live up to those standards. Some may infringe or breach the codes of discipline and some may behave unacceptably. It is to managing these that the regulations relate and we therefore welcome them.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000032"></a>I have not touched on the appeals tribunals so far and I do not intend to do any more than ask the Minister about the appointment of the chair. The chair can make a decision that has a fundamental effect on an appeal from a person whose ways have been found to be in error. Where will the chair be appointed from? Will it be a public appointment? Will they have to have a legal qualification? Presumably, and I hope that the answer to this is yes, they will already have had tribunal experience. When you put into the hands of one person either the decision or the right to turn down the appeal, even when it is glaringly obvious that that is the right thing to do, there is a huge responsibility on that person.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000033"></a>Finally, it has taken nearly four years for these regulations to come before us. I have no complaint about that because clearly they have been the subject of a great deal of consultation, but can the Minister give us the timetable for ensuring that the codes and procedures are introduced into the force so that it is not another four years before they are under way?</p>
<h5><a name="08102944000034"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08102944000035"></a><a name="81029-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08102944000113"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the instruments and I welcome him to what is probably his first question and answer session on police matters. I begin by declaring an interest as a former chair for eight years of a police authority, whose complaints committee I also chaired. I am also vice-chair of the Association of Police Authorities. About 12 years ago, when I was in the middle of a serious and difficult complaint procedure in my county, I asked for precisely what we have before us today, so I am grateful to all those who have taken part in working through these complex problems and who have come up with what I think is a good way forward.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000036"></a>Police officers want and need a better system; they deserve it. These matters affect them and their families tremendously. When police officers are subject to disciplinary procedure, it is not just the officer who has to go through the terrible difficulties surrounding it. Whether in the end they are found guilty or declared innocent, the process itself affects them. I have seen the dreadful effect that it has had on a number of police officers. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, fortunately this will apply only to a few police officers; indeed, the gross misconduct procedures will, thankfully, apply to a tiny minority in the totality of policing. A single code for disciplinary arrangements is therefore long overdue.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000037"></a>The degrees of misconduct have been well highlighted and should be recognised, but what is important is, as the noble Baroness said, how those procedures will be implemented. The time limits on the process are crucial. Months can go by. That is one of the most difficult challenges for everyone concerned. Anything that can bring down the time limits, certainly for simple and straightforward matters, is valuable. These issues should be dealt with at the lowest possible level. I think that a basic command unit commander would be absolutely ideal. However, I am happy to note that an independent member will sit on the gross misconduct panel, so we go from one extreme to the other. The presence of an independent person would have been helpful in the difficult case in which I was involved.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000038"></a>Moving from blame and punishment to development and improvement certainly is the way forward and I commend it. The cost of prolonged inquiries is enormous, as I found out to our cost, because the money comes out of the finite police authority budget. I welcome the fact that all the organisations that have a stake&#151;although I hate that word&#151;in policing have done an excellent job in bringing forward these proposals. It cannot have been easy. Having been a member of the PNB and the PAB and knowing how these things operate, I am well aware of the difficulties in trying to sort out the problems.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000039"></a>I have one or two fairly straightforward questions for the Minister. How will the time limits be adhered to? We know that they are down, but how will the regulations be implemented in the same way across all forces? How will that be monitored? Will Parliament be told how the regulations are being used and how often they are used? I echo the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about training. I was concerned about this. How will training in these new methods be delivered? It will be significant. We must understand how difficult the culture shift will be for the service. All police officers know their disciplinary regulations. Apparently we are moving to a softer touch, but it will not be a soft touch; it will still be a severe test. It will be interesting to see how it will be delivered.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000040"></a>We very much support the Police Appeals Tribunals Rules. They are very sensible; we perfectly accept that. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, suggested, the police are subject to personal restrictions of a type not known certainly to Members of your Lordships&#146; House or to general members of the public. Police officers are   


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on duty all the time. My late former father-in-law was a chief inspector of police and one of the first things that he told me 30 or 40 years ago was that he was always on duty. He felt that he had a responsibility to the community all the time. Indeed, most police officers feel that. You do not have to have a senior role in the police to feel that you have a responsibility to the community off duty as well as on duty.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000041"></a>Finally, PCSOs were discussed in the other place. They are not subject to the same disciplinary procedures and arrangements but, as we move towards including them more formally in the policing structure, we will have to think about those procedures and arrangements. I do not think that there is an answer today, but although PCSOs are classed as civilians when difficulties arise, they are under the direction and control of the chief constable. They appear to the public as police officers, so perhaps the disciplinary arrangements should be looked at to see how they can apply to PCSOs.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000042"></a>Thankfully, we are not talking about large numbers. The police do an absolutely magnificent job in the main. Those who spoil what the police do by not behaving properly need to be weeded out. All the arrangements that are now being put into place will do that and I commend the instruments.</p>

<p><a name="08102944000043"></a><a name="81029-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08102944000114"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I am most grateful for the noble Baronesses&#146; support, for the prescient points that they make and for their correct appreciation of our police service and its probity, efficiency and loyalty. As the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, says, there are a few bad apples in every barrel, but fortunately there are far fewer in this country than in some others.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000044"></a>A number of points were made, which I shall try to deal with in the order in which I took them down. Both noble Baronesses talked about training. When you change the culture of an organisation, it is important that people understand not only why you are changing it but how they are supposed to behave in the new situation. There will be a new national training package, which will be delivered by approved external providers.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000045"></a>Training will be run for trainee managers, panel members and PCSOs. Police authorities are already training independent members. Home Office guidance will be issued and the IPCC is also training staff, so there is clearly a training package that ensures that everyone affected&#151;no doubt, including the organisations representing police officers, PCSOs and others who will have an interest&#151;will have the consultation that they will rightly demand on how their members will be dealt with and how their members as managers will deal with other people.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000046"></a>The question of the chair was raised. As I said, the police appeals tribunals consist of a three-person panel for senior officers and a four-person panel for non-senior officers. The chair is selected through the Judicial Appointments Commission and must have five years&#146; legal standing&#151;currently, nine or 10 are QCs. The second member is a Chief Inspector of Constabulary or another inspector nominated by him. The third member is the Home Office Permanent Secretary or another Home Office director appointed by him.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000047"></a>For non-senior officers, the chair must be selected through the Judicial Appointments Commission and must have five years&#146; legal standing, as before. The second member is a member of the force&#146;s police authority. The third member must be a chief officer from the officer&#146;s force or another force, especially if greater independence is thought necessary. The fourth member would be a retired staff association representative. The chair has the casting vote; he would decide on papers and dismiss the case, if he thought that appropriate, without convening the panel. However, one can have some confidence in the quality, experience and qualifications of the chairs. I hope that that answer satisfies the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000048"></a>The other issue raised was how lessons will be learnt and how best practice will be spread across the service. The professional standards directorate will gather the learning experience and ensure that it is shared through formal guidance where appropriate, but all will learn together&#151;managers, managed and the HR function.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000049"></a>This is revolutionary only in relation to the police force, which is, as I said, a disciplined force. I hope that it will be benign, in the sense of not using the old, much more adversarial system, and more akin to the things that we have already in modern industry, in modern large companies&#151;multinationals and nationals. They understand how to deal with human failing, how to take remedial action and how to assist people to improve performance; only if that fails do they look to other action.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000050"></a>The final question to which I think I can give a supportive answer concerned the operative date, which is 1 December 2008. The final question, on which I will not be able to give the same satisfaction to the noble Baronesses as I hope my other answers have given, is about reporting to Parliament. This is a procedural matter that needs to be managed as a line management issue. It is clearly something that the Home Office will take a keen interest in, so we would clearly want to ensure that the Home Office was up to date on it, but it would be overkill, unless something surprising came out of the cultural change, to require reporting to Parliament.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000051"></a>PCSOs&#146; discipline arrangements are covered in their contracts of employment. There will no doubt be consultation with associations representing civilian staff within the police service.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000052"></a>Parliament will be kept informed via the Home Office. We intend to keep the operation of the regulations under review and any changes needed will be subject to further regulations being laid before your Lordships&#146; House and Parliament in general.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000062"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this Motion, I will repeat things said recently in the other place and in this House. The Government are determined to continue to drive through the real improvements in the immigration system that we have said that we will deliver. In April 2008, we created a new force, the UK Border Agency, which brings together UKvisas, the Border and Immigration Agency and Customs at the border. We are seeing the results. I realise that I am in danger of repeating what was said to most noble Lords here just a few moments ago but, since April, we have seen the prevention of some 10,000 individuals crossing the channel; we have searched more than 500,000 freight vehicles; and we have confiscated and detected more than 1,000 forged documents. In addition, anyone applying for a visa now has their fingerprints checked against UK databases. So far, we have enrolled some 3 million sets of fingerprints.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000063"></a>We have started rolling out the tough new Australian points-based system. Analysis has shown that, if the points-based system had been in place last year, around 10 per cent fewer skilled and temporary migrants from outside Europe would have been allowed into the United Kingdom. Since we introduced new penalties for employers to combat illegal working in February 2008, fines worth about &#163;8 million have been issued. We have also unveiled foreign national ID cards, which will go live later this month.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000064"></a>The problem with all this is the cost to the Exchequer and the taxpayer. This year, we will spend more than over &#163;2 billion on securing our borders and managing the immigration system, of which &#163;670 million will have come from fees paid by those using the system. It is right and fair to the users of the immigration system and to the general public in the UK that those who benefit most from the immigration system should contribute proportionately more to the true end costs.</p>

<p><a name="08102944000065"></a>For the &#163;600 multi-tier sponsor licence fee, the sponsor is a medium or large sponsor and already holds a tier 4 or 5 sponsor licence. In respect of the first fee, the facility to apply in person is highly valued by customers as an alternative to a postal application. Tier 1, post study, will be the first applicants under the points-based system able to make a premium application under the phased implementation of the points-based system. Implementing this route will generate income estimated at &#163;2.6 million until March 2009.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000066"></a>In respect of the reduced entry clearance fees, we propose that a 10 per cent fee reduction be offered to workers who are nationals of states that have ratified the Council of Europe Social Charter&#151;namely, Turkey, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#151;applying for entry clearance. Setting these fees at reasonable levels will minimise lost income and limit the impact of a fee exemption at posts overseas. It is within UK treaty obligations to reduce or abolish fees for workers under the Council of Europe Social Charter.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000067"></a>We have also removed the fee exemption for workers under the 1996 Council of Europe revised Social Charter. Workers from Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will now pay the standard entry clearance fee. We do not feel that it is appropriate to maintain a fee exemption in respect of nationals of states that are party to a treaty that the UK has not ratified and to which it is therefore not bound. Making these changes generates income estimated at &#163;340,000 until March 2009.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000068"></a>The sponsor licence fee is for medium or large sponsors who have previously applied to bring in students or temporary workers for a fee of &#163;400 and who subsequently apply to bring in skilled workers. We want to charge &#163;600 for the second application, which would mean that they pay a total of &#163;1,000, taking them up to the cost of a stand-alone tier 2 licence fee. That is an unusual category of application, for which we expect volumes to be negligible.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000069"></a>The fees proposed here are all fair and proportionate. They would recover the costs of considering the application and contribute to the true end costs of the system.

These exemptions were introduced barely a year ago. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why they are suddenly being changed. Has the number of applications in that time been so great that a charge is seen as a deterrent? The Minister said that exemptions should not apply as regards a treaty that we have not ratified. However, that situation applied last year, so why introduce a change this year? It is quite boulevers&#233;.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000074"></a>Will any more categories be introduced before the total number of fee categories is completed? These regulations come through fairly regularly and there are all sorts of tiers and parts of tiers. It would be helpful to be told when they will be fully completed. The Explanatory Notes suggest that consolidation of the current regulations and fee charges will take place as part of the annual review in 2009 and 2010. However, the current fee charges may not be the end of the story. It would be helpful to be told whether we are nearly at the end of this process or whether we are still in the middle of it, as well as whether the consolidation will lay out the full fee regime or whether we will still be messing around with one or two categories every few months. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said in an aside that this was likely to occur monthly rather than annually, so we shall take it as likely to occur monthly.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000075"></a>I have nothing more to offer on these regulations. They are clearly part and parcel of the new way of limiting immigration into this country and rationalising the charges that we make, but we need answers to the three questions that I asked.</p>

<p><a name="08102944000076"></a><a name="81029-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08102944000121"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The Minister began his remarks by repeating some of the comments that he made in answering the Oral Question asked this afternoon by my noble friend Lord Greaves. I repeat what I said then: I hope that the Government will not claim that the credit for the fall in immigration, particularly of those coming here to seek work, belongs to the points-based system when we are already seeing a huge fall in the number of employment vacancies and a rise in unemployment, which we can be absolutely certain will get progressively worse over the next 12 months. Regardless of whether there was a points-based system, there would not be as many people coming here to work, or, indeed, in any other category of immigration. I fervently hope that the Government will not try to claim that the credit for limiting immigration belongs to the points-based system when that has nothing to do with it; falling immigration is a product of the world economic downturn.</p>

The noble Baroness reinforces my point. Most of the people who came here, such as the huge number who entered from Poland after accession,  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have gone back, leading to a net reduction in immigration from the east-EU accession countries, which people were so terrified of when those immigrants first came in. The regulations and the points-based system have nothing to do with those numbers, which we talked about at Question Time.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000079"></a>The regulations come under the regime set by Section 51 of the 2006 Act, which gives the Secretary of State power to specify fees for services provided in connection with immigration and nationality, and by Section 42, as amended, of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, which allows the fees to be set at levels higher than the cost of providing the service, as well as to cross-subsidise other services without any clear upper limit.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000080"></a>I intervened in the noble Baroness&#146;s speech to say that this event was not annual but almost monthly. To summarise, your Lordships discussed the original fees order on 8 March 2007 and the original regulations three weeks later. Since then, we had amendments to the order on 13 December 2007 and two sets of amendments to the regulations on 25 February 2008 and 17 June 2008. Although it may have been a bit of an exaggeration to say that this happens monthly, this is the sixth time that we have looked at the procedures under the current legislation. This makes it ever more difficult for practitioners and the users of the system to find their way through all the paperwork.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000081"></a>The <I>Immigration Law Handbook</I> consolidates legislation up to the point at which it is published, but the current version, from early 2007, has none of these instruments. What Parliament and users need, if we are to understand this avalanche of secondary legislation and comment on it usefully, is a draft consolidation of the original order. I think that this was the noble Baroness&#146;s point. We need consolidation as we go along, including all the amending instruments up to the one under consideration. If the Home Office wanted to be helpful, it could publish the fee regulations, as they would be amended by this instrument, as an appendix to the Explanatory Memorandum each time a new instrument is tabled. There will be many more instruments; we have dealt with only a fraction of the six tiers that are involved in the points-based system.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000082"></a>The Library helpfully provided me with the Butterworth consolidation of all the regulations up to the regulation preceding this one. I laboriously inserted into it the amendments provided by this set of regulations, although that should be done by the Home Office. I have handed to the Minister&#146;s officials work that I did over the weekend to consolidate this amendment into the previous ones. If the Minister looks through it, he will find that it is easy to follow because anything that has been removed from the previous regulations has been struck out in red. You can easily look through it and see exactly what these regulations have done. You cannot tell that simply by looking at this set of regulations unless you have the previous five instruments to refer to.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000083"></a>The fee for a particular service may reflect the benefit that the Secretary of State thinks will accrue to a successful applicant. However, if that calculation is made, the Secretary of State is not obliged to tell us on what assumptions it was based or to explain how the   


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arithmetic was done. In the case of a tier 1 post-study migrant, we are told that, in the target consultation on the fees and charges to support the points-based system that was undertaken a year ago, one employer respondent agreed that tier 1 and tier 2 applicants should pay slightly higher fees, which presumably means slightly higher than the cost, because they could earn more.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000084"></a>Unfortunately, this consultation is not available on the UK Border Agency website or in the Printed Paper Office. I was under the impression that, if any document was referred to in a Motion before the House, it should be made available to Members; if that does not extend to the Explanatory Memorandum where this consultation is referred to, it jolly well ought to. I suggest that where any consultation is mentioned the document should be put on the relevant website and made available in hard copy for noble Lords to refer to either in the House or in Grand Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="08102944000108"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000085"></a>The UKBA internal summary of the consultation, which the agency kindly sent to me when I asked for it, asked for comments on the proposal to set fees for applications under each of the tier 1 categories at levels that would continue to recover more than the normal administrative costs of considering the application. The respondents to the consultation largely agreed, subject to the costs being &#147;reasonable&#148;. UKBA says that it took on board the suggestion by some respondents that the post-study work migrants should pay less because they start as low earners. This has already been taken into account in setting their fee at &#163;400 compared with &#163;750 for normal tier 1 applicants. What would the amount have to be to recover the pure costs so that users can see whether the actual amounts being charged are slightly higher, which respondents said would be acceptable, or much higher? Why is it not possible in these consultations to give respondents a rough indication of the costs for bare recovery, the additional amount needed to recover the expenditure associated with appeals against refused applications, and the elements of cross-subsidisation?</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000086"></a>The object of the exercise is to make the successful applicants in tiers 1 and 2 not only pay for the cost of processing their own applications but also cover the additional overheads incurred by unsuccessful applicants, including the cost of the appeal system and the cross-subsidisation of other elements of the points-based system. As I have said before, this makes it more expensive for a non-EU national to come to the UK under the points-based system than any other country in the world, including Australia, about which we had an argument with the Minister&#146;s predecessor over the actual figures. I have proved to my own satisfaction that our costs are higher than those of the Australians.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000087"></a>In the previous regulations there was an exemption from tier 1 general and tier 2 entry clearance applications for citizens of both CESC and CERSC states, as referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. However, as I understand it, that was a mistake. Citizens of the CESC states will now pay 10 per cent less than the tier 1 standard entry clearance fee of &#163;600 with a similar concession on tier 2. We have not ratified the revised Social Charter and perhaps the Minister will  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confirm that we have no foreseeable intention of doing so. We are therefore not obliged and never were obliged to make any concession to non-EU signatories to the CERSC. On the other hand, the exemption from charge in respect of all tier 1 and tier 2 leave to remain applications made either by CESC or CERSC nationals is maintained because these exemptions were in place before. It is confusing to have what looks like a permanent distinction in the entry clearance and leave to remain treatment from CESC and CERSC nationals respectively. When the points-based system was first announced, it was billed as a simplification of the immigration system, but with every development it becomes more and more complex. Would the Minister explain the distinction between the CESC and the CERSC states? I share the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that we have not had a proper explanation of that treatment.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000088"></a>As regards the application for sponsor licences, the Explanatory Memorandum states that there was agreement among respondents that large businesses should pay higher fees so that small businesses and charities could be cross-subsidised. Again, no figures were given and the unpublished consultation shows that there was a,</p>
<ul><a name="08102944000106"></a>&#147;general request from all the sectors to provide actual figures&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08102944000105"></a>The universities, in particular, said that the Home Office lacks understanding of the enrolment process, which involves setting out fees in their prospectuses well in advance. The fee for a sponsorship licence for tier 4 migrants&#151;students&#151;is &#163;1,000, which I suppose is not a significant cost when spread across the number of foreign students attending most universities with a unified system of admission, but is it fair in the case of universities such as Oxford, where admission is determined by the colleges? The universities make the point that they are charities but, although there was a promise by the Government that charities would pay a reduced sponsorship licence fee, that has not been honoured. Universities pay the same as any other large sponsor.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000089"></a>I do not see the amount of the fee for individual certificates of sponsorship, which are required from institutions of higher education. In its written evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry, <I>Managing Migration: </I><I>The </I><I>Points-Based System</I>, Universities UK said that it would like a more considered and staged implementation and a more flexible approach to the certificate process for tier 4. In 2006-07, there were more than 239,000 non-EU international students at UK higher education institutions and almost 20 per cent of the staff were non-UK, to say nothing of the large number of visiting academics who come here on short visits. Those international students and staff make a vital contribution to the sector academically, culturally and financially, and there needs to be far more advance notice of the introduction of the PBS as it affects them.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000090"></a>The chairman of ILPA, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee on 8 July, said that when tier 1 went live on 29 January, and again when the next phase of tier 1 implementation happened on 30 June, the guidance notes for the sponsors were published on the same day, making it impossible for employers to check their practices for compliance in   


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>advance. If the same thing happens on 25 November, HEIs will be in serious difficulties. We want an assurance from the Government that they will discuss the timing with the HEIs and agree with them on a suitable interval between the publication of the guidance and the rollout of further tiers, especially tier 4, going live.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000091"></a>The universities also protest that they are being given no chance to test the sponsorship management system, which is the IT system into which they are required to input details of their tier 2 and tier 5 employees on 25 November, yet that system is required to operate from that day onwards not only here in the UK but at every visa post in the world. I have, with the noble Lord&#146;s assistance, a paper that I received from Universities UK, setting out those and further points of concern about the regulations&#151;I will not go into further detail on that, because he will have that in writing.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000092"></a>Finally, unemployment was already increasing at the fastest rate since the early 1990s before the world financial crash; redundancies were increasing and job vacancies were falling. UKBA figures in August showed that the number of eastern European EU migrants applying to the worker registration scheme in the second quarter of 2008 had fallen to the lowest level since accession. Presumably, as redundancies soar and vacancies plummet, the number of foreign workers in tiers 1 and 2 needed by the economy has already shrunk. It would be useful to know what the Government estimate the numbers in those categories will be over the next 12 months.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000094"></a>I understand that the regulations deal primarily with fees payable in the United Kingdom and that other statutory instruments deal with fees payable outside the United Kingdom. However, the regulations cover arrangements for some countries abroad, in particular those countries that ratified the 1961 European Social Charter. I am using the SI as a peg to deal with the practical administration of the fees regime as it exists overseas. With that in mind, I suggest an amendment to the wider regime of fees payments. I understand that the UK Border Agency publishes an annual report, the problem with which is that statistical data are general and do not cover the operations of individual UK Border Agency posts overseas where visas are granted. Parliament is entitled to have far more detailed information on the work of individual offices overseas, and therefore I make the following suggestions which are based on my experience of how the system works.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000095"></a>An amended regime should be created to include the submission by UK Border Agency outposts overseas of an annual return to be included in the agency&#146;s annual report. The return should show the number of visa applications where fees are payable in each outpost overseas; the categories under which each application

I would guess that this information is available at stations overseas; or it should be. I think also that the National Audit Office would have done some work in this area already as part of its economy, efficiency and effectiveness remit.</p>

I do not know whether there is any advice as to how far we can stray outside the terms of the regulations before we go quite beyond the pale, but this seems to be pretty far.</p>

<p><a name="08102944000097"></a><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08102944000126"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> In so far as the order deals with fees, this is pretty well on the margins of the regulations but essentially within them. Why do I believe that the information should be made available? I have tabled a number of Questions for Written Answer on a particular case, that of an application made by a person who applied for entry into the United Kingdom in Tbilisi in Georgia. There have been a large number of questions going back nine months, some of which have taken a long time to answer. In one case I think it took five months to get a holding answer which arrived at the end of July, just before the Recess. In that case, realising that something was wrong, I went to the tribunal with prepared documentation because I knew that the decision which had been taken overseas was wrong. Indeed, the tribunal chairman ruled that the decision should be overturned and the person was given access to the United Kingdom. That case threw up deficiencies in the way the system operates abroad.</p>

<p><a name="08102944000098"></a>This is basically about the practical application of the regimes that we establish in the United Kingdom. When I rang the ambassador, he told me that he could not intervene in these kinds of decisions. It begs the question: at what stage and to whom are officers overseas accountable for the decisions they take? I cannot see where the accountability lies. My suggestions for amending the regime are about securing a greater level of accountability, because Parliament is entitled to know what is happening in each office. They would not greatly increase the workload of stations overseas in so far as they already submit some of that information centrally to the United Kingdom. That information should be made public in an annual report.</p>

We have not ratified the revised Social Charter, and if that is not immediately on the horizon, it should be. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also asked about costs. I will let him have that information in due course. The fees are set within a fairly strict financial limit set by the Treasury. Within that overall limit, we set fees bearing in mind the value of the successful applicant or migrant while maintaining that the UK is an attractive destination for work and study, or to visit. As he rightly said, there is a considerable advantage to the United Kingdom&#146;s Exchequer from the &#163;2.6 billion of fees paid by overseas students per year; it is not something we take lightly.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000102"></a>The overall cost for tier 1 and tier 2 is &#163;100 million. As to any costs over that, as the noble Lord said, the subsidy rates are intended to allow the subsidy of small sponsors at the expense of larger sponsors. Whether they are monthly, annual or bi-annual, we appear to have new regulations at frequent intervals. That is in part because of the introduction of the new phased five-tier system. When the introduction of fees takes place for the tax year starting in April 2009, it is intended to consolidate the charges for this year. There have been inevitable changes to the regulations this year due to the phased roll-out of the points-based system. Criticism about the ability of employers and others to see and understand the information is taken. In its response, the department will seek to provide assurances that it will deal with this point expeditiously.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08102944000103"></a>On the two points made by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, I am not qualified to judge the tangent one must reach before escaping the regulations. Although perhaps it is not a question I should answer, as I have been given notice, it seems sensible to seek a detailed response for my noble friend in due course.</p>

Why have the exemptions under the Council of Europe Social Charter and the Council of Europe revised Social Charter been dismissed after such a short time? They were introduced only a year ago. I asked whether it was because there had been so many applications or for another reason.</p>

I also omitted another charge to which I shall respond first because it is easier; namely, whether the Government would seek to take any credit for the fact that the new system comes in at a time when there is a falling roll of people seeking to join. It is beyond belief that the Government would ever take credit for anything for which they are not fully responsible, but I am assured that if they ever seek to do so, the noble Lord and his colleagues on other Benches will be the first to remind the Government that the credit is not necessarily due to them.</p>

<p><a name="08102946000004"></a>When the PBS fees regulations were drafted in April, a decision was taken to include a fee exemption for entry clearance applicants for workers who were nationals of countries that had ratified the 1961 Council of Europe Social Charter. The fee exemption was included to ensure compliance with our obligations under international law and a consistent approach towards in-country and out-of-country applicants, as similar exemptions already apply to leave-to-remain applicants. However, the 1961 Social Charter requires us to abolish or reduce fees for workers. We are therefore offering a 10 per cent reduction in fees for workers in compliance with our international obligations, while ensuring that those who benefit from the immigration system contribute to the cost. We also wish to discourage spurious applications. Applications from workers from countries that have ratified the 1996 revised Social Charter will pay the standard fee, because, as I said, the UK has not ratified that charter and is not bound by it.</p>

<p><a name="08102946000010"></a><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08102946000055"></a>Lord Brett</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the International Criminal Court (Remand Time) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000011"></a>The noble Lord said: The International Criminal Court Act 2001 ensures that the United Kingdom complies with the requirements of the statute of Rome, which created the International Criminal Court, and can play a full part in the life of that court. Today, in an effort further to ensure that the UK plays a key role in the life of the court and continues to comply with all the court&#146;s procedural rules, we seek to specify the total upper limit of time for which an individual arrested under Section 3 of the Act can be held on remand, along with the upper limit of time for which an individual can be held on remand on any single occasion following a Section 3 provisional arrest.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000012"></a>The order intends to set those limits at 60 days and 18 days respectively. The UK believes it to be of fundamental importance to bring to justice perpetrators of international crime, including genocide, war crimes   


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and crimes against humanity. We are rightly a signatory to the Rome statute, which, as I said, established the International Criminal Court, which has jurisdiction over the crimes that I mentioned, and we were among the court&#146;s founding members. We have also supported the International Criminal Tribunal, which was established for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000013"></a>The UK has legislated through the International Criminal Court Act 2001 to ensure that we comply fully with our obligations as set out in the Rome statute. It is now necessary to update the existing legislation in order to continue to fulfil our obligations to the court and to meet its procedural rules, specifically in the length of time an accused person can be held on remand following a request from the International Criminal Court for a provisional arrest. Under Section 2 of the Act, the UK can successfully execute non-urgent requests received from the court for the arrest and surrender of accused persons. In urgent cases, however, the court may request that the UK provisionally arrest a person alleged to have committed a crime over which it has jurisdiction. This arrest does not lead to surrender until a Section 2 request is received and is properly considered by a competent UK court. This is legislated for in Section 3 of the Act.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000014"></a>When the International Criminal Court Act 2001 was adopted, the court had not yet decided the total length of time for which a person may be remanded in custody following his provisional arrest. This is because such rules were not to be adopted until the first meeting of the Assembly of States Parties, which itself took place only after 60 states had ratified the Rome statute.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000015"></a>Such rules have now been adopted by the court and can be found in Rule 188 of the International Criminal Court Rules of Procedure and Evidence. This sets the upper limit for the total number of days a person can be held on remand as 60. Consequently, and as required by Section 4(4)(b) of the International Criminal Court Act 2001, an Order in Council is needed to update our existing legislation and ensure that the UK continues to meet its obligations to the court.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000016"></a>At the same time it is advisable to update the International Criminal Court Act 2001 to reflect the maximum length of time a person can be held on remand on any single occasion following a provisional arrest under Section 3 of the International Criminal Court Act. This is again done through an Order in Council process as set out in Section 4(4)(b) of the Act.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000017"></a>In relation to the equivalent provisions for the two other United Nations established courts I referred to earlier, the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, a limit of 18 days was adopted. This was done through the United Nations (International Tribunal) (Former Yugoslavia) Order 1996 and the United Nations (International Tribunal) (Rwanda) Order 1996. I see no reason to deviate from this precedent and 18 days is again the proposed limit that a person may be held on remand on any single occasion. Both these limits will ensure that a person arrested following a provisional arrest request from the ICC will not be held indefinitely

<p><a name="08102946000019"></a><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08102946000056"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> As I am sure that in 2001 the International Criminal Court Act received the closest scrutiny in this House&#151;I was not here and therefore was not part and parcel of that process&#151;I want to ask a couple of questions, and I hope this does not sound as though I should know the answer.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000020"></a>This order relates to a provisional warrant, which by definition is not a full warrant. What is being proposed is that under a provisional warrant, the maximum period of remand on the first occasion should be 18 days and the total amount of time should be 60 days. That is clear. What I am not clear about is what happens when the full warrant is issued. Presumably under the full warrant, the process starts all over again. It would be interesting to know what the absolute maximum amount of time under any International Criminal Court warrant is; that is, under both the provisional and the full warrant. It may be that they are one and the same thing&#151;and this is where I apologise because my ignorance of the previous legislation is now going to show&#151;but there is a possibility that 60 days is not the limit on the time that someone might be held on remand in custody under this international warrant. That is my first question.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000021"></a>The second concerns the appeal procedure under the warrant, and to whom an appeal against the warrant is made. Under an international warrant, presumably the offence does not have to be one that would be an offence in this country; it could be something which is an offence in another country, but not applicable here. There has been a recent case under the European arrest warrant where the offence was not related to one that we would recognise. To whom is an appeal made against arrest under the warrant? Is it to a judge in this country, is to the High Court, or are there no appeal proceedings?</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000022"></a>Those are the two main questions and I hope that the noble Lord will be able to answer them.</p>

<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>What action is being taken to establish a tracking unit in the office of the International Criminal Court to check on the movement of people who are wanted by the court and who may travel clandestinely from one country to another to avoid arrest? That may be particularly important in the case of sealed indictments, where the accused person might conceivably get through our immigration controls as an ordinary tourist without the immigration authorities being aware that he was wanted by the court.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000025"></a>In the case of previous sealed indictments, the ICC notified certain countries to which it was considered likely that a person might flee. Jean-Pierre Bemba was wanted for offences in the Central African Republic and arrested in Belgium the day after the pre-trial chamber found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he bore individual criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Central African Republic. In that case, it was known that he was in Belgium&#151;I believe that he had property there&#151;but the whereabouts of a wanted person may not always be as clear as it was in that case.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000026"></a>Tracking units were established for both the ICTY and the ICTR, and it would be logical to extend the concept of the ICC as it has been advocated by Human Rights Watch and others. What would the mechanism be for implementing the proposal, and does it have the Government's support? I understand that there are no sealed indictments at the moment in respect of any of the states where offences have been committed under the Rome statute&#151;the DRC, Uganda, the Central African Republic and Sudan&#151;but what would happen where an alleged criminal wanted by the ICC comes here as an ordinary tourist, say, without it being suspected by the immigration authorities that he is wanted? By what procedures might such a person be apprehended if we did not know that the ICC was after him?</p>

<p><a name="08102946000027"></a><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0003.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08102946000058"></a>Lord Brett:</b> The first question was: what is the maximum time limit when a formal request is received? There is no maximum under the statute. It would depend on how long the proceedings would take, but it is intended that the procedure would be fairly brief, as issues to be considered by the court are time-limited to the order and the warrant issued by the court.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000028"></a>On the route to appeal, once a Section 2 warrant has been received it is for the magistrate&#146;s court to decide whether to make a delivery order. If the court makes a delivery order, it can be challenged by the person concerned by applying to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000029"></a>On tracking units, there is a mechanism for the ICC to inform the UK of the likelihood of persons coming, but I am not fully aware of the detail that would apply or of the procedures, so I will get back to the noble Lord in due course, if that is acceptable.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000034"></a>The noble Baroness said: The order has been laid before Parliament under Section 9(9) of the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947. Since its introduction at the request of the woollen industry in 1950, the wool textile industry export promotion levy has provided funds to the National Wool Textile Export Corporation&#151;NWTEC&#151;to promote the export of wool textiles. The statutory levy is collected twice a year from about 100 wool processors and suppliers of fibre. The levy currently raises approximately &#163;186,000 per year, which accounts for just over half of NWTEC&#146;s annual income. The average levy payment per company is about &#163;1,868 per annum.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000035"></a>In view of the Government&#146;s aim to reduce bureaucracy by removing outdated and unnecessary legislation, and following representations by some companies in the wool industry that wished to see the levy ended, the Government undertook a consultation in 2007 to determine the future of the levy. We consulted NWTEC, trade associations and other stakeholders, including the trade unions, but most importantly the companies that pay the levy. The overwhelming majority of those who responded to the consultation wished to see the levy ended. Having taken full account of the outcome of the consultation, Ministers have decided to end the levy. Closure of the levy will allow businesses in the wool industry to determine for themselves how they spend their money on overseas marketing. That will bring them in line with other textile and manufacturing sectors.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000036"></a>NWTEC and the Confederation of British Wool Textiles have been encouraged to work together and with other related bodies to develop an alternative voluntary funding arrangement to promote the wool textile sector overseas, if that is what the industry wants. Although the majority of those who responded wanted an immediate end to the levy, my colleagues decided that a reasonable period of time should be allowed for NWTEC and CBWT to put an alternative arrangement in place. Over the past few months, NWTEC has been making progress on this front on a voluntary scheme to start in 2009, timed to coincide with the end of the payments that they will receive from the levy collected for the period up to 30 September 2008.</p>

Given that it seeks to cut regulation, primarily regulation of small businesses, I have no difficulty in supporting it.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000040"></a>To put it into perspective, the levy currently raises about &#163;190,000 a year, which accounts for just over half of the National Wool Textile Export Corporation&#146;s annual income. The average levy payment is just under &#163;1,900 a year. Under the order, the corporation will see its budget cut by half. The department has stated that UKTI will work closely with the corporation to continue the promotion of wool exports.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000041"></a>I have a couple of questions for the Minister. Will that funding shortfall need to be made up from the budget of UKTI? If so, will her department be providing UKTI with an increase in its budget? Does she believe that voluntary arrangements in the industry will cover the shortfall? Is it proposed simply to cease to make the expenditure at all? Removing unnecessary regulation from business and allowing firms to target their export promotion funding themselves could well be sensible steps. However, what measures, if any, has the Minister thought necessary to make to ensure that overseas promotion of the British wool industry remains focused and coherent?</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08102946000042"></a>Only 44 per cent of the 91 current levy payers responded to the department&#146;s consultation. Does the Minister believe that any steps could or should have been taken to encourage greater participation? As a matter of interest, can we expect similar revocation orders for export corporations for other industries in future? Having raised those relatively minor questions, as I said, we shall not stand in the way of this measure. However, I look forward to hearing the noble Baroness&#146;s comments.</p>

I shall be interested to hear the noble Baroness&#146;s response to the questions asked from the Tory Benches. However, this is a sad commentary on the decline of our wool textile industry. Whether the drop in the exchange rate will result in an increase in wool textiles, only time will tell, but it looks as though we are coming close to the end of what used to be a major industry in our country. If you wanted a commentary on what has happened to our manufacturing sector, it is reflected in this order.</p>

As regards the shortfall, my understanding is that we do not yet have a clear view but there is expected to be a shortfall. It is up to the industry to decide how it will market the product. As regards the demise of the industry, it has changed a lot and is very much a niche industry with its own ways of marketing. Therefore, perhaps it is not so necessary to have a common marketing strategy because it targets a certain type of high value-added market overseas and I guess that companies are reasonably well aware of where their markets are. Therefore, we did not see the need to make up the sum through UKTI funding, although it will be available to assist them if it is needed.</p>

<p><a name="08102946000045"></a>I am afraid that I do not know whether there are expected to be revocation orders for other export promotion entities. In fact, I am not entirely sure that many still exist. However, I shall endeavour to find the answer to that and write to the noble Lord. I have a breakdown of who was consulted and who responded, which I would be happy to read out, although I think that 44 per cent is not a bad response rate for consultations overall. The main people who were consulted were obviously the companies themselves, who are the users of the entity. One hundred and sixty-three questionnaires were issued, 91 to companies which currently pay the levy, 42 to companies which are liable to pay but fall below the threshold, which might account for some of the non-responses, and 30 to representative bodies. Three trade unions were involved. About 61 responses were received by the closing date. These are available on the website. We believe that represents a reasonably full view of the sector and the responses formed the basis on which the decision was taken. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for his compliment to BERR officials, which I am sure they will take kindly. I should perhaps convey my other responses to noble Lords in writing. I commend the order to your Lordships.</p>

<h5><a name="08102950000047"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08102950000005"></a><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08102950000049"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Exemption Orders (Parliamentary Procedures) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000006"></a>The noble Lord said: Without accessible transport, disabled people are limited in their ability to lead a full and fulfilling life. Noble Lords have always demonstrated a keen interest in the accessibility of rail vehicles and that is why we are now debating these orders. At the express wish of the House, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 secured greater scrutiny of applications for exemptions from parts of the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations. Under the 2005 Act, exemption orders became subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure. However, it was acknowledged that this would not be appropriate in every circumstance, and  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therefore the Act provided for the Secretary of State to bring forward regulations that set out the basis for making a decision on which parliamentary procedure to use when making exemption orders.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000007"></a>Such regulations form the first instrument before us today, the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Exemption Orders (Parliamentary Procedures) Regulations 2008. These set the criteria that the Secretary of State will use when deciding which parliamentary procedure should be followed and include, for example, the age of the vehicles and the length of time for which an exemption is requested. Parliament agreed that the Secretary of State should retain discretion to adopt a different procedure for a particular order having regard to representations from the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the Government&#146;s statutory advisers on the public passenger transport needs of disabled people.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000008"></a>I turn to the second order, the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (London Underground Victoria Line 09TS Vehicles) Exemption Order 2008. This order is fully supported by the DPTAC, Her Majesty&#146;s Railway Inspectorate and London TravelWatch, which is the official organisation representing the interests of transport users in London. The order will allow LU to introduce new trains on the Victoria line that have features not currently permitted by RVAR but which provide benefits for disabled people. The order also allows LU to resolve some of the challenges that the regulations present in the short term to a deep level metro service with high frequencies, inaccessible stations and a mix of old and new vehicles. These new vehicles will be the first for London Underground to be subject to accessibility regulations.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000009"></a>The order contains four distinct provisions. First, it allows LU to use an audible door warning which is shorter than required under RVAR while the older vehicles are being phased out. This allows a consistent warning to be given on both the new vehicles and the older, unregulated fleet, to avoid confusion. Secondly, the order allows LU to vary, on a trial basis, the announcements made on the train while it is at a station. That allows them to determine whether other information, such as details about connections, would be more useful on a metro-style service than those mandated by RVAR.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000010"></a>Thirdly, the order allows LU to use a smaller text size on public information screens inside the new vehicles. The current requirement was based on larger vehicles. On the Victoria line no one will be more than three metres from a screen, and the reduced size will allow the screens to display appropriate pictures that are particularly useful for people with learning disabilities, while still following best practice on text height relative to reading distance from the Royal National Institute of Blind People.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000011"></a>Finally, the order will allow exemptions from the requirement for step-free access between the train and the platform at specific stations. The exemptions reduce as stations gain step-free access to the platforms, ensuring seamless travel. This allows London Underground to integrate the work required with its wider step-free access programme at stations. Not only will this reduce the disruption caused by the work, it will also reduce the risk of a wheelchair user being stranded on the platform at an inaccessible station.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000012"></a>These orders are supported by stakeholders and seem to us to be sensible in the circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000013"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Exemption Orders (Parliamentary Procedures) Regulations 2008. <I>28th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I><I> and</I><I> 31st Report from the Merits Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Adonis</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08102950000014"></a><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08102950000050"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the purpose of his orders. This is the first debate I have had with him, but I have had a good report from my noble friend Lady Morris of Bolton who says that he is very good to do business with, so I look forward to doing business with him over many years.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000015"></a>I debated a similar order with the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, before the Summer Recess. At the time I said it was right that we have a relatively high hurdle of parliamentary procedures if it is desired to exempt or deviate certain vehicles from the requirements of the DDA, and I maintain that position. The parliamentary procedures regulations appear to have appropriate safeguards. They are not too widely drafted but the hurdle still remains, and in the unlikely event of disabled groups becoming aggrieved with any further orders, your Lordships still have a well-equipped parliamentary toolbox&#151;and some of the tools are still quite sharp.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000016"></a>Fortunately, no person has found it necessary to brief me about these regulations and consequently I am happy to support them.</p>

<p><a name="08102950000017"></a><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08102950000051"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I, too, support the regulations. Perhaps, unlike the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, I feel that they are very tightly drawn already, so it is inevitable that there will be continuous requests for exemption.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000018"></a>In addressing the issue of access for the disabled, we should first be concerned that disabled people travelling at present meet a lot of obstacles when using the railway. Even when travelling between well-staffed stations, messages about the means of getting on or off trains are often not transmitted by train operating companies or their staff, and disabled people find themselves marooned on trains. No matter what devices we have to tell them that they should get off the train, unless a ramp that enables them to do so is made available to them, the information that is displayed on the train is probably of little use.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000019"></a>I turn to the issue of the large number of obsolete vehicles now running on our railway. Some of them are not only unsuitable just for disabled people, they are unsuitable for anyone. I look forward to the Minister being able to tell us when we are going to get new vehicles to replace our dreadful old ones. I was talking to someone today who had made the journey from Gloucester to Swindon in a Class 143 train that he described as &#147;deplorable&#148;. He also explained to me how difficult it is to maintain such stock.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000020"></a>My last point, which is covered not by these regulations but by very similar ones, concerns the design of stations. When a disabled person gets off a train, there is often a footbridge which can be difficult, or there is a tunnel. I was in Switzerland this year, where it is common  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>practice for people, whether they are disabled, with pushchairs or just ordinary people, to walk across the track. There are lights to tell them that it is safe to do so, and it is a common practice. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that the huge footbridges that have appeared in, for example, Moreton-in-Marsh and Llandrindod Wells are extremely expensive and probably militate against their provision at all. They may also explain the resentment that the people who have to provide them feel about the system.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000021"></a>The Minister should look again at the prospect of substantially simplifying the footbridge arrangements so that people can cross the track as they used to, except on very high speed lines. They could be protected easily by signalling, which is simple. It is not complicated stuff: when the light does not show, you do not cross, so if the light fails you do not cross. We want something much simpler.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000022"></a>Lastly, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that I recently had a case of someone trying to open a railway line, but the cost of providing disabled facilities to the standards specified was so high that it was decided not to build the intermediate stations between the starting and finishing points. Therefore, not only do the disabled not get access to the railway, neither does anyone else. That seems to be a rather perverse decision. The department needs to look very closely at the present arrangements for accessibility at stations, so that people may enjoy the vehicles for which the regulations are designed, which I support.</p>

<p><a name="08102950000023"></a><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08102950000052"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> The noble Lord referred to my speech and quoted me as saying &#147;they are not too widely drafted&#148;. Does he accept that I was referring to  the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Exemption Orders (Parliamentary Procedures) Regulations rather than the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (London Underground Victoria Line 09TS Vehicles) Exemption Order?</p>

I much look forward to working with him over the coming months, as I do to working with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. I have already had the pleasure of responding to one of his debates. Hardly a day passes without my signing off many Written Answers to him, which are immensely informative to me and to knowing what is going on in the industry that he has spent so much of his working life engaged with.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000026"></a>I shall deal with the general opening remark made by noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, about the quality of the rail fleet and its accessibility to people with disabilities. Of course, I entirely share his objective, which is that we should see as much of the fleet as possible made available and open to disabled people as soon as possible. We entirely share that objective and I am sure that the noble Earl is also in agreement with that objective. We have led the way among our European partners by introducing regulations requiring all new rail vehicles, buses and coaches to be accessible to disabled people. There are already around 4,700 accessible  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rail vehicles in service, which have been introduced since the RVAR came into force in 1998. That is already more than one-third of the fleet.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000027"></a>We have set an end date of 1 January 2020, by which time all rail vehicles must be accessible. Many thousands of older rail vehicles have already been made more accessible through the process of refurbishment. While I accept that there is more to do, we have a good track record so far. As the noble Lord knows, we have the procurement process for the 1,300 new rail vehicles to be made available over the next six years, which will also significantly boost the accessibility of the railway to disabled people.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000028"></a>I shall simply have to note the remarks about footbridges. He was talking about the overground, which would not help in terms of the order about the Victoria line. Underground accessibility is often linked to lift access and to the ability to access platforms directly from ground level by means of lifts. A comprehensive programme of work is taking place on the Victoria line over the next five years to see that there is universal access to platforms from street level. At the moment on the Victoria line, Brixton and Tottenham Hale have lift access from street level directly down to the platforms. King&#146;s Cross/St Pancras will have lift access from the end of 2009; Stockwell and Vauxhall from the end of 2011; Finsbury Park, Green Park and Highbury and Islington from the end of 2012 and Blackhorse Road, Euston, Oxford Circus, Seven Sisters, Victoria, Walthamstow Central and Warren Street from the end of 2013. That is a very expensive process of refurbishment of stations so that they can be fully accessible to disabled people. The work will be welcomed by those noble Lords here and more widely.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000029"></a>The noble Lord mentioned access to platforms on the overground. As he will be only too well aware, the safety authorities have to strike a balance between accessibility and safety. I understand that Her Majesty&#146;s Railway Inspectorate is discussing with Network Rail and Passenger Focus whether we can make any changes, along the lines that he suggested, to increase accessibility for disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="08102950000030"></a><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08102950000055"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I hope that these deliberations will take account of the fact that Swiss railways have an enviable safety record and that there is very little evidence that the practice to which I drew the Minister&#146;s attention has led to casualties. I therefore hope that his officials and those from Her Majesty&#146;s Railway Inspectorate, or whoever will do this, will apprise themselves of the practice of good railways to assure themselves that what I propose is safe.</p>

<p><a name="08102950000031"></a><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="81029-gc0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08102950000056"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I will draw the noble Lord&#146;s remarks to the attention of those who are involved in these discussions.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000039"></a>The noble Lord said: The Government have been working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation to tighten noise standards with which new aircraft must comply. The latest standard, called the chapter 4 noise standard, became a legal standard on 1 January 2006 and will mean that new aircraft have to meet stricter noise standards than before.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000040"></a>Work is also under way to tighten emissions standards. Aircraft engines must meet ICAO emissions standards covering smoke, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. The oxides of nitrogen standard was recently tightened by 15 per cent from 1 January 2008 for new engine designs. The UK continues to press for further tightening to be agreed by the ICAO in 2010. Although principally targeted at reducing oxides of nitrogen emissions in the vicinity of airports, such measures will also have beneficial effects on climate change.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000041"></a>Until March 2007, the noise and emissions certification of all aircraft was undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority. The European Aviation Safety Agency&#151;the EASA&#151;was then established, and it took on responsibility for the first type of aircraft, jets and large aircraft. These are called EASA aircraft. For simplicity, we call the second category of aircraft non-EASA aircraft. These include microlight aeroplanes and aircraft in the service of customs and the police, and they continue to be regulated by the CAA.</p>

<a name="81029-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08102950000042"></a>The order sets out the noise and emissions standards with which these non-EASA aircraft must comply. Beyond that, there are no new requirements, and no new impacts or costs. This is, in essence, a tidying-up order. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08102936000009"></a><a name="81029-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81029-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08102936000064"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08102936000010"></a>I wish to announce the publication today of the Government response to the independent inquiry into the national recognition of the Armed Forces carried out by my honourable friend the Member for Grantham. My honourable friend was invited by the Government last December to examine ways of improving the nation&#146;s understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces and his report was published on 19 May.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08102936000011"></a>As I said when it was published, the Government warmly welcome this report, which is comprehensive in its coverage and based on extensive consultation.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08102936000012"></a>The Government are acutely aware of the debt owed to our Armed Forces. Our gratitude for the work they do in the service of our country is reflected in a raft of recent initiatives with the service personnel Command Paper the central plank. This unprecedented piece of work set out to achieve two things: first, to end any disadvantage associated with service life and, secondly, to apply, where appropriate, special treatment, particularly for those injured in the course of their service. Complementing this, it is also vital for our serving men and women, especially those engaged in difficult and dangerous overseas campaigns, to know that the whole of Britain understands and appreciates the work that they do in our name. That is why the Prime Minister set up the national recognition inquiry.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08102936000013"></a>The report made many recommendations, the majority of which have been accepted. We have been considering how we might implement them and I am pleased to announce that the Government have already taken action to bring a number of measures into effect, including on the wider wearing of uniforms in public, a more systematic approach to homecoming parades and new rules on dealing with Members of Parliament. However, we are also conscious of the need to avoid placing additional burdens on our hard-pressed Armed Forces, especially given the present level of commitment to operations, which must remain our top priority. Nevertheless, we welcome the study&#146;s objective to create more opportunities for contact between the Armed Forces and the society they serve and for the public to be able to express their support. Where we have not fully accepted recommendations, we are confident in most cases that we can give meaning to the intent behind the recommendation. Our detailed response to each of the recommendations is set out in the response that we are publishing today.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08102936000014"></a>Copies of the response to the report are being placed in the Library of the House and will also be available from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_head1"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08102936000003"></a>Armed Forces: Protected Mobility</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08102936000015"></a><a name="81029-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="81029-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08102936000065"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08102936000016"></a>The provision of protected vehicles to our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan has attracted considerable interest amongst honourable Members and the British public.  I therefore felt it would be helpful to set out, following the Prime Minister&#146;s announcements and within the constraints of operational security, the current position on protected mobility, and our future intentions.  This Statement will touch on both Operations TELIC and HERRICK, but will mostly focus on Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08102936000017"></a>We have already achieved a great deal in improving the protected mobility options available to commanders on operations. Mastiff is unquestionably a success story. For its role, Mastiff is delivering the very highest levels of protection available anywhere in the world. Where it can be used, and its size and weight mean that it has its limitations, it is clearly the vehicle of choice. That is why the Prime Minister announced a further order of these vehicles last year.  The deliveries of Mastiff tranche two, which will begin in a month&#146;s time, will bring the Mastiff fleet we have available to support operations to over 280.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08102936000018"></a>It is not only through Mastiff that we are delivering a world-class protected-vehicle capability; we are also delivering Ridgback. Using the smaller Cougar 4x4 chassis, and innovative, cutting-edge UK armour technologies, we will be able to deliver protection levels close to that of Mastiff in a package that is able to better access urban areas, increasing the survivability of troops in these roles. We have also recently procured 30 base Cougar vehicles, a mixture of 4x4 and 6x6, to augment our training fleet. By taking this action, we will ensure delivery of the right numbers of both vehicles into theatre as soon as is practicable.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08102936000019"></a>In recent months, the nature of threat against our troops on the ground in Afghanistan has evolved significantly. It is vital that we respond urgently to these new threats to ensure that we continue to provide the best possible protection to our people.  But delivering better protection for our troops is not just about heavy vehicles such as Mastiff and Ridgback.  In the hierarchy of force protection one should first seek not to be detected, if detected then seek not to be hit, and if hit not to be destroyed. On the more predictable and vulnerable operations we focus, rightly, on the latter part of that hierarchy, however for many of our roles we need to take a different approach, balancing the requirements of protection and agility.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08102936000020"></a>Viking, Land Rover WMIK (weapon mount installation kit) and Jackal are all agile vehicles with high levels of off-road mobility which enable us to get off tracks and trails and to be unpredictable. The Land Rover WMIK and Jackal both allow us to operate in open desert and mountainous terrain, taking the fight to the enemy away from ground of their choosing.  Jackal in particular is proving a significant success, delivering excellent protection, mobility, range  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS91"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column WS91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and firepower.  It is for this reason that we are procuring over 100 additional Jackal, costing around &#163;75 million, to augment our current fleet, bringing the total to over 300.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08102936000021"></a>Viking has provided an excellent capability in Afghanistan, giving us unparalleled access to areas around the Helmand River. But, although we are providing some further enhancements to its protection, we have reached the limit of its ability to carry extra weight and protection. This is why we intend to replace Viking in Afghanistan with an alternative, better protected, high-mobility vehicle, to be known as Warthog; work is under way to identify the right vehicle to fulfil this role. We will procure over 100 new vehicles with deliveries starting at the end of next year.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08102936000022"></a>We are also planning to modify Panther with a few theatre-specific alterations in order to field it to Afghanistan. Bought through the defence equipment programme as a command and liaison vehicle for the conventional battlefield, Panther offers excellent mobility and impressive levels of protection for its size. With a full communications capability, it will offer a capable addition to the options available in certain roles.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08102936000023"></a>Inevitably any statement on protected mobility must address the role of Snatch Land Rover, a vehicle which has received considerable criticism. First, to be absolutely clear, I can inform the House that&#151;in addition to the regular reviews that are conducted into protected mobility&#151;senior operational commanders were asked to specifically consider the requirement for Snatch Land Rover and its importance to operations. The response was clear: commanders need a vehicle of the size, weight and profile of Snatch Land Rover, capable of transporting men, to fulfil their tasks in theatre. Further, the availability of such a vehicle is considered mission critical.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08102936000024"></a>This does not mean that no action can be taken on Snatch. We have set in train a programme to apply the lessons we have learned from the development of Mastiff and Ridgback to Snatch. We have modified Snatch&#146;s running gear, chassis, engine, and other automotive components to give the vehicle more power and the ability to carry a greater load. The extra power and payload allow us to carry out a series of modifications, details of which honourable Members will understand I am unable to share, to enhance its mobility and protection. This effectively generates a new variant, especially configured for Afghanistan, the Snatch Vixen. We have already fielded a small number of these vehicles, and we will be substantially increasing the size of the fleet over the coming year.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08102936000025"></a>We cannot make Snatch invulnerable; any vehicle can be overmatched if faced with an overwhelming attack. But these modifications mean that Snatch Vixen will offer the highest levels of protection for its size and weight class.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08102936000026"></a>The need to protect our people to the highest possible standards does not stop with the patrol and fighting vehicles. We need to look closely at the vehicles which are providing the integral logistic and engineering support in this hostile environment. We have already announced the fielding of the newly procured support vehicle (SV) to Afghanistan and Iraq replacing our existing fleet of 4, 8 and 14-tonne cargo vehicles with a  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS92"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column WS92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>modern and better-protected logistic vehicle. We have also used a number of SV chassis to develop a new enhanced palletised load system (EPLS) which is replacing the deployed DROPS capability.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08102936000027"></a>But we believe there is still more we can do.  In Afghanistan we have a number of units who are sometimes required to operate outside the wire who are equipped with light utility &#145;B&#146; Vehicles such as the Pinzgauer 4x4 and the General Service Land Rover. In the context of the evolving threat, we have therefore decided to procure over 400new light, medium and heavy protected utility vehicles, to be known respectively as Coyote, Husky and Wolfhound. The tactical support vehicles (TSV), delivering from June 2009, will ensure that all our troops are operating in an appropriately protected vehicle.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08102936000028"></a>Training plays a crucial part in the success of our troops in theatre. The protected mobility package includes sufficient numbers of each of the vehicles to ensure that all troops are fully trained; vehicles will not be deployed to theatre until the appropriate levels of training have been conducted.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08102936000029"></a>Funding of &#163;500 million has been allocated from the reserve towards this protected mobility package, which is expected to cost over &#163;600 million in total. Defence will fund a part of the package in acknowledgement of the longer-term benefit to core defence capability these vehicles offer beyond our current commitments.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08102936000030"></a>Vehicles, of course, are only part of the answer; honourable Members are well aware of the crucial role played by tactics, techniques and procedures in protecting our troops from harm. Equally, our world-leading electronic countermeasures provide an extra, crucial, layer of force protection. We will also investigate new ways of approaching force protection where we can; this is why we are working on the development of a route proving and clearing capability, known as TALISMAN. This capability, which has been allocated &#163;96 million from the reserve, and uses specialist vehicles such as the Buffalo mine-protected vehicle, aims to deliver a system which allows us to mitigate the risks faced by our forces in a proactive way by applying technology to the challenge of transiting routes and dealing with high-risk areas.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08102936000031"></a>We owe a great debt to the men and women of the Armed Forces who operate in hostile environments, risking their lives to secure the freedom that has been hard won for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan and to ensure that international terrorism, which threatens us all, far beyond those two countries, is not allowed to take hold. It is beholden on us to ensure that they receive the very best support and the very best equipment for the roles they are undertaking.  In this Statement today, I have outlined a road map which will deliver nearly 700 new vehicles at a cost of over &#163;700 million, and enable us to remove some 400 lesser protected vehicles from operations. I firmly believe that this plan, once implemented, will give our Armed Forces the protection and mobility they need and deserve to do their jobs as safely and effectively as modern technology can provide.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08102936000032"></a><a name="81029-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="81029-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="08102936000066"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Lord Drayson):</b> Today my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham) has made the following Written Statement.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08102936000033"></a>This Government believe that everyone with the talent and ambition to enter higher education should be able to benefit from the opportunity. Investment by this Government means that by the end of this Comprehensive Spending Review period in 2010-11, government funding will have risen by nearly 30 per cent in real terms since 1997. There are 287,000 more higher education students than in 1997 and the unit of funding has been maintained in real terms. We have also succeeded in raising aspirations&#151;over 50 per cent of young people from every social background and every part of the country aspire to go to university.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08102936000034"></a>Finance should not present a practical barrier to students wishing to study at university. In 2006, the Government introduced a new system of student financial support which offered a maximum grant of &#163;2,700 and a minimum bursary of &#163;300 annually for students from low income households. In July 2007 I announced that, from 2008-09, this scheme would be significantly enhanced by raising the family income thresholds for both full and partial grants. At the time, I told the House that our intention was for one-third of students to receive a full grant and a further third a partial grant. The new system came into effect this academic year.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08102936000035"></a>It is now expected that about 40 per cent of students may receive the full grant. The total number of students receiving a full or partial grant will also exceed the original projections. I have decided to make extra money available in response to this higher demand for student support so that total spending on the student financial support system will rise above the levels set out in July 2007. Spending will increase by a further &#163;100 million per annum when the revised system reaches steady state. </p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08102936000036"></a>For students coming into university in 2009-10 student support&#151;like the child tax credit&#151;will focus help on families earning up to &#163;50,000 who are doing the right thing by supporting their children to go to university:</p>
the family income threshold for the full grant will remain at the enhanced level of &#163;25,000, which we expect will provide around 40 per cent of students with a full grant, exceeding the intention announced last July for one-third of students to receive a full grant;the family income threshold for a partial grant will be &#163;50,020, which means that all students with household incomes of &#163;18,360 to &#163;50,020 will be eligible for higher levels of grant than in 2007-08;all students with a household income of &#163;18,360 to &#163;57,708 will be eligible for a more generous package of grant and loan support than in 2007-08; andconsequently, we are maintaining the intention that two-thirds of students should receive either a full or a partial grant.  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS94"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column WS94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08102936000037"></a>The new student support arrangements will be applicable only to new students entering higher education in 2009-10. Existing students will receive the same support as they were entitled to receive when they started university.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08102936000038"></a>I propose to lay before Parliament amending regulations to adjust the eligibility for student grants and loans. Following approval by Parliament, they will take some weeks to implement. I have therefore asked the Student Loans Company to begin processing applications for student support in the New Year.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08102936000039"></a>The full annual impact of these changes will reduce the cost pressure by &#163;100 million. For the rest of this spending review period it will be necessary to make incremental adjustments to the DIUS budget, which totals over &#163;20 billion. My department is well on the way to identifying &#163;1.5 billion of cash-releasing efficiency savings over the period, and further reductions will be sought. I also plan to deploy some of the departmental unallocated provision.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08102936000040"></a>In making changes, we will:</p>
maintain the ring-fenced science budget; maintain the unit of funding for students in higher education;continue to increase HE student numbers annually towards our participation target; andcontinue to increase investment in further education and skills, including expansion of the Train to Gain programme. 
<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08102936000041"></a>I am today asking HEFCE to allocate no more than 10,000 additional student numbers for 2009-10. This means that, in 2009-10, there will be 30,000 more funded students (full-time equivalent) compared to 2007-08.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08102936000042"></a>Details of other budget changes will be made available at the appropriate time in the usual manner.</p>

<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS95"></a><b>29 Oct 2008 : Column WS95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08102936000047"></a>A new round of talks on Tibet between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama is likely to take place shortly. These talks are hugely important for the future of Tibet. They provide the only forum in which there is any realistic possibility of progress to resolve the differences between the parties involved.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08102936000048"></a>The Chinese Government have said that they are serious about dialogue and that they hope for a positive outcome. They have set conditions for dialogue which we believe the Dalai Lama has met. The Dalai Lama has made clear that he is not seeking separation or independence. He has said repeatedly that he is seeking a resolution to the situation of Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution, a point he made explicitly in an interview with the <I>Financial Times</I> on 24 May during his visit to the United Kingdom. He said he was &#147;not seeking separation, not seeking independence, but within the framework of the Chinese Constitution, meaningful realistic autonomy [for Tibetans]&#148;. He has maintained a clear opposition to violence.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08102936000049"></a>The British Government have a strong interest in the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama&#146;s representatives, although we are not a party to it. No Government who are committed to promoting international respect for human rights can remain silent on the issue of Tibet, or disinterested in a solution to its problems.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08102936000050"></a>Britain has been clear under this Government about our commitment to the people of Tibet. We remain deeply concerned about the human rights situation there. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister set out our concerns to Premier Wen during discussions in the spring and again when they met in Beijing during the Olympic Games. I have made the same point to Foreign Minister Yang on a number of occasions since the unrest in March this year in Tibet. We have consistently made clear that we want to see the human rights of the Tibetan people respected, including through respect for their distinct culture, language, traditions and religions. Our interest is not in restoring an order which existed 60 years ago and which the Dalai Lama himself has said he does not seek to restore.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08102936000051"></a>We are also concerned at more immediate issues arising directly from the unrest of this spring, including the situation of those who remain in detention following the unrest, the increased constraints on religious activity, and the limitations on free access to the Tibetan Autonomous Region by diplomats and journalists. These issues reinforce long-held unease on the part of the Government about the underlying human rights situation in Tibet.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08102936000052"></a>Other countries have made similar points. But our position is unusual for one reason of history that has been imported into the present: the anachronism of our formal position on whether Tibet is part of China, and whether in fact we harbour continued designs to see the break-up of China. We do not.</p>

Some have used this to cast doubt on the aims we are pursuing and to claim that we are denying Chinese sovereignty over a large part of its own territory. We have made clear to the Chinese Government, and publicly, that we do not support Tibetan independence. Like every other EU member state, and the United States, we regard Tibet as part of the People&#146;s Republic of China. Our interest is in long-term stability, which can only be achieved through respect for human rights and greater autonomy for the Tibetans.</p>

<a name="81029-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08102936000054"></a>We have noted recent comments by the Dalai Lama regretting the lack of progress in the dialogue so far. We are also aware of indications of growing frustration among some Tibetans about the dialogue process. We consider the position the Dalai Lama has stated publicly, including when he visited Britain this year, that he opposes violence and is seeking meaningful autonomy within the framework of the Chinese constitution, provides a basis for a negotiated settlement. Our strong view is that genuine progress at the next round of talks is essential to promote progress on such a settlement. Participation in these talks carries a weight of responsibility for both parties.</p>

The appropriate method is adopted to suit the needs of the particular business.

Many of the secure links between government departments use traditional cryptography which does not use certificates.</p>

Depending on the exact specification, smart meters could help facilitate the introduction of a wider range of tariffs by energy suppliers. However, if there is a positive decision to mandate smart metering for domestic customers, it will be for energy suppliers to take commercial decisions on the introduction of new tariffs for their customers.</p>

It provides a financial and legal basis for Galileo, which will offer better availability and accuracy than the current generation of GPS. The regulation also provides for the operation of EGNOS, which is designed to enhance and assure the accuracy of GPS signals. It is expected that all users of satellite navigation devices, including drivers of heavy goods vehicles, will see significant benefit from the programmes once complete. However, the availability of specialist software for HGV routing is key and will be a matter for the commercial market to deliver.</p>
