<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the largest amount of illegal meat seized in the United Kingdom at any one time in the year 2003; and what prosecutions followed.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  My Lords, according to the Food Standards Agency, the largest amount of illegal meat seized in the United Kingdom at any one time in 2003 was 33 tonnes, seized in June from premises in Bow, east London, by enforcement officers from the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The case is currently under investigation and prosecutions have yet to be initiated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his Answer. I am very disappointed to hear about the number of prosecutions pending. Is he aware of the bushmeat conference in December where African Ministers stated that illegal meat is being smuggled into this country partly because people are not frightened of being convicted if caught in the UK? Bearing in mind that the market value of bushmeat is currently £36 per pound, the typical suitcase coming into UK ports and airports could contain far in excess of £1,000 of bushmeat, if not much more. The situation is not dissimilar to that of illegal, black market drug imports. What is the real reason why there have been no convictions? Is it that Defra lacks funds; or is it that, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, said, Defra is a dog's dinner of the highest order?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, there were several threads in that essay-cum-question. On one of them, I can tell the noble Lord that there were no outbreaks of human disease in the UK traced to the illegal importation of bushmeat. The Food Standards Agency has created an imported food division to take forward the Government's Step Change initiative which aims to deliver significant improvements in the co-ordination and delivery of local authority inspection of imported food at ports and inland.
<P>

<a name="40204-01_para0"></a>I did not say that there have been no prosecutions; I said that a prosecution had not been initiated in the particular case. The noble Lord might like to know that it took two years to gather and analyse the information in Operation Aberdeen, in 2001, which <P>


<a name="column_672"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 672</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerned a large-scale meat fraud. However, that operation secured major convictions of those prosecuted in the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew2"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord appreciates that many of us are worried not about human disease but about animal disease being brought in by these illegal meat imports. Is the Food Standards Agency working closely with Defra in these matters? Are Defra scientists able to advise the Food Standards Agency about the dangers of importing such meat?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that my noble colleagues and other Ministers in Defra will be glad to look into the question raised by the noble Countess and respond to her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister indicate how many illegal meat seizures have taken place in regional airports and ports and how many prosecutions have taken place as a result? I acknowledge that there are notices in these places now, but they are pretty sparse. Is there any information on this?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, it is not the practice of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise to reveal the details of seizures, and no information on local authority enforcement action is held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I find that answer very unsatisfactory. Is the Minister not concerned not only about the risk to human health, which has been mentioned, but about the risk of animal diseases? If prosecutions are not brought, the import of such meat will continue. I am quite concerned about the Minister's response. I do not think that he appreciates the huge implications of the problem, including increased zoonosis. His department seems not to be taking an interest. I seek greater clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that the noble Baroness listened to my earlier answers. I did not say that there have been no prosecutions. I simply said that a prosecution had not yet been initiated in the case that was the subject of the noble Lord's Question. I also gave the example of the case in 2001 where there was a prosecution regarding 4,450 tonnes of illegal meat and a fraud. In answering the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, I also said that it is not the practice of Customs and Excise to reveal the amounts seized. I did not say that it had not brought any prosecutions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, further to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, will the Minister confirm that the figures that he gave include seizures at airports in Northern Ireland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, my answers related to information about England.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the most recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease was caused by illegally imported meat?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, that is a matter for my colleagues in Defra, but I will look into it&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew13"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, may I be allowed to finish my answer? I will look into that and reply to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell those of us who do not know exactly what bushmeat is?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am not altogether sure that noble Lords will thank the noble Baroness for that question, as bushmeat may include the meat of squirrels, monkeys, bats, rats and other mammals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister bring us up to date on the movement in the European Union or the European Parliament to ban the importation of bushmeat into the European Union? I understand that there has been a major move among environmentalists to do that, mainly due to denuding Africa of its wild game rather than the health issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware that specific proposals have emanated from the European Union on the issue, although I know that much debate is going on about it in which the Food Standards Agency is involved. I do not think that any specific proposals have been forthcoming.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that, since April 2003, there has been a threefold increase in illegal meats? The figure may be somewhere in excess of 7,000 tonnes. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I do not have that specific number in my head. As I said earlier, we do not collect information centrally on local authority seizures of illegal meat, so I am not sure from where the noble Lord obtains his figures. He seems to have information that is not available to Her Majesty's Government.

<a name="column_674"></a>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, the Government made it clear in the consultation paper, Next Steps for the House of Lords, that they had no immediate plans to change the role and powers of this House relative to the House of Commons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will recall how a majority of Members of this House drove Clauses 41 and 42 in the then Criminal Justice Bill&#151;they were on jury trials&#151;into the long grass, but the same Members tell us that they support the primacy of the House of Commons. Does he believe that the use of affirmative instruments voted on in both Houses under a twin-lock procedure is compatible with the primacy of the House of Commons?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, it is no secret that the Government were not best pleased to experience 16 defeats on the then Criminal Justice Bill, including on the removal of jury trial for complex cases, a measure that we felt was essential to the proper pursuit of criminal matters. Having said that, one is aware that the House has a responsibility to scrutinise legislation. The issue is all on the detail of how far and how regularly the challenging and questioning in amendments is pressed by this House to the other end. Therefore, I stand by the position in the White Paper, which is that the broad balance of powers is right but, as ever, there will be disagreements, particularly towards the end of the Session, on whether those powers should be taken right to the limit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-01_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that membership of this House nowadays represents a balance of political opinion in this country rather more accurately than membership of the House of Commons, where the Government have 63 per cent of the Members on the basis of 42 per cent of the vote? In those circumstances, is it not right that this House should continue to have powers that enable us to negotiate modest changes to government legislation?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Well, my Lords, what an ingenious argument. One should look at the comparative influence of&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;the third party in a tri-party or quadrilateral balance of power and the strength of the Liberal Democrats, in terms of many of their amendments. One could make an argument, quite richly, that on that basis the Liberal Democrats are over-represented in this House.

<P>
<P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Carter!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, in the most recent Parliament, there were 1,650 Divisions in the House of Commons and the Government did not lose one. <P>


<a name="column_675"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 675</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There were 650 Divisions in this House, and the Government lost 25 per cent. I take no pride in that statistic but, if it is a question of which House is holding the executive to account, I think that this House is doing a good job.
<P>

<a name="40204-02_para0"></a>Will my noble friend agree that in this House, in which the government party is the third-largest party and has less than 28 per cent of the vote, there is a heavy responsibility on it to remember two fundamental conventions; namely, that the elected government are entitled to secure their programme of legislation and that, after suitable negotiation, the elected Chamber should finally have its way? The negotiations on the then Criminal Justice Bill could never be described as suitable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I could not agree more with my noble friend, a former Chief Whip. That is very much our perspective on the issues. He reminds us that the Government have 28 per cent of the vote in this House. He could also remind us that, in the proposals that we have set out to remove the remaining hereditary Peers, our vote will increase to 31 per cent. Therefore we are enshrining in those proposals that this party in government will never have an overall majority, and nor will any party in government in future. I hope that the House will commend that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord and congratulate him on having asserted the constitutional position of this House with total objectivity and on having concentrated on the essence of the problem, which is how, when and how often we exercise our power.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am always grateful to receive compliments from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, but I wish he would make them to me in private to protect my reputation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, I ask my noble friend to follow the injunction of the noble Lord from the Liberal Democrat Benches and encourage the powers that be to change the balance rapidly so that it reflects the results at general elections more fairly? When can we expect that augmentation of forces and when can we expect the Light Brigade to come to the assistance of the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord reads the newspapers, as I do. Over the turn of the year they were quite rich in rumours in that respect. However, that is only one part of the issue. The more fundamental part is how we intend to move forward to the second stage of reform of this House and to the subsequent stages of reform that will also be required. Before long we shall look forward to sharing those views with the House, as we are still absolutely committed to our 2001 manifesto. I shall repeat that if there is any doubt about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there are perfectly respectable bases for supporting the <P>


<a name="column_676"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 676</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decision to continue jury trials in long fraud cases? The first is the very high percentage&#151;80 per cent&#151;of success achieved at present, which I believe is higher than for any other category of case; and the second is that the Law Commission was specifically asked by the Home Secretary to report on whether there are any means of improving the understanding of the law by members of the jury. The Law Commission reported and produced certain recommendations, none of which the Government have ever put forward as being satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am unsure whether I detected a question, but I note the comment with the appropriate interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   My Lords, given that the Minister reads the newspapers, as do most noble Lords, can I tempt him to comment on the views expressed in an interview with Mr Peter Hain in the Times last Friday?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, if I recollect, my right honourable friend was signalling the importance of making further progress on House of Lords reform, not merely on the very substantial package of proposals that we have already set out, but he was clearly looking at how to go further than that, as that will not be the end of the process or the story.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew14"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that the largest single group of electors is those who cannot bring themselves to support any single political party? On that basis, does he also accept that the largest group in this House should be the independent Peers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, if one were wearing a hat one would shake it at such creativity. I am not sure that the largest proportion of electors support no party. I believe that in general elections a majority of the electorate vote for one of the main political parties. I refute his assertion.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, in the United Kingdom human medicines are regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, in accordance with national and EU laws. The EU legislation has recently been changed to ensure that the system continues to protect public health in an enlarged Community and the Government are working on implementation. A value-for-money audit of the MHRA was conducted recently by the National <P>


<a name="column_677"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 677</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Audit Office and a Public Accounts Committee report on the agency was published in 2003. There are no plans for further wide-ranging reviews.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that very disappointing reply. Only yesterday it was discovered that the MHRA had not had full information about Seroxat from the drug company involved. There are great concerns about past delays preventing SSRIs being available for the treatment of children. There are also grave doubts about the yellow card scheme and about many other aspects concerned with the regulation of claims made about drugs, particularly in relation to Yasmin, the birth control pill, which the Minister may remember. That gives considerable grounds for an independent review. Will the Minister reconsider that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   No, my Lords. An expert working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines has undertaken a comprehensive independent scientific assessment of the available data on the safety of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, which includes Seroxat. The full conclusions of that risk analysis, coming from the clinical trials in December, were published in public. The MHRA, in dealing with particular issues, has taken an open and above-board approach. The yellow card scheme, also mentioned by the noble Lord, is recognised as one of the best in the world, although to improve it I have asked for a review to be carried out to see whether there can be improved involvement of patients directly with the agency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the MHRA has an unrivalled reputation in the world as a robust regulator? Should we not be very cautious before starting to review legislation that might undermine that reputation which has brought so much credit to this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks. From his own experience he knows how effective the MHRA is and what its standard is in Europe and across the world. The National Audit Office review recognised the international standing of the MHRA in a number of areas, particularly in the way in which it leads the field on the science of medicine safety.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, we have estimated some of those impacts. We have communicated with the research community about them and we are in discussion, as I believe the noble Earl knows, with the research community on the implications of the Clinical Trials Directive for this country. That directive will <P>

<A NAME="40204-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the Minister lauds the National Audit Office report, but does he recall that that the National Audit Office also drew attention to the conflict of interest between the MHRA's role in promoting the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and in protecting the health of the public?

<A NAME="40204-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, the Newton committee recently published its report reviewing the whole Act. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, will shortly publish his second review of the working of Part 4 of the Act. Those reports will inform the debates that will shortly take place in both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. In a civilised society, no one condones terrorism of any kind. Britain already has the most draconian terrorist powers in western Europe. Does the Minister agree that to add further to that by undermining the principle of trial by jury and radically lowering the burden of proof is wholly unacceptable? There is already an inquiry into the quality of our intelligence services. Would not the Home Secretary's latest proposals do a great deal of harm and undermine British justice without making our country any safer? How can we condemn the treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay when our own action leaves much to be desired?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge the noble Lord's concern and make clear that the comments of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary were about stimulating a debate. There is no proposed change or plan for change at present; but there is the beginning of a debate. My right honourable friend said that he will publish an options paper, setting out the options for that debate. Nothing has been ruled in; and nothing has been ruled out.

<FONT SIZE=3>protection of the values and systems that make our society worth living in, and that central to those are our traditions in the administration of justice? Does she therefore agree that any special measures that are introduced to meet the danger of terrorism must be as small as possible and last for the most limited period possible? Does she further agree that if we do not follow that course, we shall play directly into the hands of extremists, who will exploit the apparent contradictions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I absolutely agree with my noble friend that the tradition of this country is beyond compare in our adherence to human rights and the rights of the individual. I also agree with him that it is therefore absolutely proper for any step that we take to make ourselves more secure to be proportionate and fair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, following on from the question of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, does the Minister agree that conviction for a criminal offence on the balance of probabilities is without precedent in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount is quite right: at present the standard of proof for a criminal offence is that it be proved beyond reasonable doubt. I must acknowledge that the circumstances of international terrorism and terrorism in this country call for a debate, but I endorse what the noble Viscount said.

<A NAME="40204-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister acknowledge that there is no purpose in having a debate unless the Government have proposals? Is she seriously telling the House that the Government propose that the standard of proof for achieving a finding of guilt in the criminal courts is to be lower for terrorist offences than for any other type of offence? That is an extraordinary situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am not saying that that is necessarily what will happen. I am saying that my right honourable friend has said that he intends to publish an options paper so that there can be a discussion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that Part 12 of the Act, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign officials, is especially important? Can she give an undertaking that the legislative certainty of that provision will be maintained?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree with my noble friend that Part 12 is an important part of current legislation. Of course, I cannot pre-empt what Parliament will do when it considers the matter, but I can say that it appears that Part 12 serves us well.

That might at least mean that the 14 people of whom we all know who are currently detained receive a trial&#151;rather than no trial at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, of course I hear what the noble and learned Lord says about the matter and understand why he makes those comments. I am in the happy position of being unable to assist your Lordships with what will be in the options paper and what will not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I remind the noble Baroness of what her noble and learned friend the Attorney-General said only two weeks ago when talking about the standard of proof. He stressed that it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"remains for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the defendant . . .  As far as I am aware, that remains true in all respects and I regard it as a very important part of our justice system".&#151;[Official Report, 20/1/04; col. 912.]

<a name="40204-03_para0"></a>
Will the Attorney-General be consulted by her right honourable friend the Home Secretary on the matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I agree wholeheartedly with the exposition of the law as enunciated by my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General. In all things, his advice is always most welcome; I assure the House that he gives it freely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, as a member of the committee, I thank my noble friend for what she has done to ensure that we have proper time to debate the committee's report in the House. Does she agree that calibrating the right balance between the protection of the rights of individual suspects and of the community as a whole at risk from terrorism is a delicate and difficult business? If so, does she accept that the extremely broad-brush approach with which the current debate has been kicked off is unlikely to achieve the necessary delicacy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I wholeheartedly agree with my noble friend about the delicate balance of which she speaks. I am confident that when the House comes to debate the issues, it will bring to it the acuity and balance that they deserve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, the United Kingdom and other members of the Security Council will continue to press Ethiopia and Eritrea to accept the boundary commission decision and begin a political dialogue. We welcome the appointment of the United Nations special envoy, Lloyd Axworthy, and urge both parties to work with him on resolving their differences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer, which gives us a little more information about what is going on. Is she aware that there are powerful groups&#151;factions&#151;in Ethiopia that do not accept the Algiers agreement and, in fact, never really accepted the independence of Eritrea in 1991? Does she agree that it would strengthen the hand of those in Ethiopia who want peace if the Security Council were to insist on compliance with the Algiers agreement by the Ethiopian Government&#151;with the proviso that any sanctions that might be imposed should not affect food and humanitarian aid?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-03_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I accept that there are powerful groups that find it hard to accept the findings of the boundary commission. It is important to note that at present there is something of a stand-off between both sides, because, unfortunately, the Eritrean Government have not yet confirmed that they are willing to deal with Lloyd Axworthy. It is important that Mr Axworthy, as the UN special envoy, has the united support of the international community. I knew him when he was a Canadian Foreign Minister; he is an extremely impressive man and I hope that he will be able to bring both sides together.
<P>

<a name="40204-03_para2"></a>We will have an opportunity to take the matter forward. It was taken forward by my honourable friend Mr Mullin when he visited both Eritrea and Ethiopia earlier this month. I understand that the international development secretary, my right honourable friend Mr Benn, will also visit Ethiopia in February and will be able to press the points made by the noble Lord.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the reason why the Eritreans declined to accept a visit by Mr Lloyd Axworthy is that it is not they who are responsible for incursions into the temporary security zone; that it is not they who have failed to create the necessary conditions for demarcation to proceed; and that it is not they who have failed to co-operate fully and promptly with the boundary commission? In view of the Ethiopians' continued non-compliance with the Security Council resolution, does not she think that a threat to peace exists that should now be referred to the Security Council under chapter 6 of the charter?
<P>


<a name="column_682"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree with the noble Lord's conclusions. The United Nations appointed Lloyd Axworthy relatively recently and he ought to be given the opportunity to take forward the remits that he has. I have indicated that there are shortcomings on both sides, and the noble Lord has indicated very clearly the shortcomings on the Ethiopian side. It is important now that we use the forthcoming visit of the development secretary to press home the point, as we did with the visit of my honourable friend recently. I hope we will give this process a chance, under Mr Axworthy, who I believe to be a very good choice for the UN envoy role.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say what progress has been made in demarcating the frontier and whether this process also involved an element of arbitration in places where the frontier was in dispute? Furthermore, can she give us any good news about the return of prisoners and refugees by both sides which must surely help to build trust and confidence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I fear that the stand-off between the two countries at the moment does not allow me to give the good news that the noble Lord requests. I wish I could give him such news. I can only reiterate that this is a highly unsatisfactory situation. The Ethiopians have refused to accept the findings of the boundary commission. The United Nations has put in an envoy who we hope will be able to bring the two sides together, but the Eritreans are currently refusing to deal with him. The boundary commission found in favour of the Eritreans, as the noble Lord knows, but at the moment, the area particularly around Badame&#151;which is the area principally under dispute, and where there are about a thousand people living&#151;is in considerable difficulty.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para0"></a>I return to my main point&#151;that the envoy has to be given the opportunity to discuss the borders, the future of Badame and the important question that the noble Lord has raised in relation to prisoner exchange.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister agree that this dispute in the Badame region goes back a long way, certainly to the time of Mussolini and probably before that, and that there has been a long string of undertakings and agreements&#151;the US-Rwanda peace plan; UN Resolution 1226; as well as the Algiers agreement that we are talking about? Would she accept that it is going to take a lot to persuade the Ethiopians to come into line with the boundary commission, but that it is worth while persisting very hard, because last time the matter turned into violence with 100,000 lives being lost. We want no repeat of that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Yes, my Lords; I agree that it has been a dispute of very long-standing. Sadly, many disputes of long-standing duration become intractable over a period of time. It is obvious <P>


<a name="column_683"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 683</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that both sides view the Badame area as part of their own country. We have consistently stressed to the Ethiopians, at prime ministerial and ambassadorial level both in Addis Ababa and in New York, that we believe that the decision of the boundary commission is final and binding. However, it is now for the Ethiopian Prime Minister to persuade his government, his party, and his people that they must accept the boundary commission's findings. However, I am sure that he will face an uphill task in doing so, as my noble friend Lord Rea indicated in his supplementary question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, could I ask my noble friend to convey my congratulations to her honourable friend Chris Mullin on the excellent work that he has been doing in this troubled area? Perhaps I could use this short intervention to clear up any misunderstanding that I might have created with my first supplementary question. I do not include the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Mr Meles Zenawi, in any way with those who are trying to disrupt the agreement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for what he said about Mr Mullin. He is right. During Mr Mullin's visit, from 13 to 19 January, he was able to address these issues with both Eritrea and Ethiopia. He met President Issaias in Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles in Ethiopia. Her Majesty's Government have shared the regard that my noble friend has expressed about Prime Minister Meles. We are worried about many issues in Ethiopia, particularly in connection with human rights, but Prime Minister Meles shows some instincts for reform in his country; he is trying to bring forward the economic agenda and we support him in the way that he is dealing with NePAD.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew8"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My Lords, would it be wrong to presume that the Minister is familiar with the concept of horse-trading? I wonder whether the Ethiopian Government are taking up the position in the hope that they can gain some advantage, particularly from third parties who are interested to see peace in the area. Have the Government any idea what they might be looking for?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I used to be the general secretary of a trade union. Therefore, I do know a little about horse-trading, one way or another. I cannot read what the Ethiopian Government are looking for. Quite often, in these sorts of border disputes, individuals think that by not coming to an agreement they have more to gain as time goes on&#151;for example, as more and more Ethiopians come into the area in dispute, the idea is that their claims will be strengthened by people on the ground. That may be some of the thinking behind what has gone on, but that is speculation. We have to allow Mr Axworthy to bring both sides together. It will not be an easy task, but we must afford him the opportunity to try to fulfil the remit that he has been given by the United Nations.

As noble Lords know, we have a target finishing time of 10 p.m. We can meet that if speeches are limited to a maximum of eight minutes. I give the House a gentle reminder that when eight minutes displays on the Clock it means that the speaker is in the ninth minute. If we are to meet our target rising time of 10 p.m., it means just that: noble Lords should speak for eight, not nine, minutes. It is quite important that we aim to finish around our target time because tomorrow we start at 11 a.m. That gives us a particular reason for wanting to aim for that target, quite apart from the fact that many of us might also wish to finish at that time in any case.

<P>

<a name="40204-04_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to debate the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, into the tragic death of Dr David Kelly. I particularly welcome and look forward to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder of Wensum, who will obviously have a lot to contribute to the debate this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para3"></a>The report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, repays careful study. I intend to consider it in a little detail, both in relation to its conclusions and its findings. Also, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, asked me, in the Statement last week, to indicate what the Government's responses are to the criticisms made of them in the report. But it is right, as well, that I speak about the inquiry announced yesterday into the issue of intelligence, and the threat of weapons of mass destruction generally.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para4"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, agreed to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of Dr Kelly. The noble and learned Lord is a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. He was a serving Law Lord when he accepted the task. His appointment was greeted with widespread approval. His conduct of the inquiry has been regarded as exemplary because of the transparency of the process, and the clarity with which the evidence unfolded.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para5"></a>His report is an outstanding piece of analysis. There is a generalised complaint, however, that it criticised the media and was not balanced in its attacks on the Government.
<P>


<a name="column_685"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 685</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para6"></a>The robust prejudice with which the report has been approached is exemplified by comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Rees-Mogg, in a place other than this House. He is quoted as saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have not fully read his report but I have already come to the conclusion that his evidence does not support his conclusions and that is, put quite simply, a bad bit of work".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-04_para7"></a>
Put simply, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, deserved better than that.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para8"></a>Judges are not selected to produce a compromise; they are asked to analyse the evidence and reach findings of fact. That is what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has done with conspicuous skill as a trained professional and a judge. Look at his record; note the skill with which his handling of the hearing was praised; above all, read his report and see the meticulous care with which he analysed the evidence.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para9"></a>Set that record against the attacks in the media on his report. Today's Independent newspaper report claimed that Dr Jones was overruled about the inclusion of the 45-minute claim. In the evidence that Dr Jones gave to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, he accepted that it was right to insert the 45-minute claim; indeed, he said that it was important intelligence. But his concern related to whether the intelligence should be prefaced in the dossier by the words "intelligence suggests" rather than "we judge". It is a significant issue, but not the sort of complaint that justified the subsequent reports of it.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para10"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, focused on a number of issues. The main ones were: the accuracy of Mr Andrew Gilligan's broadcasts on 29 May; whether the dossier was sexed-up and the propriety of its production; and whether the Government engaged in an underhand or duplicitous strategy in relation to the naming of Dr Kelly.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para11"></a>Taking Mr Andrew Gilligan's broadcast first, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, concluded that the allegations reported by Mr Gilligan that the Government probably knew that the 45-minute claim was wrong or questionable were unfounded. Mr Gilligan himself accepted that he had made errors in his broadcasts in the "Today" programme on 29 May 2003.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para12"></a>Secondly, on the so-called sexing-up, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, concluded that the allegation was unfounded as it would have been understood by the people listening to it. The dossier, he found, had not been embellished with intelligence known or believed to be false or unreliable.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para13"></a>Finally, on the question of the release of Dr Kelly's name, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, reported that there was no dishonourable, underhand or duplicitous strategy by the Government covertly to leak Dr Kelly's name to the media.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para14"></a>However, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, found that the Ministry of Defence was at fault for not informing Dr Kelly that its press office would confirm his name if a journalist suggested it. He also considered that the Ministry of Defence was at fault for not having set up a procedure whereby Dr Kelly would be informed immediately his name had been confirmed to <P>


<a name="column_686"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 686</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the press and in permitting a period of one and a half hours to elapse between the confirmation of his name and his being told of it. Of course, the Government must respond to those criticisms.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para15"></a>The MoD acknowledged that it would have been better if it had told Dr Kelly explicitly that his name would be confirmed if a journalist suggested it, and if there had been a procedure to inform him immediately he had been identified by the press. The Ministry of Defence has already taken measures to improve procedures, including, first, by reference to terms of employment and, secondly, by reference to disciplinary and related procedures. It intends also to examine assistance to civil servants at risk of media attention and guidance on dealing with the media, where the principle will remain unchanged that no-one should speak to the media, on or off the record, without express approval.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para16"></a>I wish to make the following points. The argument that Mr Gilligan's broadcasts were in substance true albeit inaccurate in some particulars is wrong. His claim was that the intelligence about Saddam using some weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order to do so was inserted in the dossier, not by the JIC, as my right honourable friend the Prime Minister had told Parliament, but by Downing Street. He said that that was done against the express wishes of the JIC, and that it was done by Downing Street,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"probably knowing the intelligence was wrong".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-04_para17"></a>
Furthermore, he said that the source of that unprecedented charge was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a senior official in charge of drawing up the dossier".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-04_para18"></a>
That was the substance of the broadcast at seven minutes past six on 29 May. In fact, every single one of those claims was wrong, as the noble and learned Lord has found.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para19"></a>Secondly, the criticisms that the noble and learned Lord makes of the BBC were, in large measure, based on the views of the BBC itself. Thirdly, the findings of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, were entirely consistent with the findings of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee on the reliability and propriety of the dossier.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para20"></a>With respect to those who attack the findings of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, such as the Independent today, I ask that they understand what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has done&#151;an independent analysis of the facts that is unbiased, unprejudiced and fair. No axe to grind; no case to make; no unsupported assumptions. Instead, detailed findings of fact. We will make so much more progress in this matter if we accept those findings and then draw our conclusions from them.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para21"></a>Perhaps I may lay one more canard to rest. It has been suggested that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has enunciated a doctrine that greatly inhibits press freedom. It is said that this is new law. We do not accept that that is right. Obviously, we regard the independence of the BBC as critical. But the relevant findings are set out in the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para22"></a>The first is: do not publish false allegations. In support of that, the noble and learned Lord relies on well known decided cases and quotes Reynolds from <P>


<a name="column_687"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 687</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this House. Secondly, he says that it is necessary to ensure that the editors of media outlets know the terms in which a serious attack is going to be made on the Government before it is broadcast and consider whether it is right in all the circumstances to broadcast it. Thirdly, he concludes that, where an allegation of inaccuracy is made, the management should normally investigate it before dismissing it. Finally, he concludes that, where the Prime Minister and the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee allege to the governors of the BBC that a broadcast is false, the governors should investigate it. None of that is either new law or bad practice.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para23"></a>The report by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was into the death of Dr Kelly. It was set up in the wake of his tragic death. It did not deal with the accuracy of the intelligence, though the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, concludes that the dossier was an accurate account of the intelligence then available. We support and have the highest regard for the intelligence services. As has been made clear, we have not, until very recently, thought that an inquiry into the disparity between the intelligence received on weapons of mass destruction and what has been found about WMD by the Iraq Survey Group was either wise or timely. The ISG has been looking at the WMD position in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para24"></a>Until the beginning of this week (Sunday), we have always preferred to wait until that group had reported before considering any further investigation of the discrepancies that might exist after the ISG had reported. I myself expressed that view as late as Sunday morning, in a broadcast. However, a series of events has caused us to change our view. David Kay's evidence to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday of last week and the increasing uncertainty of the time within which the ISG might conclude its activities make it unwise to wait. We accept that an inquiry is required. We would have been happy for it to be conducted by the ISC, but my right honourable friend in another place was pressed hard for a Franks-type inquiry, and has agreed to it.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para25"></a>The inquiry was described in detail by my noble friend Lady Symons yesterday, when she repeated the Statement made by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in another place yesterday. The inquiry will be able to examine the whole intelligence issue, including weapons of mass destruction, and investigate in particular any discrepancies in that intelligence and what has been found in Iraq by the Iraq Survey Group. It will be able to make recommendations. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Butler, for agreeing to chair it, and to all the other members participating. I know that in this House we will be particularly pleased to see the participation of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para26"></a>I have no doubt about the independence and integrity of the members of that inquiry. I hope that they will be given time and space to conduct their inquiry, and that people will judge them by the quality of their findings rather than by whether they give the judgment that those who have already formed their view on the issue want. I hope that the willingness of <P>


<a name="column_688"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 688</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public servants such as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, and their fellow members of the inquiry to give of their time in such inquiries is not undermined by the monstering that they get from some elements of the press&#151;either after they have failed to deliver a judgment in accord with the prejudices of some, or even, in the case of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, in advance of uttering one word on the subject.
<P>

<a name="40204-04_para27"></a>I am very glad that the Conservatives are co-operating in the inquiry. I welcome the participation of the Conservative Party. I am disappointed but not surprised by the Liberal Democrats' failure to participate in the inquiry. They will snipe from the sidelines; they will make no positive contribution; and they will hope that it all goes wrong for somebody else.

He will be aware of the statement made by the right honourable Michael Howard, the leader of the Conservative Party, that the participation of the Conservative Party is on the basis that the terms of reference referring to the use of intelligence refers to the use of it by the Government and that the committee will be entitled to cover that aspect.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para0"></a>In order for the committee to start with a clear understanding of its terms of reference, will the noble and learned Lord confirm on behalf of the Government that that is the Government's understanding?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, that question was put to my noble friend Lady Symons yesterday to which she gave a clear answer. I stand by that answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, a number of noble Lords did not believe that they had been given an answer to that question. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, as a member of the Cabinet, has the opportunity to do so. The committee is being set up by the Government who are claiming the support of the Conservative Party, although they have not succeeded in getting the support of the Liberal Democrats. Michael Howard on the "Today" programme made absolutely clear his understanding of the terms of reference. The committee cannot start on the basis of an argument about its terms of reference. The terms of reference are the use of intelligence by the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as I said, that question was asked and answered yesterday. I am reluctant to reformulate the answer in different words. I shall find the words in Hansard and answer the question in the course of our debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I put the question to the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, yesterday. I am sure that it has nothing to do with her abilities, but her answer was not very clear. The answer, in effect, was that Ministers do not evaluate. I did not raise the question of usage, but the words&#151;<P>


<a name="column_689"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 689</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>evaluate and use by the Government&#151;go together. We assume that that means Ministers and civil servants, not including the intelligence service, which is a separate civil agency and cannot be wrapped up in government. We are talking about Ministers and the political administration. That must be made clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as I have said, the matter was dealt with yesterday by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons. The precise meaning of the terms of reference is plainly a matter that will ultimately be evaluated by the chairman of the inquiry. He and the other members of the inquiry must determine the scope of the inquiry. If the Conservative Party has difficulty with that, it must reach its own conclusion.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para1"></a>My right honourable friend was, rightly, not willing to give the committee the task of deciding whether the political judgment that led us to war was right, which may go some way towards answering the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord King. It is for elected politicians to make that judgment, not a committee.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para2"></a>We already know that there was both a legal and moral justification for our attack on Iraq. We went to war because of the breaches of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441. That resolution made it clear that Iraq must co-operate with the United Nations in disclosing its WMD and WMD programmes, in stopping their development and dismantling all the work on them.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para3"></a>The ISG has already found laboratories, technology, diagrams, documents and scientists who have been told to conceal their work. The ISG, as David Kay has said, has not found stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. David Kay thinks it unlikely that it will do so. We shall have to wait and see. But there is no doubt from what we have already found that Iraq failed to comply with Resolution 1441. Iraq was seeking, in breach of the resolutions, to develop weapons of mass destruction, and had the necessary intent to build up those weapons of mass destruction wherever it could. David Kay's estimate of whether stockpiles will be found may be right. We do not yet know. Even if it is, even if the 26 million documents that we have yet to read produce not one further clue, even if the interviews with scientists yet to be completed produce no further evidence, even if nothing more is found, the justification for war&#151;the plain breach of Resolution 1441&#151;would be there.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para4"></a>As David Kay recently told a US Senate committee:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In my judgment, based on the work that has been done to this point by the Iraq survey group, and in fact, that I reported to you in October, Iraq was in clear violation of the terms of resolution 1441. Resolution 1441 required that Iraq report all of its activities: one last chance to come clean about what it had".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-05_para5"></a>
He continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have discovered hundreds of cases, based on documents, physical evidence and the testimony of Iraqis of activities that were prohibited under the initial UN Resolution 687, and that should have been reported under 1441, with Iraqi testimony that not only did they not tell the UN about this, they were instructed to not do it, and they hid material".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para7"></a>The world has been made a safer place by our willingness to confront Saddam, and pursue it to a conclusion so that there is no longer a regime acting in breach of a series of Security Council resolutions designed to ensure that the regime did not continue to develop WMDs. But the world has been made safer not only by the disarming of Iraq, but also because of the effect on other unstable, repressive regimes of our willingness to confront Iraq. We need only look at the six nations talks involving North Korea, Iran's recommenced negotiations with the IAEA, and the new relationship with Libya.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para8"></a>The Hutton report has established that the intelligence we had was properly presented in our dossier. The Butler report will examine any discrepancies between the intelligence that was gathered, evaluated and used by the Government, and what the ISG has found. But let us make no mistake. We already know from what we have found in Iraq that breaches of the United Nations Security Council resolutions justified war. We can identify how the world has been made safer by the use of force.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para9"></a>It is also worth saying that our invasion has freed Iraq. A country with a proud history had been brought to its knees by the evil and isolation of Saddam. Now its oil is flowing and its wealth has been put back into the hands of the Iraqis. There is much to do. There are real security problems. But a free Iraq, which is no longer a pariah, can join the family of nations rather than threaten them.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para10"></a>While the wider issues of intelligence will now be considered, it is worth emphasising that the tragic death of Dr Kelly was the subject of Lord Hutton's inquiry. He discharged his task with conspicuous skill and he has provided an authoritative account of the circumstances leading to Dr Kelly's death. We achieve nothing by rejecting the account because it does not suit our prejudices. The picture which he paints is accurate, and for many painful. But we do not commission people of the calibre of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, to reproduce as fact the prejudices of a faction in the debate. It is precisely because the passions run so high that a measured and meticulous account is so important.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para11"></a>Dr Kelly was a fine and honourable public servant. His death was a tragedy. The dignity and bearing of his wife and family through the pain of loss and the huge difficulty of public gaze is inspiring. May they now be left to grieve in private. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40204-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I am proud to follow the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor because I greatly respect the office he holds. I hope that he will hold it for a long time. I know that he has some subsidiary offices, but he knows as well as I do that governments in their declining years tend to create offices to divert attention from their misdeeds. Such <P>


<a name="column_691"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 691</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>offices do not usually endure for very long. They are here today and gone tomorrow. The noble and learned Lord would be wise, therefore, to emphasise the historic role that he performs rather than any other.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para13"></a>I was disappointed in his speech. When he reads it over, he might think possibly that he should have voiced more sympathy for the family of Dr Kelly and indeed have apologised for the misdeeds of the Government that were recognised in the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para14"></a>I, too, pay tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, for the skilful way in which he conducted his inquiry. Nobody could have gone to more trouble to try to arrive at just conclusions, but some of those conclusions trouble me greatly. I do not find it easy to accept that there was nothing wrong in the way in which Dr Kelly's name was made public. I would just remind noble Lords of the evidence given before the Hutton inquiry, which of course was beyond contradiction.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para15"></a>I cannot get out of my mind the references in the diary of Alastair Campbell. I quote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"GH [Geoff Hoon] and I agreed it would f*** Gilligan if that was the source".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-05_para16"></a>
I quote again:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The biggest thing needed was the source out".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-05_para17"></a>
And I quote again:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Spent much of the weekend talking to TB and GH re the source".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-05_para18"></a>
I cannot forget Campbell agreeing with Mr Dingemans at the inquiry that in government circles it was recognised that it would indeed assist them to get Kelly's name out.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para19"></a>How on earth, in the face of all that, can one take seriously Mr Hoon's statement that he made great efforts to ensure Dr Kelly's anonymity? Far from doing anything of the sort, he agreed to the issue of a press statement and a course of action which he knew would lead to the naming of Dr Kelly. He did not even bother to tell Dr Kelly what he was going to do.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para20"></a>As for the Prime Minister, he may not in the strictest sense have authorised the leaking of Dr Kelly's name, but he presided over the meeting where it was decided to issue a press release that led, inevitably, to the naming of Dr Kelly. Campbell's diaries show that neither he nor anyone else in No. 10 were the slightest bit interested in Dr Kelly's welfare. On the contrary, they spent hours and hours in unminuted meetings and made unrecorded telephone calls plotting not how Dr Kelly's interests might be protected, but how his being thrown to the media might be turned to their advantage.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para21"></a>A fair summary of events is surely this. Campbell decided to wage war on the BBC, a war with no holds barred&#151;and he was happy to use Dr Kelly as a weapon in that war. Dr Kelly, already under intolerable pressure, was given no support, but instead was thrown to the media wolves and in that situation of mental turmoil, largely created by others, he took his own life. If I were a member of Dr Kelly's family, I would find it hard to accept that no one is really to blame.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para22"></a>Having got that off my chest, perhaps I may now turn to the other aspects of the inquiry, and to Mr Gilligan. I accept, without reservation, that he was entirely wrong to say what he did on the "Today" programme. But while accepting the central finding of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that the Government did not know that the 45-minute claim was wrong, I am bound to say that the evidence as a whole discloses a course of conduct by those in Downing Street concerned with the preparation of the dossier which is deeply troubling.
<P>

<a name="40204-05_para23"></a>From his background as a lawyer rather than a politician, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, may not have appreciated how wholly unusual were some of the goings on in Downing Street at that time, and how very different was the manner in which business was conducted from the way in which it was conducted by previous administrations, and, it is to be hoped, now that Campbell has gone, will be conducted in future.

<A NAME="40204-06_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I think that noble Lords opposite had better listen to what I have said because it is all in the evidence. It is of course wholly unusual for a press officer, director of communications, party political adviser&#151;call him what you will&#151;to set out to harass and intimidate the BBC with a veritable blizzard of complaints.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-06_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that noble Lords opposite know what I am going to say, so they had better listen. I am referring to the veritable blizzard of complaints, revealed in the evidence before Hutton, about the coverage of events in Iraq, going back long before the Gilligan broadcast.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para0"></a>It is wholly abnormal for a director of communications, let alone a highly political one like Campbell, to play any part in the drawing up of a JIC dossier, which is supposed to be an independent intelligence assessment, let alone chair a meeting of the JIC, as Campbell did on 9 September 2002. It is not surprising that for that he was roundly condemned by the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is surely unique for anyone, let alone someone holding a responsible office in No. 10, to mastermind the preparation of a dossier based on a 12 year-old PhD thesis culled from the Internet and then pass it off as genuine intelligence. But that is what Campbell did with the dodgy dossier of February 2003.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para1"></a>Going back to the September dossier, there is no dispute that Campbell persuaded the intelligence people to make changes that were not presentational changes, but changes of substance. The change from,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Iraq may be able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para2"></a>
to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Iraq military are able to deploy these weapons within 45 minutes",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para3"></a><P>


<a name="column_693"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 693</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
was a change of substance made at Campbell's request. I do not seek for one moment to go behind the finding of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that the change was compatible with the intelligence material in Mr Scarlett's hands, but one can see only too clearly the risk of someone in Mr Scarlett's position, knowing the desire of the Prime Minister to have a dossier which was as strong as possible, being,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"subconsciously influenced to make the wording of the dossier somewhat stronger than it would have been in a normal JIC assessment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para4"></a>
I quote from the Hutton report.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para5"></a>It is absolutely clear that Campbell should not have acted in a way which caused Mr Scarlett to be influenced. If he had not, we might not have finished with a dossier so at variance with what appear to be the facts. We might not have had a dossier which Mr Jones, the leading expert in WMD in the MoD, says in the Independent today was misleading about Iraq's capabilities because the views of the experts were ignored.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para6"></a>For reasons of time, I shall not deal with the instance where Mr Jonathan Powell also got a change of substance in the dossier. It is worth noting that sometimes Mr Scarlett would not agree to changes asked of him, but it is illuminating to look at what then happened. The original draft of the dossier led Campbell to minute Scarlett on 17 September that "might" reads very weakly. He was referring to the fact that the draft stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Iraq might have stocks of vx nerve agent"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para7"></a>
and, by implication, nothing else.
Scarlett stood firm and said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We cannot improve on 'might'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para8"></a>
What was the reaction of Mr Campbell? He removed the whole passage from the dossier and with it the point that the only stocks the intelligence service thought Iraq might hold were of VX gas. I suppose that is what they call open government and transparency.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para9"></a>Finally, I turn to the Prime Minister. He signed the foreword to the dossier, which contains the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"His [Saddam's] military planning allows for some of the weapons of mass destruction to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para10"></a>
The Prime Minister knew perfectly well that the intelligence community was not talking of long-range weapons because in the original draft of the dossier he had cancelled that out. But those words were removed in the final draft and the words that were left in&#151;unqualified&#151;were taken to mean that there was a threat to Britain. A headline appeared in the Sun, "45 minutes to doom". Jonathan Powell got the headline that he wanted in the Evening Standard, "45 minutes to attack", and it was accompanied by a photograph of a London street.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para11"></a>When all that happened, did the Prime Minister hasten to correct the false impression given by his dossier? Did he hasten to say that the reference in the dossier was to battlefield weapons only and that there <P>


<a name="column_694"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 694</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was no question at all of strategic weapons being ready or of there being a threat to this country? Not on your life. Downing Street was keen, very keen, to correct what Mr Gilligan said, but it made no effort at all to correct the false impression given by the wording of the dossier. When it suited his purpose, the Prime Minister was quite happy to see the public misled. Some might say that that deceit was almost as grave as any conduct on the part of Mr Gilligan.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para12"></a>It is a sad and tawdry story and the public should be aware that while the conclusions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, were justified by the evidence, there is nothing for Downing Street to be proud of and many lessons to be learned by those in government who were involved in this sorry affair.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_time0"></a><H5>3.51 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, has made a powerful speech, not least because of his close identification with the family of Dr Kelly, and I congratulate him on it. He raised questions that need to be answered and have not yet been answered by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para13"></a>However, I shall step back for a moment to the Hutton inquiry itself, on which the Government have become so reliant. The Hutton inquiry was strange in a sense, because the judge was a man of the utmost probity and integrity and he was regarded in Northern Ireland as a man of courage and honour. We on these Benches would not wish in any way wish to impugn him, even, if I may say so to the Lord Chancellor, as I snipe from the sidelines, which I intend to do for the next few minutes.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para14"></a>The assessment of the Hutton inquiry ran into considerable difficulties on two fronts. The first was the context in which people would read its conclusions. I give one example. If one does not set it in the context of the extraordinarily high standards of accuracy of the BBC's journalistic output, one could not understand why 56 per cent of the public said that they did not believe the judge's findings with regard to the BBC. Nor could one understand why the public, in such polls as that commissioned by YouGov and the Daily Telegraph, have said by a ratio of 67 per cent to 31 per cent that they trust the BBC more than the Government.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para15"></a>The public are not fools. They have reached those conclusions precisely because they set them in the context of their knowledge of some of the organisations involved. Similarly, the Government were being judged by the public on the basis of several years during which, rightly or wrongly, Mr Alastair Campbell was regarded as a somewhat dubious and devious figure in the way in which he used the power and street-reach of No. 10 to influence outcomes in the media. One cannot understand the reaction to the recommendations and conclusions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, if one does not realise that it was set against that background. That background is significant and it was not mentioned in the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para16"></a>In that context, one of the conclusions that was reached widely in the media&#151;not in this case by the BBC, but by newspapers&#151;and indeed in comments <P>


<a name="column_695"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 695</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made since the inquiry was published, was about the distinction, perceived by many, between the conclusions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, about the likelihood of the journalists and other public bodies being at fault and what appeared to be the giving of the benefit of the doubt to the Government and specifically to No. 10. I shall give an example. All of us know&#151;and we on these Benches have never denied it&#151;that Mr Gilligan made a serious mistake by raising the possibility that the Government had knowingly included false information in the September dossier. We do not question that. It was a serious mistake, all the more so in that the allegation was made by a journalist from a corporation that has such a fine reputation. Understandably, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, made it clear that, in his view, the editorial control over Mr Gilligan at that time was weak and had to be improved. As we all know, the result has been disproportionately great, with the departure and resignation of the chairman and director-general of the BBC, both of whom are highly regarded in their own field.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para17"></a>Contrast that with what happened when the Government and the intelligence service fell below a similar kind of standard. I quote from an article in today's Independent by Dr Brian Jones, the former head of the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons section of the Defence Intelligence Staff:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My belief is that right up to the publication of the dossier there was a unified view amongst not only my own staff but all the DIS experts that on the basis of the intelligence available to them the assessment that Iraq possessed a CW or BW capability should be carefully caveated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para18"></a>
He goes on to state that he had considered who might have seen that ultra-sensitive intelligence and concluded that it was extremely doubtful that anyone with a high degree of CW and BW intelligence expertise was among the exclusive group which did the final scrutiny of the intelligence before it went into the September dossier.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para19"></a>That is an example of a failure to read the detail provided by the most experienced experts in the field of CW and BW capability. It has many parallels with the failure to read the original notes on Mr Gilligan's report. In the first case, the BBC was heavily criticised; in the second, nothing was said about the failure to look back again at the intelligence to see whether Dr Brian Jones's objections should be upheld.
<P>

<a name="40204-06_para20"></a>I turn from that, without any apology to the Lord Chancellor, to the so-called "sexing up" of the dossier. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, has already given some powerful examples of that: the use of "are" instead of "may"; the change of the title of the September dossier; the decision to leave out of the Prime Minister's foreword&#151;in which he wrote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-06_para21"></a>
the Prime Minister's own reference in a first draft to the inability of Iraq to mount a nuclear attack against the United Kingdom. I stress "inability". The Prime Minister said that he could not. However, that essential sentence was wiped out of later drafts, including the final <P>


<a name="column_696"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 696</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one, of the dossier. I could go on and on. Between us, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, and I could give at least half a dozen more examples. Frankly, if one looks at Appendix 3&#151;I say to the Lord Chancellor that I have read the report very fully now&#151;with its 16 specific recommendations from Alastair Campbell's team to change and strengthen that dossier and to give it more zip, it is hard to accept that there was no sexing up of the dossier.

That is exactly the definition that Members on these Benches wish to examine.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   I shall read on; this is a direct quotation:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the term is used in this latter sense, then because of the drafting suggestions made by 10 Downing Street for the purpose of making a strong case against Saddam Hussein, it could be said that the Government 'sexed-up' the dossier".

</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40204-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   For the moment I shall not give way, having just given way to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. I wish to continue my argument. It is an important argument and I am well aware that Members on the Benches opposite do not wish to hear it. Members on these Benches and all the critics of the report wish to make the case that we uphold the argument that the first definition was unfounded, but believe that the second definition is clearly carried out in the terms of the dossier. Perhaps I may say that over the past few days I have asked many <P>


<a name="column_697"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 697</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people&#151;ordinary people rather than intelligence experts&#151;what they think the term "sexing-up" means. I did not prompt them and they have all replied by saying, "We think it means enhancing the good things and playing down the bad". That is exactly what I believe the Government did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will know that in the next part of the report the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, explicitly rejected that definition. He said that the way in which the term "sexed-up" would be understood is that it would mean putting in information that the person knew to be false. That is the finding of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. Does the noble Baroness agree that that is what the noble and learned Lord goes on to find?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I am willing to go on reading the report and to leave it to the judgment of the House. However, I have the words before me,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the context of the broadcasts in which the 'sexing-up' allegation was reported and having regard to the other allegations reported in those broadcasts I consider that the allegation was unfounded as it would have been understood by those who heard the broadcasts to mean that the dossier had been embellished with intelligence known or believed to be false or unreliable, which was not the case".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para2"></a>
I agree with that completely, as do we all; it is absolutely right. In the context of Mr Gilligan's broadcast, which we also repudiate, it is clear that that statement was unfounded. No one denies that and two major heads at the BBC have gone.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para3"></a>But not "sexing-up", which the Lord Chancellor mentioned again. The term "sexing-up" takes both definitions. We are talking about the second definition and we believe that we are thoroughly justified in doing so.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para4"></a>I shall now quote from Mr David Clark, the former adviser to the former Foreign Secretary:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Hutton, in assessing the charge that the Government sexed up the September dossier, relied on a definition of the term so extreme that he could not fail to acquit the Government of it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para5"></a>
I leave that without further comment because I wish to turn to the rest of my remarks.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para6"></a>I believe that the sexing-up of the dossier was made against an extraordinary background&#151;I am talking again about the context of claims made by political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic about the danger posed by Iraq. I quote the Prime Minister on 24 September 2002 in his foreword to the dossier:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para7"></a>
I quote the Foreign Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, on 2 April:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Saddam's removal is necessary to eradicate the threat from his weapons of mass destruction".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para8"></a>
Should noble Lords like a rather more extreme argument, this is President Bush:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun. It could come in the form of a mushroom cloud".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para9"></a><P>


<a name="column_698"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 698</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Unfortunately he was supported in that by Vice President Cheney, one of the most troubling people on the scene. On 16 March 2003, just at the beginning of the war, he said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we believe he [Saddam Hussein] has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para10"></a>
If noble Lords want to be a little light-hearted, only three months later, on 24 June 2003, the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, said that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I don't know anybody that I can think of that has contended that the Iraqis had nuclear weapons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para11"></a>
One wonders if one should introduce the US Department of Defense to the Vice-President and see if they cannot get their ducks in a line.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para12"></a>I move on to what I regard as a crucial question which I hope the Butler inquiry can address, but I am not sure can do so for the reasons advanced by the noble Lord, Lord King. I think it is crucial that it does so. I refer to the case of the intelligence advanced by Mr Blix, the senior UN intelligence head in his report to the UN Security Council on 7 March 2003, just before the war:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At this juncture we are able to perform professional no-notice inspections all over Iraq and to increase aerial surveillance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para13"></a>
He pointed out that he was receiving co-operation from the Iraqi authorities. Finally, on the question of whether he could complete the disarmament studies required of him under the terms of the United Nations Security Council resolution under which he went into Iraq:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It would not take years, nor weeks, but months".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40204-07_para15"></a>There are key questions: why did Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the United States insist on continuing with their plans and preparations for war in the face of Mr Blix's reassurance that he could complete the disarmament of Iraq? Why have thousands of people died because we decided that we could override the advice of Mr Blix? Why, now, do we see the facts unrolling every day to support the arguments of Mr Blix? This last is one of the most important questions of all.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para16"></a>I turn finally to the issue of the inquiries. The second inquiry has already been announced by the Government at very short notice, the so-called Butler inquiry. Again, the noble Lord, Lord King, and others have raised the question of how wide the remit can go. The Liberal Democrats are not interested in sniping from the sidelines, they are interested in getting a full study of the use and presentation of intelligence, and they are interested in looking, as did the Franks report, at the judgments made by politicians in going to war. That is the most significant decision that any politician in any country can make&#151;above all, in a democracy.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para17"></a>It is quite clear that the remit does not cover that. My right honourable friend and Leader of the Liberal Democrats in another place, Charles Kennedy, asked specifically whether it might, and was informed that it would not cover that set of issues. I am afraid that will mean that once again, as with the Hutton inquiry, the public will greet it with scepticism and cynicism, will dismiss it, perhaps quite unfairly, as a whitewash job, and we will be back to yet another series of inquiries. <P>


<a name="column_699"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Sooner or later&#151;and I say this with respect for the Prime Minister because I think he believed in what he was doing; perhaps too much&#151;he will not be able to avoid the essential questions: why did we go to war? On what basis did we go to war? How can we possibly justify having done so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, and in light of her recognition that Mr Gilligan made a serious error in his 6.07 a.m. broadcast, does she agree that, despite the vilification of Mr Alastair Campbell, he was wholly justified in seeking an immediate retraction from the BBC and that it is regrettable that the BBC did not immediately give it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   I shall answer that in two ways. First, I agree that the 6.07 a.m. broadcast made on "Today" certainly went beyond what was justified. We have already said that. I think that the subsequent broadcasts were corrected. It is right for the BBC to apologise. However, my point is that the disproportionate punishment of the BBC in comparison with the punishment of other people who got their facts wrong is very hard to justify.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_time0"></a><H5>4.10 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I must begin by saying that I find the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, to be meticulous in its detail, judicial in its weighing of the facts and excellent in its conclusions, with all of which I, as a layman, who very carefully observed the inquiry's progress, find myself in complete agreement.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para18"></a>I have to say that I have found some of the comments made in the media and elsewhere about the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, quite outrageous. People who comment that it is a pity that he could not find something negative to say about the Government completely miss the point that right is right and wrong is wrong and that sometimes, even in journalism and even in politics, things are indeed black and white. Perhaps it takes a judge to have the courage both to perceive and to say that.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para19"></a>The most surprising thing for me about the BBC's reaction is that it was surprised. How could it be? Although maybe I should have expected it. At some stage before the Gilligan story of 29 May, I was with a group of Labour Peers at a working meal with some BBC governors and officials. I and some others expressed our criticism of the way in which the BBC was dealing with the Iraq war. I was astounded at the smug complacency and lofty dismissal of all criticisms. The mantra of "We have to cover all sides" was mechanically trotted out, although it was not an answer to our specific complaints. For me, the final straw was, on leaving, to be told, patronisingly, that what we had said was just what they would have expected from government parliamentarians; in other words, our comments had gone in one ear and out the other and they were sure that they were doing a great job.
<P>


<a name="column_700"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para20"></a>I think we are all in danger of forgetting the electrifying effect, on the morning of 29 May, of that "Today" programme. As someone who shot bolt upright in her bed, I well remember it. I have to say that I do not consider this a one off, stand alone happening. I believe that long before 29 May there was in parts of the BBC an anti-war agenda. They adopted the anti-war movement from the first demonstrations and continued in the lead-up to, during and after the armed conflict. So it was on very fertile ground that the lies which were the Gilligan story of 29 May fell.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para21"></a>It is nonsense to try to present this as one slip in a seven minutes past six broadcast. As an aside, I would point out that it does not seem to me to matter what time of the day or night you lie on the BBC&#151;a lie is a lie is a lie. But this was not just one little slip; the whole story was lies&#151;a lie that the Government knowingly inserted a wrong report; a lie that the intelligence report was not in earlier because the intelligence services were unhappy as it was from a single source. It was not in earlier than the 5 September draft because the intelligence report had only been received by SIS on 29 August, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, states.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para22"></a>And it was not just at seven minutes past six&#151;the story was seized upon by the "Today" programme presenters, and other journalists, who ran with it enthusiastically and embellished the lies. I quote John Humphreys at 7.32, from the transcript of the Hutton report:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Now our defence correspondent, Andrew Gilligan, has found evidence that the government's dossier on Iraq that was produced last September was cobbled together at the last minute with some unconfirmed material that had not been approved by the security services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para23"></a>
Every single bit of that last statement from the pejorative word "cobbled" is wrong.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para24"></a>Then, at 10 to eight that morning, Mr Gilligan, repeating all his earlier inaccuracies, referred to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"what my intelligence source says".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para25"></a>
He knew David Kelly was not an intelligence source. As David Kelly himself told Susan Watts:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You have to remember I am not part of the intelligence community. I am a user of intelligence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para26"></a>
That is also in the Hutton report.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para27"></a>I have been, all my life, a defender of the BBC; I still defend the independence of the BBC; and I am a passionate admirer and supporter of the World Service and of Caversham. I am delighted that the excellent Mark Byford is the acting head of his beloved BBC in this turbulent time for it. I have to say that his statement, along with that of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder&#151;whose maiden speech we all look forward to&#151;gave the BBC back its dignity in response to the Hutton report which the so-called apology from the outgoing DG and the resignation statement from the chair of governors so spectacularly lacked.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para28"></a>I understand that the outgoing DG commented that Alastair Campbell had not been gracious. I found him dignified in the reaction to his vindication in the report. All I can say is that I have rarely seen anything so lacking in grace as the outgoing DG's attempt at an apology.
<P>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 701</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para29"></a>I should like now to turn to the part of the report which deals with intelligence and the JIC, with which I had some experience in my some 22 years of government service. Much was made in the press during the inquiry about the disquiet that some members of staff in DIS had about assessments. This issue has raised its head again today and has been referred to comprehensively by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para30"></a>I think it is important to know that the JIC process&#151;a structure, incidentally, which is greatly admired and indeed envied abroad&#151;is very much one where assessments are thrashed out round a table, usually at ad hoc current intelligence groups, and then, once an assessment has emerged, it is up to every participating service to go back to its headquarters and brief its head. If anyone is not happy about the assessment then they brief in writing accordingly and it is up to the top person to decide on the merits or otherwise of the case. It is for that person to speak for the service or organisation at the JIC. This is the normal and usual practice. In this case, it was all done properly, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has found.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para31"></a>I have to say that in my own experience&#151;I am trying now to be diplomatic in my choice of words&#151;it is not unusual to find some parts of the DIS in disagreement with an assessment. I cannot help also pointing out that DIS officers, however expert in their own particular fields, are not intelligence officers. I think there has been a confusion in the minds of many people about that.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para32"></a>I turn to the comment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that the possibility cannot be ruled out that John Scarlett and other members of the JIC may have been subconsciously influenced by knowing that the PM wanted to have a dossier worded as strongly as possible. When I sat round Cabinet Office tables contributing to assessments for the Prime Minister and No. 10, I was, I think, always very well aware of what the then Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, felt about issues&#151;one could hardly fail to be so&#151;and what she would have wanted to hear. But I know that I and my contemporaries put forward to her what we considered true and accurate. I do not think that she would have wanted it otherwise&#151;and nor would my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. I am confident that my subconscious was resistant to her influence and, as I know rather well several of the people who currently sit around the JIC table, I am certain that their subconscious is every bit as robust as mine.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para33"></a>I should like to conclude with some words about John Scarlett, a man I have known for a considerable number of years and have admired for his professional achievements as well as for his outstanding integrity, his intellectual honesty and his decency. I have been outraged by the misconceived attacks on him by various parts of the media. I am delighted that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has concluded that the scurrilous charges against him and attacks on his probity are unfounded.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para34"></a>Finally, fine government servants as well as members of the Government and staff at No. 10 were grossly traduced in lies which went round the world, and I, for one, am immensely grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, for painstakingly investigating the charges and finding them unfounded.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Ryder of Wensum: </B>   My Lords, I declare interests as a former chairman of a regional radio company and as the paid acting chairman of the BBC. I would like to thank all the present and former officers and officials of the Palace of Westminster for showing nothing but great personal kindness to me during my 29 years here and, in particular, those members of the palace staff who gave such outstanding support during my five years as Government Chief Whip in another place.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para35"></a>The departures of Gavyn Davies and Greg Dyke are sad losses for the BBC. Mr Davies is an outstanding public servant with supreme integrity and a deep affection for the institution. Mr Dyke is an inspirational leader and his charisma reached every corner of the BBC. It was necessary for the corporation to apologise for the BBC errors highlighted in the Hutton report. Most of the mistakes were, of course, conceded during the inquiry itself. Mr Davies accepted ultimate responsibility by resigning as chairman of the board. Mr Dyke also offered his resignation to the governors and the board accepted it. As Mr Dyke said himself, in his e-mail to BBC staff last Thursday:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I've sadly come to the conclusion that it will be hard to draw a line under this whole affair while I am still here. We need closure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para36"></a><P>

<a name="40204-07_para37"></a>Now the BBC must set its eyes on the future in the public interest. Mark Byford has taken on the role of acting director-general. He has the total support of the governors and the executive. Mr Byford has worked for the BBC for 24 years. He is steeped in public service values and commands wide respect inside and outside the organisation. He has shown formidable skills as head of the World Service and is a strong, proven leader.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para38"></a>Mr Byford has stressed that his role is to provide collective leadership with the executive to ensure that the BBC emerges from this difficult time a strong, independent and vibrant organisation, building on the legacy of Mr Davies and Mr Dyke. Mr Byford will undertake a review of the lessons the BBC must learn from the past few months, including how the corporation investigates and corrects editorial mistakes. Impartiality, accuracy and trust have always been core BBC values designed to serve the public. Brave, independent and rigorous journalism will be maintained under Mr Byford's leadership. This includes investigative reporting set within robust editorial frameworks. The board will never interfere with this work and nor shall I, while acting chairman, allow any external body to interfere with the BBC's crucial independence.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para39"></a>The BBC is experiencing a busier time than ever. Over the next few months it faces the Graf review of online services, the Ofcom review of public service television, the DCMS review of digital services and, of <P>


<a name="column_703"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 703</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course, the charter review process. The BBC's major document on charter review was due to be published in March. It has been agreed to postpone publication until soon after a new chairman and permanent director-general can take personal ownership of it.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para40"></a>The DCMS has assured me that the vacant chairmanship will be filled by the middle of April. I am not a candidate and intend to keep the department to this timetable. The advertisement for the job will appear in Sunday's newspapers. Meanwhile, the governors, solely responsible for the appointment of the director-general, will invite applications. A short list will be drawn up and a final choice made soon after the new chairman assumes office.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para41"></a>I have always believed that the BBC's prime purpose is to enrich people's lives with programmes and services which inform, educate and entertain. This is done in the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, as well as throughout the world.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para42"></a>Recent turbulence has been borne with true professionalism by the 29,000 people working for the BBC. They are devoted to a great institution which exists to serve the public. In particular, I want to pay a tribute to journalists for upholding the highest standards of objectivity when covering the outcome of the Hutton report. I venture to suggest that no other news organisation in the world could have achieved such balance in reporting itself in the eye of a storm.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para43"></a>I believe that the BBC must remain as an independent organisation that serves the public above all else. I believe that the vast majority of the British people are proud of the values and traditions of the BBC. It is their BBC. And let no one forget, it belongs only to them.

<A NAME="40204-07_spnew14"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, I never expected that it would be my experience to have to congratulate a former Conservative Government Chief Whip on making his maiden speech, having crossed the Floor of the House. But, I hasten to point out that there is no suggestion of defection. I am sure the whole House will believe that it was absolutely right that the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, should speak from the Cross Benches in his new capacity as acting chairman of the BBC. The whole House will also have been pleased that he did not feel inhibited by any suggestion that he should speak in a non-controversial way, in discharging the clear responsibility that he now holds to speak for that great organisation and national pride that is the BBC&#151;and for its voice to be heard.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para44"></a>One of the more boring remarks made in this House over issues of reform concerns whether there is any value in having Members who can speak with real authority and experience. The contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, whose maiden speech was well worth waiting for since 1997, has underlined that perhaps more controversial point. We very much look forward to hearing him again.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para45"></a>I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, not particularly for the hours I spent over the past weekend trying to read his report, but for <P>


<a name="column_704"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 704</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reminding me of what today's debate was all about. The report marks an extraordinary event. When the dust has finally settled, I commend to every noble Lord, contrary to the comments of the Lord Chancellor, the reading of an outstanding article by the noble Lord, Lord Rees-Mogg, on Monday. It is a tribute to his experience that even when he had only half read the report he had a pretty good idea. When he had fully read it, the comments he then made bore out his earlier comments on the matter. I was certainly impressed by what he said.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para46"></a>I tried to understand how on earth we have reached this situation. On the first symptom, I share the view of the governor of the BBC reported in the Hutton report. The "Today" programme has become one of extraordinary political significance. It is a battleground of political ideas and attempts at spin and control. Recently, as the director said in his evidence, it has come into the business of creating rather than reporting news. There were elements of tabloid and Sunday journalism in which it appeared to be avoiding contacting people who might deny its story. I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, and his colleagues that that has been one of my concerns.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para47"></a>When I read that Kevin Marsh had said that the BBC had recruited Mr Gilligan so that he might get up the nose of the Government, I was not sure that that was what Lord Reith originally had in mind in his concept of the BBC. That attitude&#151;it is valid criticism of the BBC because obviously Mr Gilligan got part of his story wrong&#151;ran headlong into a Government absolutely determined, as no government before, to control and dominate the media in every possible way. That comes out clearly in the blizzard of e-mails to which the BBC was subjected.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para48"></a>That happened not least because these incidents took place at a time of huge government sensitivity about the war&#151;about its origins and the validity of the intelligence. That combination of events led to the extraordinary diversion and to the tragedy of Dr David Kelly's death. It was a diversion from the main issue that is now to be further pursued. I believe that there are valid criticisms to be made of the BBC and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, and his colleagues will be anxious to ensure that those lessons are learnt.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para49"></a>I turn to the other part of the Hutton report that concerns me. I was impressed by Air Marshal Walker, a former deputy chairman of the JIC, speaking on the "Today" programme. His experience&#151;and it is certainly mine as chairman of the ISC for seven years&#151;is that the JIC has never before been used for a public relations exercise of this kind. I recognise the interpretation of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, of the meaning of "sexing up". Clearly, in my judgment, that document was sexed up. It was not sexed up in the context put by Mr Gilligan, but it was sexed up.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para50"></a>I am sure that one of the lessons learnt will be the importance of getting the fullest evidence possible. My former committee, the ISC, examined the issue and established that there were no political pressures on the JIC for the production of that document. The ISC <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>merely took evidence and never had access to the e-mails. Once one has read the e-mails that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, had opened up&#151;they were subsequently referred to as "a can of worms"&#151;one can see the amount of political pressure that was exerted.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para51"></a>I believe that Mr Scarlett, an outstanding public servant for whom I have the highest regard, was put in an impossible position. I understand the expression "subconsciously" used by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, but it would have been impossible for Mr Scarlett to do that job knowing that he was under prime ministerial instruction to produce the strongest document possible within the bounds of the intelligence available without being influenced in that respect. With the experience I have in that field, I can draw no other conclusion.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para52"></a>I turn to the naming of Dr Kelly. As a former Secretary of State for Defence, I was extremely unhappy about the way in which it was done. I agree with Alastair Campbell's evidence to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that with hindsight his name should have been concealed or it should have been announced having given Dr Kelly clear warning of that so that arrangements could be made for him. The idea of a "Twenty Questions" exercise to see whether the media guessed the right name was most regrettable.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para53"></a>I read the Hutton report&#151;I need to read it again but I do not have time&#151;and I could not discover who gave authority for the naming. I may have missed it. Of course the question and answer document was the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence, but within that was one key policy decision: whether to release his name. I have not discovered the source of that. Whether it was taken by Sir Kevin Tebbit, who showed the question and answer document to Secretary of State Geoff Hoon, I cannot say because I cannot find out who took it, but the Prime Minister authorised it in principle by everyone recognising, "We will announce that we have a source and it is inevitable that the name will come out". That was not a glorious decision.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para54"></a>The Chief Whip will note that I had one minute to acknowledge the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, so perhaps I may claim injury time in order to ask where we go now. I cannot understand why the Government have got into such a hopeless muddle over the new committee. I cannot understand why there has been a huge rush to set it up. One can announce that there will be an inquiry, but I understand that now we have four unexpected Privy Counsellors. No one expected that they would have to be appointed to the Privy Council because people had not had time to work out who was or was not a Privy Counsellor. That is indicative of the confusion.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para55"></a>The terms of reference are obviously most important. Perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, who is a member of the Cabinet: what do the Government intend those terms of reference should be? I hope that in responding to the debate he will have a good, clear government answer to that question. I shall press on my colleagues the <P>


<a name="column_706"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 706</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question of the continuing participation of the Conservative Party in the inquiry if we cannot be clear about the agreement we have reached. It was spelt out most clearly by Michael Howard on television, and if that is not to be honoured in an attempt to divert the committee, who are splendid people in their own right, from what we understood the terms of reference to be, that would be most unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para56"></a>I want to make a final point and I apologise for the time. Out of this difficult issue, the aim of the work of the new committee must be to ensure that in future we have the best possible intelligence and that the best possible and wisest use of intelligence is made by government in pursuit of their policies. The Prime Minister was most evangelistic in the House today about the importance of America and Britain being a force for good in the world and making their contribution in difficult circumstances to try to make the world a safer, fairer and more just place. In those circumstances, if we are to enter all sorts of situations and regions, it is absolutely essential that we have the best possible intelligence and take the wisest decisions we can before we send our forces into what may be dangerous situations. That is the objective of the inquiry and I hope that, following on from the lessons learnt from the Hutton inquiry, the new committee can have clear terms of reference to ensure that we achieve that objective.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, one sets up committees of inquiry for a number of purposes. The first is to hold a government to account and the second, but equally important, is to attempt to re-establish public confidence. It is evident from the public reaction to the Hutton report that it has failed to re-establish public confidence. That is partly because its terms were set narrowly and the noble and learned Lord's interpretation of those terms was itself extremely narrow. Now we have a new inquiry whose terms are also set extremely narrowly. We now understand that the exact narrowness of those terms is not yet fully agreed between the Conservative Party and the Government.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para57"></a>Those are the reasons why my party rightly refused to participate in the inquiry. Perhaps the House will allow me to quote from the last Liberal government's terms of inquiry over British operations in Iraq. They were:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to inquire into the origins, inception and conduct of operations of war"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para58"></a>
in Mesopotamia in August 1916. "The origins and inception" are rather broader terms. We have gone backwards in our attitude towards committees of inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para59"></a>The underlying question, as a number of speakers have already said, is what was the case for war? How strong was the evidence for weapons of mass destruction? What were the other underlying motivations?
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para60"></a>There were many other American motivations, explicitly stated in Washington in the year that preceded the intervention: clearly, in the neo-conservative Right, to remake the Middle East, <P>


<a name="column_707"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 707</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through forcing changes of regime in Iraq and Iran, so removing the main perceived threats to Israel and to America's dominant position in what the Americans call the "Greater Middle East Region"; regime change in Iraq, partly to complete the job not completed in l991 by the Administration of the first President Bush&#151;to which many of those pushing for regime change in 2002 had belonged; in Iran, to restore the prestige the United States had lost in the Iranian revolution and in the failed attempt to rescue American hostages after the revolution.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para61"></a>I recall that there was an active argument in Washington think tanks, and on the op-ed pages, about whether it was correct for the United States to attack Iraq or Iran first. There was a clear belief on the American Right that the Iranian and Iraqi regimes were the main supporters of Palestinian terrorism, of Hezbollah and Hamas, and that their removal would thus lead to Palestinian acceptance of Israeli terms for a settlement. It was stated in many publications in Washington at the time, and by Henry Kissinger, that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The road to Jerusalem lies through Baghdad'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para62"></a>
It is a deeply flawed analysis of Middle Eastern politics, but it was one that gained the status of conventional wisdom on the Right of Washington foreign policy discussions between September 11, 2001 and the invasion of Iraq.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para63"></a>It was a drive from the Right to force regime change in those two countries that predated the September 11 attacks. Those attacks, and the successful intervention in Afghanistan that followed, provided the impetus for linking global terrorism with Palestinian terrorism and Saddam Hussein with Al'Qaeda, which noble Lords will recall that the Right attempted to do, to make a plausible case for war.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para64"></a>Our Prime Minister did not share that analysis. I hope that he was well informed about the mixed motivations in Washington that drove their case for war; if he was not, then there were weaknesses at the heart of the British Government. He clearly believed that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime was a threat to peace, to the region and to the world, but it is clear that neither he nor the rest of the British Government shared American perceptions of Iran. It is also clear that many others within the British Government, including the Foreign Secretary, did not share his deeply-held personal conviction, just as there were those within the Bush Administration, notably Colin Powell, who did not share the convictions of the leaders of the Pentagon.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para65"></a>So the Prime Minister had to rest the case for war far more on weapons of mass destruction than his American allies did in order to persuade a more sceptical British Parliament and public. Clearly, that is where Downing Street came unstuck. It had to make uncertain evidence carry more weight than it was capable of bearing. The charge is that the Government stretched the evidence, that it massaged the evidence. On the evidence of the Hutton inquiry, although not in its conclusions, that charge is made. 
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para66"></a>In his opening speech the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor made some rather ungracious references to these Benches, which I felt were close to <P>


<a name="column_708"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 708</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unacceptable in this Chamber. The Prime Minister, in his speech on 13 March last year, referred to the Liberal Democrats as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unified . . .  in opportunism and error".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 18/3/03; col. 761.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para67"></a>
It has been an uncomfortable period for us in the run up to war. We were not convinced that the evidence was conclusive; we felt that the Government were putting the worst case evidence in each dossier they produced. I remember a 167-page dossier that, we were told, had conclusive evidence on page 91 that the Iraqi regime still had anthrax. I read that page very carefully. The discussion was about whether the Iraqis had stopped producing anthrax in 1990 or in 1991, and whether under ideal, laboratory conditions, they might have managed to keep some of that anthrax active for another 10 to 12 years. In the presentation that was produced as evidence that they must still have anthrax. Not surprisingly, we on these Benches were not entirely persuaded.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para68"></a>What were the other reasons for going to war alongside the Bush Administration? First, to maintain the closeness of the special relationship, to preserve Britain's claimed position as the bridge between the United States and Europe. Secondly, to gain concessions from the Bush Administration, in return for our support on their approach to war.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para69"></a>It is clear that these hoped-for concessions were: first, legitimation, through the United Nations, in the approach to war; secondly, a constructive and well-planned approach to post-conflict reconstruction, within a multilateral framework, with a vital role for the UN. President Bush repeated the term "vital role" eight times in his press conference after the Belfast bilateral summit; and, thirdly, a parallel commitment to revive the Middle East peace process through the road map. A Government resolution on March 18 last year includes the statement that the other place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"also welcomes the imminent publication of the Quartet's road map as a significant step to bringing a just and lasting peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians and for the wider Middle East region, and endorses the role of Her Majesty's Government in actively working for peace between Israel and Palestine".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 18/3/03; col. 760.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para70"></a>
We have gained none of those concessions.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para71"></a>The failure to achieve the aims that Her Majesty's Government hoped to gain through following America's lead, and accepting America's case for war, raises wider questions, far wider than those that the Hutton inquiry or the Butler inquiry are allowed to address within their terms of reference: questions about the strategy of the Bush Administration to Palestine and the Likud Government; questions about the transatlantic special relationship; questions about intelligence co-operation; questions about the renewal of the US/UK agreement on intelligence co-operation; and, indeed, questions about the future of NATO. There is an excellent article in today's Herald Tribune by a leading American that says that it is time for the Americans to reconsider the future of NATO.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para72"></a>There are some broad and difficult issues here that go to the heart of British foreign policy: the value of the special relationship; the Government's attempt to <P>


<a name="column_709"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 709</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>balance between the United States and continental Europe; the terms of British intelligence co-operation with the United States. An inquiry into the origins and inception of Her Majesty's Government's approach to war with Iraq would touch on these issues. Neither Hutton, nor Butler, with their narrowly drawn terms of reference, will do so.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Birt: </B>   My Lords, I should say at the outset that I am currently the Prime Minister's strategy adviser, on a part-time basis. However, I speak today above all as someone who worked at the BBC for 13 years, and who is deeply troubled to see an institution I so revere suffer the worst setback in its history. I am reassured that the noble Lord, Lord Ryder of Wensum, who is a deeply thoughtful and conscientious person and who I have long known, is holding the reins at this difficult time.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para73"></a>At the root of this crisis was a slipshod piece of journalism. Let us be clear: it was not "mostly right". The central thrust of the story was unfounded. But let us also be clear: the subject of the reporter's inquiry, the Government's dossier, was entirely legitimate. It was the treatment of the story that was deeply unsatisfactory. Faced with a tip-off on a contentious matter, experienced journalists test their sources rigorously. They proceed with watchful scepticism, scrutinising the emerging information from every angle. Through further inquiry, they build up their knowledge. They put the allegations to those involved. Painstakingly, they build up the fullest possible picture.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para74"></a>Had all that happened in this instance, and had an accurate, fair and contextualised story resulted, it would manifestly have been in the public interest. One reason why this did not happen is that the programme itself failed to exercise due editorial scrutiny over its reporter. Moreover, when grave allegations are to be made&#151;and especially when there is a risk of libel&#151;the programme's senior editorial staff need to bring into play the organisation's best editorial and legal minds. That did not happen either.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para75"></a>All organisations make mistakes. But the BBC was damaged in this instance above all by its failure to respond properly after the story was broadcast. When the coverage was challenged, it should have been rigorously investigated by BBC executives. But&#151;transfixed as they were by outside attack&#151;they did not. Rather, we had blind defence and sophistry. We heard the story being supported on the grounds that it was sufficient to report a source, provided that the source was reported accurately, whether or not the story was true.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para76"></a>Indeed, the word most missing during this saga was "truth". Absolute truth in journalism or in any other sphere may be unattainable, but we can all recognise journalism that is honestly engaged in the pursuit of truth&#151;journalism that is rigorous, fair-minded and questioning; journalism that is committed to getting it right.

<a name="40204-07_para77"></a>When the governors finally became involved, they focused on a key principle&#151;the independence of the BBC. They were right to do so, for the independence of the BBC&#151;we will all agree&#151;is sacred. It has been fought for by boards and directors-general since John Reith successfully resisted Churchill's demand for the government to take over the corporation in the general strike. Of course the BBC must be willing to stand up to the powerful. Of course it must investigate and reveal. But the governors' failure&#151;under fire&#151;was not to focus at the same time on another, equally vital, principle: the need to safeguard the integrity of the BBC's journalism, to try to discover whether the story complained of was actually true.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para78"></a>Last week, the governors finally did act. But they took far too long to exert a grip as the crisis rumbled on. They failed for too long to act as the BBC's regulators&#151;and, in the process, they have brought into question the institution's 1920s system of governance.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para79"></a>The story in question in the form it took was at odds with the corporation's own high and stated standards&#151;the standards that history has set it. It should not have happened, and it should not have been defended. From top to bottom a series of grievous errors was made. And it is those errors that damaged the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para80"></a>The BBC can and, no doubt, will pick its way out of this dreadful imbroglio. But it can do so only by truly coming to terms with&#151;facing up to&#151;what really happened. For some within&#151;still in denial; understandably shocked, bewildered and confused by the crisis&#151;that will be difficult. But I assure your Lordships that throughout the BBC, at every level, there are many who do appreciate the significance of what occurred, who are deeply committed to journalism of the highest standard.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para81"></a>The powerful "Panorama", put out in the week before the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton reported, is one testament to that. It is on the firm foundation of its own best people that the BBC can re-stake its claim to offer journalism of challenge and integrity; can embrace the rigour that goes hand-in-hand with robustness.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para82"></a>Your Lordships' support will be needed, too. The BBC has taken tumbles throughout its history. The institution can be infuriating, even for those of us who have led it! But at its best, the BBC has offered a vital, democracy-enhancing national debating chamber, unique in the world. It has nourished our lively, creative, national culture. It has given space to Britain's most innovative talents to express themselves&#151;and, in the process, to engage, stimulate and entertain us. It has extended all our horizons, delving into our history, opening our eyes to the wonders of the arts and science and nature.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para83"></a>The task of the coming months is to rebuild the BBC's confidence, health and strength; to encourage this great institution&#151;of which the noble Lords, Lord King and Lord Ryder, spoke&#151;to pursue its highest purposes: to restore and revitalise its historic commitment to public service.

<a name="column_711"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 711</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Birt, is one of the best I have heard in this Chamber in a long time. I also welcome the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder. He also put in context what the BBC has to do from now on. I shall come to the BBC later in my remarks.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para84"></a>It is very difficult to have a debate on the Hutton report because the report is very difficult to debate: it considers a lot of evidence and arrives at conclusions. There is not much to be said about it. So we are having a debate on everything else, such as why the Government went to war. However, that is not what the Hutton report is about. What will the new intelligence committee say to us? That is not what the debate is about either. We are going round in circles trying to find anything other than the Hutton report to entertain ourselves this afternoon. It reminds me of what Macaulay said about the English nation in a mood of hysteria.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para85"></a>Dr Kelly's death was tragic. As far as I could detect at the time and from subsequent evidence, Dr Kelly was shopped by Andrew Gilligan to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee as Susan Watts' source. What he said at seven minutes past six o'clock on 29 May does not worry me in the slightest; it is a worrisome matter but the noble Lord, Lord Birt, has dealt with it. Dr Kelly may have thought, "I could not have been the only source; he might have other sources". However, Mr Gilligan shopped his witness. When Dr Kelly realised that, he responded as anyone would when told that he was the source of a story. He felt exposed and humiliated. In my view, that is why he committed suicide. That is the core of the story. As in the old working class meal, around that little bit of meat are many layers of flour, suet and other nice fattening things. They are very nice to eat but not very meaty.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para86"></a>If one concedes that that is the story, and if Dr Kelly had not committed suicide, then everything else we have been discussing&#151;about sexing up, not sexing up, who said what to who and when&#151;would not matter. Imagine a scenario in which he had not committed suicide but had perhaps been reprimanded. There would have been no inquiry. There would have been nothing about which to inquire. There would have been no need to release 9,000 pages of evidence. I should add that I am glad that they have been released as it has been an exercise in open government.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para87"></a>When someone commits suicide, all the evidence has to be examined. The central problem is that behaviour and comments which seemed ordinary before the suicide start to look sinister after it. Quite naturally, finding a patch of ground on which he was in the right, Alastair Campbell carried on fighting. Spin doctors do not often find themselves in the right, but when they do, they fight. I do not blame him for that; this is a political game. Had this man not committed suicide all of that would have been a completely ordinary matter of daily politics to which we gave no further thought.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para88"></a>So the Hutton report is about the death of one person and not about the Prime Minister. Quite a lot of people wanted a one-page report from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that started by saying, "The Prime Minister was guilty of taking the nation to <P>


<a name="column_712"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 712</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>war on dubious grounds&#151;period". The Independent, the Guardian and everyone would have been very happy, and no doubt cheering from the rafters. However, I do not think that we have a constitution in which a judge can dismiss a Prime Minister. We have a constitution in which Parliament has to decide such matters.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para89"></a>Even if my right honourable friend had been in the wrong, and even if the noble and learned Lord had said so&#151;we would have had a very different debate in that case; we would all have been talking about the noble and learned Lord, not about a thousand other matters&#151;it would not have been right on that ground alone for the Prime Minister to resign. Prime Ministers resign when they lose the confidence of Parliament. That is the constitution; that is the way in which we do things.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para90"></a>There is a problem, because people are demanding committee after committee and commission after commission. There is the Hutton report; there will be the Butler report. When the Butler report comes out and is debated, people will be disappointed. I tell noble Lords that now. I told people before the Hutton report, "You will be disappointed by it". Once again, people expect the noble Lord, Lord Butler, to say, "The Prime Minister is guilty because he took the country to war on dubious grounds". That is not what the noble Lord has been asked to do, but it is exactly what people expect.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para91"></a>All the people who praised the integrity of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, before he published the report turned round and found all sorts of things wrong with him afterwards, only because he had not told them what they wanted to hear. If people want such a report, why do they not publish it themselves? The Liberal Democrats can publish their own report, have their own judge or many judges, and tell the judges, "Write this report". That would be very nice. Every party can have a report, and we can all be happy ever after. However, the report that we have on hand is not about why we went to war. It is about Kelly and it is absolutely clear that, so far as that question is concerned, the blame all lies on one side.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para92"></a>As my noble friend Lady Ramsay said, sometimes the blame cannot be distributed equally all around. Sometimes one has to say yea or nay. If, instead of what the noble and learned Lord wrote, he had said that the BBC was innocent and the Government were to blame, not one person would have minded. A government who have been in power for seven years become unpopular. When one is in government, one is not there to be loved&#151;one is there to govern. Not being loved should not be a problem. However, there is hysteria abroad that suggests that we resign despite the lack of evidence, as it were.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para93"></a>I therefore think that people should wait either until they get a 15th or 16th commission to report what they want it to report, or for the verdict of history about who and what was the story behind our going to war in Iraq. Incidentally, I supported the Government's stance and have seen nothing to change my view on that.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para94"></a>I want to make one comment about the BBC. I must say that I feel slightly like a foreigner. Excellent though the BBC is, I really think that we make too much fuss about it. When the BBC was a great independent institution, it was because the elite was a single, small elite of white men who had all gone to one of two public schools and one of two universities. That is why it was so solid. We now live in a society with multiple elites. We have lots of genuine differences. We cannot go on having the idea that there should be one great cultural institution that is hegemonic, culturally, so that it reflects the ideals of Lord Reith. Every time I hear his name I want to do something violent, but I shall not.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para95"></a>There is a problem. The BBC is financed by a regressive tax. I would like someone to find a way of financing the BBC by a progressive tax, not a regressive tax. I would like to see the BBC protected for its journalism and its arts, but not for its entertainment. I do not see why I have to pay for BBC entertainment at all. It can go out and compete. We need to think about the BBC; it may be the wrong time to do so, because as soon as one says anything about it people think one is attacking its independence.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para96"></a>Andrew Gilligan was not the BBC. The "Today" programme was not the BBC. The BBC should calm down. It should have done what the noble Lord, Lord Birt, said. Now that it has not done it, it should not take this crisis and make it into a tragedy for itself.

<A NAME="40204-07_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, I listened with great interest as always to my noble friend Lord Desai, and especially to his final remarks about the BBC. I do not actually know whether Lord Reith went to one of those famous public schools; I had always rather hoped that he went to Glasgow University. I am not sure that he did, but he should have done.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para97"></a>What is notable about the responses to the Hutton report is that they are mainly based on the opinions or prejudices that the commentators and reporters had before the inquiry began. The report did not change those at all. I should therefore like to put my own prejudices on record; they have not changed either. I am not new Labour, as older Members of the House will know, but I have no objection to the Prime Minister, wish him no harm and support him whenever I can. More importantly, I supported the war and still do.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para98"></a>My reasons for supporting the war have nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction or weapons of any kind, nor with any of the numerous reasons recited by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. They are quite simple and rely on Iraq's disdain for numerous UN resolutions over a considerable period, and the UN's failure to deal with that. In that respect, the UN came more and more to remind me of the League of Nations, which some noble Lords might remember. It failed in its duty to insist on the resolutions that it passed.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para99"></a>I do not need to recite those resolutions, as they were set out in two very notable speeches last year by my noble friend Lady Ramsay of Cartvale. She was right <P>


<a name="column_714"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 714</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then and is still right now. I support her entirely. I have known her for 40 years, since I was in the other place and she was a figure in the Foreign Office. We were often joined by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in those days; I am sure that he is still as favourably inclined towards her as he was then.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para100"></a>The problem arose from Gilligan's assertion that the Government had inserted certain information, knowing it to be wrong. It would be hard to think of anything more serious to allege. Gilligan excuses himself by saying that most of his report was true. That might be right, although the noble Lord, Lord Birt, did not seem to agree with that. The claim was deftly dismissed by Michael Gove in the Times yesterday, who said that if he asserted that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Greg Dyke was a charming, original, talented tax-dodger that would be mostly true",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para101"></a>
but that the last word would be a gross libel. Gilligan's assertion falls into a somewhat similar place.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para102"></a>I now turn to the general picture of the journalism of Gilligan. I have been a member of the National Union of Journalists for 30 years plus, not in the glow and glamour of Fleet Street, but in the business and professional press where we try to tell the truth whenever we can. The NUJ has a code of conduct; one might say that it is an ethical code. I think that the president of the NUJ should send Gilligan a copy of the code, as he does not appear to follow it very closely. That goes to the centre of the issue. A good deal has been spoken of the probity and brilliance of BBC journalism but, like my noble friend Lord Desai, I am slightly sceptical about it. I shall not go into that now.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para103"></a>I turn to Dr Kelly and to what is known as the duty of care that the MoD owed to him or is said to have owed to him. Having in my day been both an employee and an employer, I am not sure what "duty of care" means. A good employer safeguards the welfare of his employees as best as he can, but that does not mean that the employee is necessarily entitled to be totally protected should he stray from the path of righteousness. That is an absurd contention, and yet it has been contended throughout the whole event.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para104"></a>If the MoD owed Dr Kelly a duty of care, Dr Kelly also owed a duty of care to his employer. He failed in that and his name was rightly released to the public. Whether the mechanism by which it was released was right or wrong is immaterial. I would have preferred the MoD just to name him, to have come straight out with it, without using a questionnaire approach. Dr Kelly failed in his duty of care to his employer and the result was tragic for him and for his family, but in that respect he was the author of his own misfortune. I do not like to say that, but that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para105"></a>I have a general point to make on the media. Like the trade unions, the media have become over-powerful and over-mighty. The trade unions were dealt with in the 1980s and I supported the government of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, in doing that, although I sat on the Opposition Benches at the time. For some time the media&#151;originally the press&#151;were referred to by a nickname, the fourth estate. That was all right as long as it was a nickname, but in recent years the media have <P>


<a name="column_715"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 715</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>come to believe it and that is where they have gone wrong. The media believe that they have the right to overturn governments, to harass and possibly to overturn Ministers, and to create on the "Today" programme the political agenda for the day&#151;whatever happens to suit them&#151;and that is wrong.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para106"></a>I conclude by reminding the House of a matter that has continued throughout the war and the Hutton inquiry. The attitude of the press towards the Government and the Prime Minister reminded me of a phrase, which older Members will remember, used by Aneurin Bevan in the late 1940s: he referred to an attitude of the press as the "drip, drip, drip of denigration". That is still going on and it is high time it stopped.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-07_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   My Lords, in the increasingly bitter war of words that has been waged between the Government and the media since the publication of the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, sadly the forgotten man has been Dr David Kelly. That is why I believe we are very grateful to my noble friend Lord Waddington for his very powerful speech, given his knowledge of the family.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para107"></a>I recognise that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, decided that he did not need to make any recommendations. The basis for that belief, in paragraph 472 of the report, is that he had no doubt that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the BBC and the Government will take note of the criticisms which I have made in this report".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para108"></a>
As my noble friend Lord Strathclyde pointed out last Wednesday, to hear the Government one would think that virtually no criticisms had been made. I echo the words of my noble friend Lord Strathclyde when he said that the Prime Minister believes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the Government have nothing to apologise for and that he proposes no action to change the culture in his Government to avoid what happened to Dr Kelly ever happening again".&#151;[Official Report, 28/1/04; col. 214.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-07_para109"></a>
He asked the Government, and indeed the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on behalf of the Government, to apologise fully and unreservedly to Dr Kelly and his family. The noble and learned Lord took great offence to that. He called it irresponsible, distressing and disappointing. I have to disagree with him completely.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para110"></a>I should like to focus on one point, in disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, to ensure that lessons have been learned and that any similar situation will be avoided in the future. We owe it to the family and friends of the late Dr David Kelly to ensure that the agony that he suffered will never be repeated. The report coincides with the introduction of the Executive Powers and Civil Service Bill. Therefore, this is an appropriate moment to reflect on what went wrong, as revealed in the pages of the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para111"></a>In this country we benefit enormously from the impartiality, the independence, the integrity and the objectivity of each and every civil servant. I have said that on many previous occasions and I have had <P>


<a name="column_716"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 716</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>personal experience of it as a Minister. There is an urgent need for very clear guidelines to be set out on where civil servants have access to the media. There is no room for any grey areas. I welcome the steps referred to by the Lord Chancellor at the start of the debate, but I believe that we have to go much further.
<P>

<a name="40204-07_para112"></a>My recollection is that when I was a Minister my senior civil servants, with my full confidence and that of my colleagues, enjoyed access to leading specialist correspondents and to Lobby correspondents. That access was always undertaken under very tight conditions, assisted by a highly professional attitude on the part of information officers. But of course we now have a Government in which "spin" is a clean word. Against that background of spin, I believe that the guidelines have become seriously flawed. The general atmosphere of spin, spin, spin has confused the situation and, therefore, we must ensure that the code of conduct for civil servants envisaged under Clause 13 of the Bill places the situation beyond all reasonable doubt.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that Sir Bernard Ingham was guilty of spin as well?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   No, my Lords. Having, on occasions since he left office, heard Sir Bernard, the noble Lord may be correct in believing that he spins a little here and there. But when he occupied that vital office of communicating on behalf of the Prime Minister, I know of no instance when he was guilty of spin.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para0"></a>I pay tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, for his expert handling of a difficult brief and inquiry, with restricted terms of reference. However, my view of the inquiry is that one of the key questions, which was never asked and was therefore never properly considered, is why Dr Kelly's version of events was ever publicised. When he wrote that letter to his immediate superiors on Monday 30 June, he could have had no idea that, by the end of the week, its contents would be in the hands of the Prime Minister, Mr Campbell and the Secretary of State for Defence, through agitated phone calls of which we have no record during the Saturday and Sunday. In that letter, he says how much he deeply regretted talking to Andrew Gilligan.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para1"></a>He was seen by Dr Wells during the afternoon of Friday 4 July, together with Richard Hatfield, the personnel director. In that interview, Mr Hatfield accepted that Dr Kelly had access to the media. Indeed, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, finds at paragraph 26:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One of Dr Kelly's roles in the course of his work was to speak to the media".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-08_para2"></a>
In accepting that, Mr Hatfield told Dr David Kelly that he accepted that he had no malicious intent and that no classified material had been revealed. Mr Hatfield decided that no formal disciplinary proceedings would be initiated. He warned Dr Kelly that he would be writing to him expressing displeasure at his conduct, and that should have been an end to the matter.
<P>


<a name="column_717"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 717</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para3"></a>Dr Kelly had volunteered valuable information. How much have we heard of the leak inquiry? The information that Dr Kelly had volunteered should, as Dr Wells pointed out, have been made available to the leak inquiry, but it bypassed it and we still do not really know why. I am sure that it was right for his permanent secretary to arrange for the information given by Dr Kelly to be made available within government, better to inform those who had to make decisions about how to handle the allegations made by Mr Gilligan. However, in the Hutton report, Sir Kevin Tebbit says that his advice, presumably to the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, was that no attempt should be made to publicise what Dr Kelly had said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether the noble Lord is suggesting that the conversation between Dr Kelly and Mr Gilligan was authorised or unauthorised. That is unclear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   My Lords, it is not unclear. I said that Mr Hatfield's conclusion was that Dr Kelly should not have done what he did but that no disciplinary action would be taken against him, and that Sir Kevin Tebbit said that it should not reach the public domain. So the Prime Minister was wrong to decide that a statement should be issued saying that an unnamed civil servant had come forward. Everyone except the Prime Minister seems to have recognised that as soon as that statement was issued, Dr Kelly's name was bound to come out. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, says that it was not a practical possibility to keep his name secret.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para4"></a>When Dr Kelly received his ticking-off, he had every right to expect that he would be afforded anonymity. As far as I can see, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, never considered whether the information should have been used only to inform the leak inquiry. The decision to rush out a statement was wrong. To have exposed Dr David Kelly to intense media interest is greatly to be regretted and must never be allowed to happen to a civil servant again.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I propose to limit my remarks to one specific issue, which is important, although it was dismissed by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. That is the potential impact of the Hutton report on freedom of the media. Some of the noble and learned Lord's comments can be read as supporting the restriction of media freedom. At paragraph 280, the noble and learned Lord said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the communication by the media of information (including information obtained by investigative reporters) on matters of public interest and importance is a vital part of life in a democratic society. However the right to communicate such information is subject to the qualification (which itself exists for the benefit of a democratic society) that false accusations of fact impugning the integrity of others, including politicians, should not be made by the media".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-08_para5"></a>
That passage is repeated at paragraph 291.
<P>


<a name="column_718"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 718</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord seems to be saying that the media must not make allegations of misconduct about issues of public importance unless they are satisfied that they can verify the truth of those allegations. If he means that&#151;it is not wholly clear whether he does&#151;he plainly goes too far. The media, like the Government, must not make allegations that they know or believe to be untrue, but the media&#151;again, like the Government&#151;should be free to make and publish allegations that they believe to be true, even if it later turns out that they are not.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para7"></a>Except in a few cases, such as contempt of court, there is and should be no control by public authorities over the publication by the media of allegations of misconduct. Instead, that is a matter for the civil law of defamation. The party accused of misconduct can protect his reputation by an action in court. But media bodies that act responsibly and in good faith may be protected by the law even if they make allegations of misconduct that turn out to be untrue.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, refers to the Reynolds case and sets out extracts from it in appendix 17. That is indeed an important case; it was a libel action brought by Albert Reynolds, the former Taoiseach, against the Sunday Times, which had made serious allegations against him about the performance of his duties. That case was decided in your Lordships' House by a 3:2 majority on the actual facts, but there was broad agreement on the principle. The principle was that where, on an issue of public importance, a newspaper or broadcaster makes defamatory allegations of fact that cannot be proved to be true, in some circumstances, it is still not liable to pay damages for libel. That is the defence of qualified privilege.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para9"></a>What circumstances give rise to that defence must be decided, so the House of Lords said, on a case-by-case basis, but it is summarised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls, at page 202 of the official report of the Reynolds case. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The common law does not seek to set a higher standard than that of responsible journalism".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-08_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40204-08_para11"></a>The extracts in appendix 17 are, I fear, selective. They are passages that concentrate on the need to protect people's reputation, but they do not include passages from the same speeches that hold that a newspaper or broadcaster may have the defence of qualified privilege even where the allegation cannot be shown to be true or is shown to be actually untrue. The passages that I have in mind are those from the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls, reported at pages 202 and 204 of the official report and that from the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hobhouse, that immediately follows the extract cited in appendix 17.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para12"></a>In this case, there is no libel action, but the test for the BBC is the same: was it guilty of irresponsible journalism; not, was it making allegations that have turned out to be untrue? Was it guilty of irresponsible journalism? So far as Andrew Gilligan is concerned, the answer is plainly yes, for reasons set out in the report and repeated by previous speakers.
<P>


<a name="column_719"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 719</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para13"></a>What about Andrew Gilligan's superiors? I am sure that many of your Lordships regularly listen to the "Today" programme. It is live and unscripted, often dealing with up-to-the-minute news. Indeed, those are essential features of the programme. That system can work only if the reporters and presenters on "Today" have a good deal of freedom of action. But the BBC must be able to trust its reporters before it can give them that freedom.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para14"></a>It may be that Gilligan was known to be untrustworthy before 29 May. That is the implication of the e-mail from Kevin Marsh cited at length at paragraph 284 of the report, but that was sent a month after the original broadcast and, unfortunately, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, did not investigate Gilligan's previous record as a reporter. So the case against the BBC is, shall we say, not fully proven by the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para15"></a>The noble and learned Lord's criticisms of how the BBC handled the issue after 29 May are, I fear, clearly justified. But freedom of speech is not to be prejudiced because the BBC made mistakes. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will find an opportunity to clarify what he meant in paragraph 280 and agree that responsible reporting of matters of public importance is protected even if the alleged facts turn out to be untrue.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para16"></a>Nothing can possibly be of higher importance than information on the basis of which the country has gone to war. That may be the view of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. The report does not suggest that Susan Watts acted improperly in broadcasting what Dr Kelly said, even though the noble and learned Lord concluded that those allegations were untrue. It is clear that Susan Watts acted entirely properly and nobody at any stage has suggested anything to the contrary.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para17"></a>The noble and learned Lord cleared the Government of acting improperly in publishing a dossier, even though the allegations about Saddam's possession of chemical and biological weapons, on which the dossier was based, were in all probability wrong. It cannot be right to apply a lower standard to the Government than we apply to the media. The report must not be used to attack the freedom of the media in general, nor of the BBC in particular.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </B>   My Lords, in contributing to this debate I intend to stand back a little from the detail of the Hutton report, important though that is for a better understanding of last year's prolonged agony over the Government's dispute with the BBC and its tragic denouement.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para18"></a>For speed-readers and for those with forensic skills, the temptation to delve deep, to apportion blame and to score political points is almost irresistible. As one who does not qualify under any of these headings, I would rather try to set the events covered by the Hutton report in a wider context and to look for lessons to be learned in a somewhat broader perspective.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para19"></a>There are some important questions to be examined, which go wider than the terms of reference of the report itself and indeed will now fall within the scope <P>


<a name="column_720"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 720</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the new inquiry announced yesterday. How did all those involved in intelligence gathering and analysis&#151;and that includes the UN's own inspectors&#151;come to overestimate the extent of Saddam Hussein's inventories of weapons of mass destruction? And why did Saddam himself not move decisively to extract himself from the predicament in which overwhelming military force was going to be deployed against him?
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para20"></a>It does not seem to me to make much sense now to contest the fact that there was, last year, an overestimation of Saddam Hussein's inventories of weapons of mass destruction, which is not the same thing as saying that there was an overestimate of the danger inherent in his capacity rapidly to reconstitute his earlier programmes and thus of the continuing threat to international peace and security which he represented and of his failure to comply with mandatory Security Council resolutions.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para21"></a>Why did this overestimate occur? Many of the opponents of the war have no hesitation about answering that question, because, they say, the US and the UK deliberately exaggerated the threat and misled their parliaments and people about it. But that rather ignores the fact that the UN and many of the governments who opposed the use of force in March made just the same overestimates.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para22"></a>The difference between the two groups came over the correct response and its timing. Some wanted to give the inspectors more time; others thought that Saddam had had enough time to comply. There is in effect a rather simpler explanation for this overestimate than deliberate duplicity. In 1991, when UN inspectors first gained access to Iraq's WMD programmes, they found that they were far more elaborate and advanced than Western intelligence, before the 1991 war, had ever predicted. Had Saddam Hussein not been so unwise as to invade Kuwait in 1990, he would, by about 1993, have had nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. In 1995 the inspectors discovered, in addition, from the evidence provided by Saddam's luckless sons-in-law, that he had a number of biological weapons programmes, including projects for their weaponisation.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para23"></a>Following such a major series of intelligence failures, which could have had genuinely horrendous consequences, and faced, as they were, with 12 years of systematic Iraqi obfuscation and concealment, is it surprising that intelligence analysts and weapons inspectors were inclined to err on the side of overestimate rather than underestimate?
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para24"></a>Why then did Saddam not make a clean breast of it, open every door and every book to the inspectors and convince them he had nothing to hide? That he did not do so is not in doubt. We have Dr Blix's word for that in a whole series of reports. There is every difference in the world between a government who decide definitively to rid themselves of WMD once and for all and co-operate fully with UN inspectors&#151;as the South Africans did over their nuclear programme and as we hope Colonel Gaddafi is now beginning to do&#151;and a government like the Iraqi Government who do not. It took little over a year to finish clearing up South <P>


<a name="column_721"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 721</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Africa's nuclear programmes&#151;and they were far more advanced than anyone else's had ever been&#151;and 12 years not to do so in Iraq. Perhaps Saddam will give us an explanation for this conundrum, but I doubt whether anything he says will have any credibility.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para25"></a>Meanwhile, it does not seem likely to be too wide of the mark to speculate that Saddam was simply not prepared to renounce these programmes once and for all; and that he was determined to retain the capability to reconstitute them if and when the international community tired of its efforts to deprive him of them. This hypothesis may, retrospectively, cast doubt on the immediacy of the threat posed; it does not cast doubt on its fundamental reality.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para26"></a>One is surely bound to ask also how much significance it is reasonable to attach to the drafting differences in the British Government's September dossier, over which so much agonising went on at the time and on whose significance the whole dispute between the Government and the BBC was based. Does one seriously believe that the effect of the very slightly more cautious wording originally proffered by the intelligence services would, if it had appeared in the published dossier, have fundamentally altered the conclusions drawn from it, or indeed that it should have done so? I doubt it. After all, two months later, the Security Council&#151;most of whose members, and certainly its permanent members, could hardly be expected to treat British intelligence as Gospel truth&#151;agreed unanimously that Saddam Hussein was in breach of his WMD obligations and faced "serious consequences" if he did not immediately remedy that.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para27"></a>What was a mistake, from which we need to learn, was to impart to a document based almost exclusively on covert intelligence, a degree of certainty which no such document can reasonably sustain. Just as intelligence does not win wars, but only helps you to win them, so intelligence cannot be expected to provide certainty, but merely varying degrees of probability or possibility. That is not a reason to ignore it or to discount it. Quite the contrary. When dealing with a totalitarian dictatorship, it is likely to be the best you are going to get and it may have to be a basis for action.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para28"></a>I now turn to the sequence of events covered in the report of the noble and learned Lord, and it is important to remember at each stage that whereas we now, with the benefit of hindsight, read history looking backwards and knowing much that was not known at the time, decision-makers have to live history moving forwards, ignorant of much that we now know. There are two generic issues of process which merit some comment: the way the media separate, or rather no longer separate, the reporting of news from the commentary and opinions they express on it, and the way the e-mail technological revolution has influenced the transaction of government business. Time was when the separation of news from comment was a fundamental part of the professional credo of journalism. It still is in a very few honourable exceptions, such as the Financial Times and the New York Times. But generally the distinction is now ignored, as are the rigorous checks that used to be required as a necessary preliminary to filing a news story. Clearly in a free society <P>


<a name="column_722"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 722</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>both abundant news and a capacity to comment fearlessly are essential, but mingling the two does no one any good. It reduces the respect and confidence we have in journalism. It reduces the value of the media's contribution to the formation of our opinions. It leads ineluctably to the sort of feud which we have seen played out before our eyes in recent months.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para29"></a>No one can, or should, try to force the media to re-establish a Chinese wall between news and comment, but I would hope that they would reflect on whether it is not in their own best interest to do so. In that respect I was greatly encouraged by the most impressive contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, to our debate.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para30"></a>To lament the omnipresence of e-mail and to attempt to turn back that tide would be about as silly and misconceived as the advice of King Canute's courtiers or the activities of the Luddites. E-mail is here to stay, or at least until it too is superseded by the next wave of technical innovation. What seems to have gone wrong, however, is that this major change has occurred without anyone having given thought to its implications for the conduct of government business, and above all for the essential clarity over lines of authority and responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para31"></a>In the dim and distant past there was, on the one hand, the telephone, which was pervasively used but left no trace unless it was converted into an official document and therefore had no official validity, and, on the other hand, the official written transaction of business, which was regulated by rules and which clearly established lines of authority and responsibility. Into that idyllically clear division plunged e-mail, which was none of those things and falls between every bureaucratic stool. It is recorded, as we are now all too well aware, but is not regulated by any rules of procedure or any discipline. Most dangerously of all, it blurs the lines of authority and responsibility so that Lenin's famous dictum "Who, whom?" becomes rather difficult to construe.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para32"></a>What is surely urgently needed now are clear rules of the road that bring e-mail communications within the ambit of other written communications&#151;not so much a big conversation as a controlled interaction of various policy considerations. Lest I be thought to be a little critical, in particular of No. 10, I should add that I believe that my former department, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and others are every bit as much in need of reform in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para33"></a>It is right that we should debate this report with seriousness and with the intention of drawing lessons from it that will prevent mistakes being repeated in future. But I hope that we will not linger too long over the minutiae and, in some cases, the trivia of what has been uncovered. There is a natural prurience about such matters, which means that we find them endlessly fascinating. But the need to face up to present and future challenges, not least in Iraq, is pressing, and raking over the past is of only limited use in finding the right answers there.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para34"></a>Whatever our views on the origins of the war, there is surely a lot more common ground on the future that we want to help Iraq and its long-suffering people <P>

<A NAME="40204-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. He and I spent four years in Brussels. He has made a vital contribution to this important debate. I am not easily astonished, but I was by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, who claimed that the Thatcher government, which he served with distinction, were guiltless of spin. I am totally astonished at his version of history. Notwithstanding that, I hope that we can remain good friends.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para35"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Desai, has said, when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was appointed, there was not a whimper from the lips of the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats, let alone their leaders. Yet when the decision&#151;and it is reiterated in its terms of reference&#151;emerged, all sorts of slurs encompassed the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, and those acquitted of the death of David Kelly, and many other offences that were germane to them. We have heard it all today.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para36"></a>For eight months the Prime Minister and others had to endure all sorts of calumnies. He was accused of deceit and deception, not least by those who were quick to come alongside him in his denunciation of Saddam Hussein and everything for which he stood. But the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, acquitted the Prime Minister of those grave charges, and because of that neither he nor others were forgiven by those opposed to those views. The dilemma that confronted the Prime Minister was acute. If he did nothing, permitting Saddam Hussein to remain in unquestioned power, but then Hussein used weapons of mass destruction&#151;which the Prime Minister thought in good faith that he had&#151;in the light of the information provided by the intelligence services, it is right that he would have been held culpable.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para37"></a>In all the circumstances, the Conservative Opposition in another place and here have rushed to conclusions utterly out of kilter with their original views. They have been extremely opportunistic, and what is worse, they even realise it themselves. If the Conservatives had done the decent thing, this debate, in so far as it revolved around the issue of the Prime Minister's bad faith, could have been short-circuited.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para38"></a>None the less, some useful lessons can be learnt. First, it would have been preferable if the Prime Minister&#151;who, in my view, has already acted with the utmost good faith&#151;had said that Saddam Hussein posed threats different in quality, and realistically, from any others and, underlining the words of United Nations Resolution 1441, had to be removed in the interest of mankind. That is what I think the Prime Minister believed. Some may think that the Prime Minister might have been wrong. I do not share that view. In all material respects, I believe that he maintained an honest opinion.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para39"></a>Secondly, the mystique of the intelligence services must, in some respects at least, be dispelled. The public, when it is taken to war, is entitled to much more information than it was given. Of course, certain information must be withheld but not most of it. I hope that the new committee will do precisely that.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para40"></a>It is essential that the BBC be objective and independent. It is widely respected nationally and internationally. That is unquestionably the case now, and I believe that it will remain so despite all the criticisms unleashed on the governors. Everything that I have heard from Ministers since the publication of the report underlines that very fact.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para41"></a>What of the immediate future? A delay of perhaps a year or more in the publication of the report would be unconscionable. There is a very good prima facie case for urging that the report be given within a certain time.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para42"></a>The Intelligence and Security Committee, which has produced its report, has done an invaluable task. I do not concur with all its views, but that is inevitable when one considers the breadth of its considerations. Nor can we overlook that precedentedly no publicity had been afforded to the deliberations of the Joint intelligence Committee.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para43"></a>The British Government decided to depart from that and to publish in September 2002 Iraq's weapons of mass destruction&#151;The assessment of the British Government, otherwise known as the dossier. That was unprecedented and should be applauded.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para44"></a>The history of events that led up to UN Security Council Resolution 1441 is well known. But it needs to be emphasised again and again that Iraq did not comply with all its obligations to surrender its weapons of mass destruction capability and its weapons systems. Indeed, that was acknowledged by the Iraqis themselves.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para45"></a>The Prime Minister had no alternative but to ensure that force&#151;regrettable though that may have been&#151;had to be used. The clear fact remains that Saddam Hussein could not be trusted. Chemical and biological weapons existed, albeit hidden, or secreted away by the regime. I cannot help feeling that much of that is attributable to the fact that the United Nations inspectors were there. What has happened since September 2002 does not have to be underlined by me.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para46"></a>The Intelligence and Security Committee has done a wonderful job. It has assessed the information put before it very clearly. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, within the terms of reference, also carried out a thorough task. The Government should be acquitted of the very grave charges that have been hurled unconscionably at them.

<P>

<a name="40204-08_para47"></a>First, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, on his maiden speech, and above all I wish him well in the job that he now has. He is no stranger to difficulties. <P>


<a name="column_725"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>He and I worked closely together between 1992 and 1994. A Chief Whip who got the Maastricht legislation though the House of Commons with the majority that we achieved deserves our respect. I am sure that he will serve the BBC well. I was pleased to hear the reassurances that he gave.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para48"></a>My view of the Hutton report and its conclusions is that the Government have been very fortunate and the BBC very unfortunate. Having read the evidence, like the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, I still find the process whereby Dr Kelly's name was revealed to the press extraordinary. I emphasise that I do not believe that the Government were dishonest in the way in which they handled the matter. It was a question not of conspiracy but competence. One could have tried to keep the name secret, although I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that that would have been difficult to do, and probably impossible. However, if that was the judgment, it is extraordinary that, rather than making an open statement of identity to all the media, and having a properly planned process for protecting Dr Kelly&#151;the two go together&#151;there was an elaborate, and totally unprecedented 20-questions procedure, in which the press was invited on fishing trips to reveal Dr Kelly's identity. That is totally objectionable.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para49"></a>It is extraordinary that important decisions that could have a vital effect on the defence department were taken without the responsible Minister&#151;the Secretary of State for Defence&#151;being present. It is extraordinary, too, that the Secretary of State seems to have adopted a pretty hands-off approach to such a major issue affecting his own department.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para50"></a>If I were the Government, I would not feel very proud of the way in which this tragic case was handled. I would not have responded in quite the aggressive manner in which the Lord Chancellor opened his speech this afternoon. The report has been completed; it has been accepted; and we now have the consequences.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para51"></a>I shall concentrate on the consequences affecting the BBC. We have lost two exceptionally able men: the chairman and the director-general of the BBC. I regret that very much. They were outstanding leaders, and the BBC is very much the loser because of their resignations. We are now told that a line has been drawn and that peace has broken out. There is the danger. The relationship between government&#151;any government, not just this one&#151;and the BBC should never be a peaceful one. Of course the BBC has a duty to be as accurate as possible, but it also has a duty to question government, probe their policies and reveal their errors. The BBC is not an organisation whose duty is to relay the message of the government uncritically. Given some of the comments that have been made from&#151;I regret to say&#151;the Government Benches, that point needs to be emphasised.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para52"></a>I note that Ministers now talk of maintaining and supporting the independence of the BBC. Governments are not the natural supporters of fearless reporting and the independence of the BBC. That is not what governments want. They have never supported that in my time at Westminster, and they never will. In the 1980s <P>


<a name="column_726"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 726</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I remember Margaret Thatcher speaking at a dinner for Cabinet Ministers and their wives at No. 10. She paid tribute to her husband with the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whenever I was tempted to say anything nice about the BBC Denis persuaded me out of it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-08_para53"></a>
That not unfairly encompasses the view of the BBC in No. 10 in the 1980s.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para54"></a>In the 1990s, as party chairman, I remember being at No. 10 with John Major when the unfortunate head of press relations was instructed to ensure that the BBC immediately changed a report of the Prime Minister's speech. It was a hard task given that the BBC had quoted exactly the words that he had used.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para55"></a>The conflict between this Government and the BBC is nothing new, although 16 letters of complaint from No. 10 about the coverage of the Iraq war was not only excessive but clearly counter productive. It explains the BBC's reluctance to correct. I do not disagree with what the noble Lord, Lord Birt, said on that point, but we need to remember the context of a corporation under a continual barrage from No. 10. Perhaps the noble Lord is a better man than most to take that message back to No. 10.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para56"></a>In resisting the pressure of governments, the BBC must be able to establish that its standards of reporting are high. We should remember that, whether in broadcasting or the press, mistakes will be made given the speed of journalism. Even when elaborate precautions are taken, media organisations can get it wrong. Hitler's bogus diaries come to mind. There is a need to guard against journalists or editors hardening up a story beyond its true worth, which seems to be what Mr Gilligan did. He had rather a good story on the doubts about information in the dossier, but he then pushed it several stages too far.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para57"></a>I am concerned about the suggestion that the BBC in future should only report the news rather than at times initiate it. That would be profoundly wrong. My first editor on the Times was William Haley, a former director-general of the BBC. He was perhaps austere, but he was an upright and principled man. His definition of the purpose of any media organisation was that it was there to expose. That is the media's duty. Neither Haley nor I mean exposing the trivia of an affair between a Minister and an actress. I mean exposing issues such as unacceptable hospital conditions, famine in poor countries, and, yes, the deficiencies of government.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para58"></a>Mr Gilligan may have overstated his story but that does not invalidate the process. Programmes such as "Today" must continue to make the news as well as report it. Not to do that leaves it a broken-backed programme without influence or purpose.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para59"></a>Overarching all that is the decision on what kind of BBC we want. Some want a much-reduced BBC; some want it for their own commercial interests. Over the coming months, we will have to judge. The Government, in my view unreasonably, criticised the BBC for its coverage of the Iraq war. The noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, repeated that charge today.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para60"></a>I really wonder whether the Government or the public would prefer the kind of coverage transmitted in the United States. One news channel operated with <P>


<a name="column_727"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 727</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the national flag flying in the corner of the screen and martial music played as troops advanced. Would we prefer that? Or, as in another case, would we want military attacks delayed so that the advancing troops can act as a backdrop to a newscast by an influential correspondent? They both happened in the Iraq conflict.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para61"></a>If one good thing has come out of this sad and tragic affair, it is this. Here, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and I totally disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Desai. The opinion polls show clearly that there is much more support for the kind of BBC we have than some commentators and some politicians believe. As we now enter the period of debate on licence renewal, I think that the public have delivered a clear message to the politicians; that is, proceed with care. Do not tamper irresponsibly with an organisation which some of us still believe is one of the world leaders in broadcasting.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-08_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne: </B>   My Lords, I need to declare an interest before I make a short intervention in this important debate. I serve as rapporteur for Iraq, as WHO's special envoy particularly for that region, and I also serve as chairman of the AMAR International Charitable Foundation. In all of those capacities I have paid many visits to Iraq, to the neighbouring countries and to the region. Inevitably, I have received hospitality of some variant or another from a number of organisations and governments. Wherever I can I try to pay my own way, but I am often offered kindness and hospitality. I hope noble Lords will take that and set it aside from the comments I am about to make.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para62"></a>I support the findings of the Hutton report. I appreciate his work and I pay tribute to him and his staff. However, I ask the Government to look again at the European Convention on Human Rights, which, in 1998, was to act as a lodestar. Of course, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, made the point that accuracy of information is an imperative for the media. But he did not go further and point out that the print media are not covered because the Government are in breach of the relevant article of the ECHR.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para63"></a>The Broadcasting and Television Act 1956 demands a duty of accuracy and a separation of fact and opinion on radio and television. I guess that is what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was thinking of when he referred to the need for accuracy. Alas, it does not cover the print media. I wonder whether noble Lords recall the hounding of Dr Kelly by the print media and the fact that the family had to move house at once when his name was released. They knew that they had to run; they went to a house in Cornwall. Does that kind of thing really give the Kellys the right to privacy and family life in the United Kingdom? I ask the Government to think again and cast their minds back to that important article in the European Convention on Human Rights. Perhaps that might have made a difference.
<P>


<a name="column_728"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para64"></a>As I said, I have paid many visits to Iraq. I should like to voice my personal sorrow on the death of Dr Kelly, whose work was so vital and so important. I regret the fact that he did not receive the Nobel Prize. The work of his team, the work of David Kay, and the continual work of the Iraq Survey Group, under Charles Duelfer, is of great value and importance nationally and internationally. It is of importance to the United Kingdom; it is of importance to the region. We are referring to a regime that assaulted its own people, attacked its neighbours and was preparing to attack outsiders.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para65"></a>In his report, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, referred to the continued controversy and debate surrounding the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But I think that there can be no serious doubt that Saddam Hussein possessed and sought to develop weapons of mass destruction throughout the whole of the 1990s and the early years of the 21st century. Indeed, there is evidence that he was doing so in collaboration with foreign terrorist organisations.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para66"></a>Newly unearthed extensive video evidence that I have received on my latest visit to the region shows collaboration between Saddam Hussein (on video) and a leader of an international terrorist organisation. Masoud Rajavi, leader of the MKO, is shown with Saddam Hussein discussing various actions locally, domestically and internationally. They are shown plotting and money being given in payment for services rendered and in payment for services to be rendered, which are discussed very explicitly. The evidence clearly shows international terrorist organisational work between Saddam Hussein and outside organisations. Another set of videos shows collaboration between international terrorist organisations and the head of the Iraq secret police.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para67"></a>Witness reports from non-Iraqis show descriptions of the transport and concealment of what clearly were non-conventional weapons, the involvement of non-Iraqi Arabs, and, I believe, the involvement of the Taliban as well. I personally have received witness reports that describe the construction, by non-Iraqi Arabs, of secret military facilities, and the burial of what appear to be weapons of mass destruction. I have witness reports confirming republican guard training of non-Iraqi Arabs. There is also evidence of foreign collaboration in the suppression of ethnic minorities&#151;both Kurd and Shi'a. That evidence is clear throughout the 1990s and into the early 21st century.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para68"></a>I have a further request for the Government. It is clear that, certainly across the Atlantic, there was insufficient intelligence on the ground. Would the Government consider more investment in the BBC World Service; for example, in the Arabic and Farsi services? Would the Government consider more investment into the British Council; not a terrorist organisation, not a secret police, but, none the less, a mechanism of understanding different cultures more effectively, and other ways in which the United Kingdom used to be stronger? I recall that investment into the BBC World Service was diminished&#151;under a Conservative government, I am sorry to say&#151;under the last chairman, Sam Younger, now on the Electoral <P>


<a name="column_729"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 729</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commission. I recall fighting that battle very hard and unsuccessfully in the other place. We should put more investment into the BBC World Service, in particular into the services in this very troubled region.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para69"></a>I do not think that the Government went to war because of weapons of mass destruction. If I recall correctly, we went to war because Saddam Hussein and his regime continued to defy UN conventions. Resolution 1441 rings loudly in my memory. We acted boldly as a nation. I believe that we were right. But the question now is when pre-emptive strikes should be needed. What are the rules? What are the guidelines?
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para70"></a>Last week, in the European Union and the European Parliament, we had Kofi Annan with us. He told us about the special working party that he has set up. He agrees that the role of the United Nations somehow has been marginalised in the present conflict. He does not want that to happen again. Therefore, he has set up a working group. I hope that the British Government will be forward in giving evidence to that working group. It is to attempt to set up the guidelines for when pre-emptive strikes may be needed in the future and could be supported by the United Nations Security Council. The role of the United Nations is vital.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para71"></a>It is a tragedy that the UN is no longer in Iraq because it cannot see the genuine deep-rooted joy and satisfaction of the ordinary Iraqi at being released from the reign of terror of Saddam Hussein. I hope that once the next investigation, under the noble Lord, Lord Butler, is over, perhaps we may return to the question of when is it right to intervene. When is it right to intervene in order to assist others at their time of tragedy? I believe that we did the right thing in Iraq. I hope that colleagues, too, will share that view.

<A NAME="40204-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson, with all her experience on the ground, as it were. I agree with everything she said on the subject of Dr Kelly himself and the contribution which he made.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para72"></a>However, I hope that she will forgive me if I do not follow her into that wider ground and concentrate instead on the report itself. Its central question&#151;and it is a narrow one&#151;is whether the Government knew, or probably knew, that information in the dossier was wrong. Whether the 45-minute claim was in fact wrong is of course a separate question, outside the terms of reference of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, which will now be addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Butler. However, there is a third question which may or may not be answered by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, depending on how one construes his terms of reference, about which we will probably hear later. I do not find the terms of reference even to be grammatical. They seem to contain too many "betweens", but no doubt all will be explained in due course.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para73"></a>Whether the noble Lord, Lord Butler, covers that point or not, I hope that we in this House will not forget the fundamental question, which is whether the <P>


<a name="column_730"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 730</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government made the right judgment at the time. In that respect, I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. That question should be the subject of continuous debate in this House and can be the subject of debate now. We do not have to wait until the noble Lord, Lord Butler, has reported.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para74"></a>On the central question of whether the Government probably knew that the 45-minute claim was wrong, it is now quite clear that they did not. Nobody really suggests that they did. A further question was rightly raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, about the position of John Scarlett, against whom also a very serious accusation was made; namely, that he allowed an allegation to be put into a JIC document which he knew not to be true or to be unjustified. That was another serious allegation and, again, we all now know that nothing was put in the dossier with which the JIC did not fully agree.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para75"></a>There are of course other questions on which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, might have reached a different conclusion. He might have done so in particular on the naming of Dr Kelly or the manner in which his name was mentioned. We now know that that was the point on which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, changed his mind. At first, he thought there was some ground for criticism, but in the end, he decided there was not. His view was that once Dr Kelly had written his letter of 30 June, his name would be bound in the end to be revealed. Whether it was revealed in the most satisfactory way is another question on which different views might be taken.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para76"></a>However, on the central question of whether the Government were dishonest in what they put into the report, I like many others have read all the evidence. On that evidence, there is no conclusion to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, could have come other than that the Government did not lie.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para77"></a>What was the defence which the BBC put forward? That is set out fully in paragraphs 276 and 289. There were three grounds for its defence. All were addressed in the important maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, and echoed in the equally important speech of the noble Lord, Lord Birt. In view of what they said, the matters can be dealt with very briefly. First, it was said that Mr Gilligan was reporting only what his source had told him. The trouble with that defence is that that was not the case. He was not just reporting what he had been told; he was adding his own conclusions. That conclusion led to the grave allegation against the Government. Secondly, it was said that even if Mr Gilligan was wrong, it was early in the morning; it was off the cuff; it was unscripted; and he should be forgiven. Perhaps Mr Gilligan should be forgiven, but far less forgivable was the subsequent treatment of his report by the BBC. On 26 June, Mr Alastair Campbell asked the BBC directly whether it stood behind the allegation which had been made. On the following day, Mr Sambrook, on behalf of the BBC, replied with the simple word "yes". I accept that Mr Sambrook may have been driven mad by Mr Alastair Campbell. But it is extraordinary that Mr Sambrook could have written the sentence which one finds at the bottom of page 697 <P>


<a name="column_731"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 731</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>without even troubling to look at the original note that Mr Gilligan had kept. In that, there was no reference at all to the 45-minute point.
<P>

<a name="40204-08_para78"></a>The BBC's third line of defence was that it was entitled to say what it said in the interests of press freedom. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made that point and seemed to be saying that the BBC should be allowed make false allegations that impugn the integrity of others, especially of politicians, in the interests of press freedom. I entirely disagree with the noble Lord's claim that that is in accordance with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. We will not argue a question of law now. I shall simply wait&#151;

I agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said on that subject. The tone of the press is so different from that of six months ago. Then it was roses, roses all the way as far as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was concerned. He was a wise and upright judge, a second Daniel come to judgment, who was going to give Alastair Campbell a bloody nose and the sooner the better. The great misfortune of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was that he reached a conclusion that was the exact opposite of what the press were hoping for. Articles were then written. I shall not refer to the article of my noble friend Lord Rees-Mogg, but I shall refer specifically to an article in the Spectator by Rod Liddle and to another article by Sir Max Hastings, in the Daily Mail, ridiculing the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. Those articles of course make good copy. But sometimes I wonder whether journalists realise the harm they cause and the damage they do&#151;not only to the object of their derision, not only to the people who read and perhaps believe what they are told by the papers, but to the profession which they themselves follow.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para1"></a>It is that kind of article, that kind of allegation, that the whole report was a whitewash, which brings journalism into even greater contempt than politics. If anyone doubts that or thinks it is just the view of a judge and not that of a journalist, then I suggest they read a perceptive article by Mr Martin Kettle in yesterday's Guardian on the central question that the judge could not have reached any other conclusion. To call it a whitewash is not proper journalism.

<FONT SIZE=3>past president of the MCC, rather naturally I subscribe to that view. Indeed, with one so eminent as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, we have little option. Within his limited remit covering the circumstances of Dr Kelly's death, his findings should be generally accepted and appropriate retractions and apologies made. In the case of the governors of the BBC, they have been.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para2"></a>The fact remains, however, that because of what eventually went into that dossier on so-called "weapons of mass destruction", what was left out, and even more how it was interpreted and subsequently presented to Parliament and elsewhere, not least by implying that the possible 45-minute warning for small battlefield weapons was somehow equally relevant to long-range strategic ones, the British people were left with the distinct impression that the threat from Iraq to this county was infinitely more massive, imminent and alarming than it has since turned out to be or, probably now, ever had been.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para3"></a>We know that the Government were determined to strengthen the dossier to the limit that the Joint Intelligence Committee would accept. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has confirmed this, finding no impropriety in such action. But I suggest that, not surprisingly, the Government wanted to do just this because the other justifications or excuses for invading Iraq would not have been readily acceptable to Parliament, the country and to many eminent lawyers. I refer, of course, to the longstanding series of United Nations resolutions, including Resolution 1441, to which the Government later resorted as the prime explanation for war and perhaps more compelling, if less advertised, to the fact that America was going to war come what may. The view could be strongly held that it would be in our own national interest to be alongside, rather than outside, like the French. Neither of those justifications, whatever their validity, embrace the essential element of totally lawful self-defence on which most of the country wished to be reassured.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para4"></a>So the question remains in the wider context, outside the remit of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. Taking into account all the factors: the national interest, the pre-eminence of Parliament and even some political expediency, we must ask whether the Government's determination first to strengthen the raw intelligence when so many in the know had serious doubts, in particular about the likely offensive use of such weapons, and then by implication to misrepresent its significance in relation to strategic weapons, all in order to mobilise public opinion behind an attack to which this country may already have been committed, now opens the Government to the kind of criticism and censure which within the narrow remit of the Hutton report they have so far avoided. On this, I believe that the jury is still out.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para5"></a>Although it would be nice to think that the new inquiry under my noble friend Lord Butler of Brockwell might throw some penetrating light on these very things, I fear that unless we are given real assurances by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor about his committee's terms of reference, it <P>


<a name="column_733"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 733</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may turn out yet again to be far too limited. Let us be in no doubt about this. Although evaluation would have taken place in the JIC, the interpretation was for Ministers above it.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para6"></a>Finally, having made these accusations, I have to recognise that ultimately, in the real and harsh world, any historical judgment on whether we were right to invade Iraq will certainly not be made on the Government keeping on saying that they were right to do so, nor even on whether the country was taken to war under false pretences, which it may well have been, but on what happens in Iraq and the Middle East over the next one, two or even more years, and the effect that will have on our national interest and on international stability. On that, I believe it is still far too early to make a judgment.

<A NAME="40204-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, it is a privilege to follow the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. The happiest compliment I can pay him is to quote another earlier Field Marshal at the conclusion of my speech.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para7"></a>Two days after the Hutton report came out I was telephoned by a Sunday paper seeking my comments on the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, as a man. I explained that although I had met him on a series of occasions in Northern Ireland, he and I had, whether consciously or unconsciously, kept a general distance from each other in our respective offices, perhaps to underline the distinction between executive and judiciary in the Province. I greatly admire him, not least for 30 years' steadfastness during the Troubles and, as a man with three-eighths' Ulster blood, I take particular pride in the speed with which this careful and comprehensive report has been produced. Of the latter quality I give a tiny example.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para8"></a>In a minute from Sir Kevin Tebbit to Mr Hoon set out in paragraph 87, there is in sub-paragraph (3) a small and no doubt inadvertent but substantial slip of the metaphorical pen which brings the reader up short. In sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 430, that error is discreetly corrected without attention being drawn to it in the noble and learned Lord's own conclusions. It is a de minimis point, but it illustrates that the narrative was a real-time narrative and how, in the midst of such fast-moving events even Homer, in the form of a Permanent Secretary, can nod.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para9"></a>My overriding sense of the events described is of a Greek tragedy unfolding with a single individual the ultimate victim, as the title of the report spells out. As in Hardy's poem, "The Convergence of the Twain", subtitled "(Lines on the Loss of the 'Titanic')", one senses the Government and the BBC moving inexorably towards collision, with a single man crushed by this occurrence.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para10"></a>In terms of what has happened since the report, leading up to yesterday's announcement of a new inquiry, your Lordships' House must have felt for the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&#151;as I infer the Lord Chancellor prefers to be known&#151;when his <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>weekend remarks on not holding a new inquiry were so rapidly overtaken by an absolutely contradictory development. But there was about the truisms he used at the weekend an echo of the Greek chorus in just such an Aeschylean drama. Although mighty forces were patently at work, the opposing human parts were played by Mr Campbell and Mr Dyke, both men of an unyielding disposition. The fact that in the end Mr Campbell was in narrow terms victorious had itself a Hardyesque resonance, for the final verse of the "Titanic" poem reads,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Till the Spinner of the Years"&#151;

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Said 'Now!' and each one hears
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para12"></a> And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres".
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para13"></a>Yet victory unqualified is the wrong phrase, however much the Government initially forgot the wisdom of Slim's wartime aphorism that no news is ever as good or as bad as it first appears. If top-up fees were a Pyrrhic victory on Tuesday, the ghost of Pyrrhus was also present on Wednesday. I do not know whether Lady Bracknell knew who Pyrrhus was, but she was arguably the first observer to recognise the importance of handbags in public affairs. She would certainly have commented on this 24-hour conjuncture.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para14"></a>Pyrrhic the Hutton report is because the BBC, like our Armed Forces, is one of our international jewels. The Government cannot have helped noticing, as some of my noble friends have quoted, in Thursday's Evening Standard that even in the light of the Hutton report the Government fell far below the BBC in public opinion reactions to the terms of the verdicts of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para15"></a>Those in the BBC who have fallen on their swords have made it much easier for the BBC to reassert itself, as my noble friend Lord Carrington's heroic resignation did similar service for the then-Government in the aftermath of the invasion of the Falklands. But it remains essential that the prompt announcement made about BBC succession on Monday is swiftly followed up by actions and outcomes, as the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, encouragingly confirmed in his admirable speech.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para16"></a>My concentration on the collision should not ignore the individual victim. Because the verdict of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, on the BBC has suggested leniency elsewhere, it is necessary to draw attention to his excoriating judgment, in what I shall neutrally call "judicial language", between paragraphs 430 and 439 on what Mr Hoon described as,

<a name="40204-09_para18"></a>If I may be personal, twice when I was a Minister I felt alone in public through my own actions. I acknowledge that I never felt remotely suicidal, but my weathering the storm was immensely assisted by the unwavering support of direct colleagues. I can imagine how much worse it would have been, despite the identification of mitigating circumstances by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, if my sense of <P>


<a name="column_735"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 735</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>loneliness had been increased by feeling, as Dr Kelly clearly did, that my direct colleagues were not doing everything they could to sustain me.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para19"></a>Now we are to have a further inquiry, never envisaged last summer, sprung on us when all the auspices pointed elsewhere, as the Government, for all the conventional mantras about issues being constantly kept under review, must themselves be feeling. International policy in this administration is exemplified by Longfellow's banner with a strange device, which bore the word "Excelsior"&#151;to which the Government have added as the first subtitle, "What works", and as a further one, "What Tony wants"; of which there is an echo in paragraph 228 sub-paragraph 7 of the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para20"></a>There is, no doubt, a further subtitle still, in invisible thread, adding the smaller words, "What George wants", but then to be fair a similar Longfellow banner in the United States might also include in invisible thread&#151;but in tiny letters&#151;the same thought: "What Tony wants".
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para21"></a>I spoke of the BBC in the same breath as the Armed Forces, for which in such debates universal praise is expressed. Oral orders in the heat of battle do not often come down through history to us, but I quote in conclusion two orders given by that fine fighting solder Sir Colin Campbell&#151;the name is a coincidence&#151;later a field marshal, in a three-year period. First, at Balaclava:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"93rd! 93rd! Damn all that eagerness";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para22"></a>
and, secondly, at Lucknow:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Lie down, 93rd! Lie down! Every man of you is worth his weight in gold to England today".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para23"></a><P>

<a name="40204-09_para24"></a>Against the e-mails that the Hutton report revealed, such admirable consistency and clarity of policy&#151;and indeed of purpose&#151;as that of this other Campbell would serve the Government well.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, I wish to concentrate entirely on the relations between the Government and the BBC in the light of the Hutton report and particularly on the report's impact on the future of the BBC. I should perhaps declare an interest as a former chairman and present pensioner of the regulatory body of commercial broadcasting in this country as well as the father of a member of the BBC's board of management.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para25"></a>I am particularly happy in concentrating on the BBC to follow the excellent maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder. He did a service to the House by taking the courageous decision to make his maiden speech at this belated stage in the present circumstances. I found great value in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, who brought to our debate his experience as a great director-general of the BBC. Perhaps some of the BBC's problems in the present situation would have been avoided if it had been able to stick to his famous exposition of broadcasting as a mission to explain; a mission to report the news rather than to make the news.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para26"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, presided with Olympian distinction and clarity over what amounts to a bitter dispute between two of the nation's <P>


<a name="column_736"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 736</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>major institutions: Her Majesty's present Government and the BBC. As it turns out, the balance of his magisterial report leaves the main body of criticism at the BBC's door. Certainly the Gilligan story is an unhappy one, as the noble Lord, Lord Birt, made clear.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para27"></a>However, it is unfair that the totality of the BBC&#151;to use one of the Prime Minister's recent favourite words&#151;should be judged by this particular aberration. The Government and the BBC should realise that great damage has been done to them both by this recent chapter of events. For the nation as a whole, the trust in two of our most important institutions has been seriously damaged and the sooner a line is drawn by both politicians and broadcasters the better.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para28"></a>I therefore welcome the Secretary of State's assurance the other day that this episode does not change the Government's view of the importance of preserving the BBC's independence in the forthcoming charter review. I was glad to hear the Minister on the Front Bench repeat a Statement the other day setting out the careful arrangements for approving the new chairman of the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para29"></a>It is a recognition that when all passion is spent, the BBC, warts and all&#151;and it has a fair share of warts&#151;is a uniquely valuable national asset. In that tired cliche, it is one of the rare British institutions that is undoubtedly regarded as world-class and does us credit all around the world. Its contribution to the quality of civilised life stretches far beyond the inevitably controversial frailties of current affairs into education, music, sports and all the creative arts. It is the benchmark for the nation's standard in public service broadcasting and indeed for other broadcasters in the country. Compared to the pay-TV subscriptions that I happily now pay to enjoy sports and films, the BBC licence fee&#151;leaving aside the fact that I now receive it for free as an elderly pensioner&#151;remains extraordinary value for money.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para30"></a>The Hutton report may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the BBC if it is able to work with the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, and his ultimate successor, and Mark Byford, whom we all wish well, to deal with some of the consequences of recent events. They should help it to concentrate on sustaining its unique qualities in the multinational world of telecommunications now regulated by Ofcom. In my view, the key area for necessary changes lies in the role of the BBC board of governors in relation to the BBC's programme makers. The first task for the new chairman must be to equip the board of governors to be a more effective regulator and public trustee in the interests of the listeners and viewers. The BBC board of governors has the difficult dual role of being the public regulator, on the one hand, and being the non-executive directors of a huge creative enterprise, on the other.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para31"></a>It is a demanding role but not an impossible one. It is infinitely better than the alternative of transferring the public trustee role to a new and untried Ofcom, most of the regulatory responsibilities of which lie in the field of commercial competition. In any event, Ofcom will have quite a difficult time over the next few years in settling <P>


<a name="column_737"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 737</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>down to its wide range of responsibilities. As the legendary left winger Jimmy Maxton once said about parliamentary and governmental affairs:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If you can't ride two horses at the same time in this circus you'd better get out of the bloody ring".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para32"></a>
That is the advice that I would pass on, in all modesty, to the governors of the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para33"></a>The Hutton evidence reveals the dilemma very clearly. On page 211, one of the inquiry's barristers said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"surely the problem here was that the Governors did in fact duplicate what the executives had done instead of forming a view of their own which, if they had been properly informed, might have been very different".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para34"></a>
It was on that basis that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, concluded that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Governors are to be criticised for failing to make more detailed investigations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para35"></a><P>

<a name="40204-09_para36"></a>But the Governors were ill provided to make any independent investigations of their own. The lesson is that under the new charter they should be equipped with their own distinct unit that will enable them to establish the public interest independently when the need arises. That would be to adapt the framework that I enjoyed as chairman of the old IBA, where we were proud of the creative work of the companies that held our franchises but we were at arm's length from them when something went wrong and we had to adjudicate on matters such as these. That model could be usefully explored.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para37"></a>I believe that Gavyn Davies was a chairman of quality and integrity who found himself, with his fellow governors, stranded between the bullying harassment of Alastair Campbell and the opportunistic reporting of Andrew Gilligan. In a vivid phrase in his own evidence, at page 211, Mr Davies said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a gap between what the Board is and does and what the management is and does".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para38"></a>
The infant Ofcom cannot fill that gap, certainly without undermining the coherent character of the BBC that has served Britain well over so many generations. It will be for Gavyn Davies's successor to reshape this aspect of the governors' role to preserve the BBC as the world's most trusted broadcasting organisation.

<A NAME="40204-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Goudie: </B>   My Lords, following the tragic death of Dr David Kelly, and given its circumstances, there was strong pressure for a public inquiry to be set up and for it to be conducted by a senior judge. Her Majesty's Government acted with the utmost speed. They immediately set up a public inquiry and invited a very senior and highly distinguished judge to conduct it. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, accepted the invitation.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para39"></a>I do not recall any clamour that there should not have been an inquiry; I do not recall any clamour that it should not have been a judicial inquiry; I certainly do not recall criticism of the choice of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para40"></a>We then had the judicial inquiry process in the full glare of publicity. The nation was at one in being highly impressed by the way in which it was conducted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, and rightly so.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para41"></a>We now have had the independent, impartial, meticulous and careful report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. The umpire has given his ruling. Imagine the uproar that there would have been if he had put his finger up when the Prime Minister, or the Secretary of State for Defence, or the No. 10 director of communications had been at the crease and they had not walked. They would have been expected to respect his verdict. Others should do so too.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para42"></a>However, within hours of the publication of the more than 300 pages of closely reasoned report, criticisms of it were being expressed. The criticisms amount to little more than the fact that a judicial approach of rigorous analysis was adopted. What on earth else was or should have been expected, except by those for whom nothing less than a witch hunt would do? I wonder how many of those who reacted to the approach of opinion pollsters had actually read the report when they did so. By contrast, among those who have read the sound and balanced report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, and who did not have preconceived views of what the outcome should have been, I have not detected any serious criticism.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para43"></a>For my part, I did have some reservations about there being an inquiry at all and, if there was to be an inquiry, some reservations about it being conducted by a judge. I often have such reservations. I suspect that we have too many inquiries. And I do have a real general concern about politicians asking judges to conduct politically sensitive inquiries and judges agreeing to do so. Certainly it was necessary for the Secretary of State to draw up tight terms of reference, and it would be wholly inappropriate for a judge then to be expected or entitled to broaden them.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para44"></a>In the present kind of situation there is an acceptable alternative&#151;it is what would have happened in any event&#151;a coroner's inquest, possibly with a jury. If there are perceived to be weaknesses in such a process, then the law relating to inquests should be reformed. If it is felt that some inquests require a more high-powered judicial input, then the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, or the Attorney-General, or the Lord Chief Justice should have the power to appoint a High Court judge or a special coroner. If, however, there are wider political issues which are not suitable for an inquest, then they are not likely to be appropriate for a judge at all.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para45"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, as a judge, was given a task. He accepted the burden. He has discharged his role with the utmost skill. We should be grateful to him. We should accept his conclusions and let the sniping cease.

<A NAME="40204-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Haskins: </B>   My Lords, I should like to raise the issue of trust. I fear that most of us would have to agree <P>


<a name="column_739"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 739</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, for a variety of reasons, the public's regard for the Houses of Parliament and for those who play a prominent role in public life has seldom been lower. While we can argue among ourselves about the rights and wrongs of the Iraqi war, we need to recognise, sadly, that the public have a deep suspicion of the Government's position and, even more sadly, near contempt for the position of the main opposition party. Bizarrely, despite its many mistakes, the public credibility of the BBC remains much higher than both. I have every confidence that the BBC will be able to weather this storm.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para46"></a>The public are no longer as impressed as they might have been in bygone deferential days by inquiries led by senior judges and senior civil servants because they believe, rightly or wrongly, that this is merely a process to enable the establishment to close ranks. It seems to me that the American approach to its inquiry is both more transparent and comprehensive than is envisaged for here, which is a pity.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para47"></a>The two inquiries will be taking place during the run-up to two general elections. If the present level of public cynicism in this country does not abate&#151;and at present I can see no reason why it should&#151;we might see a turn-out on polling day far below the abysmal 60 per cent of 2001. The cynics may argue that the Government do not care very much about this as long as they are returned to power, which is very likely at the present time. But we must remind ourselves of what happened in France last year when public cynicism led to a low turn-out and the Le Pen catastrophe. Of course I am not suggesting that a disaster of that kind could happen in Britain but, in very low turn-outs, extremists who can muster their support stand to gain.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para48"></a>The Government may rightly feel that much of this general cynicism is both unfair and nasty. They have not been given full credit by the press for the most successful period of sustained growth for more than a century; nor is there a proper recognition that, as a result of unprecedented levels of investment, most of our public services are at last beginning to show a real improvement; and Northern Ireland is enjoying peace, albeit uneasily.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para49"></a>It seems a tragedy therefore that the Government, and their supporters such as myself, find ourselves so lacking in public confidence. This is not helped of course by a vitriolic tabloid press which seeks, it appears, to usurp the role of the official Opposition.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para50"></a>If we cannot tackle that public malaise&#151;a combination of J.K. Galbraith's slothful culture of contentment and a deep disaffection with government and Parliament&#151;we are heading into dangerous and uncharted waters. When respect for democratic institutions becomes undermined, so do democratic values of tolerance and social justice.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para51"></a>The Profumo affair 40 years ago, culminating in the now much-discredited Denning report, did great damage to the public's perception of the establishment. But then the issues at stake were trivial compared with the subject of our discussions today. There was a credible opposition in Parliament to provide the public with an alternative&#151;<P>


<a name="column_740"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 740</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that does not appear to be the case today. I believe that it is unlikely that the public will abandon their cynicism and distrust on the issue of the war after all the inquiries have run their course.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para52"></a>However, there is one issue that can restore some degree of public confidence and which cannot await the outcome of the inquiries&#151;the achievement of peace and stability in Iraq. For that to happen, the Americans, the British Government and our partners in the European Union must stand together and involve the United Nations as the only institution that has the ability and the trust of the world and the people of Iraq to deliver that outcome. The British Government must lead the way in persuading our American friends that their ambivalence and shabby treatment of the United Nations is no longer acceptable.

<A NAME="40204-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Alexander of Weedon: </B>   My Lords, like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, one of my predecessors as president of the MCC, I am not in favour of challenging the decision of the umpire, whether with or without the aid of an action replay. The task of a judge at a public inquiry is lonely and difficult. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, conducted his hearings splendidly and sensitively. In considering his conclusions we should all remember that he had the advantage of assessing the witnesses and weighing all of the evidence. I share the relief at his view that the Government did not seek the inclusion in the dossier of intelligence material which was known to be false. That conclusion seems to me to be fully justified, as it does to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, on the evidence.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para53"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, did a service in finding the facts, which I would like to return to and I do not think have yet been fully appreciated. I have some concerns about the balance of the report. The BBC made mistakes and they have paid a high price. But they were put under enormous pressure by Alastair Campbell, who the Prime Minister himself has publicly described as "rough and tough". To me that seems to justify Mr Greg Dyke's remarks that it was bullying conduct. Am I alone in thinking that the days when the type of dealings that Mr Alastair Campbell had near the head of government were conducted by senior permanent civil servants were healthier days that should be renewed?
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para54"></a>I want to say how much I admire the BBC for so much of its journalism. I am glad that it was prepared to probe so rigorously the case made by the Government for leading us into what so many of us consider to have been an unnecessary and costly war of choice. Throughout, my own party was very largely fully supportive of the Government. That made it more important that the media, and especially the BBC, should join the Liberal Democrats, so wonderfully led by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, in redressing the democratic deficit by making certain that the doubts were heard. I am also glad that Tessa Jowell, over the past few days, has steadfastly said that she will uphold the independence of the BBC and, as I <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>understand it, continue the case for strong public funding. I share the view that it is vital to us as part of our democracy.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para55"></a>For me the central problem flows from the narrow remit of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. He pointed that out. He records with deadly precision some of the material which would have remained buried and out of sight but for his inquiry. I found the way in which he set out some changes in the draft dossiers in September 2002 particularly cogent. On 16 September the dossier told us that Saddam,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is prepared to use nuclear and biological weapons if he believes his regime is under threat".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para56"></a>
By the draft of 20 September that assertion had been queried by Number 10 and the proviso that the regime would have to be under threat had disappeared. The distinction between aggressive use and defensive use had become blurred.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para57"></a>I shall also give another illustration by reference to the first draft of the foreword by the Prime Minister, which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, remarked upon, and which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, drew attention to this afternoon. It included the statement:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The case I make is not that Saddam could launch a nuclear attack on London or another part of the UK. (He could not)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para58"></a>
That was deleted from the final dossier. We were left with the repeated claim that Saddam could launch an attack within 45 minutes. Why? The Prime Minister, as a lawyer, should know that the suppression of the truth risks creating the impression of a falsehood. There was no mention at all that battlefield weapons were what the dossier had in mind. Why?
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para59"></a>I have spent time on that claim because I believe that it was crucially alarmist and influential. I vividly remember how it was understood and reported. The Evening Standard said simply,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"45 minutes from attack".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-09_para60"></a>
The Government knew that that impression gained wide currency. But what did they do to correct a misunderstanding of their own creation? Nothing. Why? That over-dramatic, over-hyped claim had become crucial in trying to shift a deeply divided nation in favour of the war. It was of a piece with the desperation of the effort to persuade people in early 2003 with the infamous and irresponsible "dodgy dossier".
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para61"></a>The scepticism is greater now that an extensive search has discovered no weapons of mass destruction. Yet no one who read the reports of Hans Blix back in February last year should be surprised. He made it plain that the jury was still out and that he needed more time. But the Government ignored him and abandoned their long-standing commitments to the United Nations and followed the lead of the United States into war.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para62"></a>Against that background, I would find it deeply disappointing and unwise if the new inquiry, so hastily set up yesterday, focused only on the accuracy of the intelligence material and where it seems to have gone astray. The Government seem not to appreciate that <P>


<a name="column_742"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 742</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public disquiet goes much wider than that. Many share the suspicions, which Clare Short and Robin Cook have voiced, that we too slavishly followed the lead of the United States. It is the greatest crisis of confidence in the handling of issues of war and peace since Suez.
<P>

<a name="40204-09_para63"></a>Any inquiry should take account of the advice that the Government received as to the legality of the war in international law. My concern was reinforced yesterday when the Government argued that war was justified for breach of Resolution 1441. But in international law the right to use force is a last resort and has to be unequivocally spelled out. Resolution 1441 did not do that. That is why the Government wanted a second resolution, until they realised that it would not pass. The Attorney-General then published a summary of his advice in which he based the ultimate authority for war on UN Resolution 678, passed in 1990, to authorise the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Yet both President Bush senior and Mr John Major publicly stated that this resolution would not have justified them in going to Baghdad. The suggestion that it somehow allowed an invasion for a different purpose 12 years later has been rejected by almost all international lawyers. It is widely believed that Elizabeth Wilmshurst, a very senior Foreign Office legal adviser, resigned because she disagreed. Yet the Government persistently refuse all requests for disclosure of the Attorney-General's full advice. We are apparently entitled to his "view" but not to his "advice", a distinction which seems incomprehensible to me. The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, has described his view as "straining at a gnat" and for what it is worth I have characterised it as "risible". In his advice, the Attorney-General would have needed to deal with some formidable objections to his view and his advice should at long last be disclosed to the inquiry. There are clear precedents for the Attorney-General's advice to be disclosed to official inquiries.

<a name="40204-10_para0"></a>The clamour for a full inquiry was growing before President Bush gave Mr Blair no option but to follow his lead once again. The substantial plus of this war has been the removal of Saddam, but this was not its aim. Twenty thousand lives have been lost. Iraq is far from being the democratic empire of liberty which President Bush grandiosely promised. WMD have not been found.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, has made a formidable case against the legal justification for going to war. In that sense, he has taken the issue beyond the particular inquiry into the Hutton report. One part of it which is relevant is how far there was at the time any justification in the Government's mind for believing in the weapons of mass destruction. I want first to address that background.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para1"></a>Why did people believe that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction? I commend to noble Lords an article in the current Atlantic Monthly by Kenneth Pollack, a leading Iraq expert and intelligence analyst in the Clinton Administration. The article is reproduced in today's Guardian, and it explains why government and security advisers believed that there were weapons of mass destruction. It puts them in perhaps a slightly more favourable light than the noble Lord, Lord Alexander, suggested.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para2"></a>Mr Pollack describes how in the spring of 2002, 20 former UNSCOM inspectors gathered together and all agreed that Saddam was operating a secret centrifuge plant for separating nuclear fuel. That was the view of all 20 former UNSCOM inspectors.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para3"></a>Before the inspectors went back to Iraq, the intelligence services of Russia, China, Israel, Germany and France as well as Britain agreed with the prevailing view which the Americans had expressed. In fact, President Chirac referred to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as late as February this year. The Germans, who opposed the invasion, were the most fearful and they argued that Iraq might be able to build a nuclear weapon within three years.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para4"></a>All those secret services had been seared by experiences after the first Gulf War. Before the war, it was widely believed that Iraq was five to 10 years from acquiring nuclear weapons. Instead, they found in 1991 that Iraq could have had them within only six months to two years. After that, they found a continuous record of deception and an apparent determination to produce weapons of mass destruction.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para5"></a>Everyone got it wrong. David Kay got it wrong. David Kelly, too, got it wrong. I did not believe the claim about weapons of mass destruction as a reason for going to war. I got it right, but I dare say that if I had been in government and this information had been supplied to me, I, too, might have believed it. Why they got it wrong and when they should have realised will no doubt be a matter for the new inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para6"></a>I turn to the Hutton report. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, published the evidence given before him on the web, everyone feels qualified to deliver their own report. A thousand alternative Hutton reports have bloomed. Everyone knows exactly what he should have <P>


<a name="column_744"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 744</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>found, just as everyone knows how wrong the England football team's manager has been in his team selection and in his tactics.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para7"></a>According to recent comments, it now seems that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, is an establishment figure; a government stooge; a narrow-minded lawyer, ignorant of politics; and deeply biased against journalists. As a number of speakers pointed out&#151;the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, was one&#151;that is in contrast with what was said before his report came out. What a fair-minded man he was then; utterly impartial; independent-minded; and meticulous in his approach to evidence. What a good judge he was and how fairly he conducted the hearing.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para8"></a>Indeed, his record as a judge in Northern Ireland speaks for itself. He based his judgments entirely on the evidence. If it meant freeing IRA men, however dangerous, he freed them. Everything suggested that he would go by the evidence, the whole evidence and nothing but the evidence. And that, I believe, is what he did in his inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para9"></a>Let me reveal my prejudices. I start with a prejudice in favour of the BBC. I admired its independent reporting during the war. I deplored Alastair Campbell's tendency to bully it into supporting the government line. I dare say that parts of the report are open to criticism and the noble Lord, Lord Alexander, mentioned some of them. But overall, Hutton's main findings are convincing. At the heart was the charge that the Government published a vitally important document and probably knew that the key statement in it was untrue. It was a very grave charge. The Hutton report said it was unfounded and that the intelligence chiefs approved the statements in the dossier, as modified, and even if some more junior people had their doubts. Since the charge could not have been more serious, the chairman, the director-general and the governors were gravely at fault in not bothering to check it. I can understand that they resented Campbell's bullying tactics, but that was no excuse.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para10"></a>Why, then, has the report been so viciously attacked? I believe it is because people have been told endlessly that Blair is a liar and they were furious that the Hutton report dared to find he was not. People believe all politicians are liars. The Daily Mail, Rory Bremner and even more sensible people like Max Hastings and Jeremy Paxman tell us that they are. Opposition politicians frequently accuse Ministers of lying. Michael Howard accused the Prime Minister of lying and did not have the generosity of spirit to withdraw the charge.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para11"></a>Most of the press were furious because the Hutton report deprived them of their quarry. Shock horror verdict: the Prime Minister did not lie. I am not impressed by the fact that the public did not believe the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. You do not decide complicated issues of the kind that were before the inquiry by opinion poll. I know from my own experience when I was involved in the Hanratty case. I reached the firm conclusion, contrary to my first impression, that the evidence was overwhelming that he was guilty. I went public on that and was abused about it. At one stage I was described as the only <P>


<a name="column_745"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 745</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person left in the whole of Britain who believed that Hanratty was guilty&#151;until the DNA tests were done which showed that my view of the evidence was right.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para12"></a>That is why I am delighted by the Hutton report. Most politicians do not lie, although they are far too ready to call their opponents liars. I may disagree with Tony Blair, but I believe that he is an honest man. Ministers seldom lie. Cases like Suez are the rare exception, not the rule.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para13"></a>Indeed I believe that the outcome of the Hutton report will be highly salutary. The BBC's independence will be safer. In future the Government will be more cautious about trying to bully it into conformity and I trust that the licence fee will be renewed.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para14"></a>I hope that the BBC will be more careful to uphold its traditions of accurate and balanced reporting. Programmes such as "Today" and "Panorama" might be less concerned to promote their own agenda. In fact, "Today" had improved since Rod Liddle went&#151;in good time too&#151;and the Gilligan report was not typical. Perhaps even the press may now place accuracy higher on the list of its priorities.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para15"></a>Finally, although this is a separate matter, perhaps the new director-general of the BBC will remember the words of Lord Reith about its mission:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To apply [broadcasting] to the dissemination of the shoddy, the vulgar and the sensational would be a blasphemy against human nature".

<A NAME="40204-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Weidenfeld: </B>   My Lords, for someone who grew up in central Europe in the age of the dictators and who lived through the Second World War in this country, the idea of overthrowing a tyrannical regime through a coalition of the willing, even by pre-emptive action, would have fulfilled a deep-felt yearning and no sacrifice would have been shirked.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para17"></a>The issues we are debating today, relevant and, indeed, grave as they may be, in my view pale before the conviction, shared by our Prime Minister and the President of the United States, that we are engaged in a total war against a world-wide conspiracy of terror. It is a war against an implacable, merciless enemy and a just war. A war in which the issue of weapons of mass destruction, that may until recently have been in the possession of Saddam Hussein, are but one element and not, as the doubters feel, the overriding cause for war.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para18"></a>Of course, every effort must be made to revisit the findings of our intelligence and the relationship between government and the BBC and the media. However, I plead for a sense of proportion and for the need to achieve that unity, internally and among allies, which, had it been prevalent during the period leading up to the Iraqi war, might conceivably have spared us a military resolution and might still have effected regime change.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para19"></a>The message arising from the testimonies of the two Davids, Dr David Kelly and David Kay, seems to be clear. They thought that the war against Saddam Hussein was justified and, indeed, essential for <P>


<a name="column_746"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 746</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the security of the neighbourhood and the world at large. David Kelly summed it up in a posthumous paper. In his Senate deposition, David Kay revealed that Saddam Hussein's Iraq, in a stage of dissolution and corroding corruption, was an even more dangerous place than we thought.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para20"></a>We must not be blinded by partisan bias, or by bile against the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. George W Bush, after the twin towers tragedy, talked of the "axis of evil". Events have proved that this was not just a figure of speech, let alone a matrix for cabaret turns. However, diverse and divergent in their methods or in their priorities, rogue states, tyrannies and terrorist bands are bound to converge operationally sooner or later in their common quest to harm and harass, demoralise and ultimately destroy, our open society.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para21"></a>In this context, the Hutton inquiry and the relationship between the BBC and government assume considerable significance. If I may once more be permitted to introduce a personal note, I feel that I owe a great debt of gratitude, and possibly the whole direction of my career, to joining the BBC as a twenty year-old journalist on the eve of the war and to having served throughout the war. The high standard of objectivity and accuracy, even in a life and death struggle, was a shining example of journalistic integrity from the top down. However, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, and must regretfully submit that even cursory monitoring of the BBC news reporting of the war in Iraq, of the controversies about that war and of events in the region, lacked integrity and objectivity. The Andrew Gilligan story is by no means the only controversial issue.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para22"></a>That eminent lawyer, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has judged fairly and convincingly. The right honourable gentleman, the Leader of the Opposition in another place, acted, perhaps unwittingly, against the spirit which enjoins a loyal Opposition to show a sense of solidarity in a grave hour of national importance, when facing an existential issue. I hope that the Opposition and the Government will sink their differences and will collaborate in this inquiry into the quality and performance of intelligence.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para23"></a>In conclusion, I hope that all those people, and there are many, who still have great misgivings about the resolve to go to war in Iraq, will pause and reflect upon what would have been the alternative had we allowed Saddam to survive, recover and resume his tyrannical rule, feted as an icon who defied the wicked West, and thirsting for bloody revenge.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Parekh: </B>   My Lords, although it may sound a rather strange thing to say, it is a little too early to comment properly on the Hutton report. So much has been written and said about it, from so many different points of view, that it has become difficult to appreciate the report in all its complexity. We therefore need a little distance in time.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para24"></a>Now that the Government have set up a new inquiry on the gathering and use of intelligence, the findings of the inquiry will shed a new light on the questions that <P>


<a name="column_747"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 747</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, addressed or bracketed out, and it will influence how we shall read his report in a few months' time.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para25"></a>It is in this spirit of caution and tentativeness that I wish to raise two simple, but central, questions. First, why has the report aroused so much controversy and failed to reassure a large section of the British public? Not only the media, but also ordinary men and women, and even professional politicians, remain somewhat sceptical about the report and even use such silly and offensive expressions as "a judicial whitewash". Secondly, and more importantly, where do we go from here? What lessons can and should be learned from the findings of the report and the issues that led up to the inquiry in the first instance? I shall address these two questions in that order.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para26"></a>The report became controversial for two kinds of reasons, some external and some internal. Since the inquiry was conducted in public, everyone had access to the relevant evidence and everyone, naturally, reached their own conclusions. Some sections of the media reached their conclusions before the inquiry started. Since the report's conclusions were rather different from those that most people had come to expect, many felt disappointed, even bitter, and began to suspect an invisible, conspiratorial hand. We generally tend to approach life, especially political life, with the assumption that no party to a dispute is ever entirely innocent. Therefore, we expect a public report to criticise all the parties involved. When that does not happen, our instinctive ideas of fairness, as well as our assumptions about public life, come under strain and we refuse, wrongly, to accept the report. We suspect a whitewash.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para27"></a>In Britain, as well as elsewhere, there is a widespread culture of cynicism about those in power, a culture that has, sadly, been nurtured by the media, with at least some contribution by the politicians themselves. A report that gives the politicians the benefit of the doubt and accepts them as men and women of honour and integrity goes against this cynical grain and becomes a target of cynical distrust. We need to fight this corrosive trend.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para28"></a>While these and other external factors account for the dissatisfaction with the report, there are also internal reasons. Like all reports, the Hutton report is underpinned by certain assumptions that influence the inferences that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, made from a given set of facts and the conclusions that he reached. So far as discovering facts is concerned, he is scrupulous and thoroughly objective. He is right to insist that Andrew Gilligan's early morning broadcast on 29 January was false and utterly misguided and that his subsequent conduct and changes in his testimony, with two different notes of his conversation with Dr Kelly&#151;all these related things&#151;impugned his integrity and made him an unreliable witness.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para29"></a>Everyone should also agree with Hutton's findings that the Prime Minister behaved with impeccable honour, that Gilligan's charges against him were wholly unfounded and silly, and that the BBC should have apologised as soon as the complaint was made.
<P>


<a name="column_748"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 748</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para30"></a>When facts do not speak for themselves so obviously and need to be interpreted, Hutton, I think, slips into a kind of thinking that can be easily misinterpreted. He talks of "subconscious influence" and of "mitigating circumstances". These sorts of expression, by which he negotiates his way from facts to conclusions, are inevitably subjective and vague. Furthermore, since he generally invokes these factors in relation to the Government but rarely in relation to the BBC or even Dr Kelly, some readers of the report might feel that he was somehow applying double standards or not being wholly even-handed. These critics may be wrong, and I think they are in some respects, but the report itself cannot be entirely absolved of all blame. While welcoming the report, especially its exoneration of the Prime Minister and the Government of the charges that were levelled against them, I am not sure that one can defend or endorse all its detailed conclusions.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para31"></a>Hutton assumes that there were only two sides to the dispute&#151;the BBC and the Government&#151;and that Dr Kelly's death had to do with the behaviour of either or both of these institutions. He ignores the role of the media which aggressively hounded Dr Kelly, door-stepped him, chased him everywhere and made him look like a criminal on the run. Professor Hawton, the professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, told the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that the main reason why Dr Kelly could have taken his life had to do with the loss of self-esteem brought about by a number of factors, the most important being his exposure to the media. Dr Kelly was a private person, but even if he were not he would have found it extremely difficult to cope with the treatment that was meted out to him by the aggressive media.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para32"></a>Some criticism of the behaviour of the media was surely needed, because the media do need to find ways of respecting the privacy and vulnerability of people in public life. I can say that with some personal experience. When my own report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain came out it was grossly misrepresented in the Conservative media and I and my fellow commissioners were hounded and pilloried. We went through a crisis of confidence. I can easily imagine how Dr Kelly would have felt when the press pack started to hound him.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para33"></a>Where do we go from here and what are the lessons we can learn? I want to end with two general suggestions. First, the kind of conflict that we saw between the BBC and the Government should be avoided in future. The conflict did no good to the BBC and alienated large sections of the British people from the political process. Rather than take an aggressively confrontational approach, we need to find ways of exercising timely self-restraint and wisdom. Over the past few years many of our major institutions have been losing their legitimacy in the eyes of the British people; for example, the press, the monarchy, Parliament, the political parties and even the police.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para34"></a>Now the BBC is added to the list, and soon it might be our intelligence services. We cannot go on like this. If we did, we would find all of our institutions discredited or de-legitimised in one way or another and our democracy and public life in general would suffer. <P>


<a name="column_749"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 749</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>All of our institutions need to engage in some form of intense introspection on how they are run and how they behave, both within their own organisations and towards each other.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para35"></a>Secondly, with all the good will in the world, the kind of confrontation that we saw between the BBC and the Government is likely to occur in the future, not only between them but also involving other sections of the media. That would inevitably call for some type of sensible resolution. I am not sure that a judicial inquiry headed by a single judge is the best answer because of the inevitable psychological and moral assumptions that every judge brings to his task. Perhaps we could think of a two or three-judge inquiry to cancel each other's biases and to inspire greater public confidence in the findings of the inquiry. One might even wonder whether a judge is always the best person to conduct such inquiries. We might think of senior trusted public figures who would be intimately familiar with both public life and the world of journalism. We might be able to persuade them to head such inquiries. We might even move away from such public inquiries and turn instead to a suitably strengthened Press Complaints Commission.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para36"></a>Whatever we do, our urgent task now should certainly be to reduce the heat and polemics of our public life and restore a climate of sanity and mutual trust between our institutions so that they begin to see themselves as partners in the collective enterprise of restoring public confidence in our political process.

<A NAME="40204-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, referred to the fact that many people feel that the Hutton report was a whitewash. Indeed, over the weekend, I looked at an ITN teletext poll which asked the viewers whether the Hutton report was a whitewash. Of the more than 20,000 who voted, 94 per cent said it was and 6 per cent said it was not. Other polls have shown to varying degrees the same result. However, we should not take it from that that people are criticising Hutton. I believe that people are not criticising him, but were showing instead a complete lack of trust and confidence in government, politicians and our political system as they see it. That is what I think the polls were saying.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para37"></a>At least the Hutton report is seen as a whitewash after the event, unlike the forthcoming inquiry which is seen as a whitewash before the event. While it is not for me to advise the Leader of the Opposition, Michael Howard, I think he ought to take note of what his noble friend Lord King said earlier today and ensure that the terms of reference are completely clear before he continues his support for this new inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para38"></a>Most people to whom I have spoken say that the Government and Ministers have got off scot-free from the Hutton report while the poor BBC and to some extent Dr Kelly have ended up carrying the can. Bearing in mind the very narrow terms of reference, I believe that that was almost inevitable&#151;although I feel bound to say that the noble and learned Lord, <P>


<a name="column_750"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 750</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Hutton, was unnecessarily kind to the Prime Minister and Mr Hoon and particularly kind to Mr Campbell, who as we all know has a reputation as an arrogant bully and who has cast a malignant blight over British politics over the past seven years.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para39"></a>Indeed, what I found most odd and unacceptable in the report was the confirmation that, while Mr Campbell and Downing Street were cleared of sexing up the dossier of 24 September 2002 which contained the 45-minute claim, they did have an input, and some of their suggestions were accepted by Mr Scarlett, who in my view was bound to have felt under pressure to do so. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, clearly believes that such contact between Downing Street and the security and intelligence services is proper. But I am not so sure about that. The duty of the security services is surely to produce accurate information based on reliable intelligence which should be made available to the Prime Minister and which he can accept, reject or question; but surely not ask for alterations, especially if they are titivated for public consumption.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para40"></a>The most disturbing outcome of the Hutton inquiry, however, is the baleful and disproportionate effect that it has had on the BBC, its governors, managers and staff. It was certainly not intended to, but the report has played into the hands of the BBC's enemies, especially those who resent its independence and want to see its wings clipped. Indeed, the Culture Secretary was quick to say that the Hutton report would be taken into account when the BBC's charter came up for renewal in 2006. That must have sent a chill up many spines; it certainly did mine.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para41"></a>Having said that, and as a long-term friend of the BBC and public service broadcasting, which I believe is very good value, I would advise the BBC to have a good look at itself and make some necessary alterations that will help it to retain its support and, indeed, gain more. I am a founder member of Global Britain, which over the past five years through an independent monitoring organisation&#151;Minotaur&#151;has carried out 13 tracking projects of the BBC's output. That research has raised a number of major issues, including that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There appear to be few, if any, internal mechanisms for assessment on a systematic basis&#151;in terms of Charter requirements&#151;of coverage of controversial areas . . .

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-10_para46"></a><P>

<a name="40204-10_para47"></a>There could be various ways of solving those problems, but what must be avoided is putting the BBC under Ofcom or the culture department, or getting rid of the governors altogether. In my view, there should be a few more governors, drawn from a much wider section of the community than at present. It is essential that the governors represent and are seen to represent the owners and customers&#151;the viewers and listeners&#151;and should not simply be there to defend everything that the staff do or wish to do. As the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, said in his excellent maiden speech, it is their BBC if it belongs only to them. The BBC should always remember that.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para48"></a>Although it might be difficult to separate the governors completely from the day-to-day running and administration of the BBC, there is a middle way of ensuring that standards are maintained, by setting up a trust paid for out of the licence fee that would enable the governors to have expert advice from outside the BBC itself.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para49"></a>These are dangerous times for the BBC and freedom of speech generally. I hope that the governors and all those who work for the BBC will take on board criticisms and suggestions made by us and others for a better, more accountable and impartial public service broadcasting organisation.

<A NAME="40204-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I supported the Government in going to war against Saddam Hussein, and I still support that. There has been much talk about whether stocks of WMD will be discovered, but does anyone doubt that they existed and that Saddam used them? How could we doubt that? If at the last minute, after endless ultimatums that he had received from the UN, we and the United States had chickened out of military action, Saddam and his sons would now be torturing and murdering with renewed zest. Most of all, Saddam would have reopened all his plans to develop by any means, including of course biological and chemical weapons, the terrorising and intimidation of his own people and his neighbours. That would have been a major source of growing instability in the Middle East and a very real threat to the safety of this country.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para50"></a>Thousands of lives were lost as a result of the war, but hundreds of thousands of lives were saved because of it. The death of the sons and the capture of Saddam have been major victories in the war against terrorism and indeed against tyranny in all its forms. I hope that it will not be too long before Saddam is brought to trial. The Nuremburg war crimes trials started in November 1945, less than six months after the end of the war. Less than 11 months later, 10 of the worst Nazi war criminals were executed. I suspect that, until Saddam is dead, many in Iraq will not really sleep easily at night.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para51"></a>I accept the findings of the Hutton report. I believe that it was soundly based and disposes of many of the aspersions on the integrity and propriety of the <P>


<a name="column_752"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 752</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government. As we have heard, when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was appointed there was little but praise for his abilities, objectivity and integrity. Now that he has shot the hunters' fox, his report is dismissed.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para52"></a>I have confidence in the independent professionalism of the highest levels of the judiciary. Indeed, it is because I believe that it works so well that I oppose the Government's plans to dismantle the present system. We all know that in politics perception is reality, but I do not believe that the British people perceive our senior judges as either biased or incompetent. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, told us, by rubbishing the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, we rubbish the judiciary. That does not help justice in this country.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para53"></a>The task of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was to give his judgment based on the evidence. However, many people, particularly the media and the Lib Dems, seem to believe that he was merely a judge taking evidence and presenting it to a jury, and that they are the jury to reach a verdict. I reject that interpretation. I do not feel qualified to be a member of that jury. I am by no means sure that I believe that it is really the right moment to have yet another inquiry, whatever its terms of reference. I am reminded of a letter written to the Times in 1958 by AP Herbert, which read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The government, like an elderly hypochondriac, is always asking for a second opinion but never accepts it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-10_para54"></a><P>

<a name="40204-10_para55"></a>Let me turn briefly to the two main findings of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, as I read them. First, it is clear that the person responsible for the tragic death of Dr Kelly was Dr Kelly. For him, the pressure proved intolerable. The noble and learned Lord makes it clear that his suicide was not foreseeable and that Kelly was not an easy man to help.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para56"></a>Secondly, I turn to the BBC. The accusation is not that it misused the two words "sexed up" as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, would have us believe. But the BBC made the most serious allegation that I can imagine, that the Government took the country to war under false pretences. I have watched and listened to the performances of the BBC throughout the Iraq affair and I have observed its constant anti-war agenda. There can be little doubt about its agenda. The techniques that it uses include the prioritisation of news items; any item of bad news on the situation in Iraq, however trivial, is automatically turned into the lead story. That is particularly so on Radio 4 and most of all in their flagship programme "Today", which is listened to by the entire political establishment, under its chief presenter, John Humphreys, who also spells out his personal views in his newspaper column.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para57"></a>The BBC has yet to establish the distinction between a presenter and a commentator, or to show objectivity as a first requirement. I exclude the BBC political editor and most of his assistants from that accusation and I believe that the World Service has maintained its integrity and high standards.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para58"></a>As individuals, we all have the right to an anti-war agenda. The commercial media, whether written or broadcast, has the same right. The BBC does not have <P>


<a name="column_753"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 753</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that right. It is, as the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, said, "our BBC". It is responsible to all the people of this country who support it financially and who are thus shareholders in it. It has, I hope temporarily, failed in a massive way.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para59"></a>I salute Gavyn Davies for his integrity in resigning as chairman. Greg Dyke is another matter. He is said to have shown inspiring leadership. The BBC workers demonstrated their support when the governors, rightly in my view, withdrew their support from him. However, his leadership was of the "happy-clappy" variety and resulted in a breakdown of discipline, amounting almost to anarchy. I am delighted that Mark Byford has taken over. He sounds a good candidate to be a permanent director-general.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para60"></a>I am not prepared to join the pack in savaging the Prime Minister. I do not believe that it is in our national interest to do so. The office that he holds is too important to impugn the integrity of its holder without the clearest evidence. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has acquitted him; I accept his verdict. However, I agree that it may not be the end of the matter. To explain what I mean I shall conclude by quoting from Winston Churchill's tribute in the House of Commons on the death of Neville Chamberlain in November 1940. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not given to human beings, happily for them, for otherwise life would be intolerable, to foresee or to predict to any large extent the unfolding course of events. In one phase men seem to have been right, in another they seem to have been wrong. Then again, a few years later, when the perspective of time has lengthened, all stands in a different setting. There is a new proportion. There is another scale of values. History with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days. What is the worth of all this? The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honour".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 12/11/40; col. 1617.]

<P>
<A NAME="40204-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, comes from a part of the world where pressure, force, the use of violence and profound emotions often serve to inform the truth rather than the facts of the matter. He was used to having to look at the facts of a case in circumstances where, as it would be said in Belfast, "even the dogs in the street knew different".
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para62"></a>It seems to me that when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, considered this matter he said there were a number of questions. Did the unfortunate Dr Kelly take his life? Yes, he did. Was that something that reasonably could have been predicted as the outcome of the various interventions of others at the time? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, said no, it would not be reasonable to assume that of the other people around. That seems reasonable because we know many people in public life are under extraordinary pressure, but this is not the general outcome. Were there other reasons, thoughts and <P>


<a name="column_754"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 754</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matters in Dr Kelly's mind as well? We do not know; we cannot know; and we shall never know. It is difficult enough to know what is going on in anyone's mind when they are alive and able to respond; it is absolutely impossible to know what was in the mind of someone who has passed on. That is a tragedy and clearly there was turmoil, but it is a question that we cannot answer.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para63"></a>The next question is whether there would have been an inquiry without the death of Dr Kelly. It seems to me that the answer is no. If the answer to all those other questions is so obvious, what was the purpose of the inquiry? It seems to me that it was because in such circumstances there is almost immediately a public outcry and a demand to search for the guilty or the responsible party.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para64"></a>When the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, considered the questions, inevitably he would come to the conclusion that some people may be able to be criticised, but that did not necessarily mean that they were guilty of the death of Dr Kelly. What about the demand to find out about guilt? There are other questions in the community that the noble and learned Lord was supposed to answer in some kind of impossible way. The first question for many people in the community is whether the reason that we went to war concerned weapons of mass destruction or something else.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para65"></a>In introducing the debate, the Lord Chancellor said that in his view, undoubtedly the world is a safer place now that we have got rid of Saddam Hussein. That may be his conviction; it may not be an entirely unreasonable conviction, but it is not necessarily one that I share. I do not believe that people who travel around in aeroplanes feel safer; I do not believe that any of us really look at the world now and regard it as a safer place. Of course, some things are better for the people of Iraq, but that was not the claim that was made. It was claimed that this is a safer world. I hope I am wrong, but I fear that it is a less safe world, not because Saddam Hussein should have been allowed to stay, but because of how he was removed. It is not a matter of whether he was in power or not&#151;no reasonable, fair, just person wanted him to remain in power&#151;but the question is how one should get rid of him. The "how" is the problem.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para66"></a>Many people believe that the Prime Minister had decided at an early stage that he was going to get rid of Saddam Hussein and that he was going to get rid of him, if necessary, by force of arms. Weapons of mass destruction was not necessarily the key issue. We have experience in the community of governments not being entirely forthright about their motives for doing things. We have a press whose approach is to assume that any public figure who says anything about anything is doing so for some ulterior motive. The idea that people enter public life with any real integrity&#151;in or out of government&#151;is not a fashionable view. So the BBC's approach is not just a matter of war and it is not just a matter of the reasons for the war; it is that this is exactly what is done in every circumstance, not <P>


<a name="column_755"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 755</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>just by the BBC, but in general. The assumption is that a public figure is doing something wrong and that it is merely a matter of finding out exactly what it is.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para67"></a>So what Andrew Gilligan did was not really a mistake. It was an inevitable consequence of an approach to journalism. It might not have been Mr Gilligan, Dr Kelly and the war, but somewhere along the line it was inevitable that some tragedy would supervene because of an approach to journalism that is not respectful, courteous or, actually, about finding the truth. That was revealed in an interesting comment made by Mr Dyke, who made clear that it was in the public interest to publish an allegation. It did not matter whether it was true; it did not matter whether the person who made it was prepared to come out publicly to say so. So an anonymous, uncorroborated, unattributable source is enough for any allegation, no matter how serious, to be promoted.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para68"></a>That is not about informing; that is not about educating; that is not about the public interest; that is about exciting people. So much of what now passes for journalism is about whipping up people's emotions and feelings. It is not about giving them information. The boundary between "inform" and "entertain" has disappeared. They are almost seen to be the same thing. The reality and content disappear.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para69"></a>That does not happen only in the press; it happens in other aspects of public life. It happens on the government side; it sometimes happens on the opposition side too. That is a serious problem. It is not about the current Government. The idea that a government might make a decision that they are determined to force through by pressure, persuasion or, frankly, deceiving people&#151;promoting something with a whole lot of colour around it&#151;did not start with the current Government. It started with the previous government, Margaret Thatcher's government, when the idea of working out something together by consensus disappeared.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para70"></a>The responsibility of government was to get an idea and then to press it through. If you can press it through by force, you do. If you cannot, you spin a whole story around it that moves people and builds up their feelings so that they will be prepared to go with you for the moment and allow the matter through. It does not happen by thought, consideration, reflection and some kind of consensus.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para71"></a>Because there is now so little faith in public figures, people turn to other areas where they feel that there is an assurance of truth. They turn to the press and the media. I discovered when I was a junior doctor that it was far more valuable to be in the press and on the radio to convince patients that you were well qualified than to have a dozen degrees and certificates up on the wall. If you are being used, especially by television, but also by radio, you must be an expert, whether or not you are qualified. People believe what is said, especially on television, even more so than on radio.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para72"></a>I turn to intelligence. What is intelligence? We might well wonder these days. Intelligence is a couple of different things. It is about the accumulation of open <P>


<a name="column_756"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 756</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>source, as well as covert, material; but then it is about assessment. It is about the judgments that are made, which are more important than the material obtained. It is about being clear about how soft and mistaken so much of that material is. We have not learnt. We all got it wrong about the Berlin Wall and the fall of communism, but did not learn from that to be a bit more sceptical of intelligence. People think that if it is intelligence, that means that is true; if it is on the BBC, that makes it true. I wish that it were so easy. It is not.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para73"></a>What is key about the Hutton inquiry is that it reminds us all that a confrontational approach to political life that sets aside the truth in favour of what we would like to be the truth and that elevates getting your own way above getting agreement on the basis of the facts. If we do not realise that, the situation can only get worse. If the noble and learned Lord does us one real service, it will be that he calls us back to the kind of careful, courteous, thoughtful, respectful, fact-based approach that he so exemplified in his work in the report.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Armstrong of Ilminster: </B>   My Lords, some commentators have been critical of the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, because he did not address the question of whether the Government were justified in taking this country into a war to destroy Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. The noble and learned Lord himself said that that was not within his terms of reference and, in any case, an inquiry into such an issue should be done not by a single judge, however eminent and independent, sitting on his or her own, but by a group of people, including Privy Counsellors from the main political parties and people who are not politicians but who are independent and have the necessary experience of affairs.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para74"></a>That is the sort of inquiry that we were offered yesterday to consider the intelligence aspects of the matter. It is to be chaired by my noble friend and eminent successor Lord Butler of Brockwell. I do not know whether to congratulate him or commiserate with him. At least they waited until the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, had reported before accusing him of a whitewash; they are accusing my noble friend of a whitewash before he has even uttered a word, let alone held a meeting.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para75"></a>I assure your Lordships that my noble friend is no pussycat waiting to lie on his back to have his tummy tickled by the Prime Minister. If he and his colleagues see good reason to be critical of the Government, they will no doubt express that.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para76"></a>To return to Hutton, I rather agree with Gavyn Davies: one may not have chosen the referee, but one none the less accepts his decisions. The noble and learned Lord has read and heard all the evidence, no doubt very carefully and thoroughly, and has come to certain conclusions. Others of us might have reached slightly different conclusions on the same evidence; but few if any of us have steeped ourselves in the evidence or had the opportunity to assess the quality of the evidence and, as the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, said, the quality of the <P>


<a name="column_757"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 757</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>witnesses who gave it, as has the noble and learned Lord. Having studied his conclusions and learnt the lessons, we should move on.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para77"></a>This all started with the "Today" programme on 29 May, when Mr Gilligan included in his broadcast the allegation that the Government had inserted the 45-minute claim into the dossier, knowing or believing that it was wrong or probably wrong. Furthermore, he allowed it to be understood that his source for that allegation was the individual whom he had interviewed, later disclosed to have been Dr Kelly. In fact, he had no authority for the allegation, which he eventually admitted to be wrong; and it did not come from Dr Kelly, but was&#151;on the most favourable gloss that Mr Gilligan himself can put on it, an inference that he himself drew from his interview with Dr Kelly.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para78"></a>At that time, it was clearly a very damaging allegation that the Government inserted in the dossier a statement that they knew at the time to be wrong. It is understandable that the Government wanted to counter it and kill it as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the Government, in the shape of Alastair Campbell, went in for overkill. He bombarded the BBC with a deluge&#151;or, some say, a blizzard&#151;of letters, telephone calls and e-mails. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, refers to that bombardment, but I am not sure that he has given sufficient weight to the psychological effect that it must have had on the BBC. Coming, as it did, on top of a long period in which the Government had been accusing the BBC of a systematic anti-war bias, the BBC clearly felt that it was being unreasonably harassed and bullied by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para79"></a>If Alastair Campbell was obsessed about the BBC, the BBC in its turn was obsessed by its sense of being bullied by an overbearing Government. Its first and overriding thought was to resist that pressure, stand by its journalist and maintain the traditional independence of the BBC. That completely took the BBC's eye from the question of substance: whether the allegation complained of was well founded.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para80"></a>It is ironic to think that, had the bullying tactics of Alastair Campbell been less fierce and persistent, the BBC might have been readier than it was to investigate more closely whether there was any substance in the Government's complaints, and to acknowledge that there was when this was found out. If that had happened, we might not be here this evening.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para81"></a>The BBC has, as we have seen, paid a high price for its errors, but the Government cannot be completely acquitted of blame in their handling of the matter. No. 10's obsession with the need to nail the BBC also affected its behaviour in respect of Dr Kelly. Dr Kelly told the Ministry of Defence that he had gone beyond his authority in speaking to Mr Gilligan. He was called to account for that and given a severe reprimand. As far as Dr Kelly was concerned, that should have been the end of the matter. The Government should have stuck to a refusal to disclose the identity of the civil servant who admitted having talked to Mr Gilligan.

<a name="40204-10_para82"></a>The noble and learned Lord evidently accepted the view that in the end it would have been impossible to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>prevent Dr Kelly being named because of the intense media interest. I can understand that and can understand and approve the Government's wish not to tell an untruth nor to equivocate if faced with a direct question: "Was it Dr Kelly who was interviewed by Mr Gilligan?" All the same, it would have been fairer to Dr Kelly if the Government had maintained a refusal to disclose his name. I fear the decision not to maintain such a refusal was another by-product of No. 10's determination to nail the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para83"></a>The Ministry of Defence recommended that Dr Kelly should not be allowed to give evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons. That advice was over-ruled by No. 10 and the Secretary of State for Defence. But the Ministry of Defence does not seem to have been given an opportunity at the relevant meeting at No. 10, or subsequently, to ask if that decision should be reconsidered.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para84"></a>Dr Kelly was not as accustomed, as some civil servants become, to facing a parliamentary Select Committee. His evidence was, in the circumstances, bound to be a highly charged political occasion. If he was to be obliged to appear before the committee, I believe that, in his own interest, Dr Kelly should have been accompanied by a very senior civil servant, who could have supported him and helped him to deal with the very outspoken&#151;indeed, I dare say offensive&#151;questions that were thrown at him.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para85"></a>Finally, there is the question of records of meetings at No. 10. We are given to understand that the noble and learned Lord was surprised by the absence&#151;from the papers available to him&#151;of records of at least some of the important meetings that took place in 10 Downing Street during this affair. Had such records been available, some of the confusion and misunderstanding that have bedevilled the affair might have been avoided.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para86"></a>When a meeting takes place in No. 10 at which the Prime Minister is present and decisions are made, it is wise&#151;I would venture to say necessary&#151;that a full minute of the meeting should be made for the record. This is not just for the sake of the historian; people who have to act on the decision but were not at the meeting at which it was taken need a clear record&#151;available for reference as required&#151;of the decision taken and the reasons why that decision and not a different decision was taken.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para87"></a>There is also the issue of accountability. Mere memory is fallible, as I know from experience. A contemporary written record of a meeting at which a decision is taken can be an invaluable aid to establishing exactly what happened and to discharging the duty of accountability.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para88"></a>The occupants of 10 Downing Street have generally speaking been meticulous about recording the Prime Minister's meetings. If standards have slipped in this respect, it would be as well for integrity in government and good administration if they were restored.

<A NAME="40204-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, I believe that two of the greatest institutions of our country are the BBC and the Civil Service. The comments of the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, have exemplified some of the advantages we have had in the Civil Service over the past 150 years, and similarly the advantages we have had from the BBC over the past 80 years. They are enormously valuable; in many respects they are the greatest institutions we have in the whole of our country. They are internationally respected and understood to have the probity and the standing which we have come to expect. It is a terribly sad reflection of our times that these two institutions are under the greatest threat. This is deplorable.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para89"></a>Comparisons have been made between the BBC and commercial broadcasters. Comments have been made about the value of the independent reporting of Channel Four and ITV 1 and 2. I acknowledge that valuable aspect. The question that we have to ask is how much of that is due to the standards which are set by the BBC. The BBC is a yardstick and it sets a valuable benchmark. That is a particular value of the BBC and is, I believe, a most important background to the debate.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para90"></a>Behind all this was the fact that there were two well-known Labour supporters&#151;Gavyn Davies and Greg Dyke&#151;who came under constant and unremitting pressure from Alastair Campbell. They are both men of great ability and had a dedication to the BBC. They felt that they had to assert their independence, particularly since they were strong members of the Labour Party, and so they had to react in the way they did, partly for that reason, but partly also because of the unremitting nature of the torrential bombardment, as the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, called it, that produced a feeling that their independence was under attack. If the representations had been less vehement, an accommodation could have been reached. They might have handled the situation differently, but their reasons were honourable.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para91"></a>The Hutton inquiry has produced a great deal of information. This was a valuable decision of the noble and learned Lord. He opened all the evidence to the public. When a judge in court comes to a conclusion about which I feel uneasy, I accept the decision because he has seen all the evidence and has heard all the witnesses&#151;so my understanding is much less than his. In this case, with all the evidence, all being in public, and with the interest that one has in the issues, and knowing the people involved, one has been able to follow it all up in very great detail. We should be grateful for this opportunity to follow these investigations as thoroughly as we have been able to do.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para92"></a>Furthermore, because one may have close personal knowledge of many of the people and of the circumstances over so many years, one is able to question, rightly, the conclusions that the noble and learned Lord reached. He gave us so much information that we have as good a right to come to our own conclusions as he has in a number of instances. I shall mention two of these conclusions.

I am in as good a position as anybody else is to judge sub-consciousness, and that is not my view.
<P>

<a name="40204-10_para97"></a>The noble and learned Lord refers to the term "sexed-up". Fortunately, I still have contact with my former constituency. I asked a number of people there what they thought "sexed-up" meant. The general view was that it meant exaggerated or made more interesting by exaggeration. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, does not have that view, but the view of ordinary people is similar to what I have described. "Sexed-up" is not a wrong description of what happened, taking into account the way in which ordinary people use those words.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The term "sexed-up" . . .  lacks clarity [and] . . .  is capable of two different meanings. It could mean that the dossier was embellished with items of intelligence known or believed to be false".

</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40204-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, I have read that and much of the Hutton report. The noble and learned Lord concludes that it is a much lighter version than I would have accepted. I would have interpreted "sexed-up" as an exaggeration or an embellishment. This in itself is not particularly bad; it is just an understanding of what happened. That is the interpretation that many of my former constituents made.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para0"></a>On the complaint about the broadcast, at page 213 of the report, the noble and learned Lord made the following argument:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Governors were right to take the view that it was their duty to protect the independence of the BBC against attacks by the Government and Mr Campbell's complaints were being expressed in exceptionally strong terms which raised very considerably the temperature of the dispute between the Government and the BBC".

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para1"></a>
Of course there is a question of errors. But proper representations can be made and apologies for errors sought. Newspapers make errors every day and do not apologise, but the BBC normally does. The situation must be handled sensibly. If one handles it aggressively, one will not get the kind of reaction that one might seek.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para2"></a>Following the new BBC chairman's appointment, I would like to see him or her come before the Public Administration Committee for its approval, in the same way as, under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Radice, governors of the Bank of England came before the Treasury Committee for its endorsement.

<a name="40204-11_para3"></a>David Kelly was 59 and coming up to retirement. It would be surprising if his pension and the fear of its loss were not on his mind. For six months, in 1974, I effectively ran the Department of Civil Service, subject to the Prime Minister, who, because of the political situation between the two 1974 general elections, gave me the responsibility of its day-to-day management. I had to deal with issues of dismissal and loss of pensions. It would be surprising if the possible loss of his pension was not prominent in his thoughts. By committing suicide, he would have been able to assure himself that whatever happened his wife would be protected. If that was so, we must accord his decision to end his life a sad but an honourable and an understandable one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I suggest that truth is always complex. It cannot be broken down into neat, watertight compartments. Each element affects and is affected by the others. As the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater, reminded us yesterday, with all his relevant experience, the gathering, evaluation and use of intelligence is seamless. It would be naive to pretend otherwise, and that must be recognised in any inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para4"></a>However, the seamlessness is true of the whole saga of the Iraq war. Real historical perspective would be essential before sound and wise judgments can be made, and even then there will of course be arguments. There will be judgments but absolute answers are another matter. The thirst for instant, absolute verdicts in limited spheres is, I suggest, inevitably destined for frustration, cynicism and controversy. However distinguished and however honourable those asked to make inquiries may be, and however courageously determined they may be in accepting, faced with an issue as complicated and literally intriguing as the war, it is to ask too much to expect the findings of limited inquiries not to raise more questions than they answer. That was true of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton; it will, I suspect, be true of the team led by the noble Lord, Lord Butler.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para5"></a>The key question is whether the war was justified&#151;whether the price in loss and maimed lives, and bereaved and grieving relatives and friends, was a valid price to pay in terms of the outcomes. Apart from the human cost to the allies, thousands of Iraqi civilians were killed and wounded in the war. Thousands of young Iraqi service people who had no alternative but to serve the cruel dictatorship were also maimed and killed. As we gravely ponder&#151;as we in a responsible and civilised society should&#151;the untimely and tragic death of a decent and talented public servant, we must remember the thousands who, without choice, suffered and died for the cause we embraced. Their families and friends are entitled to ask whether our preoccupation with Dr Kelly has not become a distraction from the wider question that must be addressed.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para6"></a>We need the most comprehensive insight possible on which to base our judgments, whatever those may finally be. There is a debilitating uneasiness, if not <P>


<a name="column_762"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 762</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>malaise, in our democracy, which centres on trust and credibility. We are all part of it. The political community is seen as closed and self-seeking. Much of the media are seen in the same way. The BBC has been a notable exception, but the BBC will retain its trust only if it invariably operates with the enviably high standards that it has established for integrity, independence and a constant striving for objectivity. Gravitas&#151;let us not be ashamed of the word&#151;is a part of that.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para7"></a>The BBC must be a source of reliable news based on verified information and balanced analysis. It must never be a tool of anybody&#151;especially the government. It will rapidly lose its status if it is drawn into a rat race of being the first with sensational stories. That is not its role, and it is not what the public want. Its hallmark should always be considered reliability.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para8"></a>There is another characteristic, which too many in the political community and the media&#151;even some in the BBC&#151;have in common, and which I am convinced is central to public disillusion and alienation. I am talking about arrogance. If we are to restore public confidence in democracy, humility is indispensable. We politicians should argue our case. We should toughly analyse and criticise the case of others, but always in the context of recognising that nobody&#151;not one of us as a mere mortal&#151;has a monopoly of truth.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para9"></a>There must be mutual respect. The challenge is to convince, not just to win. By convincing we can build the consensus that is essential for social and political stability. The absence of that culture means that there is a predisposition to mistrust findings that are seen as coming from establishment quarters that are inevitably perceived as related to the questionable worlds of politics and media.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para10"></a>I hope that I am wrong, but I fear the same reception for the inquiry led by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, as that, however unfairly, given to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. If a new inquiry is to benefit from the experiences of the previous one, it must be seen to be about a search for truth, rather than just to allocate blame. Even now its composition should be seen to be widely drawn and demonstrably independent of the power circles that I have described.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para11"></a>My noble friend Lady Symons has stressed that the legality of the war was based on the UN resolutions. But the UN resolutions were related to the supposed existence of weapons of mass destruction. If those do not exist, that surely raises questions about the validity of that legal argument. Nobody is suggesting bad faith on the part of Ministers, but it is a question that will not go away.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para12"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, did not feel able to deal with it within his remit. The new inquiry may well feel itself unable to face up to it, but it has to be faced. In saying that, I stress that it is a question about legality. There is a difference between legality and justification. That is a big issue, which is central to the whole realm of ethics. I suspect that history will look at justification every bit as closely as legal niceties, if not more so. Justification relates to human costs and measurable results.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para13"></a>While mentioning the United Nations there is another point to be made. Some of us argued that there needed to be a specific United Nations Security Council resolution authorising the war, and that to try to assemble an authorisation from past resolutions and their implications was not convincing. It is not mere legalistic concern. For an operation of that significance, with all its widespread consequences, endorsement by the most representative cross-section of the international community is indispensable. It is that that gives maximum authority. A specific resolution is the formalisation of that endorsement.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was not expected to look at the history. But for the whole story to be convincingly evaluated, sooner or later that will have to happen. In 1991, why did the UN mandate, as formulated&#151;we played a big part in the formulation&#151;not authorise taking Baghdad? What were the underlying anxieties about Iran? What were the concerns to balance that equation? When there was not unconditional surrender, why was the situation played as though there had been, instead of deploying all the skills of imaginative, positive engagement? How far did that play into the hands of Saddam Hussein instead of opening up the situation if&#151;a big consideration&#151;indeed, it was possible to open it up?
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para15"></a>All those questions need to be considered if we are to learn for the future. On one specific, I hope that we shall have reassurance from the Government. It is surely important that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and his colleagues look at the work of Dr Blix and the UN inspectors alongside their examination of intelligence activity. What was the quality of that work? How seriously was it treated? Why was Dr Blix not allowed to finish his task before a decision was made about war? It is misgivings in that area that lend fuel to the argument that there was a prior decision to go to war in any case.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para16"></a>We live in an age of blame. Like truth itself, responsibilities in the real world are a complex web of interrelationships. Finding scapegoats is the soft option. What matters is a determined search for the whole truth and a determination to learn for the future. Meanwhile, we are where we are. What matters now is to ensure the peace, not just in Iraq or even the region, but globally. That will require generous and vast resources. I suggest that it will also make a return to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its centre an imperative. Lasting peace cannot be imposed. It has to be built. That requires a common effort with a widespread sense of stakeholding and ownership in the process.

We in this country set ourselves very <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>high standards. That does not matter though because when people fall below those standards, we can get quite cross.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para17"></a>Until last year, no man could be tried twice for the same offence. The present Government have altered that. It is a pity that one of the exceptions does not include appeal from the judgments just given. I think that on many occasions some of those judgments have been perverse. It is admitted that Mr Gilligan erred and strayed. He erred and strayed greatly. He erred when he stated that the Government knew that the 45-minute warning was false. No one would believe that accusation. He strayed from the path of righteousness almost into the wilderness with his leaks to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee. But reading the evidence to the Hutton committee and its appendices, it is impossible for me to agree with the conclusions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, regarding the celibacy of the present administration.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para18"></a>The Lord Chancellor is on the Front Bench today. Tomorrow he could be on the Woolsack. There is an immense difference in meaning between those two statements. It is equally different when applying those two statements to chemical and biological warfare. The change suggested by Downing Street is shown in the two drafts. The first states that weapons "could" be deployed; the second states that they "are" deployable in 45 minutes. In my view, that is sexing up. The evidence for that claim came from one reliable source, who passed on hearsay evidence.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para19"></a>A 45-minute reaction time implies a fielded capability that should have provided collateral to an otherwise single, uncorroborated source. Iraqi staff officers, some of whom had been well trained in our own staff colleges, knew that to deploy those weapons down to divisional level would require large numbers of men, large amounts of paperwork and a large amount of signalling and e-mailing. Admittedly, a great deal of Iraq's communications in 1991 was carried out on secure fibre-optic lines, but at operational level, signals have to go via wireless telegraphy. That can be monitored. With the allies' total air superiority, there should have been air photographs or satellite evidence. There were none of those. When units move, signals increase. Where was the evidence of that?

Not one single note asks "Are you sure?" or "Have we got this right?" or "Check again". All those notes from officials in Appendix 13 could, in old-fashioned cavalry talk, be described as "hack on": "Never steady the beys, rein in the greys, but always let the 11th Hussars ride through".
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para25"></a>If the Government knew and were certain that the Iraqis had weapons of mass destruction, deployable at 45 minutes' notice, why did they allow soldiers to attack without chemical or biological warfare filters? Of course, if they believed that they did not, it would not matter that there were no filters. However, I do not completely acquit the Government of that belief, which makes the former even worse.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para26"></a>I do have a difficulty, because I supported the war, I support it now, and I am quite convinced that Iraq will be a better place than it was under the reign of Saddam Hussein.

<P>

<a name="40204-11_para27"></a>If those reasons were enough in their totality, why did the Government have to behave in that iffy way?

<A NAME="40204-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the maiden speaker on his notable and helpful speech. Often when debates of such seriousness are held in this House, one is genuinely informed and one's mind is shifted in the course of debate. That has been true tonight. However, I have to say that those who suggest that if one disagrees with the judgments reached by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, one is somehow arguing with the referee or subverting the course of justice, that really is misconceived. Judges are human, they are constantly appealed in the normal course of their work and that is the nature of judging. Nothing could have been more difficult than the task with which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was vested in this case. It is no wonder that some of us, while accepting the utter integrity of his judgments, disagree with him in certain particulars.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para28"></a>Perhaps I may concentrate on the issue of sexing up. I do so not to rake over the coals, but because there is real public unhappiness about this report. Others have referred to that and I think it is a reality. The noble Lord, Lord Haskins, spoke of public trust and the importance of trying to restore it. We need to face the fact that, on this occasion, the public had greater access to this inquiry than to any other in history. People could watch it nightly on their televisions and read about it day by day. If ever the great British public has a sense that it is entitled to its own view, this is it. People are, to an extraordinary degree, unhappy.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para29"></a>First, in my view the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, gives an incomplete definition of the term "sexed up". He states on page 144 that it is capable of two different meanings. The first,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"could mean that the dossier was embellished with items of intelligence known or believed to be false or unreliable to make the case against Saddam Hussein stronger".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para30"></a>
It is this meaning that he ascribes to Andrew Gilligan's broadcast on 29 May, thus inevitably rejecting the sexing-up charge, pursuant as it is to his prior judgment about the untruthfulness of Andrew Gilligan's report.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para31"></a>His second meaning of sexing up is that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the dossier was drafted in such a way as to make the case against Saddam Hussein as strong as the intelligence contained in it permitted".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para32"></a>
But that is not sexing up in normal parlance.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para33"></a>I suggest a third definition, one that he did not mention, which I believe is the one to which the British public relate; namely, that the dossier was drafted in such a way as to exaggerate or over-egg the interpretation of the intelligence contained in it or otherwise to distort its impact by emphasis, omission or presentation.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para34"></a>Having read with care Chapter 6 and the conclusions in Chapter 12, I can say only that, in common with a great many members of the public, I believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, under-sexed his conclusions about the impact of Alastair Campbell and his team on the final wording of the dossier. That is a vital matter. Your Lordships will recollect that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, put it in terms of possibility that Mr Scarlett may have been "subconsciously influenced" by No. 10. I summarise. Most people think that that is a severe understatement of what went on.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para35"></a>It was only in the last draft of the dossier, produced on 20 September, that the foreword by the Prime Minister was included. Notably it made no mention at all of human rights issues, concentrating entirely on WMD. The Prime Minister stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I wanted to share with the British public the reasons why I believe this issue [WMD] to be a current and serious threat to the UK national interest".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para36"></a>
The foreword goes on to repeat:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am in no doubt that the threat is serious and current, that he has made progress on WMD, and that he has to be stopped".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para37"></a>
Many noble Lords, notably the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, and my noble friend Lady Williams, have laboured this point.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para38"></a>This foreword and the dossier were designed to scare those who read it and the reference to the readiness of WMD in 45 minutes was included in several other parts of the report. Indeed it assumed a greater profile in the successive drafts throughout September, as the report catalogues.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para39"></a>I turn to the whole question of the reality of the threat from Saddam Hussein. This is a particularly important incident referred to at some length by the noble Lord, Lord Alexander. It may help noble Lords and the record if I read the e-mail sent on 19 September by <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Jonathan Powell to Alastair Campbell and John Scarlett, this at a time when they were furiously and frenetically honing the final dossier:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Found my copy. I think it is good.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para40"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I agree with Alastair you should drop the conclusion.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para41"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Alastair &#151; what will be the headline in the Standard on day of publication?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para42"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>What do we want it to be?"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para43"></a>
We know what it was: "45 minutes from attack".
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para44"></a>There is more in this. Alastair Campbell referred to "the threat" in the draft as it then stood:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Saddam is prepared to use chemical and biological weapons if he believes his regime is under threat".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para45"></a>
Jonathan Powell said that this was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a bit of a problem. It backs up the Don McIntyre argument that there is no CBW threat and we will only create one if we attack him"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para46"></a>
Donald McIntyre is of course a writer on the Independent&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I think you should redraft the para".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para47"></a>
Indeed, the paragraph was redrafted.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para48"></a>While most of us accept the broad criticism by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, of the BBC's inadequacy at top levels concerning Gilligan's failing, what is one to make of his exculpation of the relentless pressure exerted by No. 10 throughout September, which led to the exclusion of reference to there being no danger to Britain from nuclear attack; excluded intelligence that Saddam would use his weapons of mass destruction only defensively; change of qualified statements to unqualified ones; repeated warnings of a "current and serious threat", which was misunderstood, written to be misunderstood and which, having been duly misunderstood by the public, was not the subject of an attempted rectification?
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para49"></a>That contrasts starkly with the demands made of the BBC by Alastair Campbell for its misrepresentation. What, too, does one make of the fact that the 45-minute claim was, as other noble Lords, including the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, have mentioned, never qualified to make clear that it was a battlefield threat only, and that the intelligence on which it was based was a single, uncorroborated source?
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para50"></a>Even Gilligan's story of Alastair Campbell's relentless efforts to sex up the dossier had corroboration from Susan Watts's recorded conversation with Dr Kelly. What did Alastair Campbell say about the fact that the BBC was relying on a single source? He said a heck of a lot.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para51"></a>The frenetic exchange of e-mails and drafts between Campbell, Scarlett and Powell between 16 and 20 September will on reflection be seen to have been an inappropriate way of dealing with a matter of such immense importance. That has relevance for the review which I hope the acting chairman of the governors of the BBC will institute, just as the acting director-general is undertaking a review.

<A NAME="40204-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, the theme I wish to develop is that outlined earlier by my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon. He is quite right and astute in saying&#151;if I may paraphrase him&#151;that the situation now reached in the fourth estate of the realm, as the press is sometimes called, has uncanny resemblances to the position of the trade union movement in the 1970s. The perception of its role at that time was one of power without responsibility. I have in mind the famous quote from Baldwin about the press in the 1930s&#151;power without responsibility&#151;which he said was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para52"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para53"></a>In that case, rightly or wrongly, there was some redress through the political process. In many respects the laws dealing with trade unionism were badly handled, but in the case of the media, if the analysis is correct, is there any corresponding way forward? I shall come in a moment to the propositions from the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, with which I disagree.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para54"></a>Let me establish what some leading authorities are saying at the moment about this situation being a crisis for the media. On Saturday, there was an outstanding article by Andrew Gowers, the editor of the Financial Times. He stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The true message of Hutton is that this was a story about journalism, not about the deliberate embellishment of a dossier on Iraqi WMD, against the wishes of the intelligence services . . .  That claim . . .  was demolished . . .  The Hutton report is about a story that was wrong",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para55"></a>
and so on. He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No one&#151;certainly not Lord Hutton&#151;is suggesting that journalism must now retreat . . .  we have a duty not to 'sex up' what we claim to have found".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para56"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para57"></a>In the Times on 3rd January, Sir Harold Evans, a distinguished journalist, stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Something is rotten in the state of relations between government and press in Britain. There is distrust all round&#151;distrust of government by the press, distrust of the press in government, and of the press among the public. It should not fester . . .  I believe that good might come from a public ventilation of grievances . . .  and an informed examination of the practices, assumptions and ethical standards prevailing in journalism . . .  and government-press relations alike".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para58"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para59"></a>Finally, Mr Geoffrey Goodman, the distinguished former industrial editor of the Daily Mirror and the founding editor of the British Journalism Review, stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is nothing wrong in demonstrating that there is an inevitable conflict between [government legislators and the media]; that is an essential condition within any democratic society.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para60"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>But where this conflict degenerates into a cancer of contempt, mistrust and eventually mutual derision between the two, the democratic process is itself threatened. Politicians have become increasingly contemptuous of journalists, and perhaps even of free journalism; and journalists have grown increasingly derisive of politicians and their function. In some cases there is also now a danger of journalists arrogating to themselves a new role"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para61"></a>
I hope the House will forgive his pun&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"&#151;a kind of House of Columns to replace a House of Commons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para62"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para63"></a>The central problem is that we now have new tribunes of the people who, objectively speaking, seek to replace the tribunes of the people in Parliament but without having the same responsibility.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para64"></a>We are all schizophrenic about the media&#151;we need them but are they really trying to catch us out? While wearing one hat, even Dr Kelly himself was apparently, if not encouraged, not discouraged from talking to the media, as an expert, about his knowledge of Iraq. He was perhaps talking about matters to one of his contacts, dropped his guard and certainly said&#151;he may have set out to say it&#151;something that he should not have said. "There but for the grace of God go I", was my thought at the time. Surely we have all been there. It is the idea that we are all in thrall to the press that forces us into these uncomfortable situations.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para65"></a>But it is not a one-way argument about politicians and the press. We, as parliamentarians, have to be very careful about how we put issues to witnesses giving evidence to Select Committees. We also have our responsibilities. There should be some kind of restraint on the way in which the media develop their role in the governance of the country.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para66"></a>I said that I wished to respond to an interesting point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. As a lawyer, he has pointed out that the reporting of an allegation that one believes to be true but turns out not to be true is legally protected. But I hope that I am not doing him an injustice by saying that he would not wish to declare that that fine legal point is the basis of a proper relationship between the media and governance of the country&#151;because we cannot have a civilised or constructive relationship on that basis.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para67"></a>In conclusion, there should be an open study between leading journalists and leading politicians to see how we can find a way forward. It is not a question of having another Royal Commission. It is to build on what the Hansard Society's commission, under my noble friend Lord Puttnam and its vice-chair Jackie Ashley, is doing to look at how that problem of lack of respect and constructive relationship can be improved. That is an important conclusion from the Hutton inquiry.

<A NAME="40204-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, I must begin with a hereditary interest and I am most grateful to the BBC, because it is, to some extent, responsible for my position here. When my grandfather was in the Cabinet, as Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, he gave the BBC its original charter. When he arrived here, he introduced television with the Selsdon report. All of his diaries and readings that I have tried to find in a suitcase locked in store somewhere in Ealing have warned me about the events that would have happened&#151;and have happened&#151;today. He warned that one must not have sex, religion, finance or politics. We have too much of all of those. He also said that we must pay due attention to the English language. I now say that the first casualty of war was truth and the second was the English language&#151;something that Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote some time ago in the Guardian.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para68"></a>About two years ago, Mr Hoon, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, said that there was no universally-acceptable definition of the phrase <P>


<a name="column_770"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 770</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"weapons of mass destruction". The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, only a year later, on 3 March 2003, said that there was no such definition of weapons of mass destruction. The English language is pretty good. The first definition of "weapons of mass destruction" was, supposedly, by the Times in 1937, when Franco tried to bomb the Basques out of existence in Guernica. The phrase was then used by the Nazis for carpet bombing. Then we became equally guilty of carpet bombing at Dresden. It was Lord Cochraine, an admiral, who first suggested to the Admiralty that there was a new weapon that could possibly replace fire ships. That was a noxious gas that was introduced in 1914.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para69"></a>One way or another, we are talking about fear and threat of weaponry. The Americans did not define weapons of mass destruction until 1998 but even their law does not seem to apply. We are talking about something of which we know nothing. I often find to my amazement that when I have asked the Government a question they say that there is no definition and tell me to look it up in the dictionary. The most recent example was when I asked for the definition of "vermin". In France, the largest vermin is an animal called a blaireau&#151;a badger. There is no definition of "vermin" in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para70"></a>The great and wonderful English language should often be used in legislation and elsewhere to provide definitions. I am a "reporter", if one looks up the definition of the word. I did not realise that&#151;it is an old usage in that one goes out to report upon matters, one writes them down and compiles reports. That stems back from my time in the Navy, when my noble friend Lord Geddes was also there. He was more competent than I, a seagoing officer who had to take a Corona typewriter and type seven carbon copies in a rough sea, where the "o"s and the "a"s perforated the paper, tore it apart and blew overboard. Ever since then I have worked for bureaucracies including the great Midland Bank, where we had to report on absolutely everything.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para71"></a>Part of my time took me to countries of the Arab world&#151;first to Iraq in 1974. I learnt from those countries and others that they have a great knowledge of and an interest in the United Kingdom. I also learnt that much of their knowledge and truth came from the BBC and in particular from the BBC World Service. I was often told, "You don't want to listen to much of the rubbish that is being broadcast in the United Kingdom. That is all politically motivated. But the World Service you can trust".
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para72"></a>When I returned from a mission&#151;sometimes a government mission&#151;I would often be asked whether I would go and see those in the World Service and tell them what I had done. If people in the host country had been rude to me&#151;the Iraqis were always extremely rude&#151;I would be extremely rude back and surprisingly enough the World Service would not always edit that out.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para73"></a>I believe that there has been a failure in many of us to understand Iraq. When I first went there, people in the British embassy were not allowed outside and it was probably impossible to gather any reasonable <P>


<a name="column_771"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 771</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intelligence of what was going on. The Iraqis are masters at disinformation. First, they make everyone look the same and then they make them all speak the same.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para74"></a>I became involved with the Iranians and the Libyans and discovered that many of them play cricket. The other day, one of them referred to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, as being the wicked wicket keeper of the Woolsack. He is portrayed as having to defend fast bowling when it is all off line. He has done a wonderful job and I want to thank him personally for having sat here throughout the debate. That is a great honour to the House and it is much appreciated. I hope that in due course he will realise that my hereditary duty at the BBC came to an end with the House of Lords Act in 1999 when, effectively, we were called "elected" hereditary Peers. I hope that before he leaves this House, if ever he does, he will refer to us with the one word "elected". The Iraqis and others think that we are more important because we were elected. I do not return to how or why.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para75"></a>Here comes one of the worries: weapons of mass destruction. Let us look at the history. We went to war with Iraq but why did we stop? No one has been able to tell me that. I could spend half an hour telling your Lordships why other people think we stopped, but we stopped. Why did we start again? We started something again because we heard about the wonderful weapon of mass destruction called the "supergun" which could bomb everyone out of existence. It was actually fixed in concrete and pointed only in one direction.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para76"></a>Then we experienced something totally unrelated. The United States, which had never been involved at the beginning of any war and had never really been involved in terrorism, had United States aeroplanes flown into buildings by United States immigrants. They were not called "weapons of mass destruction" because under the law they were not. That then led to the desire to hit back at somebody. First, the idea was to hit back at Osama bin Laden. You could hit back at him in Afghanistan&#151;another of my patches. When you cannot get him there, you announce that everyone is linked together in an axis of evil and that they are all hosting terrorists&#151;and attention turned to Iraq again. With that comes the information that they are a threat with their weapons of mass destruction.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para77"></a>What a load of rubbish. A weapon of mass destruction, if it is so defined as gas or whatever&#151;but it is not&#151;is only of value if it can be "weaponised" and delivered. There is no way that most or any of the weapons referred to in government documentation could, with the facilities available in Iraq, be delivered to threaten us or anyone in western Europe.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para78"></a>But we come to the methods of delivery that they had. Of course they had Russian-oriented missiles. I happen to have spent some time in the Ukraine and elsewhere and visited the missile factory there. It was explained to me that in no way would the Iraqis have been allowed to have Scud missiles that could do any harm to the Russians or reach their territory. During the Gulf War, a Scud missile landed and exploded, but had no explosive hits.
<P>


<a name="column_772"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 772</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para79"></a>I must be careful what I am saying, but I am only reporting what people have said to me. I was told at that time that it took 45 minutes to change the head of a Scud missile. It could be used to drop propaganda or something else. How was it possible to activate it? Look at where the Scud missiles went during that war and think back at how many were camouflaged. Think back to what British troops did during the Tripoli incident when they made cardboard tanks. Again I was told that it took 45 minutes to get a Scud missile up and ready to go.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para80"></a>A lot of disinformation is provided to us by a lot of people, but whatever the reasons I support the Government's decision to go to war and I will support for ever the right of a Prime Minister of this country to make that decision. If after the event people wish to have it justified, so be it. There was a lot of wrong, and a lot of disinformation, and a lot of fear was created unnecessarily. Let us put that behind us and let us get on with the job.

<A NAME="40204-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, I would rather be debating a Motion today that did not just take note of the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, but warmly welcomed it. I certainly do. Right at the outset, I express my gratitude to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, for his diligence and impartiality in analysing the issues&#151;the basis of the report&#151;and for his well argued and well reasoned conclusions.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para81"></a>The terms of reference were simple and straightforward:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para82"></a>
It is a matter of some regret that in today's debate we have heard precious little about that. We have heard an enormous amount about other things that should be the subject of other inquiries and about some that will be the subject of a further inquiry. I regret that we have not dealt with the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para83"></a>We all know the genesis of the report. Mr Gilligan made serious allegations that the Government probably knew, prior to its inclusion in the 20 September 2002 dossier, that their statement of Iraqi ability to deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was wrong, and that 10 Downing Street ordered the dossier to be sexed up.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para84"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, describes the first of those claims quite clearly as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a very grave allegation which attacked the integrity of the Government and the integrity of the Joint Intelligence Committee and gave rise to a major controversy which dominated the headlines for many days".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para85"></a>
I find it small wonder that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and his staff robustly defended themselves because their integrity before Parliament and before the nation had been seriously challenged. Mr Gilligan's already grave allegations were exacerbated three days later when he could have reflected, and corrected his earlier broadcast, when he wrote in the Mail on Sunday that the Government dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"transformed the week before publication to make it sexier".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para86"></a><P>


<a name="column_773"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 773</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Again the Government, and their director of communication, replied robustly, directly to the BBC and in their evidence before the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para87"></a>As a supporter of this Government, I would have put the worst construction on a government that did not seek robustly to defend their integrity. I am sure that, if I were prepared to do that, the vast majority of honourable Members in this House would do it. I expected and demanded of the Government that they should defend their integrity in such circumstances and do it clearly and robustly. Their integrity was therefore examined, tried and tested by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, and the Prime Minister, in advance of his report, conceded the imperative of his resignation should he have been found to have misled Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para88"></a>I wish that some people who, in advance of the publication of the report, made accusations against my right honourable friend the Prime Minister had the same level of integrity in putting their reputations on the line, or at least that they would be prepared to apologise for the mistakes that they made. I look forward to the possibility that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, will remedy, this week, that which he failed to do last week.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para89"></a>The Prime Minister and the Government were not found wanting in the report. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, for that which he did.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para90"></a>Today, in the opening speeches from the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, I saw two speeches that contrasted ill with the measured, well argued references to the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, that we had from my noble friend Lady Ramsay, or with the impressive speech of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, with his insistence that an imperative part of the inquiry should be the pursuit of truth. For so many people, it was the pursuit of pre-stated political prejudices which led them to serious bitterness when the report did not provide the justification for that which they had decreed in advance.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para91"></a>The two opening speeches contrasted ill also with the directness of the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, on the findings on the serious allegations against both the Government and Mr Scarlett. There were other excellent speeches&#151;the clarity of the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, and the measured words of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford&#151;but I turn to the opening speeches.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para92"></a>I can understand the emotion that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, feels in relation to a death that everyone regrets. However, he does not improve the quality of debate in this House with hyperbole about Dr Kelly being thrown to the media or being subjected to intolerable pressure. As for being thrown to the media, I have to say to the noble Lord that there was in fact a rather willing victim who put himself in the position of going to the media without the necessary authorisation and in circumstances that led to his being severely reprimanded for that which he had done. When the noble Lord talks about, "Campbell <P>


<a name="column_774"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 774</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drawing up a JIC report", he offers a very liberal interpretation of language. It almost matches the famous words I remember being attributed to the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, about being economical with the truth.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para93"></a>Equally, in her opening remarks, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, tried to have it both ways by saying that she supported Hutton but then appearing to want the decision to be made by opinion poll or media response. In the multitude of opinion polls, many of which were interestingly done on samples of fewer than 500 people, some produced mutually contradictory results. So we cannot nor should we have in this House a welcome for a report by a Law Lord of high repute then being subjected to judgment by media reaction or opinion poll. That would be a travesty of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para94"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, also referred to the report in today's Independent concerning Dr Jones. However, I think we should just look at what Dr Jones was actually arguing about. The Hutton report says that Dr Jones,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"did not argue that the intelligence relating to the 45 minutes claim should not have been included in the dossier but . . .  did suggest that the wording in which the claim was stated in the dossier was too strong and that instead of the dossier stating 'we judge' that 'Iraq has:&#151;military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including against its own Shia population. Some of these weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use them', the wording should state 'intelligence suggests'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para95"></a>
So all that argument in today's Independent was covered in the Hutton report, and it was an argument about the difference between "we judge" and "intelligence suggests". It was nothing to do with the substance of what appeared in the report.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para96"></a>I really am surprised that so much of the debate has concentrated on the supposition that Dr Kelly&#151;a valued civil servant who had given good service to his country and his people and who was obviously a valued member of society&#151;should, in the circumstance in which he had gone beyond his competence at work, necessarily be given anonymity. Kelly spoke to the press. He spoke to them outside his remit without authority, not on technical questions but on questions that appeared to amount ultimately to not much more than political tittle-tattle. If I have a serious criticism of the Ministry of Defence, it is that it should ever have suggested that anonymity was appropriate in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para97"></a>Too many noble Lords wanted an inquiry into the report. They welcomed the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, praised his thoroughness and integrity, and then sought to set new standards of obfuscation in professing to accept the report in full while simultaneously nibbling away at the detail. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. I accept his report in full and I, if not the rest of the House, believe that we owe him our gratitude and thanks.

<A NAME="40204-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I agree with every syllable just uttered by my noble friend Lord Tomlinson. I would like to start by reading out three quotations <P>


<a name="column_775"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 775</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from someone who stands completely outside the political fray. They are very significant quotations from last Saturday's Financial Times, taken from a very unusual signed article by the editor. He wrote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Hutton report is about a story that was wrong, defended against furious government complaints by a BBC management that had not bothered to check it, even weeks after it was broadcast, and backed by a board of governors determined to resist external pressure at the expense of obscuring the truth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para98"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para99"></a>The second paragraph that I want to quote states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In reply, Mr Davies insinuates that Lord Hutton's conclusions do not fit the facts and mutters about threats to press freedom. And Mr Dyke claims the Gilligan story&#151;though mistaken&#151;was in the public interest and that the governors had no reason to apologise. In so doing, both demonstrate that they have only a passing acquaintance with the basic tenets of good journalism".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para100"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para101"></a>The last quotation from Mr Andrew Gowers with which I shall detain your Lordships&#151;the article is worth reading in full&#151;states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Against this background, Mr Dyke's contention that the thrust of the story was worth reporting, and that any mistakes were in the detail, defies belief. Worse, it demonstrates the extent to which the BBC has been infected by the poisonous culture that has long since tainted other parts of the discourse between politicians and the media".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para102"></a><P>

<a name="40204-11_para103"></a>We all know how we got into this state. It was because the poor old BBC, for which we all must feel very sensitively, was subject to a blizzard of hectoring e-mails from Mr Alastair Campbell. It is worth inquiring why he saw fit to inundate the BBC with that blizzard of e-mails. It was because in his view the BBC's programmes&#151;not only the "Today" programme&#151;were demonstrating a consistent anti-war bias. There were many times when I was on the point of writing a letter to the BBC, because I was so furious in the evening at some of its programmes. I am glad to say that my wife dissuaded me from doing so the following morning.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para104"></a>It is not only the anti-war bias of the BBC that gets to some of us, but the perpetual anti-American bias. It is so deep that I am quite sure that members of BBC staff do not realise that they are infected by it. I was not in the Chamber, but I watched the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Weidenfeld. I agree with him entirely that it is not only Mr Gilligan about whom we have to complain. I even watched a "Newsnight" programme one night, and took the trouble to get the video of it. It was the night that Uday and Qusay Hussein had been killed by American soldiers. Noble Lords will not believe it, but they were described on "Newsnight" as "those two hapless men". "Hapless"? As the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, remarked a few moments ago, there are questions about some people's appreciation of the meaning of the English language.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para105"></a>It is not only on the BBC that we have such difficulties. On "Channel 4 News" at seven o'clock earlier this week, Jon Snow said to Donald Anderson with the most venom that he could put into his voice, "You can't hide behind the skirts of the French and German intelligence services". He did not know, as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, pointed out, that the Chinese and the Russian intelligence services had come to the same view. Leaving aside the vulgarity of the language of Mr Snow, that kind of attack <P>


<a name="column_776"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 776</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>demonstrates how little some presenters know of the significance of the underlying facts of this unfortunate affair.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para106"></a>Why did we have this explosion of anger? Here I have to make it clear that I take serious issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, whom I have known and admired for many years. Today she repeated many times that Gilligan was guilty of a serious mistake; she and her party repudiated his serious mistake. That is not the language that I would use. Gilligan was not guilty of a serious mistake; he was deliberately guilty of a foul slander and he saw that it was perpetrated throughout the media. He never apologised until very late in the day. That is not a serious mistake; it is much more serious than that. That is why there was an explosion of anger on the part of those of us who cared for the reputation of our friend.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para107"></a>We were also very angry, not just because of the imputations against my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, but also because it let down the country and the BBC. If Mr Davies had apologised, like the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, did at the beginning and in my view appropriately, we would not have had this trouble. The problem with Gavyn Davies is that he does not like apologising. No one likes apologising. The two most difficult words in the English language are "I apologise". Mr Gavyn Davies simply could not come up with those words. He did not like the man to whom he thought he had to apologise. Mr Gavyn Davies was too unintelligent or too insensitive to recognise that he owed an apology not just to Alastair Campbell, but to the whole country, to everyone who had listened to the BBC broadcast. So he has gone.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para108"></a>I am not a critic of the BBC as an institution. I have no desire whatever to change its charter arrangements. Here we have not a failure of an institution, but a failure of men. The list goes on. We had an extremely supine board of governors that clearly failed to perform its duty. It may surprise your Lordships to know that I have a certain amount of sympathy for Mr Greg Dyke. The board of governors should have said to Mr Greg Dyke, "No, do not go because you have a lot more on your plate and it is understandable that this did not come to your attention". However, they should also have said to Mr Greg Dyke, "We want Mr Sambrook out of this building within the next 15 minutes". In a moment I shall say a little more about Mr Sambrook, the director of BBC radio news.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para109"></a>My right honourable friend Gerald Kaufman will be dilating on this subject and on the way in which Mr Sambrook concealed the facts from the board of governors and probably from Mr Greg Dyke in the course of his remarks at the other end of the corridor. I wish to draw your Lordships' attention to the state of the professional relations between Mr Sambrook and Miss Susan Watts, one of the very few BBC employees who, in my view, comes out of this matter with an enhanced reputation.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para110"></a>I shall quote one or two passages from Miss Watts' evidence. She said of her conversations with Dr Kelly:
<P>


<a name="column_777"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 777</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"He didn't say to me that the dossier was transformed in the last week and he certainly didn't say that the 45-minute claim was inserted either by Alastair Campbell or by anyone else in government. In fact, he denied specifically that Alastair Campbell was involved in the conversation on May 30 . . .  he was very clear to me that the claim was in the original intelligence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para111"></a>
She continued by testifying that the BBC had been primarily interested in getting her to corroborate Mr Gilligan's account, rather than in the merits of her reports. She said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I felt under some considerable pressure to reveal my source. I also felt the purpose of that was to help corroborate the Andrew Gilligan allegations and not for any proper news purpose . . .  I was most concerned that there was an attempt to mold [my reports] so that they were corroborative which I felt was misguided and false".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para112"></a>
On 11 July, Ms Watts's solicitors&#151;she felt that she had to retain solicitors to protect her against her own employers&#151;wrote a letter to Sarah Jones of the BBC Litigation Department. Again, I shall cite only partially, but the full text is available. It states:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I also place on record my extreme disquiet that a senior BBC executive"&#151;

<a name="40204-11_para113"></a>
that is Sambrook again&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has apparently told a journalist at The Telegraph that the BBC believes Andrew Gilligan's source to be my source also and that Andrew Gilligan and I 'got exactly the same story'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para114"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I do not agree that a comparison of the two reports suggests that there is only one area of difference between the information disclosed by my source and Mr Gilligan's source, as was suggested by Mr Richard Sambrook to my solicitor and on which basis he apparently predicates his belief that they are the same person . . .  Further, I am very concerned about the process by which the circumstances surrounding my Newsnight report are being drawn into a dispute between the BBC and the Government and consider it inappropriate that my reports be used in this way".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para115"></a>
I think I have said enough to make it quite clear that Mr Sambrook is not fit to be supervising anyone in any institution, let alone to be head of radio news at the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para116"></a>What of the future of the BBC? I entirely agree with the constructive suggestions made by my noble friend Lord Lea, which I shall not repeat. Unlike some of my noble friends, I think that we should have an overt recognition of the political nature of the job of the chairman of the BBC. No one cares especially about the gardening or sports programmes or the theatre department; they are not matters of controversy. It is the public affairs and news programmes with which we have difficulty.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para117"></a>We have some useful landmarks that we could follow in that respect. Down the other end of the corridor, the chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee properly reposes with the Opposition and changes hands whenever there is a change of government. That is a line that we might consider with profit. Of course, we must be careful whom we choose. There are certain politicians on both sides of the House whom I consider totally unsuitable to be chairman of the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para118"></a>I am not much in favour of the chairman of the board of governors who preceded Mr Davies. But I am quite sure that when the BBC was in the hands of the noble Lord, Lord Hussey, and my noble friend Lord Barnett, something of this sort would simply <P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, when noble Lords read Hansard tomorrow, they will see what a disappointment Members on these Benches have been to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and a number of other noble Lords. None of the seven speeches that have been made from these Benches have rubbished the Hutton report; nor has anyone from these Benches ever accused the Prime Minister of lying.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para119"></a>I start with the statement in paragraph 472 of Hutton that was cited by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have decided that it is unnecessary for me to make any express recommendations because I have no doubt that the BBC and the Government will take note of the criticisms which I have made in this report".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para120"></a>
The absence of specific recommendations in the report was a mistake. At least initially, it allowed the Government to proclaim Hutton as bringing in a not guilty verdict, whereas we believe that the report and its evidence cry out for immediate action not just by the BBC but by the Government and others.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para121"></a>My noble friends Lady Williams of Crosby and Lord Wallace of Saltaire have already set out in persuasive detail the reasons why my party is not prepared to serve on the Butler committee. I look forward to hearing the clarification by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor asked for by the noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord King, of the terms of reference of the committee. I wish to concentrate my remarks on other areas where there is need for urgent action. In so doing I draw on my experience in public relations in the 20 years since I left the House of Commons. There is a self-mocking definition of public relations, which says "give us the truth and we will varnish it for you". So rather than debate the exact meaning of "sexing up", the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and I must agree that there is no doubt that a document which went through several coats of varnish, the document which Parliament thought was the unvarnished opinion of the Joint Intelligence Committee, had several coats of varnish applied by Mr Alastair Campbell.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para122"></a>The lessons from Hutton are very clear. Never again should a political appointee, and especially the Government's political propaganda chief, be so closely involved in the workings of our secret services. The role and powers given to Alastair Campbell when the Government came into power in 1997 were fraught with dangers for the political neutrality of the Civil Service and the integrity of the information services. There is an urgent need for a Civil Service Act to underpin the Northcote-Trevelyan principles of a politically neutral Civil Service promoted on merit.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para123"></a>The Government are in the process of finding a Civil Service head for their information services and have before them the Phillis report and the Public Administration Committee's draft Civil Service Act. They should move quickly on both reports to restore public confidence in these areas.
<P>


<a name="column_779"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 779</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para124"></a>While looking at Civil Service reform, the Government should also review their "duty of care" responsibilities. The noble Lord, Lord Howie, asked what was meant by "duty of care". The view of the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, seemed to be that "duty of care" was very sparse, but it is now standard practice for large companies to have established procedures for helping employees in trauma or stress or under the media spotlight. These would include professional counselling, physical protection from media intrusion, and assistance in dealing with media questioning, as the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, pointed out.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para125"></a>Reading the Hutton report, it is hard to find a specific and consistent duty of care procedure being employed. Indeed, a reading of the evidence suggests that Andrew Mackinlay MP was not far from the truth when he said that Dr Kelly had been hung out to dry. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, observed that Dr Kelly may well have been a difficult man to help. But helping the difficult cases is just why you have such procedures in place.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para126"></a>Another area where there is a need for government action is over Mr Alastair Campbell's assertion that parts of the BBC were operating to an anti-war agenda. That canard was repeated today by, among others, the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, and the noble Lords, Lord Marlesford, Lord Weidenfeld and Lord Gilbert. It was also said the other night by the noble Lord, Lord Jordan. It was that assertion by Alastair Campbell&#151;in its way as damaging to the reputation of the BBC as Gilligan's sexing-up accusation was to the Prime Minister&#151;which coloured and influenced the BBC response to the complaints coming from Campbell.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para127"></a>So I ask the Minister again tonight the question I first asked on 17 September 2003, which is whether the accusation made by Alastair Campbell of the BBC operating to an anti-war agenda was a statement reflecting the Government's official view. If not, Ministers should draw a line under that accusation by confirming all the academic studies undertaken since the war which show that there was no such bias in BBC reporting.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para128"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, identified some grievous faults in the management of the BBC, and as the noble Lord, Lord Alexander, pointed out, grievously has the BBC paid for them. But he seemed to take no account of the water in which modern media operations take place. In 1988 Michael Dukakis lost a commanding lead in the race for the White House because he was perceived to react too slowly to attacks on him by the media. From that experience came the technique of rapid rebuttal. It means responding to every critical story, using every channel of complaint, challenging the journalist, his superior and his superior's superior. It is aggressive, in-your-face and it works.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para129"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Hunt of Wirral and Lord Clinton-Davis, clashed over where and when spin started in Downing Street, but what is clear is that after the Labour 1992 defeat, new Labour studied rapid rebuttal techniques&#151;read The Unfinished <P>


<a name="column_780"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 780</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Revolution by Philip Gould&#151;and Alastair Campbell brought them into Downing Street in 1997. Anyone who saw him before the Select Committee, in his interview when he turned up uninvited at Channel 4 or in his multitude of post-Hutton interviews will have some hint of how that process of systematic intimidation works.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para130"></a>The reality was that the BBC was reacting not to an isolated complaint but to a pattern of behaviour that allowed a genuine complaint to be dismissed as another of Alastair's rants. The real failure of the BBC management was not to have in place a more thorough, fail-safe mechanism to deal with such a complaint from such a ruthless foe.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para131"></a>As I have said, the action needed now is for the Government to respond positively and quickly to the Phillis recommendations and for Mark Byford, the excellent acting director-general, to insist on back to basics in the standards of BBC journalism. In that respect, he will be greatly encouraged in that task by the authoritative maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, which will also create great confidence in the country as a whole.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para132"></a>What I do not find in Hutton is any justification for changes in the BBC that would reduce or undermine its role as the iron pole around which we construct high quality public-service broadcasting. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert: look at Fox News. For some time I have been thinking of suggesting to the House authorities that they should show Fox News in one of the television rooms so that noble Lords can watch it. If noble Lords watch it for an hour, they will see the future if we do not have the protection that the BBC affords us as regards quality of news reporting and standards. In some ways, only in the United Kingdom could one of the world's best-known, most trusted brand names be submitted to such sustained criticism. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, might inquire why, during the Iraq war, Internet users in their thousands in the United States switched to BBC news so that they could find the truth.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para133"></a>Of course the BBC should reform and improve, but so should the rest of the media. I was very impressed by the interventions of my noble friend Lord Goodhart but also by those of the noble Lords, Lord Lea, Lord Hannay and Lord Parekh, who spoke wise words about the nature of the media. They tie in closely with a section on this issue in the Puttnam report, which deals with the worrying, debilitating impact of the media on our national life. In today's Guardian, Mr Martin Kettle writes:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A month ago, the Phillis report on government communications set out some ways that the post-Campbell political world could clean up its act. These need to be followed through. But do we in the media have an equivalent awareness of the equally urgent need to raise our own game? I do not believe that we have even begun to realise the damage that some modern journalism is doing to the fabric of public and private life".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-11_para134"></a>
That is so very true. But I will have real hope only when I see such self-criticism written by Mr Trevor Kavanagh in the Sun.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para135"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, reminded us that the two greatest inheritances that we carried into this century from the previous one were our Civil Service <P>


<a name="column_781"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 781</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the BBC. The Hutton report shows that both are under threat. That is why the real lessons of Hutton have been spelt out from these Benches this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para136"></a>We want a full public inquiry into our reasons for going to war. We want an overhaul of our intelligence services. We want the Phillis recommendations on government communications to be implemented. We want a Civil Service Act to protect the public service ethos of our Civil Service. A clear duty of care procedure should be put in place throughout Whitehall. We want the BBC charter review to be conducted in such a way as to restore public confidence that the BBC will emerge strong and independent of government interference.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para137"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has been a little tetchy about the position taken on these Benches. Part of the problem is that he is on the cusp of two careers. He rather takes the lawyer's view. He has the judge's verdict, so he can go back to chambers, throw his wig in the corner, have a sherry and that is the end of the problem. But the political world operates differently. There is another jury&#151;that of public opinion, which will be tested finally at the ballot box.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alexander, referred to Suez. Perhaps the most honourable casualty of Suez was Sir Anthony Nutting, who called his memoirs, "No End of a Lesson". The sad and sorry story of Dr Kelly's untimely death has lessons for us all. The Hutton report will be of value only if the Government, as well as the BBC, accept the noble and learned Lord's invitation to learn those lessons and act accordingly.

It has included some of our most senior Members of the House&#151;those with wide experience in government and in the Civil Service.
<P>

<a name="40204-11_para140"></a>I start by congratulating my noble friend Lord Ryder of Wensum on his excellent maiden speech. Although he sits on the Cross Benches, I hope that I can still call him my noble friend.

<P>

<a name="40204-11_para142"></a>It deals with the war between the BBC and the Government, in which Dr Kelly became a pawn and chief victim. As the noble Lord, Lord McNally said, our debate points to the many lessons that need to be learnt right from the start of this sorry episode. There are lessons about the use of intelligence, the way in which Select Committees operate and how government treat their staff. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, reminded us earlier this afternoon that we should remember that the Hutton inquiry was first and foremost about the tragic loss of a gifted and honourable scientist.

<a name="40204-11_para143"></a>The noble and learned Lord completed his report last week, and I accepted its conclusions. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, that one can accept the conclusions of the report and still look at some of the things that were left out, and some of the issues that were not entirely resolved, such as the naming strategy. The noble Lord seems to be really annoyed that we accepted the report's conclusions and supported the war. That is what the noble Lord gets so excited about.

We have been equally consistent in calling for an inquiry to be held into the intelligence surrounding the war. It is becoming increasingly clear that there was a discrepancy between the intelligence assessment of the weapons of mass destruction and the reality on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para1"></a>As already mentioned, David Kay has said that he does not believe that weapons of mass destruction exist or existed in Iraq. I hope that the House agrees that it is possible both to support the war and to want to get at the truth. I am very glad that after so many months the Prime Minister has accepted the case for this inquiry; although after hearing the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor say on a television programme on Sunday that there was no need for a further inquiry, I was stunned to hear that view overturned within 24 hours. At last we have got an inquiry, and I am grateful for that.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40204-12_para2"></a>There has been much discussion about the terms of reference of the inquiry, so let me be clear about our understanding of it. We believe that the committee can and should consider the way in which the Government used the intelligence with which they had been provided. We believe that that is now included fairly and squarely in the terms of reference. That is why we agreed to them. I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will not take refuge in the mantra that it is for the committee to construe its terms of reference. They are the Government's terms of reference. They must know what they intend them to mean.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para3"></a>I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater for raising that. I look to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to confirm my view as clearly and unambiguously as I laid it out. The Government can already show their good intentions as regards this inquiry. As has already been referred to, writing in the Independent today, Dr Brian Jones (described at the Hutton inquiry as probably the most senior and experienced intelligence community official working on WMD) has made a specific request to the Prime Minister to publish the intelligence behind the Government's key claims that Iraq was actively producing chemical weapons and could launch an attack within 45 minutes of an order to do so.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para4"></a>Given that Saddam Hussein has been overthrown, he clearly does not believe that there is any reason or sensitivity for not publishing the intelligence. If there is such a reason, he thinks that it should be stated clearly. What is the response of the Government? As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor acknowledged today, there are specific criticisms of the MoD in the Hutton report, focusing on the way it treated Dr Kelly in relation to the naming process. Paragraph 432 of the report states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The principle fault lay in the failure of the MoD to inform Dr Kelly that the press office was going to confirm his name if a journalist suggested it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-12_para5"></a>
I shall not go over the ground again, but I hope that the noble and learned Lord listened carefully to my noble friends Lord Waddington and Lord Hunt of Wirral in their powerful contributions. I trust that right across government, attention will be paid in future to ensure that employees are given the care and respect they deserve, so that, as my noble friend Lord Hunt said, this can never happen again.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para6"></a>There are lessons, too, about the process of government; such as, the lack of documentary evidence of the conclusions of crucial meetings, which was commented on by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, in the course of the inquiry and, today, by the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, with all the weight of experience that he has at his disposal.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para7"></a>I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will reply to the charge made by my noble friends Lord Waddington and Lord Alexander of Weedon. Should not the Government have gone to greater lengths to avoid the kind of false interpretation that was placed on the 45-minute claim? As my noble friend said, when newspapers published headlines such as "45 minutes from attack" on the day of the <P>


<a name="column_784"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 784</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>September dossier, and "Brits 45 minutes from doom" the day after, should not the Government have made it clear that the claim in the dossier referred to battlefield weapons? That they did not is just one of the reasons why public confidence in the Government is so low. The public feel manipulated by the Government's omission.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para8"></a>My noble friends Lord Alexander of Weedon and Lord King raised also the question of the advice given by the Attorney-General. That is a crucial point. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will confirm that the Attorney-General's advice on the reasons for going to war will be made available to the Butler inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para9"></a>There are lessons to be learnt about how the operation of Select Committees could be improved. My noble friend Lord King asked why the Intelligence and Security Committee could not obtain the e-mails that were readily surrendered to the inquiry of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. In the previous Parliament, my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth chaired a commission of distinguished parliamentarians and constitutional experts and proposed ways to strengthen democratic control of the executive. What a pity those recommendations were not taken up by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para10"></a>Finally, I turn briefly to the BBC. The most serious and far-reaching repercussions of the Hutton report in the past week have been for the BBC. I join those noble Lords who have paid tribute to Gavyn Davies and Greg Dyke. Notwithstanding the criticisms of them in the Hutton report, they both made a significant contribution to the BBC. That something went seriously wrong in the BBC is not in any doubt, but I share the view of many noble Lords that the BBC, at its best, has no equal in the world. Some institutional changes are now required, which must be properly debated and fully thought through, so that another generation can benefit from the excellent reporting that has been so true in the past.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para11"></a>There is also an essential point of principle here. No one should underestimate the vital role that a free media plays in sustaining a vigorous and healthy democracy. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, himself states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The communication by the media of information (including information obtained by investigative reporters) on matters of public interest and importance is a vital part of life in a democratic society".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-12_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40204-12_para13"></a>There are clearly important lessons to be learnt from the report about how governments run their business. They are lessons for governments of all political parties. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will tell us what lessons the Government have learnt and what plans they hope to put into effect, and when. One view, shared by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is that the Government should commit themselves in this Session to a civil service Bill in order to restore a proper separation between the political and official arms of government. The independence and impartiality of the Civil Service need now to be given statutory reinforcement. If that were done, the tragic death of Dr Kelly might not have been in vain.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we have had a very full and impressive debate in many respects. I join noble Lords in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Ryder of Wensum, on his speech. Two things emerged from it: first, how brave he was to devote his maiden speech to a topic of such public interest; secondly, how mysterious it is that he has been silent during the past seven years when the quality of his speech was so high. I join with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, in saying that the country can be confident that the BBC will be in safe hands during the months when he is the acting chairman of that great organisation.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para14"></a>I shall not be able to address my closing remarks to every point that has been made before 10 o'clock, so I shall divide them into three areas: first, the comments on the Hutton report itself; secondly, comments on the forthcoming inquiry&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord King, have brought us intelligence of what has been said in the Commons in the hope that we might say something different in this House; and thirdly, the position of the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para15"></a>I turn first to the Hutton report. Three strands emerged in the debate. The first was the strand exemplified by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, and the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, who said, "We appointed a judge. Let us genuinely accept the report". The second strand was represented by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. They said that they accepted the report. They accepted, for example, the conclusion that the Government did not act dishonourably in relation to the naming strategy. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, then delivered a speech describing the Government as "throwing Dr Kelly to the media". Those are not the words of honour. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, made it explicit that she accepts the wording of the report. The report states that it was perfectly proper for discussions to take place between Downing Street officials and members of the JIC. She then made a series of remarks to the effect that she did not regard that as proper; indeed, she regarded it as "sexing up the document". So the second strand comprises those who say that they accept the report, but then operate in precisely the opposite way.
<P>

<a name="40204-12_para16"></a>The third strand comprises, as one would expect, the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who are absolutely straightforward: they said that they do not accept many of the findings. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, put his finger precisely on the point. Because the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has published all his evidence, some people think that they can have a shot at forming their own view and putting themselves in a position that might be regarded as superior to that of the noble and learned Lord.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. That was not my proposition. I made it perfectly clear that I accept the main finding of Hutton in respect of Gilligan's untruthfulness about the position of the <P>


<a name="column_786"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 786</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Prime Minister and the Government on inserting stuff into the dossier in which they did not believe. I repeat, I made that perfectly clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I was complimenting the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, on his straightforwardness. I understood him to say quite clearly at one stage that some of the findings of the noble and learned Lord were&#151;I think I am using his word&#151;perverse. Of course I do not dispute that he accepts some of the findings, but others he took absolutely head-on.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para0"></a>The best example of the "I accept, but do not really accept" strand arises over the question of whether improper pressure was put on the JIC in relation to material put into the dossier of 24 September. Before one comes to a conclusion on that, it is worth pointing out what was the accepted context of that dossier. Some demand was made by all political parties for the Government to set out their case, including intelligence in relation to the position on weapons of mass destruction. No dissent was expressed by other political parties about doing that. It was recognised that it was unusual and it was of course recognised that both the intelligence services and the JIC would have to be completely involved in it. However, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, found, so would the Prime Minister, who would be responsible for presenting it to Parliament. If he was involved in presenting it to Parliament, plainly he was entitled to be satisfied about its contents, as long as it was owned by the JIC.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para1"></a>We had the spectacle this afternoon of some noble Lords picking over a number of e-mails and remarking, "Well, this or that should not have been agreed. That had a damaging effect in relation to the dossier". I remind noble Lords that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, heard from Mr Scarlett, the chairman of the JIC, Sir Richard Dearlove, the chief of SIS, Sir David Omand, Permanent Secretary at the Cabinet Office and former head of the GCHQ and former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, Air-Marshal Sir Joseph French, the Chief of Defence Intelligence and Mr Anthony Cragg, the Deputy-Chief of Defence Intelligence. He heard from every single one of those people on whether the JIC honestly thought that the assessment was valid and a fair consideration of the intelligence.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, also had the benefit of looking at the very same e-mails. The reason why, in my submission, judges of the eminence and calibre of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, are appointed to look into such issues is because dispassionately&#151;away from politics, from trying to establish the point of view of a particular political persuasion, from trying to damage the political party in power or to score political points&#151;it is possible to come to a firm and final conclusion about what happened.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para3"></a>I ask those noble Lords in either the second or third category&#151;the second category being those who say that they accept the report, but then take the findings <P>


<a name="column_787"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 787</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>obliquely; the third category being those who seek explicitly to reject the findings&#151;to reflect on the work carried out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, would the noble and learned Lord's argument on the e-mails be stronger if in any of those e-mails the Office of the Prime Minister had sometimes said, "Hold on, are you sure about that?" In none of them did it say that: they all said, "Hack on; make it stronger; make it quicker". Those of us who find that section of the report so difficult would be far more sympathetic to the view put forward by the noble and learned Lord if there was a counter-argument by someone saying, "Are you sure you've got it right?"

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Earl knows, in the e-mails corrections of fact were made that were neither strengthening nor weakening. I am asking him to consider&#151;and he is a man much admired in the House&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, flattery will get you everywhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, that is why I said it. Will he consider the possibility that if he had heard the evidence of those members of the JIC and also considered the e-mails, he might have come to same conclusion as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton? There is a danger in the approach taken to the conclusions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, by so many people in this House and beyond. I am sure that such opinions are held in good faith, but what is the point of appointing a judge who has gone through the evidence in such detail and then seeking to pick away at his findings?
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para4"></a>The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, was exactly as one would expect from an advocate of his power. It was an advocate speech that did not really take on board the work carried out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para5"></a>I turn to the report's main findings. First, was the document sexed up? It was not, the noble and learned Lord said, in the sense understood by the people listening to the Gilligan broadcast. It was not sexed up in the way described by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and it was not sexed up as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, put it. He said that it was exaggerated, which is not accepted by the JIC.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para6"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, if "sexed up" means acting consistent with the intelligence available, then it was sexed up in that sense. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, finds that, but he says that it was perfectly proper to operate on that basis. That is the conclusion that she contests.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para7"></a>With regard to the naming of Dr Kelly, the Government found themselves in the position where two parliamentary inquiries were either going on or about to start in relation to the issue that the Government had wrongly sexed up the document. In effect, Mr Gilligan's allegations were being considered by the two parliamentary committees.
<P>


<a name="column_788"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 788</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para8"></a>Plainly the most material aspect of Mr Gilligan's report was who was the source of that report. He had told the Foreign Affairs Committee that there was a single source. If the single source, or someone who might be the source, came forward, how was it possible, consistent with propriety, for that fact not to be revealed to the committees? That view was taken by Sir David Omand, Sir Kevin Tebbit, Sir David Manning, all of the officials involved and all the Ministers involved. What conclusion would have been drawn if it were known that the Government knew who the source was and hid that information from the two committees?
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, heard evidence from the chairman of the FAC; the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee and from a member of the FAC, Mr Andrew Mackinlay. He also read the evidence from when Dr Kelly gave evidence and noted the series of questions asked by Sir John Stanley about when the Government first discovered that Dr Kelly might be the source.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para10"></a>Once it became clear to the Government that they had to disclose that fact to the committee, the question was not whether his name would be disclosed but how it would be disclosed. The evidence accepted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was that the name was not disclosed in a straightforward, clear and clean way because they were not 100 per cent sure at that stage that it was Dr Kelly. That evidence was accepted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. He described the conduct of the Government as not dishonourable.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para11"></a>His account of events is entirely inconsistent with the account given by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington. If one asks oneself the question "Is it plausible that once the name was known to the Government they had to disclose it?", the answer is "Yes, it plainly is". The Government fully accept and must learn from the fact that much more care could have been taken in relation to Dr Kelly, and we apologise unreservedly for that.
<P>

<a name="40204-13_para12"></a>Equally, it is perfectly plain that, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better if the name had been disclosed in a press release at a time identified by the Government and notified to Dr Kelly. But that is not the same as saying that a dishonourable course was followed. I am glad to see Members on the Benches opposite nodding in relation to that. That is why, when asked do I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said, I must reply "No, I most certainly do not". The implication of what he said is that the conduct of the Government, both Ministers and civil servants, was dishonourable, and I do not believe for one moment that it was.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has quoted Sir Kevin Tebbit, but not as in paragraph 51 where the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, quotes him as saying that he did not recommend to the Government that the evidence given by Dr David Kelly should be disclosed. He wanted it kept secret. <P>


<a name="column_789"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 789</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That is clearly set out on page 33 of the report. The only point that Sir Kevin added was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I do, however, believe it necessary to have defensive material available should the story leak".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-13_para13"></a>
It leaked with the authority of the Prime Minister. I do not believe that Sir Kevin anticipated that.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, with the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I believe that is at an early point in the story. If one looks at Sir Kevin's views as the story develops, he becomes increasingly concerned that the name will leak out and he agrees to the issuing of the press release on 8 July. He approaches it on the basis that it is almost inevitable that the name will come out; he proceeds on the basis that the inevitability of the name coming out has been told by Mr Hatfield to Dr Kelly a few days before. Obviously I shall read very closely the part of the report referred to by the noble Lord, but if one looks at the whole story and the way in which Sir Kevin's thinking develops, I believe one will find that that is only a part of the story.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   My Lords, is the Lord Chancellor saying basically that the procedure used then will never be used again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, it is a very unusual situation. Of course we need to learn lessons from it. In the light of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, has said, we have obviously learnt that it would have been much better for a press statement to be issued disclosing the name. There should have been a close discussion between Dr Kelly and officials, and then a time agreed in relation to it. That is the conclusion reached by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para0"></a>But again I come back to the point that he has made it absolutely clear that there was no dishonour in what was done. It was a very difficult situation. That was his view and I earnestly ask noble Lords to look at the report and to consider whether or not what the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said on a previous occasion was appropriate. The noble Lord, Lord King, also referred to this today. On 28 January the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, ended his remarks by saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"So will the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor apologise fully and unreservedly to Dr Kelly and his family on behalf of the Government? When he replies will he also say, without qualification, what the Prime Minister failed to say; "We are sorry that our actions led to Dr Kelly's death and we apologise unreservedly"?".&#151;[Official Report, 28/1/04; col. 216.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-14_para1"></a>
I know that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, will now be aware that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, made it absolutely clear, in wording that refers to officials and Ministers alike, just as the wording of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, covers officials and politicians alike:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am further satisfied that none of those persons was as fault in not contemplating that Dr Kelly might take his own life".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-14_para2"></a>
So when the noble Lord complains of tetchiness, I apologise for that. But one of the things that is of considerable sensitivity on the matter is that those <P>


<a name="column_790"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 790</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people who did their best in the Government&#151;officials and politicians alike&#151;fear that whatever may happen they will always be accused of causing Dr Kelly's death.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para3"></a>I shall move on to the new inquiry, which we are calling the Butler inquiry. I support all noble Lords who have said, "Let the inquiry take place and let's accept that it has been set up in good faith; and let us not criticise the noble Lord, Lord Butler, before he has even started looking at the issues".
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord King, asked a number of questions about the terms of reference. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said in another place and my noble friend Baroness Symons said in this place that of course it will be a matter for the chairman to explore the terms of reference with committee members to decide the appropriate limit of the remit. To suggest that the chairman will not consider the terms of his remit is, with great respect, not sensible.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para5"></a>As far as Her Majesty's Government are concerned, picking up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made clear that the terms of reference exclude ground already so thoroughly covered by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. I do not think that any of us wants the report to go over the ground that has already been covered. It has been made absolutely clear that it excludes any consideration of whether the Government were justified in taking military action. That conclusion, which has been accepted by the Conservatives, is not a matter for a committee; it is a matter for the elected politicians.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para6"></a>The terms of reference include, among other things,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to examine any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the Government before the conflict, and between that intelligence and what has been discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end of the conflict".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-14_para7"></a>
Clearly, Ministers do not gather intelligence. As my noble friend Lady Symons explained yesterday, they do not evaluate it. That is done elsewhere in the Government machine. Ministers and governments do use intelligence, as the noble Lord, Lord King, mentioned. That is plainly covered in the terms of reference and it always has been since the terms of reference were agreed. I understand from looking at Hansard that the right honourable Mr Michael Ancram, the shadow Foreign Secretary, has accepted that the terms of reference are acceptable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, before we move on to another interesting and possibly contentious point, the right honourable Michael Ancram's points were made yesterday, if he is quoting Hansard. Since then an issue has arisen. Since the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is being extremely helpful, can he give a straightforward answer to a question? Are the uses made by the Government of that intelligence within the remit of the terms of reference?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the terms of reference are explicit in relation to that, so I am not <P>


<a name="column_791"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column 791</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>quite clear what the question meant. Before I answered the question, because the terms of reference were explicit, I thought I should think very carefully. The terms of reference, as the noble Lord knows, specifically refer to the use of intelligence by government and I explicitly accept that "government" includes officials and Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way again. I am sorry that he did not just say, "Yes", because that would have been most helpful. As was made clear by the Leader of the Conservative Party on the radio this morning, the use by the Government of the intelligence is within the terms of reference. The noble and learned Lord knows&#151;he is extremely clever and I respect him for that&#151;that the terms of reference could be ambiguous. So that there is no misunderstanding before the committee starts its work on an extremely challenging task, could he just say, "Yes" in answer to my question: do the terms of reference cover the use of intelligence by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Yes, of course, my Lords. I have said that three times now. Obviously I was not making myself adequately clear and I apologise. I understand from what the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord King of Bridgwater, said that the Prime Minister said that the Attorney-General's advice would be available. That is not my understanding of what was said in another place. The position is that the Government made it absolutely clear that they will co-operate fully. Noble Lords know perfectly well what the arrangements are in relation to the Attorney-General's advice. For the past 30 years it has not been disclosed, although as the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, pointed out on a number of occasions, it has on a few occasions been released&#151;normally in the context of judicial proceedings such as the Factortame case. If and in so far as I am wrong and my right honourable friend said something else, no doubt the noble Lord, Lord King, can rely on what was said in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Alexander of Weedon: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. In view of all the doubts that have been expressed about the legality of the war, would it not be much better if we did not have to rely on a summary view given by the Attorney-General, but that the window was opened to his full advice so that those of us&#151;and there are many&#151;who think that the war was unlawful in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>international law will have the opportunity of evaluating his advice and, if that advice is sound, reconsidering our view?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord knows, I was a Law Officer. The Law Officers, in their current modern form, have been rightly extraordinarily astute to ensure that their advice is not normally disclosed. If it were to be disclosed as a matter of course, exactly the sorts of blandishments the noble Lord, Lord Alexander, puts so persuasively would be put in every case. My noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith rightly agreed that there should be a summary of the legal basis for using armed force. It was utterly clear what that basis was and international lawyers are able to evaluate and debate the issue fully on the basis of that advice.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para8"></a>I should say, although I do not express it as a concluded view, that the terms of reference of the inquiry are to look at discrepancies in the intelligence and what has now been found in relation to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Superficially, it is quite difficult to see at this particular point the connection between that and the legal advice of the Attorney-General. But no doubt at some stage the connection would be made in a clearer form.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para9"></a>Finally&#151;and I am sorry I have spoken for so long&#151;the BBC. Everyone knows that there was a row with the BBC. Please no one take the view that the Government have any view other than they want to see a strong, independent BBC holding us to account, being the glory of the world in relation to the quality of what it provides. But, equally, if we think the BBC has told the wrong story and maligned us, it does not mean that we cannot object in relation to it. All that we would expect is not that the BBC withdraws in relation to the story, but takes the trouble just to look at it.
<P>

<a name="40204-14_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ryder, in his powerful speech, made it clear that many of the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, in relation to the BBC were on the basis of an acceptance by the BBC of the various problems that have arisen as a result of what has happened. It was not that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, made findings against, in many cases, the wishes of the BBC. There was a mature acceptance of the fact that things could get better. In relation to both the Government and the BBC there needs to be that mature acceptance. That entirely depends upon people accepting the report, rather than trying to cherry-pick bits of it to make political points. The whole point of asking the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, to make his report was so that that would not happen.

<a name="40204-15_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 76(7) lays down that, if an offence under this section is committed by a Scottish firm with the consent of a partner, that person is guilty of the offence and liable to prosecution. Will the Minister explain why, according to the Bill, that person will not be dealt with in the same manner and with the same safeguards as an offender in another part of Great Britain? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, on her acuity in spotting this issue, but I reassure her that it is not an oversight on our part that there is no specific mention of Scotland in Clause 77(3). There is no need to provide for proceedings in Scotland here. The Lord Advocate ensures the same result; namely, prosecutions can be instituted only by central government agencies without specific enactment. The amendment, therefore, is unnecessary, and I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. We try to look through Bills fairly carefully, as the noble Lord knows well. If he assures me that the amendment is not necessary, I must obviously beg leave to withdraw it.

 "MODIFICATION OF LICENCE CONDITIONS FOR OFFSHORE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
(1) If the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to do so for purposes connected with offshore transmission or offshore distribution, he may&#151;
<br>
(a) modify the standard conditions of transmission licences or distribution licences;
<br>
(b) modify, for purposes that in relation to modifications made under paragraph (a) are incidental, consequential or transitional purposes, the conditions of a particular transmission licence or a particular distribution licence;
<br>
(c) modify a code maintained in accordance with the conditions of a transmission licence or a distribution licence; and
<br>
(d) modify an agreement that gives effect to a code so maintained.
<br>
(2) Before making a modification under this section, the Secretary of State must consult&#151;
<br>
(a) the holder of any licence being modified; and
<br>
(b) such other persons as he considers appropriate.
<br>
(3) Subsection (2) may be satisfied by consultation that took place wholly or partly before the commencement of this section.

(4) The Secretary of State must publish every modification made by him under this section.
<br>
(5) The publication must be in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.

(6) Where the Secretary of State makes modifications under subsection (1)(a) of the standard conditions of licences of any type, GEMA must&#151;
<br>
(a) make (as nearly as may be) the same modifications of those standard conditions for the purposes of their incorporation in licences of that type granted after that time; and
<br>
(b) publish the modifications in such manner as it considers appropriate.
<br>
(7) A modification under subsection (1)(b) of part of a standard condition of a licence does not prevent any other part of the condition from continuing to be regarded as a standard condition for the purposes of Part 1 of the 1989 Act.

(8) The Secretary of State's powers under this section are exercisable only during the eighteen months beginning with the commencement of this section.
<br>
(9) In this section&#151;
<br>
"offshore distribution" means distribution within an area of offshore waters of electricity generated by a generating station in such an area;
<br>
"offshore transmission" means transmission within an area of offshore waters of electricity generated by a generating station in such an area; and

"offshore waters" means&#151;
<br>
(a) waters in or adjacent to Great Britain which are between the mean low water mark and the seaward limits of the territorial sea; and

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-15_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall attempt a second time to move Amendment No. 106EC. I anticipated this debate with great fervour. That is why I was so enthusiastic to move on to this group of amendments. There are 11 government amendments in total, and I shall speak to those. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I do not address myself to the other amendments in the group tabled until Opposition spokespersons have had the chance to speak to their amendments. Then I shall seek to reply to them.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para15"></a>Let me make the obvious point that the Government tabled the 11 amendments to supplement the existing clauses in the Bill providing the basic framework for the regulation of offshore electric lines. The first four amendments each introduce a new clause, while the remaining seven make consequential changes to existing clauses.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty indicated at Second Reading that the Government would table amendments. Clause 79 provides for the extension of the four prohibitions in the Electricity Act 1989 to offshore areas as far as the outer limits of the renewable energy zones. That also has the effect of extending the licensing and exemption regime to those areas. The need for the regulation stems from the moves to much bigger-scale offshore renewable energy generation, most of which is focused on wind energy.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para17"></a>The first generation of offshore wind farms was relatively small and widely dispersed around our coasts. However, the Crown Estate has recently <P>


<a name="column_GC344"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>announced site lease awards for a second generation of offshore wind farms, which will be much larger and concentrated in three strategic areas. While the process of obtaining the relevant construction consents for the 15 sites involved has yet to be gone through, we expect these wind farms ultimately to generate between 5.4 and 7.2 gigawatts of electricity, the higher figure being enough to meet the needs of around 4 million homes.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para18"></a>Given the upsurge in offshore generation, the Government are clear that there needs to be appropriate regulation of the generation and of the connections to the main grid system. Regulation will help ensure that the cabling infrastructure required is provided efficiently and that a proliferation of relatively thin cables from individual wind farms is avoided. We are looking to allow a number of wind farm connections to be marshalled at transmission hub points offshore through thicker cables. We also want to ensure that the connections put in place allow fair and open access to the grid for offshore generation.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para19"></a>Amendment No. 106ECg empowers the Secretary of State to modify the standard conditions of offshore transmission and distribution licences and make consequential and incidental changes to particular transmission or distribution licences. Such a power is necessary because we foresee that the different offshore environment may, as a matter of practicality, necessitate some change to standard conditions. For example, the differences in engineering involved when putting cables into the sea rather than on land may require some changes to licence conditions.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para20"></a>We considered whether it would be sufficient to take account of the particularities of offshore circumstances by applying special conditions to each individual licence. However, we believe it will provide greater clarity and transparency for the industry if we specifically set out the modifications within the standard conditions that will apply in relation to offshore areas. The exact scope of the modifications remains to be established, and any proposals for modifications will be the subject of formal consultation. We anticipate that offshore and onshore licence conditions should remain the same unless there are good reasons to make changes.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para21"></a>We are also conscious of the need to avoid uncertainty among licence holders, and we do not intend to take an ongoing power to make modifications. The power is exercisable only within 18 months of commencement of the section. We have notified the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform of our intention to take this power.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para22"></a>The new clause inserted by Amendment No. 106EDg enables the Secretary of State to extend the system operator licence to apply to offshore. Chapter 1 of Part 3 sets out the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements provision. They are designed to create a single trading market in wholesale electricity in Britain, with all the resulting benefits. Broadly speaking, the activity of transmission will be divided into two parts&#151;system operation and the provision of transmission assets.
<P>


<a name="column_GC345"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para23"></a>I hope noble Lords will forgive me for using the acronym BETTA from now on, as it is a mouthful to spell out in full each time. I take it that, in this part of the Bill, we will all have to take care to ensure that Hansard reporters and others know that we are referring to BETTA, not using the word "better".
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para24"></a>The essential part of BETTA is that there is a single system operator for the whole of the British transmission system. Although licensing of the GB system operator cannot take place until certain provisions in the Bill have received Royal Assent, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has already indicated that she is minded to agree that National Grid Company plc's application for this role should be accepted. However, current transmission licences extend only to the British shoreline, and the changes to be made under BETTA will not alter that. That means that we need a power to extend the system operator licence to cover offshore areas. In addition, the changes to the system operator licence may have a consequential effect on other electricity licences, so the clause includes the power to make any changes necessary to those licences to take account of the extension of the system operator licence.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para25"></a>Exercise of the power will again be subject to prior consultation and must happen within 18 months of commencement of this section. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has been made aware of our intention to take this power.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para26"></a>Government Amendment No. 106EE enables the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to make regulations setting out the process to be followed by it in awarding offshore transmission licences by competitive tender. As I mentioned, BETTA will result in the activity of transmission being divided in two: system operation and provision of transmission assets. There are no offshore transmission licences, and it will be necessary to grant such licences to allow the necessary transmission infrastructure to be established and operated offshore.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para27"></a>In awarding licences, GEMA will have to act in accordance with its statutory duties. The regulations will require the approval of the Secretary of State but will not be subject to a parliamentary procedure. Once more, we have notified the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee accordingly.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para28"></a>The new clause inserted by Amendment No. 132ZAg amends Section 64 of the Electricity Act 1989 to define high-voltage lines for offshore areas. The Electricity Act did not originally contemplate offshore transmission, so the definition of "high voltage" applies only in England, Wales and Scotland. Currently, 132-kilovolt lines are defined as high voltage lines in Scotland but not in England and Wales. That is because, in Scotland, 132-kilovolt lines are generally used for the bulk transfer of electricity, whereas in England and Wales such lines are mainly used to distribute electricity.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para29"></a>The definition of "high voltage" is important, as it feeds into what constitutes a transmission system. A transmission system must be wholly or mainly made up of high-voltage lines. The amendment makes it <P>


<a name="column_GC346"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clear that offshore lines of 132 kilovolts and above will be high-voltage lines, if such a line conveys electricity from an offshore generating station. That is because such offshore lines will be used for the purpose of bulk conveyance of electricity and so are more appropriately classified as high-voltage lines.
<P>

<a name="40204-15_para30"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 141Ag to 141Fg and 149 will make minor changes, which are a consequence of the first four amendments, the nub of our present debate. They each make adjustments to cross-references in the Bill to take account of the new clauses if they are approved. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40204-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 106EC, Amendment No. 106ECA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Line 22, leave out "in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate" and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-16_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(a) in writing to all holders or applicants for licences who may be affected by such modifications, and
<br>
(b) in the case of the licences referred to in subsection (1)(b), by publishing the same in at least two national daily newspapers and any appropriate trade journal or journals"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-16_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: Before I move my amendment, perhaps I may say to the Minister that the way in which the amendments are numbered, with ZAAs and so forth, is a nightmare and makes it difficult for us to find our place. What makes it even more difficult is that on the groupings list the letter "g" has been included. However, that is not part of the amendment number, as the Minister will see from the Marshalled List. He referred to the amendments as including the letter "g", but that is not necessary. I say that only because it is confusing enough, and when we start looking for the letter "g", we do not find it. I might even suggest to those in the Whips' Office who prepared the Marshalled List that including the letter "g" is less than helpful.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para2"></a>In moving Amendment No. 106ECA, as an amendment to government Amendment No. 106EC, I shall speak also to my Amendment No. 106EDA, which is an amendment to government Amendment No. 106ED. Both of those amendments introduce a new clause to the Bill. With the leave of the Committee, I would also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 115, 117, 120, 124 and 130. They make exactly the same point that I am making in those two amendments. It will be easier for the Committee if I speak to them now, rather than come back and repeat myself later. If I may, I will also speak later to Amendment No. 106EF, which is an amendment to the government Amendment No. 106EE, which the Minister has also spoken to in this group. The further five amendments are to Clauses 106, 109, 118, 122 and 140. Those are the amendments that I just said that I would group with them, with the leave of the Committee. All have the same effect as the amendment to the two proposed new clauses.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para3"></a>Each of the clauses relates to the modification of energy trading and transmission licence conditions, or creating new standard transmission licence conditions, <P>


<a name="column_GC347"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or licences for electricity and gas interconnectors and standard licences for energy administration. Each of the clauses gives the Secretary of State power to make and to vary the terms of general or specific licences.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para4"></a>There is no real, major objection&#151;although there may be some around the edges&#151;to what is a necessary administrative process, as the noble Lord outlined. However, the Government seem to have a penchant for trying to give Secretaries of State carte blanche to take major administrative steps in any way they choose by passing the normal democratic processes of publicity. That will not do. If there are things that we are generally going to accept, but we leave it to the Government, we cannot give them carte blanche to deal with them in any way they like.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para5"></a>I remind the Committee&#151;with some pride, because I won&#151;of a battle that I had with the Government over provisions in the Employment Act 2002, which enabled the Secretary of State to amend that Act, either by primary or secondary legislation, or otherwise. That is fine&#151;primary or secondary legislation&#151;but the word "otherwise" is extremely worrying. It took an attempted amendment at each stage, and finally the interventions of two noble and learned Law Lords, before the Minister at the end gave in and thought it was not correct. They are sort of at it again.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para6"></a>Noble Lords might remember that only yesterday when we were discussing Clause 75(7), we discussed first exploitation and then exploration. The rest of that sentence says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'exploration' includes the doing of anything (whether by way of investigations, trials or feasibility studies or otherwise)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-16_para7"></a>
We all stopped reading at the word "anything". That little word "otherwise" crept in, and I did not notice it yesterday. That is exactly how it is here; the Government are at it again. They want to publicise matters that ought to be fully in the public domain in such a manner as the Secretary of State "considers appropriate"&#151;not even, the Committee will note, in such a manner as should be "reasonable". The words used are "as the Secretary of State considers appropriate".
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para8"></a>As drafted, the clauses could mean that the Secretary of State could publicise the terms or variations of licences by a classified advertisement in the Beano, or putting it on a lamp-post in the Outer Hebrides. The Committee may think that that is extremely fanciful, but it might be interested to know of a recent case where the courts held that notice of a planning application for a radio mast was validly given, even though it was posted far too far from the road for it to be read by any passer-by. It was impossible for anyone to read it, but it was considered to be OK. I only wish that I could give the Committee the name of the case; I have searched but I have not yet found it. However, I hope that by the end of the passage of this Energy Bill, which seems to be going on forever, I will have found that name. I notice that the Minister raised his eyebrows; perhaps he does not feel quite so concerned about the matter as we do.
<P>


<a name="column_GC348"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC348</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para9"></a>The absurdity is that, in the terms of the clauses as drafted, the Secretary of State need not even specifically or directly tell the licensee about the variation of the licence. Instead, he could leave it to him to find out for himself that the licence had been varied and the terms of the variation. The licences referred to in the clauses are not merely valuable commercial rights; they impose duties on the licensee and probably create rights for the consumers of gas and electricity. Details of those must be in the public domain and, one hopes, in the sight of vigilant members of both Houses of Parliament and the local and national media.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para10"></a>The terms of my amendments are identical. They remove from the Secretary of State the power to publish licence details merely in any way that he considers appropriate, including in any obscure or secretive way he thinks appropriate. Perhaps the Secretary of State is taking to heart the Latin root of the word "secretary"&#151;secretarius, meaning "secret".
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para11"></a>In place of the potential obscurity that the Secretary of State wants to impose on the licensing process, I propose two very simple changes. First, the Secretary of State must notify all licensees in writing of the terms of their licences and any changes in those terms. Secondly, he must publish details of the conditions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in at least two national daily newspapers and any appropriate trade journal"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-16_para12"></a>
or "journals", if there are more than one. There is a slight variation in the case of the amendment to Clause 106, which includes a reference to particular licences as distinct from general licences.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para13"></a>The amendments would not in any way detract from the licensing powers of the Secretary of State; they do not impose in any way an administrative burden on the Secretary of State. There are several agencies which, for a modest fee and in response to a simple letter, would see to everything, if there is no in-house agency in the department&#151;although I suspect that there probably is. The amendments would not add to the cost for the taxpayer, as the expense would be met by the licensee. The amendment would support what the party opposite claims as one of its objectives&#151;which is why I think it will like the amendments. It supports open government, which is a very important thing.
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para14"></a>Amendment No. 106EF would amend Amendment No. 106EE, to which the Minister spoke. As he explained, the Government propose to introduce a whole new clause providing for competitive tendering for what, we may assume, would be lucrative off-shore transmission licences. There is clearly no objection to an obviously necessary concept, although I have to ask why the Government have only just thought about that two months after the publication of the Bill and long after the Bill was first mooted. However, there is one area in which the tendering process is deficient: it does not stipulate the most important feature of the tendering process, namely its publication to prospective interested parties. Despite the details of the tendering procedure set out in subsection (2), that essential ingredient is omitted.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para15"></a>Over the past few years, the Chamber and Committees have rung with government pledges about openness and with the buzzword, "transparency". Let me say at once that I do not for one moment suggest that the authority now or in future would act in any way other than with the utmost integrity. I am also prepared to assume, as it is nearly always so, that it will act with utmost good faith. In fact, I would say that that was always so. However, circumstances could arise in which, for some reason of expediency or others, it could be necessary&#151;because the authority did not have the necessary time or ability, or whatever&#151;to grant a licence without the fullest implementation of normal commercial tendering procedure, which means advertising the offer to the widest possible audience. Furthermore, circumstances could arise in which, in what might be called an executive decision, the authority decided that the competitive process called for under subsection (1), and the procedure needed to be curtailed without, of course, breaching the procedure laid down in subsection (2).
<P>

<a name="40204-16_para16"></a>I say at once, in anticipation of what I believe the Minister will say, that I acknowledge, as I have already done, that it is quite likely&#151;even probable or, if the Minister insists, certain&#151;that the tendering process will be carried out with absolute probity. I am also aware that the licences may be subject to rules laid down in Brussels. Nevertheless, there is a legal maxim that, if justice is to be done, it definitely&#151;certainly&#151;needs to be seen to be done. By analogy, if tendering is a form of open competition, it must be seen to be open. That means that it should be seen to be open not only by potential rival bidders and the financial and trade press but by that hypothetical man who is always riding up and down on the top of the Clapham omnibus. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40204-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in his place. I have warned him of what is to come, albeit at a much later stage in the Bill. However, the trouble is that we have hit the point now. I have been trying to get to the root of the peculiar planning procedures which exist for electricity generation and transmission. The Committee should know this, so I shall not give all the background information. Suffice it to say that thus far I have got back to the Town and Country Planning Act 1962, where I find a clause which states, more or less, that any relevant Minister can grant permission for the development of relevant land so long as he does it under any enactment&#151;that is, an enactment prior to 1962. As I now have to explore the whole gamut of legislation relating to public utilities, I suspect that I shall stop and invite the Government to have a look at the whole problem.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para0"></a>The matter becomes relevant here because, under Clause 150, special provisions are made for additional planning inspectors in relation to major generation applications and, indeed, major transmission applications. In fact, the clause is precisely in line with what has been said about local government in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, which is going through on the Floor of the House. It seems to <P>


<a name="column_GC350"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC350</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me that, at least as a question of principle, we need to explore whether it is appropriate to have special planning provisions for particular utilities.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para1"></a>I do not want to get into that now, but it becomes relevant because, while the generation is offshore, it is absolutely appropriate and proper that it is dealt with under this Bill. Indeed, while the transmission&#151;I see that it is to be 132 kilovolts, which is the Scottish figure&#151;is offshore, there is absolutely no problem, but what will happen when it comes ashore? I am not certain whether it comes ashore at the low-tide or the high-tide mark, and that may be important. We are talking about the really high-powered transmission lines. There is a distinction on the mainland because, as the Minister pointed out, 132 kilovolts is the Scottish high-power level and the English high-power level is 230 kilovolts. So there is a distinction there that we perhaps need to think about. But once that line is ashore, it needs planning permission. The current high-power transmission lines by and large do not go to the shore; they stop somewhere short of it. Of course, a lot of low-power transmission lines will run right out to the shoreline, but I believe it is rare to find a high-power transmission line that does so.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para2"></a>How is that to be dealt with? It appears from the Bill that it is to be dealt with by the Minister by order. However, it seems to me that that is in breach of all the planning principles that we have. I raise the matter because we need to think carefully about it. I refer to the high-power transmission lines that we already have and the high-power transmission line that stops at the shoreline. How will that matter be decided? It seems to me that it certainly cannot be decided just by ministerial order. The construction of such a line would have to go through a planning process of some sort.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para3"></a>I do not want to bring the whole system to a halt, but we need an answer to that question. I suspect the Minister will say that he will need to think about it. There is a serious problem here that will result in communities the length of our shores jumping up and down, if we do not find a satisfactory answer to it.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   We may eventually reach Amendment No. 107, which deals with the effect of the Bill on various shipping interests both with regard to freedom of navigation and safety at sea. On listening to the Minister, I thought that there were some issues involved in the matter that we are discussing that might also affect shipping. I am not clear from what he said whether these high-power transmission lines are to be above the sea on pylons or below the sea or perhaps a combination of both. If they are above the sea, they may interfere considerably with shipping, not least with pleasure boats, yachts and so on. If they are below the sea, they may also create problems. Either way, it seems likely that they may have effects on radios used by shipping and on navigational instruments. Underwater cables may have an effect on depth sounders.
<P>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para4"></a>I presume that those factors have been taken carefully into account by the Government in considering the various sites at which wind farms might be located. If that is the case, no doubt the Minister can tell us what conclusions the Government have reached regarding how serious these issues may be. They ought to be considered carefully. Above-sea transmission cables could increase the area in which shipping is impeded, even though those routes may have existed for a long time. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us what the situation is, give us reassurance and in particular, given the overall context of the Bill mentioned by my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon, tell us what the situation is regarding planning permission. Foreign ships may not be immediately aware of the potential dangers posed to their freedom of navigation by the granting of planning permission by an authority in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   Following on from what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has just said, even if the transmission cables were to be buried&#151;as is the case with telegraph cables&#151;there might still be a problem with fishing craft using bottom trawling gear. That is a matter that the Government must look into.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-17_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   In his opening remarks, the Minister mentioned that the Secretary of State's power under this amendment and Amendment No. 106ED was exercisable only during the 18 months beginning with the commencement of the section. Although that may be a worthy intention, does the Minister perhaps not agree that as licences are gradually granted for the generation of power by wind farms, modifications may be required in licence conditions after 18 months, when the experience is gained? Should the Government so restrict themselves when glaring modifications may be required after that time? In particular, new subsection (1)(c) would modify a code maintained in accordance with the conditions. What would the process be to make a sensible modification to the licence conditions after that period?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  I apologise first of all to the Committee and, in particular, to my noble friend Lord Davies for not being here at the beginning of the debate on the amendment. I had assumed that, as the first amendment was a Scottish amendment, it might last some considerable time.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para5"></a>A range of issues has been raised. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, is touching on something which comes much later in the Bill but which is relevant here and at various points. The planning system for this and for existing electricity power plant generation and transmission is different from that relating to planning permission in general. It is not particularly unique; it has been in place for decades and relates also to roads, railways and other large installations.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para6"></a>It is true that in this case the link between onshore and offshore lines will be through the existing onshore regime, which is not the local planning regime but <P>


<a name="column_GC352"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>comes under Section 37 of the Electricity Act 1989. It will need to upgrade the onshore system to cope with the arrival of new offshore legislation, but essentially, it will be the system that currently exists rather than the local planning system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The Minister is, as always, perfectly correct, but if my memory is correct on Section 37 of the Electricity Act, there has to be consultation over such developments. If a planning authority chooses to object, unless the Minister actually responds to its objections so that they are in effect answered, there has to be an inquiry. We need to work our way through the system. I did not wish to imply that there is not a planning system for these things, because clearly there is. There are separate issues which I will deal with on Clause 150.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para7"></a>I would not have raised the matter here, except that it becomes relevant as soon as these lines are onshore. There may have to be planning inquiries about the routing of these lines, be they overhead or underground, once they are above the shoreline. We need to be aware of that and to know exactly how it will be done. From reading the Bill, one could have the impression that it could almost be done by ministerial order, and I do not think that is the intention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The ministerial order would have to be in the context of this legislation and the existing Acts that will affect the connection offshore to onshore. I hesitate to suggest it, but we may need a more wide-ranging debate when we come to the planning part of the Bill. Clearly, there is no implication in these provisions that anything can just be done by fiat.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para8"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, asked why we were talking about only the 18 months after the Bill comes into effect. It is because we need one-off modifications to establish the offshore licence conditions themselves. The licence conditions could be modified thereafter, as they can now, by agreement between the regulator&#151;Ofgem/GEMA&#151;and the licence-holders. That will continue to be the case, so the modifications could still take place.
<P>

<a name="40204-17_para9"></a>As for the potential danger of the transmission lines to shipping and to others, those lines would be trenched under the seabed or would lie on the seabed, as cables do now. Indeed, that is how we supply electricity to our islands and get a certain proportion of our electricity from time to time from France. It is not a new thing for shipping or for the way in which those cables are laid. They would need a licence, and that licensing system would be subject to regulations relating to cabling under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Therefore, this is not a new situation for shipping or for those who regulate.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Is the Minister giving us an absolute assurance that there will be no question of the cables being above the sea on pylons? Secondly, while it is true as he says that there are existing cables, there will be far more cables now. Has the department carried out a careful study of the effect on instruments used to determine depth by small sailing ships, for example, which would normally not go anywhere near one of the <P>


<a name="column_GC353"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>major cables? There will be a great proliferation of cables, and the effect on depth instruments and on radar may be considerable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In terms of the total number of cables that could potentially, in some circumstances, have the effect that the noble Lord mentions, it is not a huge proliferation. They are high-tension and high-voltage cables, and they will be required to be protected in line with the voltage that they carry. That is not a new system, either here or in the rest of the world. High-voltage cables exist between islands and countries throughout the world, without any general disruption of signals, of shipping or of depth assessments. Therefore, it is not as big a problem as the noble Lord suggests. Clearly, when considering a site, we shall have to consider the route of the cables, and shipping companies and others with an interest in where the cables are laid will need to be notified. However, it is not a new situation for the users of the sea to contemplate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I have not had an assurance about the first point that I made, about pylons. Of course, what the Minister says about deep-laid cables is true, but we are presumably talking here about very shallow waters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Yes, but all cables come to shore, including high-voltage cables, so in terms of the inshore area at relatively low depth, that is not a new problem or issue.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para0"></a>As for the first proposition made by the noble Lord, the presumption is that all the cables will either be laid on the seabed in certain areas or trenched. It is possible that a proposer might come up with another way in which to transmit the electricity through an above-the-surface system. I find that somewhat difficult to envisage, but I cannot give an absolute assurance that no such proposition would come forward. The Government and the authorities would need to consider that question extremely seriously, particularly with the implications for shipping.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para1"></a>Technology will develop in that area, and the Bill does not strictly speaking prohibit it from happening&#151;but I should be extremely surprised were there to be any such proposition in the first few decades of this operation. My technical advisers may tell me that there is a possibility, so I shall leave that door slightly open but, as near as I can be, I believe that that will not happen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   It would certainly foul up the radar.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   If it happens. The cables below the surface would not foul up the radar.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para2"></a>I turn to the amendments to our amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Effectively, she is saying that the powers of the Secretary of State in the first two amendments and the powers of Ofgem GEMA in the third need to be <P>


<a name="column_GC354"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC354</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explicit. In the first two cases, they need to communicate this issue in relation to modifications to licences. The noble Baroness does not think that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-18_para3"></a>
is a sufficient prescription; albeit that that form of words is used in many pieces of legislation, most recently and relevantly in Sections 33, 68 and 81 of the Utilities Act, which was, as I recall, not necessarily objected to in this House.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para4"></a>It is one thing to argue that the clause as it stands is open-ended, it is another to be as prescriptive as the noble Baroness proposes. I recall that we have had this argument on many pieces of legislation. I am not inclined to accept stipulation on means of communication because technology moves on; for example, when noble Lords want me to put in a Bill "put on the website" or "use the first-class post". I hope that this legislation will last for some considerable time. However, the means of communication will have changed during the currency of the Act. Indeed, if we had been debating the Bill 20 years ago, some of the areas that we are now being pressed to stipulate would not have been appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para5"></a>The noble Baroness is slightly time-warped herself&#151;if I may say so&#151;in that she refers only to national newspapers and any appropriate trade journals. She is not even saying that it should be advertised on the Clapham omnibus, despite her concern for the man on the top deck. Other means of communication, electronic and otherwise, are more appropriate now, but that will change in five and 10 years' time. So it is not in my view particularly helpful to specify the means of publication. Therefore, there should be some flexibility. The noble Baroness may consider that the current flexibility is too wide, but I consider her prescriptions too narrow.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para6"></a>The same is true in relation to the third amendment, which relates to the procedure for promulgating the modification for licences and setting out the tender processes for the issue of transmission licences under GEMA. Again, that is being prescriptive in relation to ordinary pre-paid post.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para7"></a>There are a huge number of administrative details about how the tendering process should take place. The habit has been to leave to the regulator how precisely that is done. That would include the way in which it communicates the process. GEMA will need to have the power to make subsequent regulations establishing exactly how the tendering process should be carried out. Noble Lords will find that in most areas where a regulator operates, we leave it to the regulator to decide within statutory powers how administratively it will deal with the tender process. That also seems sensible in this context. I, therefore, would not be prepared to accept that amendment either.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, he may well have satisfied me. Indeed, I hope that he has. I shall read what he said with great care. The one point he did not pick up&#151;or perhaps his team do not have <P>


<a name="column_GC355"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the answer to it&#151;is whether transmission lines will come ashore at the high tide mark or the low tide mark. There may be occasions when that is significant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I recognise it may be significant, but I cannot give an answer to that. We shall have to judge the proposition when it occurs. Existing transmission lines often come to the surface slightly inland, so high tide or low tide is not necessarily the only option.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Whether the lines come ashore on the surface or below it is neither here nor there. What I am asking is where is the boundary at which the planning regulations start to apply? There will be a definition on that somewhere. It may be that it is three miles. I am not sure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am informed&#151;and noble Lords more conversant with marine law will know this&#151;that it is the low water mark where the planning conditions start.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am very grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Before we leave this important issue, may I raise a matter that is probably rather tangential, dealing with the financial implications of the arrangements? From what the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, told us in his introductory remarks, a substantial amount of electricity will be generated from offshore wind farms, and a substantial network of high voltage lines will be laid to transmit that electricity to shore. Obviously, that will add substantially to the cost of electricity generation generally. Are the Government satisfied, within the terms of the renewables obligation, that all that will add up? Will it be an additional cost, on top of the costs created by the renewables obligation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The estimates of the cost include the cost of making the electricity usable and, therefore, the cost of connecting to the National Grid. Those are the costs that have been assumed for the contribution by offshore wind power to the achievement of the renewables objective. There is no new cost implied by the fact that, for various obvious reasons, we must have transmission lines from the offshore site to the grid. That is included in the capital cost of the installation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Following what the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said, I should like the Minister to indicate to the Committee what the cost actually is. That would be helpful to us all. It would be interesting to know what proportion of the whole it is. If that is not possible at this stage, the Minister might write to us and let us know. That would be appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am sorry if I am becoming rather a pain, but, if I have understood matters correctly, the main transmission lines under the ocean will, in effect, become part of the National Grid. Presumably, they are part of the construction cost of the wind-generating farm that feeds the electricity to <P>


<a name="column_GC356"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>them. Although subsequent transmission costs will include the cost of that cable, National Grid Transco or whoever will not bear the cost of constructing the high-voltage lines under the sea to the wind farm station. It will a liability of the person with the concession for the wind-powered station.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-18_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The question of what the cost is is rather different from the question of who bears it. My answer to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is that all the calculations of the relative carbon saving and the relative amount of power that could be generated by offshore wind power include the cost of bringing it onshore and joining it up to the grid. It is general electricity policy to separate generation from transmission. Hence, the transmission will be owned by someone operating under the grid system, not by the generator.
<P>

<a name="40204-18_para8"></a>The question of who bears the cost in the first instance will be a matter for different propositions. It is clear who will bear the cost of operating it. The totality must be taken into account by those making the case for a particular wind farm or range of windmills offshore. That is the extra cost of providing the facility.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040204/text/40204-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The question is vital. It is one thing for National Grid Transco to have responsibility for laying the deep-sea high-voltage line at its expense; it is another if the costs are, as they should be, part of the cost of constructing the wind farm and getting the electricity to shore. We need an answer before the Bill completes its passage through the House. Without an answer to that question, we shall not know what we are talking about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The total cost of the installation will include the cost of the transmission belt, but the generator will pay the cost of the farms, and the transmission company will pay the cost of the transmission. They will then claim back from the generator by the systems charges, in the same way the grid does from onshore generators, which will eventually make up that cost. It is not a question of the generator paying for the cost upfront.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I think that I am satisfied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, has received an answer to his question. Does the Minister agree that the provision of offshore wind generation will be more expensive than onshore wind generation? Obviously, the foundation, distribution, and construction costs and the cost of transmission to land will also add to the cost. The second part of the noble Lord's question was who will pay for it, and the answer is the same person who pays for the premium cost of wind power at present; that is, the consumer.

<A NAME="40204-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As to whether onshore or offshore would be more expensive in practice, clearly one windmill operating offshore and requiring a transmission line will be significantly more than one similar-sized wind farm onshore connecting to a national grid only a few hundred yards away. <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40204-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   It is interesting, because when I started I said that we did not have any major concerns about this group of amendments, in that we understand that administration must go forward, and that powers are needed in order to do that. However, I also said that we had some minor concerns. I listened to those concerns, and afterwards did not think that they were so minor. Whilst we still have some minor concerns, we do not believe that this particular power, that the Secretary of State can do anything that he considers appropriate, is correct.
<P>

<a name="40204-19_para0"></a>I take the Minister to task. I am not sure that I have ever been told that I am in a time warp.

My noble friend drew my attention to the fact that the amendment I tabled referred to such further manner as the authority shall deem appropriate. So, apology accepted.
<P>

<a name="40204-19_para1"></a>That is an important point, to which we shall return. I shall withdraw the amendment now, but there is no question in my mind about this. It is all very well the Minister saying that this has become usual, that it was done in the Utilities Act 2000, and no one seemed to notice. Yesterday, I did not notice the "or otherwise". It was only when I looked into it in more depth that I noticed it. It has become a habit of this Government to take unto themselves wide powers that look okay, but are not. It is important that we try to restrict that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(1) This section applies where, at the commencement of this section, a transmission licence is in force that authorises a person to co-ordinate and direct the flow of electricity onto and over a transmission system by means of which electricity is transmitted within Great Britain, or within an area of Great Britain (the "co-ordination licence").
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State may make such modifications of the co-ordination licence as he considers appropriate for the purpose of applying the authorisation and conditions of the licence in relation to the transmission of electricity within one or both of the following&#151;
<br>
(a) an area of the territorial sea adjacent to Great Britain; and
<br>
(b) an area designated under section 1(7) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 (c. 29).
<br>
(3) The modifications that may be made by the Secretary of State under subsection (2) include such modifications of the co-ordination licence (including modifications of the conditions included in it) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for incidental, consequential or transitional purposes.

<a name="40204-20_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40204-20_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall be much briefer than was the case with the previous amendment. This is a probing amendment. An objection is received from the planning authority and studied by the Secretary of State. Upon reflection, he finds himself in agreement with it. He notifies the applicant that in order to receive the desired permission the application will have to be altered to meet the objection. Can the Minister explain why at that point the objection should be expunged from the record? All over the country people are doing things without permission. For example, the police were in action again in East Anglia in January to remove Travellers who were in open defiance of the planning law. If the objection to the original scheme is expunged, will it not be harder to ensure that things which are developed, built and commissioned are in line with local requirements and therefore comply with the law? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I thank noble Lords for probing the matter. I hope that I can explain to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, why we cannot accept the amendment. It has the potential to lead to planning inquiries that could be of a far wider and greater remit than is necessary. Probably the best way to proceed is to try to explain what Clause 80 seeks to achieve, and how it seeks to achieve that.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para2"></a>Noble Lords who are familiar with Schedule 8 of the Electricity Act 1989 will know that applications for consent to construct, extend or operate a generating station under Section 36 of that Act must be served on <P>


<a name="column_GC360"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC360</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the relevant local planning authority. Where that local planning authority maintains an objection to the application, the Secretary of State must hold a planning inquiry. However, where the Secretary of State can meet the local planning authority's objection by making modifications to the Section 36 consent or attaching conditions to it, no public inquiry needs to be held. The provision provides useful flexibility in avoiding unnecessary public inquiries.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para3"></a>The main purpose of Clause 80(2) is to clarify the role of local planning authorities where the application of consent relates to a generating station offshore; that is, not in a local planning authority's jurisdiction. We are proposing that local planning authorities should not have the right to force a public inquiry in regard to those parts of the generating station that are outside its jurisdiction. However, the local planning authority retains the right to require the Secretary of State to hold a public inquiry in respect of those parts of the generating stations that are within its jurisdiction. Subparagraphs (7) and (10) of new paragraph 7A deal with the circumstances in which two or more planning authorities have jurisdiction over the same generating station because it straddles both their areas. Both authorities have the right to make an objection. Paragraph 7A(10) deals with the situation where the Secretary of State accepts the objection of one planning authority and not the other. In such a case, an inquiry is still required, but only in relation to the area of the planning authority whose objection has not been met rather than the one whose objection has been met. Paragraph 7A(10) is intended to make it clear that if the objection of one of the authorities is accepted, the inquiry will continue only in relation to the objection of the other authority. It limits and focuses it.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para4"></a>The consequence of removing the subparagraph would be that the Secretary of State would have to hold a public inquiry covering the areas of both authorities when she could otherwise hold an inquiry in relation to the area of the authority whose objection had not been met. I hope that noble Lords will feel that this is the kind of efficiency that is often sought in these matters without compromising planning safeguards. It provides the right balance between proper planning processes and what might be an irrelevant and bureaucratic process.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-20_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40204-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 107 stands in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and refers to the siting of offshore wind farms. I feel that I have been becalmed for several days and many hours waiting for this amendment to come forward, and I cannot believe that we have reached it at last.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para12"></a>Subsection (1) of Clause 82 gives the Secretary of State a discretionary power to issue notices declaring safety zones around offshore renewable energy installations. On the face of it, that sounds a perfectly sensible thing to do. However, there are concerns in the leisure-boating industry, where the authorities feel that those zones must not unreasonably restrict or exclude recreational craft.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para13"></a>Looking at the issue on a more general basis, there is widespread concern in the shipping industry, the ports industry and at Trinity House&#151;the general lighthouse authority&#151;that such installations and their safety zones should not impinge upon designated sea lanes or prescribed traffic separation schemes. The amendment is designed to ensure that recognised navigation rights are upheld.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para14"></a>The sense of unease in the industry was heightened by the announcement last December of the proposed wind farm sites under round two of the consenting phase. On looking at some of the charts, one can see that some effort has been made to position these sites in areas where there is less shipping activity. But some of them&#151;notably in areas of dense shipping traffic, such as the Humber approaches, the Thames estuary and Liverpool Bay&#151;are very close to or, indeed, encroach upon regularly used shipping lanes and, in one or two instances, completely straddle them.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para15"></a>Moreover, these problems are likely to extend to other sea areas in future as a result of increasing demand for other renewable energy sources, such as wave and possibly tidal power. I understand that there are already plans for a full-scale trial of wave power generation off the Scottish Isles and that the Celtic Sea is earmarked for operational sites in future rounds.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para16"></a>What is needed and, to my understanding, what seems to have been conspicuously absent in this case is proper prior consultation between the Government, the shipping interests, the Crown Estate and would-be developers of offshore energy sites. Perhaps I may give an example of what has already happened under round 1.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para17"></a>There is currently under construction off Cromer a 30-turbine wind site, which cuts obliquely into two recognised shipping routes, narrowing the one closest to the shore, which is used by many ships in inclement weather, and forcing the one further out to be re-routed by means of what, at sea, we call a "dog leg", which not only narrows it but also pushes it closer to a third sea lane a little further to seaward. Squeezing ships closer together or forcing them closer to the shore would heighten the risk of collision or stranding, with the added probability of environmental pollution.
<P>


<a name="column_GC362"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para18"></a>On looking at the chart of the site&#151;I have it here&#151;my immediate reaction was to ask why they were not placed on sandbanks, where they would be free from shipping activity. I understand that there is, perhaps, a difficulty in that the sands shift from time to time; yet, on looking at the chart for the Thames Estuary, I see that there are two proposed sites running along two sandbars, at the Galloper and Gabbard.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para19"></a>To avoid having such things happen in future rounds, the shipping interests believe that three things should be done. First, the impact of wind farms and the like on navigation should be assessed through proper risk modelling&#151;something that has already been undertaken by the Dutch and Danish Governments, who, in recognition of their responsibility, have commissioned consultants to examine the potential risks.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para20"></a>Secondly, we should employ management tools, such as routing measures, to enable offshore energy farms to co-exist with shipping and other users of the sea without conflicts arising. That idea is not new. I understand that, during the early days of North Sea oil and gas exploration, a system of maritime clearways&#151;agreed navigation routes within which there would be no other activity&#151;were employed to good effect.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para21"></a>The third thing is something that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, touched on. We badly need further evaluation of the adverse effect that offshore wind farms have on marine radar and VHF communications. That problem came to light after the strategic planning under round one. It needs resolving, possibly by specifying a minimum separation distance between shipping and wind farms.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para22"></a>It is a fairly safe bet, when one places a fixed object in the sea, that sooner or later a ship will run into it. Ships are good at running into one another, but they also hit fixed objects. I need only quote two recent incidents. One involved the Nab tower, which is a fairly substantial structure sitting at the eastern approaches to Southampton. It was clouted by a ship, even though it has been there for many years. The other incident involved Hythe pier, closer to Southampton, which was cut in two by a ship the other day. If things are there, ships will hit them.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para23"></a>There was also the "Tricolor" incident in the North Sea, just over a year ago. A sunken car carrier, lying on its side more or less level with the surface, was struck by several ships soon after it capsized. Some even got stuck on the wreck. Even when the wreck had been properly marked by buoys and was being controlled by warning craft, an average of one ship a week steamed within the warning buoys. That fact alone speaks volumes about the standard of navigation on some ships at sea today. It should cause huge concern with regard to offshore wind farms. I am tempted to draw an analogy with ten-pin bowling; it is a tempting target for ships.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para24"></a>The overall responsibility for safe navigation around our coast lies with the Government due to their obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, not with those who wish to develop offshore wind farms. We certainly do not want&#151;God <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>forbid&#151;a major accident, involving the collision of two oil tankers, with fire, loss of life and widespread pollution, because of the alteration of long-established navigation channels due to the ill thought-out positioning of an offshore wind farm. If one of those tankers were then to drift, it might even score a passable and wipe out an entire wind farm.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para25"></a>I do not whether it is a question of a lack of consultation, a lack of joined-up government or a combination of both. It is a serious matter, and I hope that, even if the amendment does not find favour with the Government in its present form, the Minister will consider the implications carefully and that his department will have further consultations with all interested parties in the hope of finding a satisfactory resolution. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I rise to support the noble Lord and speak in support of his amendment. I make two initial points. First, my interest in shipping goes back a very long way indeed. Indeed, I am rather surprised to find that I qualified as a member of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers more than half a century ago. That may suggest that I am slightly out of date in terms of speaking to this amendment but between then and now I was shadow Secretary of State for some considerable time. During that period there was a collision of ships in the Channel on almost a weekly basis and the Government were obliged to make a Statement on the matter. Subsequently, the situation improved considerably, partly due to improvements in technology and partly due to the better management of shipping lanes, notably in the English Channel.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para26"></a>I turn to my second personal point. I suspect that I am slightly less against wind farms than some of my colleagues. Your Lordships will recall that the matter came up at Question Time yesterday. I spend virtually every weekend in Holland. I am surrounded by wind farms. Apart from very low level wind noise, I do not find that if you stand under them they are all that noisy. Although it was said yesterday that wind farms wiped out birds in Spain, that does not seem to happen in Holland. I am not clear why Dutch birds should be better at avoiding wind farms but there are remarkably few bird corpses lying underneath the wind farms in Holland.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para27"></a>I understand that the Royal Air Force has objected to wind farms, claiming that they interfere with low flying aircraft. I am not so much concerned about low flying aircraft but I am concerned about low flying ships. In that context, the point that the noble Lord made with regard to the effect of wind farms on radar&#151;I am not speaking here of the electricity side of it but rather the rotation of the blades and so on&#151;seems to be causing considerable worry. That is something which needs to be taken into account regarding the location of wind farms. However, as the noble Lord said, the Chamber of Shipping, Trinity House, the British Ports Association and the UK major ports groups have all expressed considerable concern about the proposals that are now being put <P>


<a name="column_GC364"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC364</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forward. There is a general feeling that the approval of wind farm sites has not taken account of the risks to seafarers or the environment, or fully recognised the UK obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para28"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord would give the Secretary of State discretionary power to ensure that installations or their safety zones cannot be established where they would interfere with designated sea lanes or prescribed traffic separation schemes, which is one of the major reasons why collisions occur less frequently in the Channel than used to be the case.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para29"></a>In addition to that, we seem to find ourselves, at this late stage of the Bill, in a rather extraordinary situation. It appears that the Crown Estate takes a decision on various applications and their sites and then proposes, if necessary, diversions of shipping around those sites instead of doing what one would have thought was painfully obvious: namely, seeing where the main shipping lanes are and then deciding where to put the wind farms. That is quite extraordinary. The lack of consultation on the matter and, indeed, the lack of appreciation of the rather simple point that I have just mentioned seems rather strange. It is a matter of serious concern for the reasons that the noble Lord mentioned. If we are not careful we shall end up with an environmental disaster on a massive scale because the rather simple point that I mentioned and consultation have not been taken into account.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para30"></a>It is also important to recognise that, in diverting ships in the way that I have described, one also has to take account of environmental damage to the marine environment that may result from the ships having to divert from their usual course, the increased risk of collision arising from that and, not least, increased costs of transportation. All those factors are very important.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para31"></a>However, the amendment would also ask for consideration of designated lanes and prescribed separation schemes to be used. That would be in conformity with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which includes such a provision. Unless the Government are prepared to take action with regard to these lanes they would seem to be in conflict with the provisions of the convention. Not only are we a party to it, we have been one of its leading supporters before it was agreed and subsequently. So that is a very important reason. We need the Government to ensure that the proposals in the Bill take into account the provisions of the convention and also are not actually in conflict with it.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para32"></a>One must ask to what extent the proposals are set in concrete. As I understand the issue, there has been a first round of wind farm sites and, rather curiously, looking at the maps provided by the Crown Estate, at least one of these appears to be within the DTI exclusion zone. What is more worrying as one looks at the various charts is the extent to which the proposed wind farm&#151;certainly in round two&#151;will interfere with navigation, with all the consequences to which the noble Lord and I have already drawn the attention of <P>


<a name="column_GC365"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Committee. The effect is not simply, for example, in the Channel where there is a massive one off Southend-on-Sea and another one off Margate/Ramsgate, but equally outside Liverpool, the Humber estuary and the Wash. It almost looks as though they have been deliberately planted to be in the main shipping lines, rather than elsewhere on the coast where they would not run the risk of interfering with shipping.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para33"></a>I am sure we shall wish to return to the matter at Report. But I think it is very important that the proposals made by the industry&#151;for example, resurrecting the UK shipping clearways charts&#151;to help deal with this problem are made between now and Report.
<P>

<a name="40204-20_para34"></a>The noble Lord talked about the degree of consultation and assurance that the Government have so far given to the shipping industry. I speak here of our shipping industry, but of course it has enormous international implications. The Government seem to be underestimating the very real dangers that are being caused by the way they appear to have gone ahead with these proposals, without taking into account the very important interests of the freedom of navigation on the one hand and of safety for the wider community. I am very happy to support my noble friend. I hope that the noble Lord can give us assurances along the lines I have suggested and in particular with regard to more extended consultation, before final decisions are made.

<A NAME="40204-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Listening to my noble friend Lord Higgins and the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, no one can be in any doubt about the seriousness of the matter. Perhaps the most important thing that struck me in listening was the lack of consultation that has brought us to this position of the Government apparently not thinking that the matter is too serious. But, as my noble friend has recently pointed out, it is a very serious matter. I hope that that particular matter can be addressed in the Minister's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Clearly, this is a serious matter. We think that the legislation already covers it. Safety at sea is a main concern of the Government. Therefore, we must bear that very much in mind in regulating marine renewable energy installations. Some of your Lordships will be aware that the developers of any such installations must already have obtained consent under the Coast Protection Act 1949. That is designed to ensure that the structures are not placed in locations that would be detrimental to the safety of navigation. Consideration of various consents would also have to take into account the effect on marine radar and communications.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para0"></a>The Department for Transport, which is responsible for overseeing this part of the regulations, considers applications for consent and consults the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and other organisations, including shipping organisations, with an interest in marine safety. The Coast Protection Act 1949 applies to developments in territorial waters and also to areas <P>


<a name="column_GC366"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC366</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that have been designated under Section 1(7) of the Continental Shelf Act. It covers the renewable energy zones that are being established by the Energy Bill.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para1"></a>It is true that there are complications in that the developer can choose to seek development approval from a project in England and Wales, or in English and Welsh territorial waters, using the Transport and Works Act 1992, which has a way of disapplying the Coast Protection Act 1949. However, even if they take that route, the controls over such developments are equally stringent and ensure that marine safety is not compromised.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para2"></a>The language of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, relates to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. By implication, he is saying that the Government are ignoring their obligations. That is not the case&#151;we take those obligations very seriously, and the provisions of this Bill are entirely compatible with our international obligations. They do not require an amendment to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para3"></a>Article 22 enables a coastal state to require foreign vessels to use designated sea lanes or traffic separation schemes. That is a right, rather than an obligation. We do not need further powers to exercise that right. We have an obligation under Article 60 of UNCLOS to make sure that installations and the safety zones around them in, for example, the renewable energy zone, are not established where they would cause interference to recognised sea lanes essential to international navigation. We will fulfil that obligation. We already have the legislative tools to regulate the location of developments. We do not need any further change to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para4"></a>It might be helpful if I say a few words about our general approach to the siting of offshore farms&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Perhaps the noble Lord will give way. It is my understanding that the various proposed items would require the diversion of ships away from the recognised routes, and that would be inconsistent with the articles of the convention. I may be mistaken, but that is my understanding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Some of the sites may well involve diversions, but they would involve diversions that would be available to shipping in those routes. We are not interfering with essential routes where there is no alternative. That relates to the obligations under both UNCLOS and the existing UK legislation.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para5"></a>More generally, the impact of proposed developments on the safety of navigation was an important factor in deciding which sites would be offered a lease in the first instance by the Crown Estates. A high level of screening of proposed sites was undertaken in relation to the 15 sites in the greater Wash area, Thames estuary and the waters of north-west England, which covers the area to which the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, referred. That was based on traffic density data.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para6"></a>We believed that the projects would be acceptable without major interference. Those projects which were seeking an application which would have been <P>


<a name="column_GC367"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prejudicial to marine safety have been eliminated through that process. It is difficult at that point in the process to engage in a consultation with the marine interests because such applications are in effect a proposal to the Crown Estate on a commercially confidential basis.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para7"></a>However, all elements of the Government are very open to a dialogue with the shipping industry about the impact of the proposed sites on navigation and navigational safety. The Department of Transport will shortly be undertaking a consultation of the industry to elicit views, including the cumulative impact of the various sites.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para8"></a>I hope, therefore, that I have said enough to ensure that noble Lords recognise that we are taking the safety of navigation very seriously in these decisions. I do not say that there will be no impact on the shipping industry. As I say, there may well be deviations from what has hitherto been the preferred route. However, we shall attempt to minimise that and to ensure that navigational safety is not thereby endangered.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para9"></a>I turn to safety zones, which is the main subject of this clause, rather than the siting of the wind farms. The safety zone scheme provided for in the Bill comes into play only when a renewable energy installation has all the suite of development consents in place. So the location of the development from a marine safety point of view will have been considered by that point. The purpose of the safety zone will be to protect shipping navigation in the area of the renewable energy installation to avoid collisions and to keep vessels a safe distance from the installation. The extent of the safety zone will be tailored very much to an assessment of the risk of collision at the particular location of the development. They will be no larger than they have to be to achieve that aim. The primary aim in these considerations is to ensure that there is no danger to navigational safety.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para10"></a>I believe, therefore, that both the UK's international obligations and existing UK procedures and legislation cover the objective of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Perhaps I may come back on one or two points. The general view of the industry is that the Government are underestimating the amount of traffic which is likely to pass near the wind farms. They underestimate the extent to which the diversions may increase the risks of collision either with other ships or other objects or, indeed, the wind farms. Alas, we do not have a blackboard in the Moses Room, but if one looks at the charts showing the way in which the proposed round two applications are located, it would seem that that is a valid view which is held by the outside interests. None of us wants an environmental disaster. Therefore, further consultation is necessary to establish exactly how important that particular aspect of the matter would be.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para11"></a>The other point on which I am unclear, now that the Minister has resumed his seat, is whether he accepts the amendment. If, indeed, it is compatible with the <P>


<a name="column_GC368"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as I believe it to be, and would ensure that there is compatibility with the convention, at least the Minister should say that he accepts the amendment and we can take it from there. Other than that, certainly we shall need to return to the matter on Report. I continue to remain extremely worried that through adopting an approach which seems to be more concerned about locating wind farms and diverting shipping rather than having the lanes in place and putting the wind farms out of their way, this may, indeed, become a matter which in years to come we shall regret.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   I have listened to the Minister's comments and agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, just said. I do not think it can be right necessarily for diversions to be imposed on shipping, especially where there is high-density shipping, around these proposed sites. Many of those ships are ferries on regular routes, so ships are going backwards and forwards, day in, day out, all year round. Those ships will use more fuel in order to go round the sites. As the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said earlier, that would mean more pollution from their exhausts, and could result in increased costs of transportation.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para12"></a>To my recollection, the Minister did not comment on risk management, which is one of the points I made. Have the Government considered anything along the lines undertaken by other governments? As regards recreational craft, it was my understanding that possibly there would be a kind of inshore zone that would be sacrosanct. I do not know anything about the Coast Protection Act, but can the Minister confirm that that is the case? There is a worry that where some of the round 1 sites are located, there will be a leap-frog effect with other sites being added to the existing ones, and so on and so forth, further out to sea. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I have tried to explain that the assessment of the applications at various stages has to take into account the density of traffic, the effects of deviation and the potential increase in marine safety. If the noble Lord wants to refer to that as "marine management", it does not establish a body which then directs marine routes as the way one would into a harbour but ensures that shipping takes safe routes.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para13"></a>I am not entirely sure that I understand the noble Lord's point about inshore recreational shipping. Clearly, there are exclusion zones which may be provided for in the impact assessment. However, I am not sure that anyone has ever promised an exclusion zone covering the whole of the inshore areas for recreational craft. I do not completely understand the noble Lord's point.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para14"></a>The main point of the provisions, and the main reason why we do not accept the amendment&#151;there is also the fact that it is attached to a clause which deals with safety zones rather than the siting of installations&#151;is that our current legislation effectively covers this application in a way in which it is normal <P>


<a name="column_GC369"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the shipping industry to be consulted. The international obligations are not normally repeated in legislation in the way suggested by the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="40204-21_para15"></a>I am not prepared to accept the amendment. I believe that the dangers have been exaggerated and would in any case have to be taken seriously into account on any particular site designation or development application. The risk assessment would have to include those issues of dangers at sea to which both noble Lords have referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I still have difficulty in understanding why the noble Lord will not accept the amendment, which is entirely in line with the requirements under the treaty. There is a case in many treaties for incorporating the particular proposals in domestic law. At all events, we shall need to return to this on Report. As the industry is deeply concerned about this issue, can he give an assurance that there will be further consultation before Report?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am perfectly happy to have further consultation with noble Lords before Report. The timing of Report stage is not in my hands. I do not think that any further consultation with the shipping industry necessarily would affect my attitude to the amendment. I think that we have built in sufficient safeguards through the whole of the process and in any case are obliged to do so under existing UK law, which it would not be necessary to repeat here. I regard this as not a particularly strong objection to the approach which we adopt in the Bill to facilitate the construction of offshore wind farms. I find some of these objections unacceptable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   After the last three sittings, the timing of the Report stage remains a matter of conjecture. However, at all events, there is no reason why the consultations need to be delayed. I am sure that those in the industry who are deeply concerned would readily make themselves available for further consultation. However, it seems to me unreasonable for the Minister to say that he is sure he is right that the risk has been overstated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   Naturally I am disappointed at the Government's response. I have only one thing to say. If an incident which, admittedly, I described as a worst-case scenario were to take place, the blame would lie firmly with the Government. It would not lie with anyone else. I believe that the Government must recognise that.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para0"></a>Obviously, I hope that more consultations will take place before the next stage of the Bill and I reserve the right to return then with another amendment. I realise that this one may be defective. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40204-22_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 107A is another probing amendment. On reading the Bill, I find that devolution makes all-country legislation less than satisfactory. That will not come as a surprise to the Minister. He will no doubt tell me that my understanding is wrong. However, I believe that, in essence, this part of the Bill means that Scottish Ministers have no choice. In effect, if the Secretary of State is advised or is minded to declare a safety zone around a particular installation, he may do so provided he has consulted Scottish Ministers, but they do not necessarily have to agree. That is my first point.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para4"></a>One can consider the plight of fishermen or shellfish collectors who may be prohibited from using a particular area of sea or from fishing a particular shoal. We have just been talking about normal routes. Can the Minister assure us that no safety zone would deflect the normal route of, say, a North Sea or west coast ferry? At present, some ferry routes follow laid-down lines. The Minister's response to the previous amendment makes me even more concerned and leads me to believe that an answer needs to be given to this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para5"></a>Should not Scottish Ministers have as much power over the siting of safety zones as they do over deciding which activities in the territorial sea will be classed as criminal? Should they not have to give their approval rather than simply be consulted? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend in this amendment. It follows on from a previous contribution that I made when I tried to elicit from the Minister who had the final say in various issues which concern the Secretary of State for Trade, the Secretary of State for Scotland&#151;albeit, the part-time Secretary of State for Scotland&#151;the First Minister and Scottish Ministers. I did not obtain a very satisfactory answer to my question, and this seems to provide a suitable opportunity to discover whether the Government have given this matter any more thought. Perhaps they can tell us a little more accurately what might happen.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para6"></a>It seems to me that my noble friend is making a very good point by seeking in the amendment to leave out the word "consult" and insert "obtain the agreement of". That highlights the whole problem. The Secretary of State for Trade comes forward with a suggestion and puts it to the Scottish Parliament. Does he "consult" or, ultimately, does he "obtain the agreement of"? When I received an answer on the previous occasion, I was told that this need not bother us too much because all these matters can be dealt with through consultation.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para7"></a>The relationship between the Secretary of State for Trade and Scottish Ministers would work perfectly well so long as one had the same government in Scotland as in the United Kingdom. However, let us suppose, for example, that a different party was in power in Scotland. It might not be very easy for the Secretary of State for Trade to obtain agreement, and what would happen then? Whose word would prevail? Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us a little more.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   If it is a UK power, the will of the UK Minister will prevail. If it is a devolved power, the will of the Minister from the devolved Parliament will prevail. It does not matter which party they belong to. The powers are either reserved to the UK or devolved. In this particular instance, it is a UK power. The Secretary of State has the power to deal with safety zones. It is sensible, and the legislation will prescribe, that the Secretary of State will consult with Scottish Ministers. One would hope that the Scottish Minister and the UK Minister would reach agreement, no matter which party they belonged to. However, were there not to be agreement, in the exercise of a UK power it must be the UK Government who prevail.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para8"></a>It would be the other way round in provisions where there was a devolved responsibility or an assumption that the Ministers from the devolved Parliament would consult because it would fit in with an overall UK strategy. But if the UK Minister disagrees with the Scottish Minister in the exercise of a devolved power, ultimately the Scottish Minister can act. Therefore, I do not believe that the issue is complicated.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para9"></a>In so far as there is a UK power involved in this clause, it is clear that the view of the UK Minister would prevail. We have not had any great problems with our Scottish colleagues, and this particular wording has been agreed to be the most sensible presentation of the way in which we would endeavour to carry out the duties under this clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for clarifying my question. I asked why there was a difference on two occasions in the Bill. I suppose he will say that in criminal law the Scots have different rules and regulations and that is why they have overall jurisdiction as opposed to this occasion, where they do not. However, I find this odd. Did the Minister refer to the fact that this particular part had been referred to the Scottish Parliament and they are content with it, or does he just assume that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Scottish Executive has agreed to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   In that case, there is nothing much more that I can say. I asked for clarification because it seems unusual to have one system in one place in the Bill and a different system in another. However, the Minister having explained that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40204-22_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment as I wonder what is the need for this particular subsection. The Bill confers powers to declare safety zones in our waters and theoretically it sets out provisions allowing proper control and management of those zones. But this subsection appears to suggest that there should be no limit to the area of sea that could be designated&#151;indeed, we <P>


<a name="column_GC372"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>touched on that earlier&#151;and that some of the waters concerned might not be subjected to the regulatory regime in the rest of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para13"></a>I may have misunderstood but it would appear to be the case that, once a zone has been declared and approved on, say, Scroby Sands off Great Yarmouth, as is suggested, the zone might be extended indefinitely by this subsection to include the whole of the North Sea within our territorial jurisdiction. I query whether that is what is meant. Can the Minister assure me that that is not the effect of this subsection and perhaps explain the reason for this provision? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling this probing amendment. It returns us to the discussion that we had yesterday, when I was trying to discover what sort of limits there were to renewable energy zones. The noble Baroness has spotted another place in the Bill where they are undefined. Indeed, the Bill goes further in enabling them to be fairly unlimited in scope. I will listen to the Minister's reply with interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-22_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I will set out the intention of this provision. The central theme of the provision is to ensure and maintain safety. In a recent debate with the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, on the issue of light dues, all of us decided that whatever the complexities in that area, the fundamental issue that we should be concerned with was safety, which is obviously enormously important. There should be no compromise in any effort made to ensure that all mariners have confidence in a system of protection for them.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para14"></a>Safety zones around renewable installations&#151;I emphasise that I use the phrase safety zones in the plural, because I want to come back to the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer about renewable energy zones&#151;will be considered only where there is a sound case for declaring them. It follows that where there is a sudden haste to impose a safety zone, the Secretary of State should have sufficient powers to impose one.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para15"></a>The proposed amendment would lead to such a right, or power, being weakened in cases where the renewable installation was sited so close to the boundary of the renewable energy zone that it was not possible to impose the full safety zone&#151;justified on safety grounds&#151;within the zone. The installation could be left with, for example, a 500-metre exclusion zone in one direction, but only 100 metres in the opposite direction. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a safety zone can only be 500 metres maximum. We can see that this offers a degree of flexibility, but that is available to us only within a rather limited system. We would not expect a situation to arise very often where there would be a great deal of asymmetry between the different ends of the zone, but we need to provide for the eventuality where that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40204-22_para16"></a>The renewable energy zone is a singular concept, and anyone who reads the Bill will find that it is never expressed in the plural. I was trying to make this point <P>


<a name="column_GC373"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC373</B></P>

<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. I am not absolutely sure that my amendment would detract from doing what I was trying to achieve, which was to make sure that we were limiting the amount of extension that could take place. Am I wrong in that?
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para0"></a>The Minister explained that safety zones can only be a total of 500 metres maximum, whichever way it is done. Obviously, if new planning permission is given for more installations extending further out into other navigation lanes, I was concerned that this is an open-ended phrase that comes into this section of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para1"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for her comments. I will take it away to give it further thought. The Minister is virtually saying that I should have no grounds for misunderstanding, but his answer was not entirely satisfactory. Does he have anything to add to it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Let me try to do my best, for the purposes of the greatest clarity that I can achieve. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea gives us the right to establish safety zones around renewable energy installations in the renewable energy zone. The provision enables us to establish a safety zone around an installation that is located on the boundary of the renewable energy zone, so that the safety zone extends outside the zone. Similar powers exist, incidentally, in relation to oil and gas installations on the Continental Shelf. There is no difference in that sense.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para2"></a>The effect of the amendment is that the Secretary of State would be unable to apply safety zones beyond the defined limits of the renewable energy zone even where there was a demonstrable case for having such a safety zone in the interests of achieving all of the safety objectives which are shared on all sides of the Committee. That is why we think that the amendment would be unhelpful.

<a name="40204-23_para8"></a>No one would think of not consulting the inhabitants of a region on major planning changes likely to affect their way of life, but it is easy for the planners and the civil servants in far distant departmental offices not concerned with the business of those who go down to deep waters to see the sea as so much empty space. Amendment No. 107BA would ensure that would never happen and would give fishermen a statutory right to be consulted on these matters.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para9"></a>Given the fact that even in local fisheries there are cases where boats travel a long distance to carry out their work, Amendment No. 107DA ensures that representatives of fishermen in ports up to 50 miles from any proposed safety zone should be informed and consulted and given the opportunity specifically to make their case to any inquiry set up into the proposed zone.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para10"></a>In order to aid the Committee I should say that the last words of the amendment should read,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must be consulted on the size and effects on fishing of a safety zone".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-23_para11"></a>
I hope that the Minister can consider very positively the points underlying these amendments for there is no doubt that the livelihoods of many families could be affected by any disruption caused to fishing. If he is not able to accept my amendments, I invite him to explain to the Committee the procedures by which he will ensure that fishermen are informed and consulted and can put their case to an inquiry. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, highlights the difficulty of operating in the absence of any kind of marine spatial planning framework. People who will be affected by such an application will not understand how to make their representations and what sort of representations they can make. That would not be the case with a planning application on land. The amendment is extremely worthwhile as it explores those issues.

<A NAME="40204-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   In principle, one has every sympathy with the fishermen over this issue. Indeed, it is essential that their voice is heard. However, I do not think it would be particularly wise or safe to permit fishermen to enter these zones. The sea is a pretty hazardous place, and if the weather was inclement, I hate to think what might happen if a fishing vessel were to try trawling up between wind generators. It would be appallingly dangerous for everybody. Much as I sympathise with their position, I do not think that that sort of freedom is possible, although it is essential that they are properly consulted so that, if at all possible, <P>


<a name="column_GC375"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these wind farms are not sited in traditional fishing areas. That would be the only sensible way to deal with the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We must be clear that we are dealing with the safety zones in this part of the Bill. The application of a safety zone is basically on the grounds of safety. It is clear that we recognise that on many occasions there will be possible implications for fishermen. It is important that we act in a reasonable and justifiable way in relation to all interests. The decision is essentially made on safety grounds, and as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has implied, there could be an issue of safety relating to fishermen.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para12"></a>So far as taking views into account is concerned, Clause 82(7) requires that where the Secretary of State issues a notice about a safety zone or where a determination is made in relation to that notice, he must take appropriate action to bring it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to the attention of persons likely to be affected by it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-23_para13"></a>
Clearly, where there is established fishing activity, it falls under that requirement.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para14"></a>Similar requirements fall on any other person issuing a notice&#151;the applicants themselves, for example. It is therefore important that we adopt a very inclusive approach so that everybody who is likely to be affected by it will know of its existence. It is pretty inconceivable that fishermen who could be affected by the safety zone would not be covered by that requirement. However, there may be other people equally likely to be affected&#151;for example, those involved in recreational shipping, commercial shipping and other recreational activities in the area. They are also covered by the general phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"persons likely to be affected by it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-23_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40204-23_para16"></a>Amendment No. 107DA would require that where the Secretary of State has deemed that a public inquiry is necessary in respect of a safety zone, representatives of the fishing industry and ports within 50 miles of the proposed safety zone, from where boats are traditionally fished in the area, should be notified of that decision. Fishermen who used that area for their fishing would be well aware of such a proposition. If we start specifying everybody who might be involved, we would, as normally happens in debates on legislation, be guilty of the implication that others who might have such an interest are excluded by mentioning only fishermen.
<P>

<a name="40204-23_para17"></a>Paragraph 6(3) of the schedule provides for the publication of a notice to inform,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"persons likely to be affected by the proposal"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-23_para18"></a>
than an inquiry would be held. I cannot conceive in the situation described by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that fishermen could be excluded from such a category. If we were to specify them, we would have to specify many other categories of people or potential sites in various parts of the sea. I therefore do not think that it is necessary to specify fishermen here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I have obviously listened carefully to the Minister. I referred to fishermen in the <P>


<a name="column_GC376"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment because they use the sea the most, apart from business shipping which is, one hopes, further out. I want to ensure that fishermen are consulted before the zone is designated. Will the noble Lord point me to where it says that in the Bill? I cannot see it, but I may have misread the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Clause 82(7) requires that where there is a notice about a safety zone or, later, when there is a determination on that notice, people who are likely to be affected must be informed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   That is after the decision is made, is it not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-23_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No. It is when a notice is issued, which is the point where, as with most such propositions, it would be required to be drawn to people's attention. They could therefore object at that point. I assume that I am correct.

<P>
<A NAME="40204-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for his comments. I named fishermen because, as I say, I think they will be the most directly affected. I hope the noble Lord thinks that we will still have a fishing industry, because it is very much under threat at present. It is very important that we protect fishermen as much as we can. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40204-24_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40204-24_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 107C, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 107D.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para5"></a>Amendment No. 107C is a probing amendment. As it stands, the wording implies that the location might be given in the form of a map of, for example, the Goodwin Sands, with a shaded area to the north-east. If this is the case, will the drawing be to scale and, if so, to what scale? Perhaps it is already laid down and I have missed it.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para6"></a>I understand that in matters relating to navigation at sea, it is customary to work in degrees, minutes and seconds of latitude and longitude. Indeed, in the papers relating to the common fisheries policy, I have come across areas or zones defined in those terms. When a zone starts on dry land, one may find a definition that reads, for example, "due east of Peterhead to a point", and the point is defined by such a reference. Will the Minister explain what the current wording means and why that form has been chosen?
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para7"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 107D, the notice may require objections to be sent to someone&#151;let us call him Person X. If Person X receives any objections, he must copy them to the Secretary of State. Yet subsection (3) states that the Secretary of State is required, whenever he or she receives objections or copies of objections, to use them in deciding whether to hold a public inquiry.
<P>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para8"></a>Will the Minister give me an idea of the checking system that can be put in place to ensure that all objections received by a third party are indeed copied to the Secretary of State; of the system that will ensure that those copies reach the Secretary of State; and of the system that will ensure that the Secretary of State is made aware of their arrival? Will the Minister explain why it was considered necessary to write this provision into the Bill? It may be that it is the same as provisions in other Bills.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para9"></a>Finally, will the Minister explain why, in paragraph 4(3), there is no specific statement about sending objections to a third party but there is a requirement on the Secretary of State? It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where objections, or copies of objections, to an application have been sent to the Secretary of State in compliance with the regulations",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-24_para10"></a>
the Secretary of State must take appropriate action. I wonder whether we are creating yet more layers of bureaucracy, and I seek ministerial reassurance. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Let me deal with the amendments in the same order that the noble Baroness introduced them. It is obviously of the utmost importance to those organisations and people who are likely to be affected by a proposed safety zone that they should be made aware of its location as quickly and as accurately as possible. Part of the burden of the noble Baroness's remarks is what is the most accurate way of doing that and what would therefore be most helpful.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para11"></a>Limiting the description of the site to reference points would disadvantage potentially affected parties, particularly yachtsmen and other recreational users of the sea who might not be able to locate the positions of the installations in question quickly. Some would, of course, because they might have great experience of using reference points on charts. Others, I fear, might have less facility in doing so.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para12"></a>We believe that a map is much more user-friendly to all concerned. My understanding is that charts will be to scale and that there should be no great difficulty in making sure that they can be used with precision.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para13"></a>Let me turn to Amendment No. 107D. Having talked yesterday about what one could see over very long distances, I fear that today I must say that this amendment may turn out to be short-sighted. It seems logical to me that where the Secretary of State has asked for objections to an application to a safety zone to be sent to someone other than himself or herself, that person must also send a copy to the Secretary of State. That completes the circle; it makes sure that the Secretary of State is fully in the loop and is aware of all the communications about the matter.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para14"></a>We are not placing a copying burden on the objector, incidentally, but on the person whom the Secretary of State nominates to do the job. This seems reasonable. The system that ensures that the loop is complete will obviously need to be specified in a way that ensures everybody knows what they have to do, in greater detail than would probably be appropriate in the Bill. None the less, it is intended that everyone should see a copy of everything, again on the grounds <P>


<a name="column_GC378"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that safety is the preoccupation here. We do not want to find that anyone has missed out on a major safety requirement by a miscommunication.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   Most recreational craft these days employ some sort of GPS satellite navigation system which gives the latitude and longitude read-out, so there is no problem for yachtsmen in reading such figures. They do not necessarily need a chart showing the site.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para15"></a>What is confusing me about objections is that we have already had round one; round two was notified at about Christmas time, and we are only now discussing the Bill. There was no method by which anyone could object under round one, which seems a strange way of going about things.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   All I can say is that it is essential that these provisions are right and that all future arrangements ensure that there is the fullest possible communication of the areas on maps. I take the point about the new pieces of machinery that find your latitude and longitude; I believe you can even do it in central London, let alone at sea. Many taxi drivers seem to employ that method for getting around.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para16"></a>I take the point that we must make sure that the objections system is thorough and robust and that everybody knows what the position is. The Bill must establish that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, for his comments. I certainly had not realised that this system was not in being in the first instance, which is pretty bad.

 "unless it is a United Kingdom registered fishing vessel which has entered the zone for the purpose of plying its trade on local fishing grounds or a vessel carrying shellfishermen to a bank, shoal or reef within the zone on or over which there is an established fishery of shellfish."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-24_para23"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Government are constantly paying lip service to the need to avoid regulation, but Clause 82 contains provisions to establish a new regulatory system requiring fishing boats to apply for permits to go to fishing grounds that they have traditionally worked. I wonder whether fishermen have not already had enough to put up with, given the restrictions we have discussed in the common fisheries policy, without new regulatory burdens.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para24"></a>Fishermen are no threat to the security of these installations. On the contrary, if anything, a threat to the way they work will be posed by the new installations. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said <P>


<a name="column_GC379"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC379</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>earlier that he feels sure that the fishermen will not want to go anywhere near them. The works in progress to build them will affect the fishing industry.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para25"></a>However, the very nature of the sea and the areas of shoaling water where renewable energy installations might be installed means that in some places certain species will be in abundance. The Government must recognise the specific interests of fisheries and the shellfish industry.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para26"></a>The amendment would give an automatic exemption to fishermen and shellfishermen to enter a safety zone. It appears&#151;at least, I hope this is the case&#151;that some type of exemption may underlie subsection 4(b). I hope the Minister will clarify that and assure the fishing industry that there will be no new regulatory system for local fisheries and no onerous permit system and that there will be a general exemption to allow fishermen to continue conducting their business.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para27"></a>We all accept that there may be occasional emergencies or times of danger when an area should be closed to all navigation. There is provision for that elsewhere in the Bill and in law. However, a general prohibition on fishing in a safety zone unless permission is given is, I believe, putting the extra regulatory burden the wrong way round. Surely there should be a presumption on the right to fish without a need for such a permit unless good reason can be shown why navigation should temporarily be stopped.
<P>

<a name="40204-24_para28"></a>Does the Minister accept that fishermen are deserving of this kind of trust and support? Does he seriously envisage that a permit will have to be required every time someone wants to check their lobster pots, for example, or will they not be allowed to fish in the zones anyway? Will the Minister take this opportunity to spell out in detail the specific regulations and regulatory system proposed? Can he guarantee specifically that there will be no permit charge to fish in safety zones&#151;in other words, that this is not another stealth tax? I seek clarification with the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I can see that, during the construction period of any installation, a safety zone would be very necessary because many unknown things would be going on. However, unless the Minister tells me otherwise, I can imagine that, once some installations were in place, they might well be a perfectly good fishing ground.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para0"></a>The fishermen will know where the installations are; they are well able to avoid difficulties, as they have been doing for hundreds of years when it comes to rocks around our island. The safety zones may actually become richer fishing grounds, for one reason or another. We cannot know that yet and nor can the Government as they have not done an environmental assessment. Certain species might proliferate in the zones.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para1"></a>There are many interesting issues in this respect. However, I cannot see why, just because energy is being gathered above the surface of the ocean, <P>


<a name="column_GC380"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>fishermen should necessarily be prohibited from operating beneath the wind turbines. It is not as though they are operating sailing vessels, for example.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para2"></a>I can see that it will be necessary to hold considerable discussions with fishermen about safety issues and so on, but it seems excessive to expect that they would not be able to fish those areas, unless there was a very rigid regime. I should have thought that the zones would pose no more risk to fishermen than the natural hazards they meet every day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   I should like to pick up on the point made by the noble Baroness. In my experience, any fixed structure placed in the sea picks up, over the course of time, a certain amount of accretions and crustacea. If there were suddenly to be a growth of mussels or whatever on these structures, I cannot help thinking that any fisherman worth his salt would creep in at the dead of night to harvest this unexpected bounty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I have been longing to ask one question&#151;I do not know whether the Minister can give me the answer&#151;about the type of cable lying under the sea, which may presumably, if there are a series of farms, be fairly high voltage cable. I do not know how high the voltage would be. Will that cable have any effect on instruments in the ships on the surface? Also, will it have any effect on the fish? These are things we should know. I do not know about electromagnetic fields that flow from high-tension cables, but I know that it is advisable not to live underneath one. Perhaps it is the same for fish and ships!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I echo what I said before. I hope that an exclusion zone is an exclusion zone. I have immense confidence in our fishermen and in their ability as sailors. However, if an exclusion zone is not an exclusion zone; it is all very well to say that they will not go out there in a force 10 gale, but you can bet your bottom dollar that someone will be caught out there in a force 10 gale and he will not be in total control. If we are putting these fixed installations in the sea, even with a reasonable separation, they will be a hazard to anyone who enters that zone.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para3"></a>Much as I sympathise with the good intentions of my noble friend, I hope the Minister's response will be that an exclusion zone is just that: an exclusion zone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In principle, the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, is correct: safety zones are safety zones. They are imposed for safety reasons and safety applies to fishermen as much as it does to any other people navigating in that area. Clause 83&#151;the prohibited activities clause&#151;provides for permissions to enter that zone under certain circumstances when there are individual installations and access to vessels which can, because of their size, manoeuvrability or location of the site, proceed safely. But those permissions have to be granted specifically under subsections (4)(5) and (6) of the clause.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para4"></a>In general, there would be an exclusion for fishermen as there would be for other bodies. If one is imposing a restriction on safety grounds with some <P>


<a name="column_GC381"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC381</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>flexibility, that applies to fishermen as much as it does to anyone else. The attempt by the amendment of the noble Baroness to have a blanket override for fishermen of what is imposed for a safety reason does not seem to be sensible. There is a little flexibility here, but it would be slightly perverse to allow fishermen in general to override something imposed for safety reasons.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para5"></a>The question of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, takes us beyond the safety zones into the whole issue of the cable. Clearly, the possibility of interfering with instruments was discussed when dealing with an earlier clause. The possibility of giving fish migraines has not been raised before. I do not think we have any evidence that high-tension, high-voltage cables, of which there are plenty around the world, have any detrimental effect on fish themselves.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para6"></a>However, the issue of interference with communications radar or ships' instruments has to be taken into account when granting permission in the first instance. There are international precedents for that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sorry, I did not hear the answer about when the cable is under water.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   When the cable is under water, it is unlikely that there will be any serious interference. It may not be nil and, therefore, that has to be taken into account in granting the application in the first instance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have contributed. There is obviously a difference of opinion about whether safety zones are or are not safe to fish in. That is not really my dividing point. I wanted to establish what is meant by the Bill, and I believe that the Minister has answered that point&#151;that is, people are definitely not allowed to enter safety zones unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Minister is nodding.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para7"></a>I now ask the Minister to turn his attention back to Second Reading, when my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon raised the question of human rights. The Bill is supposed to be compatible with human rights. However, is the Minister confident that he will not be taking away anyone's human rights if safety zones are to be established and fishermen are not allowed to fish in areas where they have traditionally fished? I should be grateful for a response to that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I cannot see that a human rights issue is involved here. We are not taking anyone's possessions; we are simply imposing a restriction on the grounds of safety. I do not believe that that would qualify as a deprivation under the Human Rights Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-25_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Does the Minister not consider that it would be taking away part of people's livelihoods&#151;a matter which I thought came under Human Rights Act? There is time to consider the matter between now and Report, but that was the reason that I particularly wanted to bring forward this amendment, which has prompted diverse views to be <P>

<a name="40204-25_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: We have nearly reached the end of my group of amendments. In moving Amendment No. 107DC, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 107DD. The amendments move on from the amendment that we have just considered, but I submit that they are of equal importance, as they deal not only with the question of prohibition and the regulation of fishing in safety zones but with the potential criminalisation of fishermen if they attempt to carry out their traditional trade. We touched on that point during debate on the previous amendment.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para13"></a>Can the Minister explain why he believes that fishermen are such a threat to wind farms that he must propose these draconian powers? It is interesting that in a previous debate the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, obviously did not consider that to be a reason to ban people from fishing in those areas, but that was not the view taken by my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith. Therefore, I find myself moving another amendment on which I am not sure that agreement will be reached around the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para14"></a>Under this section, if a man's tackle, nets or pots drift into a safety zone which he does not hold a permit to enter and he enters the zone to retrieve them, he could be arrested and sent to prison for up to two years. I wonder whether that is right. Subsection (9) gives no defence against a conviction on such grounds. What happens if a fishing boat is hove to and drifts on the wind or the tide into a safety zone of which the fisherman was aware but whose boundaries he had not noticed he had passed? Is he guilty of a criminal offence? Where is the defence against conviction under subsections (7), (8) or (9)? It is all very well to say that common sense should apply but, if we take motorists in Great Britain as an example, it rarely seems that that happens in real life.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para15"></a>Therefore, I seek clarification on the position of the fishermen. What would happen if, for example, under subsection (2), a condition was put on a permit to fish in a zone and the person caught a type of fish which was not specified or was prohibited in a permit? Would that be a criminal offence? Again, surely it would be better to turn the Bill round the other way so that fishermen plying their traditional trade were automatically exempted and could not be criminalised in the circumstances that I described. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40204-25_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling the amendment. The longer these debates go on, the more it seems to me that banning fishermen from the safety zone is over the top. I realise that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has a different viewpoint. I cannot understand why fishermen are not deemed to be the best judges of whether it is safe to fish in a place. If safety were a measure of things, we would not allow anyone to be on roads at all, given how many people are killed on roads every year.
<P>

<a name="40204-25_para16"></a>I recognise that during the construction period there will certainly be issues, but I do not believe that the Minister has explained at any point the reasoning behind the process&#151;and certainly not to the point at which fishermen should be sent to prison for entering a safety zone. Members of the fishing community, when consulted, asked whether they were not capable of judging when things were safe and when they were not, given the hazards that they face every day around our extremely rocky and hazardous coast, which are likely to be much greater than in a known safety zone, so-called.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I really do not accept that argument. These are safety zones, imposed for safety reasons. The issue is not what harm the fishermen can do to the installation but what harm the installation can do to fishermen, or anyone else approaching it in a dangerous situation. I do not see that there is an argument for exempting fishermen from the provision; in these circumstances, as so often, we are saving fishermen from themselves. Under any other safety provision, we do not say that there is a whole class of people to which it shall not apply. If safety provisions are provided by the state, or required of someone to provide, we do not distinguish as to whom they should apply.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para0"></a>As the noble Baroness said, exemptions are made and those exemptions are bound to have conditions; breach of those conditions then becomes a criminal offence. But that applies to anyone&#151;it is not directed specifically at fishermen, who are entitled to protection as much as anyone else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response, although I do not agree with all that he has said. He has not actually answered my question as to what happens if fishermen happen to drift into that area, in rough weather or in whatever circumstance. Would they just be guilty&#151;would that be it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That would be a matter for the courts, which would consider the mitigating circumstances. I suspect that prosecution would hardly arise in those cases, but it would be either for the prosecuting authority or for the courts to make a common-sense judgment&#151;although the noble Baroness just now rejected the operation of common sense. The clause <P>


<a name="column_GC384"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provides for safety for fishermen and other sea users in the vicinity of these installations. It is safety that has to be protected&#151;their own as well as anyone else's.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The Minister rightly said that it was for the courts to decide, but it is for us as parliamentarians to lay down the law, which the courts then interpret. That is a very different matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I draw the noble Baroness's attention to something that may meet her points partly. Subsection (8) of Clause 84 refers to the person taking all reasonable precautions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to prevent the contravention in question".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-26_para1"></a>
That would probably cover most of the drifting inadvertently, unless it was a case of total negligence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   That is a wonderful phrase that nearly covers everything that could possibly happen. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40204-26_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 108:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 87, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-26_para15"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 86 OR 87
<br>
(1) If the Secretary of State shall grant any consent or make any declaration under section 86 or 87 which shall interfere with the private or commercial interests of any person or corporation, he or it shall be entitled to compensation.
<br>
(2) Such compensation shall not be limited to the financial or other benefit received by the person in whose favour the consent or declaration is made."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-26_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: In presenting the Bill to your Lordships&#151;indeed, to Parliament&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, made the following statement under Section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In my view the provisions of the Energy Bill are compatible with the Convention rights".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-26_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40204-26_para18"></a>The views of the noble Lord on matters of fact are not something with which one should lightly disagree. However, in the case of the provisions of Clauses 86 and 87, it is clear that there are massive encroachments on the proprietary rights of both individuals and businesses. Between them, Clauses 86 and 87 cover some two and a half pages, but I need not trouble the Committee with the text. The gist is fully explained in the marginal notes.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para19"></a>Clause 86 provides for the extinguishment of certain public rights of compensation, while Clause 87 provides for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"further provision relating to public rights of navigation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-26_para20"></a><P>

<a name="40204-26_para21"></a>Subject to anything that my honourable friends in the other place may yet have to say about the details in those two long and complicated clauses, I am not going to argue about the principles involved in them. For example, erections of wind farms offshore may very well interfere with rights of navigation, of access to parts of the shore or with fishing rights. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, and my noble friend Lord Higgins, made that point very strongly earlier. However, there are those who at present enjoy those rights, and possibly other rights. The two clauses empower someone to take them away&#151;presumably for the public good, but additionally for the commercial advantage of some company or other. That termination of rights, which may have existed for hundreds of years, is in fact nothing less than an act of confiscation.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para22"></a>The Minister invoked the European Convention on Human Rights. Allow me to remind Members of the Committee of the first protocol to the convention, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful possession of his possessions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-26_para23"></a>
Savour that primary and overriding principle. The protocol does, however, go on to make exceptions in favour of the public interest, subject to the conditions provided by law, and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the right of a State to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest".

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para25"></a>Those exceptions, governed by the public interest, are undoubtedly the justification for the Minister's claim that the Bill, and, in particular, Clauses 86 and 87, are compatible with the convention on human rights.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para26"></a>Let me assume for the sake of argument today that building monstrous windmills out at sea, at enormous expense, and of dubious effectiveness in generating electricity at reasonable cost at times of the day when it will be of any use, is in fact necessarily in the public interest. Let me further assume, for the sake of the same argument, that these machines, which will interfere with navigation rights, the ability of fishermen to fish, and of the fish to breed, are in fact in the public interest, even though they will be operated, not by the state, in whose favour the exception is made by the convention, but by some commercial firm to whom the state has granted the right to construct and operate these machines. In other words, let me assume for the sake of argument at this time, but subject to what my honourable friends may have to say on the principles involved, that every argument of the Government in support of the power by which they seek to extinguish long-held and valuable private and commercial rights is valid.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para27"></a>The fact is that under the laws and customs of this country, rights of property, whether tangible in the form of land or intangible, such as navigation or fishing rights, are not expropriated by the state under the pretext that it is for the public good. Every person whose land is compulsorily acquired, whether, as in the old days, for the purposes of building a railway, or currently for road building, receives compensation. Even the refusal of planning permission or the existence of a planning scheme affecting a property may attract a claim for compensation. Whether the compensation is adequate or not is of course a matter of opinion.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para28"></a>The rights covered by the clauses are no less valuable, no less important, and certainly not by any means intangible or ephemeral. My proposed new clause gives anyone adversely affected by the operation of the two clauses a right to compensation. I have not specified how that compensation should be calculated. That is a matter for the courts to decide under Section 8 of the Human Rights Act if the Secretary of State does not set a satisfactory figure when exercising his powers under the two clauses. I am content that the legislation should not be too prescriptive in this regard.
<P>

<a name="40204-26_para29"></a>The only constraint that I propose on the level of compensation is that contained in subsection (2) of the new clause. Compensation should relate to the loss suffered by the person whose rights have been terminated or curtailed. That may be far greater than the commercial advantage conferred on the person enjoying the benefit of the clauses. Compensation should therefore cover that loss. I hope that the Minister will agree that this new clause does not <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, that human rights are extremely important. I am sure that the Minister agrees that we must pay extreme regard to them.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para0"></a>With respect, I believe that the noble Baroness slightly spoiled her case by using such emotive language, in referring to offshore wind farms as "monstrous windmills" of dubious efficacy. It is irrelevant whether she believes them to be a good or bad form of power. I would say to those people who object to the proposed excellent wind farms, which will undoubtedly contribute to the National Grid&#151;and is another way of looking at the matter&#151;that I still believe people are more likely to prefer that option, and indeed onshore wind power, to having new nuclear build in their back yard, especially at the stage when we have not solved the issue of nuclear power. I make that point only to say that mixing up whether we agree with the form of power with the issue of human rights creates a difficult argument.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para1"></a>I see that shipping can take a different route. Recreational sailing and boating is public use of what could be said to be the marine equivalent of common land or open access land. There is plenty of other ocean over which people could sail or boat as a recreation. However, I return to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, to the fishing rights. That is what concerns me in this regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   I totally agree with that. I have a modicum of sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness. However, compensation for altering public rights of navigation is almost impossible to quantify for shipping. We should bear in mind that we are dealing with international shipping, not only with British ships. However, I very much go along with what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, said about compensation for fishing rights. That is a much more important problem, which we shall discuss under the next amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I agree with what the noble Lord says. It is difficult to imagine the effect of offshore wind farms on the public. However, I say to Members of the Committee who do not live near the coast where there are a lot of oil rigs that people come to our part of the world on pleasure trips, to look out to sea and see the oil rigs. They get very excited about it. Indeed, buses stop on the road when they get to that point, and the people all get out&#151;rather like the opening of Parliament&#151;and are told about the oil rigs. Therefore, one could say that it is a huge asset to the tourist industry. Equally, in another place, it might be a terrible nuisance.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para2"></a>The effect is very difficult to quantify, but with regard to offshore windmills I do not believe that people are horrified. When there is one right beside where one lives, that is different, as it alters everything about one's landscape. I believe that if wind farms are set up off the coast where I live, people will get quite excited about it.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para3"></a>The fishing industry is different. It is terribly important that people who regularly go and catch prawns and shellfish of different sorts will make the most frightful fuss, and I cannot see a windfarm being set up in those places because there would be such a row. I find it very difficult to anticipate, although I appreciate the point that the noble Baroness is making. She is quite right to raise it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Section 86(1) gives the Secretary of State power to make a declaration extinguishing public rights of navigation, in so far as they exist, in respect of a site of a renewable energy installation. Does the power offend Article 1 of the first protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights?
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para4"></a>The first paragraph of Article 1 of the convention states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law by the general principles of international law".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-27_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40204-27_para6"></a>The Strasbourg jurisprudence affords the concept of "possession" a wide meaning. In a case called Beyeler v Italy, the court held that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the concept of 'possessions' in the first part of Article 1 has an autonomous meaning which is not limited to ownership of physical goods and is independent from the formal classification in domestic law: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as property rights and thus as 'possessions' for the purposes of the provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-27_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40204-27_para8"></a>The fact that domestic law does not acknowledge a particular interest to be a legal right or recognise it as something other than a property right is not determinative under Article 1 of the first protocol. The concept of possessions is not the same as the concept of ownership. It may be sufficient for the purposes of Article 1 that the applicant demonstrates an established interest with economic value. Of course, there must be an entitlement to some real economic benefit, even if its value is not yet ascertained. Possessions have been held, for example, to include the good will of a business.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para9"></a>In the case of Pine Valley Developments v Ireland, the court found that Article 1 was able to protect a legitimate expectation that a certain state of affairs would apply. The loss in that case was in the form of a reduction of value and loss of commercial potential. In the case of Tre Traktorer Aktiebolag v Sweden, the applicant took over a restaurant and subsequently the licence previously granted to serve alcohol was withdrawn. The court held that a licence to serve alcohol could constitute a possession, given that economic interests connected with the running of the restaurant were possessions for the purposes of Article 1.
<P>


<a name="column_GC389"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para10"></a>I incline to the view that a PRN can constitute a possession. First, a recurring theme in case law for determining possession is the concept of an established interest with economic value. I would expect that those exercising a PRN, especially if they were doing so as part of a commercial enterprise, could rely on the decisions of Pine Valley Developments v Ireland and Tre Traktorer Aktiebolag v Sweden.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para11"></a>In my opinion, the broad interpretation of a "possession" is likely to encompass a PRN and, ultimately, it may turn on the particular facts: namely, the number of individuals that would be affected; whether there were other convenient navigation alternatives; and the scale of detriment to any commercial enterprise. Of course, states are allowed to deprive an individual of possessions where it is in the public interest, but that is subject to the conditions provided by law and the general principles of international law that compensation should be paid. The amount of compensation must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para12"></a>Therefore, I believe that it is reasonable to conclude that the right to exercise one's public rights of navigation, at least in some cases, is a possession for the purposes of Article 1. In those circumstances, the Government are obliged to provide a provision for compensation in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para13"></a>There is one other issue of relevance; that is, whether or not the provisions in Schedule 8 to the Electricity Act 1989 meet the Article 6 test in the convention. In my view, there is a potential flaw in the 1989 approach&#151;that is, there are circumstances in which the Government are not obliged to hold a public inquiry. While I accept that if they do hold a public inquiry the possibility for the courts to judicially review on appeal the decisions of that inquiry would bring the Bill within the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights, that would not be the case where the Government decided not to hold a public inquiry. Therefore, in my view, the Bill raises a second potential issue over the European convention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Some helpful and interesting points were made earlier. Perhaps I may make it clear that we are dealing with navigation rights. Fisheries will be the next item.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para14"></a>I am afraid that I disagree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. If we are dealing with Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which obviously the Government take extremely seriously, then we must consider what is regarded as property or possessions and we must examine the way in which domestic law deals with property and possessions.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para15"></a>Throughout, the Bill attempts to strike a fair balance between the rights of the wider community and environmental benefits, and so on, and the rights of the individual in regard to navigation. Therefore, we are operating on a balanced and justifiable basis. However, there is a basic objection to what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggests&#151;that is, whether there is a deprivation of a possession in the first place. <P>


<a name="column_GC390"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The public right&#151;it is a public right; it is not an individual right&#151;to navigation is not, of itself, a possession. It is simply a right to navigate and it may be used for business or pleasure.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para16"></a>Even if it were a possession in the normal parlance of English or Scottish law, the European Convention on Human Rights does not lead to any kind of inescapable conclusion such as the one that the noble Lord draws&#151;for example, that compensation should be paid. Legally speaking, in domestic law the situation in England and Wales is that the public right of navigation is not a property right. Therefore, Article 1 does not apply in this situation.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para17"></a>In Scotland, the situation is somewhat different. However, I believe that it is even more damaging to the case put by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in that the right is treated as one of a number of rights held by the Crown in trust on behalf of the public and forms part of the regalia majora. In Scotland, that right is a right of property, but it is property held by the Crown on behalf of the public. Therefore, no individual member of the public has the right to claim that that is his possession and that he is entitled to compensation for the extinguishing of that right.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para18"></a>Therefore, I do not believe that in any normal reading of either English law or the European convention would the extinguishing of public rights and navigation in either English or Scottish courts be allowable and I do not believe that it would pass the first hurdle. Therefore, I reject the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also referred to Article 6. The procedure under the Electricity Act which is being followed here is a sufficiently fair and balanced judicial or quasi-judicial procedure. I believe that the implication of the noble Lord's comments was that that would probably be the case where a public inquiry operated, but were there not to be a public inquiry because, in his view, there was no resort to a judicial review, doubt would arise.
<P>

<a name="40204-27_para20"></a>I am not sure that the noble Lord is correct to say that there would not be a right to a judicial review of that decision. I suspect that there would be. It would be a different kind of judicial review from the review of the outcome of a public inquiry, but it would be a review of the reasonableness of the action of the Secretary of State in refusing a public inquiry. I undertake to consider that point to see whether any amendment is necessary in that respect. However, I am clear that nothing proposed in the Bill is in any way contradictory to Article 1 of the convention.

<A NAME="40204-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two brief observations to make on what he said. First, his certainty about Article 1 is not reflected in the Government's Explanatory Notes to the Bill, which express some doubt about whether or not Article 1 applies. Secondly, I believe that I made it clear in my opening remarks&#151;this is well reflected in the <P>


<a name="column_GC391"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights&#151;that the domestic classification of property rights is irrelevant as to whether a particular thing is a possession under the first protocol of the convention. The fact that PRN is not a property right in English or Scottish law is neither here nor there so far as concerns the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para0"></a>Perhaps I may add something about judicial review. I was lax in my language when I turned to the question of Article 6. There would, of course, be a right to a statutory review after the public inquiry system set down in the Electricity Act. The nature of the investigation would be very similar to the judicial review but the investigation would, indeed, be set out in statute.

<A NAME="40204-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. I thank particularly my noble friend Lord Kingsland for his clear exposition of what he considers to be the legal position in which we find ourselves. I note what my noble friend Lady Carnegy said. I do not live near enough to the coast to be able to look out and say whether or not these wind farms look good. Sometimes, I wish that I did. The noble Baroness made the point that she thought it would be difficult to quantify what kind of compensation could be awarded. My noble friend Lord Kingsland answered that point in a sense when he said that it would have to be reasonable.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para1"></a>I am sorry that my language offended my namesake, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. She was 100 per cent correct. I wish that I had not expressed my feelings quite so strongly. I noted what the noble Baroness said. I also noted what the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said. I thank the Minister for his reply. We hold different views on the matter, but the bottom line is whether we believe that the people affected are entitled to compensation. That will turn on a legal interpretation.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para2"></a>I heard what the Minister and my noble friend Lord Kingsland said. I very much hope that the Minister was not offended by my remarks. I am not a lawyer and therefore I did not mention all the cases that my noble friend mentioned. I am inclined to go along with the advice of my noble friend Lord Kingsland, particularly as he has been a Member of the European Parliament and is very conversant with all kinds of laws. Therefore, I have confidence in his advice. I hope that I do not embarrass him by saying that, especially if he finds out subsequently in the highest court of the land that he was wrong. Having said that, of course I shall withdraw the amendment, but it is a matter to which we shall certainly return as this is a very serious issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 88, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-28_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMPENSATION FOR FISHING INDUSTRY
<br>
( ) Where the creation of a safety zone under this Part, or where the operation of a renewable energy installation within a safety zone causes or has caused financial loss to United Kingdom fishermen or shell fishermen who traditionally work on or over grounds within that safety zone&#151;
<br>
(a) by interruption of business;
<br>
(b) by causing harm or pollution damage to fish or shellfish;
<br>
(c) by altering the temperature or current flow or other characteristic of the local waters or of any bank, shoal or reef such as to deter fish or shellfish from the area;
<br>
(d) as a result of concerns over the effects on public health of the consuming of fish or shellfish caught within a safety zone; or
<br>
(e) by other means,
<br>
the Secretary of State must establish a scheme of compensation to offer compensation to those fishermen who show that they have traditionally fished on or over those grounds for any loss attributable to the creation of a safety zone."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-28_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment deals with the important issue of potential compensation for fishermen and shell fishermen whose livelihoods may be damaged by the creation of a safety zone or the erection of energy installations within it.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para7"></a>It is important that the Minister should explain to the Committee and to the industry what kind of compensation arrangements the Government envisage. The amendment requires the Minister to set up a compensation scheme for fishermen who can show that they have traditionally always fished over those grounds.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para8"></a>This is an extension of the law. The Bill envisages the creation of zones at sea where fishermen will, in future, at very best only be allowed to go with a permit or by permission. My noble friend Lady Byford mentioned that in an earlier amendment.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para9"></a>Unlike deep sea oil and gas installations, where there are already controls, these installations will in many cases be in inshore fishing grounds and may, in some cases, be on sandbanks or flats that are worked by landing from boats as well as by fishing. What consideration has the Minister given to the effect of installations and safety zones on fishing activity? Will he give an assurance that if fishing is not allowed during the building of an energy installation, there will be a scheme of compensation financed by the government department that has agreed to the creation of the zone?
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para10"></a>It is not enough to say that the fishermen can go elsewhere. It might well be that he has agreed to the installation of a wind farm right in the middle of the best fishing ground off a particular coast. Will fishermen be able to take comparative catches and revenue into account in any claims of compensation? Technology is evolving in this area all of the time. For example, what if it is found at some future date that there are scientific consequences of the installation of wind farms, as is often claimed is the fact with mobile telephone masts?
<P>


<a name="column_GC393"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para11"></a>I have no reason to think that might be the case, but what if at any time in the future there were public health concerns arising from the operation of installations and there was either an effect on sales of fish or the Government closed an area to fishing? Can the Minister assure the Committee that a scheme of compensation would apply in those circumstances?
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para12"></a>It is also the case that erecting or operating a major structure out at sea can have effects on the temperature of the surrounding waters or may affect the flow of water or tide so as to alter the configuration of the seabed or of a sandbank. The effects may well be marginal but they could happen and could have a direct and serious impact on the appearance of fish and shellfish.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para13"></a>Can the Minister assure the Committee that compensation would be available for fishermen in such a case? It may be that there are other instances that other Members of the Committee might bring to mind. However, I believe that the issue is one of great importance and I hope that the Minister can explain in this debate what plans he may have in mind.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para14"></a>I did not say at the beginning, although I suppose it is unnecessary in Committee, that this is a probing amendment as, indeed, all amendments are. I did not say either that although the amendment is tabled in my name also, I am moving it on behalf of my noble friend Lady Byford, who, regrettably, was not able to stay any longer. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   As I said on a previous amendment, I support the thrust behind this. I believe there is a case in point as regards fishermen, not necessarily just in relation to offshore wind farms but in relation to the oncoming alternative energy sources, which I mentioned earlier. I refer, for instance, to wave power installations which I understand might cover quite large areas of the Celtic Sea; a very well-fished area. I believe there is a case for considering this subject more closely and would be interested to hear what the Government have to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness sets up a whole framework for compensation. It covers a number of direct and potentially indirect effects on fisheries as the result of the creation of an offshore installation and safety zone. Again, the issue of whether the amendment is entirely appropriate in this part of the Bill is in issue. This part deals with safety zones. Once there is an installation, a safety zone is required. It is the initial installation which may be the issue.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para15"></a>However, the issue of establishing a fairly wide-ranging form of compensation in the scheme proposed by the noble Baroness does not seem to be appropriate anywhere in the Bill. In most cases when we deal with diversion of fishing away from a relatively small part of what is likely to be a fishing area, the fishermen are able to fish a few miles away, or even a few hundred yards away in terms of fishing banks as a whole. Therefore, there is unlikely to be a demonstrable loss of income and loss of access to fish. Contributions at earlier stages suggested that more fish might be <P>


<a name="column_GC394"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>attracted to those zones, and they would create a potential fishing site that may or may not be accessible, depending on the safety considerations. We would hardly be depriving them of a previous income. We may be creating a different eco-climate.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para16"></a>No question of compensation would arise in either of those cases. There may be an issue, in some limited cases, where the installation and the safety zone around it really hit, rather than simply diverted, and caused the loss of a major source of fish income to the fishermen. In those cases, the effect would need to be discussed prior to the installation, and it would need to be determined whether compensation should be payable. Compensation would therefore depend on the particular circumstances and whether there had been an informed and reasonable discussion between the developers and all parties prior to those proposals.
<P>

<a name="40204-28_para17"></a>That is one factor that would have to be taken into account in the decision on whether consent would be given in the first place. I am not ruling out, in all circumstances, compensation to fishermen for loss of access and, therefore, income. A broad-based scheme, with all its direct and indirect effects on fishery income, would not be appropriate. It would be dealt with in the normal way, either by negotiation or litigation in order to establish compensation. I accept that fishermen may be in a different situation to the general issues of public rights of navigation, but it would be a limited subset of fisheries rights that would be affected, and they would have to be dealt with case by case.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-29_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   Before my noble friend decides what she will do with the amendment, is the Minister suggesting that no compensation is payable by government, but if fishing rights were extinguished by an operator, even for a certain amount of time, the operator might have to bear the compensation for those who had been fishing up until then?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There are two issues: first, whether the developers, in their proposition, have reached an agreement with people likely to be affected that recognises the need for compensation; and secondly, whether, if they fail to do so, that is unreasonable behaviour on the part of the developers. In most analogous situations, on-land developments will involve a degree of compensation for loss of access to adjacent businesses. There is an element of compensation in the original proposition.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para0"></a>If that has not been faced up to, the Secretary of State would have to bear that in mind in the decision whether to give consent in the first place. If consent has been given without compensation in the first place, there may still be a right to compensation, should it subsequently be established that a serious and irreplaceable source of income had been destroyed as a result of the decision to go ahead. In most cases, the developer would pay the compensation, but there could be one-off cases where compensation from the Government might be appropriate.

<A NAME="40204-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 109:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 89, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-29_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "POWERS OF GEMA TO SECURE INFORMATION FROM OFFSHORE GENERATORS OF ELECTRICITY
<br>
 Regulations may provide that GEMA shall have such powers as the Secretary of State shall consider necessary or expedient to secure information from offshore generators of electricity including generators from wind, tides or waves."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-29_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment originated with my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding. He is unavoidably absent this evening and will be for a couple of weeks. At the same time, I would like to speak to his identical Amendment No. 109A. Both amendments are to the same effect. They give GEMA power to secure information, first from generators of offshore electricity and, secondly, in Amendment No. 109A, from offshore producers of gas. But the principles are the same in both cases.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para5"></a>Industrial and commercial gas consumers have long complained that they do not have the same access to information about gas production offshore as the companies which produce the gas. They are, therefore, at an unfair disadvantage when trading with these producers in the wholesale British gas market. Ofgem shares this concern with them. They would like to extend the information available both to Transco as operator of the British gas network and to consumers. We think that this could be helpful for security of supply.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para6"></a>Ofgem's responsibility for regulation broadly extends only to the onshore gas market in Britain. The DTI is responsible for regulating the offshore oil and gas sector. This issue of information is, therefore, relevant to both Ofgem and the DTI as regulators, because what happens offshore may very well be&#151;indeed, it is likely&#151;material to movements onshore of the wholesale gas market.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para7"></a>Let me summarise Ofgem's publicly stated views about information disclosure regarding offshore gas. They come from a paper with the far from succinct title of The gas trading arrangements. Reform of the gas balancing regime. Next Steps. It was published in April 2003. They are as follows. On operational efficiency, Transco faces difficulties when determining whether to take action to balance gas inputs and offtakes. These difficulties are exacerbated by the unpredictability of offshore daily production.
<P>


<a name="column_GC396"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para8"></a>When, due to lack of information, Transco takes unnecessary action to balance input and offtakes, this imposes additional cost on the market which inevitably in the long term is passed on to the consumer.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para9"></a>On market efficiency, the lack of information available to all market participants about offshore production reduces their ability to react to, and to address, supply shortfalls. Unexpected supply shortfalls could increase the volatility of gas prices, thus increasing the cost of operating the system. Security of supply is also adversely affected by the absence of timely offshore information to Transco and other participants. That is because there may be insufficient time for parties to react to supply shortfall, such as an outage, which may increase the likelihood of a gas emergency.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para10"></a>There are what Ofgem pretentiously called "information asymmetries". In plain and simple English that means that participants who had access to information about offshore production via their offshore affiliates would be better able to predict price movements, and therefore would have an unfair advantage over those without offshore affiliates.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para11"></a>Last autumn, the DTI and Ofgem made a joint approach to the offshore gas producers to secure greater release of information to Transco and to consumers on a voluntary basis. The approach was in three phases. The first has already been agreed. The second, involving the release of information to Transco as network operator, is making progress. But the third, which is about the release of consolidated information to consumers much closer to "real time" in a manner designed to accommodate legitimate confidentiality concerns of individual producers, has not yet advanced very much. Ofgem regards reaching a solution on all three phases as important.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para12"></a>The remarks that I paraphrased from Ofgem's published concerns about the gas industry apply in equal measure to electricity, hence the same amendment is tabled by my noble friend&#151;Amendment No. 109A.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para13"></a>These amendments are not designed to inhibit competition between suppliers in either the gas or the electricity industry. They are designed, however, to inhibit unfair competition. They are also designed to protect the market and ultimately the consumer&#151;you and me&#151;from fluctuations in supply, and hence the risk of sudden shortages. Fluctuations in wholesale and market prices of fuel inevitably get passed on to the consumer. Inefficient fluctuations in supply inevitably lead to waste of valuable resources.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para14"></a>I do not believe that any form of voluntary arrangement between producers can be relied on to resolve the problem. In saying this I do not impugn the good faith of members of the industry, or even of the DTI, who would have to sanction any scheme.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para15"></a>I have not considered, even assuming it is a factor, whether a voluntary exchange of information between market participants may be a breach of the Competition Act and goodness knows how many EU directives. I know not whether that is the case, but it <P>


<a name="column_GC397"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC397</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could be. I have not managed to look into that matter which occurred to me when reading a speech of my noble friend Lord Jenkin. I hope that I shall be given a reply to that point.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para16"></a>Having said that, if a voluntary scheme does not prove successful after a reasonable period, we would expect the Secretary of State to have the power to require the release of this information. I ought to mention that just before I entered the Chamber today I was sent&#151;I shall not say from whom&#151;yet another briefing on this issue. The authors of that briefing said they considered that giving away too much information might be very bad for competition. I just mention that as it is appropriate to give the whole picture, as undoubtedly the Government will do when replying to this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para17"></a>I believe that this is a matter which has to be resolved by the DTI. The wide discretionary statutory powers that these two amendments propose would enable that to be done without further recourse to primary legislation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I shall give rather short shrift to Amendment No. 109 but respond fully to Amendment No. 109A which raises the really fundamental issues here. I can be reasonably brief on Amendment No. 109. GEMA already has powers through standard licence condition 13 of the Electricity Generation Licence to require licensees to provide the information the authority needs to carry out its functions. Clause 79 of the Bill extends the requirement for a generation licence offshore and standard licence condition 13 will apply to offshore electricity generators. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness on Amendment No. 109.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para18"></a>However, she raises a whole raft of interesting questions and sensitive matters on Amendment No. 109A. I address most of my remarks to that amendment in the hope of persuading her that it is not necessary although we recognise the anxieties that have given rise to it. Ofgem is not the offshore gas regulator and so the situation is very different from that pertaining to electricity.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para19"></a>First, I reconfirm the Government's commitment to consumers of gas through a robust secure gas supply system and a well functioning gas market. The Government recognise that these may need to be underpinned by further access to information&#151;that was the main burden of the noble Baroness's remarks&#151;about the supply capability of the offshore industry. In general the Government prefer to avoid legislative provision if we can meet our objectives with a lighter touch. We believe that we can do so in this instance.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para20"></a>We are already working with the upstream gas industry towards this end on the basis of voluntary agreement. I believe that the noble Baroness recognised that fact. We do not believe that the sweeping powers proposed in the amendment are the best way forward. They could lead to an inflexible <P>


<a name="column_GC398"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>outcome and would lead to unnecessary bureaucracy, which I know the noble Baroness detests as much as we do on this side of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para21"></a>The noble Baroness was very honest in her presentation of the issues and recognised that this is a sensitive and technically complex area where the commercial concerns of individual players must be finely balanced with the need for the market to have access to the requisite information.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para22"></a>"Information" is a blanket term. It can be easy or costly to provide; it can be hard data or depend very much on judgment. As the noble Baroness indicated, it may be commercially sensitive and its disclosure may harm a commercial player even though&#151;perhaps because&#151;it gives commercial advantage to another player in the market.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para23"></a>Our great preference in this difficult area is for voluntary arrangements rather than compulsion. Our reasons for that are that we want to work with industry, not against it; we are not in the business of placing avoidable burdens on industry; and we are conscious that the North Sea is just one production province competing for the resources of petroleum companies in what is a global market. To increase the burden on this industry could impact on the attractiveness of the province to both existing participants and potential new entrants with the inevitable risk of accelerating the decline of economic UK energy production. The Committee will be aware that one major company has already significantly reduced its commitment to the North Sea.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para24"></a>Perhaps at this stage I may declare a tangential interest. My eldest son works for BP, but he is safely located in Tokyo and therefore not directly involved in BP's endeavours in this part of the world.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para25"></a>We consider that a well-focused voluntary arrangement is likely to be more successful, effective and ultimately more responsive to market needs than a statutory requirement, which the amendment proposes. Therefore, it would not be sensible at this time to confer such wide powers while the prospect of effective voluntary information provision exists.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para26"></a>I recognise the strength of the argument presented by the noble Baroness in terms of the difficulties surrounding these issues. We know that we need to get the balance right. We have been working on these issues for some time. I cannot pretend that at this stage we have completed all the discussions and are in a position to say that everyone is satisfied. I am sure that if we were, the amendment would not have been proposed.
<P>

<a name="40204-29_para27"></a>However, we are doing considerable work in this regard and have made significant progress. In the past few months, agreements have been reached, which have moved things further forward. Our main proposition is that this is the way we should go rather than to enclose the concept in statute, which would produce a rigidified structure and place burdens upon industry. We do not think that that is the way forward. It is on that basis that I ask the noble Baroness perhaps to consider withdrawing her amendment.

<P>

<a name="40204-30_para0"></a>Does this Bill make a difference to the offshore gas industry? I wonder how the amendment arose. Does the Bill have anything to do with North Sea gas?

<P>

<a name="40204-30_para1"></a>The noble Baroness has brought in a potential solution to some of the difficulties by proposing an amendment that would write a structure into the Bill.

<a name="40204-30_para2"></a>I said that I thought that a voluntary system probably would not work. That was how I put it. If, no matter how hard one tries to influence people, time passes and the voluntary system does not work, will the Government consider having an alternative system?

<A NAME="40204-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Baroness has raised some significant issues. They will have to be resolved. We must get the balance right. If we reach the point of failure with the present process, the Government must, ultimately, act in the interests of the nation. The supply of gas at a reasonable price is an important factor for the nation. We might have to take some legislative opportunity. I hope to get her to agree at this stage that now is not the time for that.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40204-30_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: The point of the amendment is to extend the principal objective of the Secretary of State and Ofgem under the Electricity Act 1989 to include sustainable development and environmental conditions.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para8"></a>Section 3A(1) of the 1989 Act defines the principal objective of the Secretary of State and Ofgem as the protection of the interests of consumers of electricity supply by promoting effective competition between generators and suppliers. That is still extremely important, but it does not reflect the way in which government policy has moved, especially in the past few years, nor does it reflect the importance put on sustainable development and environmental matters&#151;the reason that the Bill has come into being.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para9"></a>Energy policy has a significant impact on the environment, as, I am sure, the Government recognise, through the technologies developed and how and where they are sited. The Government's Energy White Paper states that energy policy should ensure that significant damage resulting from climate change should not occur. It recognises that the supply of electricity is fundamental to the achievement of sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para10"></a>The amendment would give Ofgem and the Secretary of State the latitude to expand their view of their duties. Clause 89 is an amendment to the Electricity Act, so it is right that we should amend the Act to reflect the different weight and greater importance now given to sustainability. I tabled the amendment to try to do that.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para11"></a>I remember that in discussions on the Water Bill the Government agreed that Ofwat should have a very similar duty; it was felt that was very important with regard to water. So there is a precedent for this. I hope, therefore, that the Government will feel, in the same <P>


<a name="column_GC401"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way as we have come to regard water sustainability as very important, that energy policy and its delivery should also be thus regarded. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am not proposing to accept the amendment, but I am grateful for this opportunity to set out how we are already tackling sustainable development and environmental concerns, which is what the amendment addresses and the noble Baroness has articulated.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para12"></a>There is already a clear and express duty on the Secretary of State and on the authority to have regard to environmental matters when carrying out their respective functions under Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989. This duty is very similar to the one contained in the amendment. There is also a duty on the authority to have regard to guidance issues by the Secretary of State on social and environmental matters. In light of these existing duties on the Secretary of State and the authority, we obviously consider that the amendment would merely duplicate those duties and is therefore not necessary.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para13"></a>The draft social and environmental guidelines, currently laid in Parliament, which the Secretary of State from time to time issues, seek to support the implementation of the longer term strategies set out in the Energy White Paper. The guidance includes a request that the authority report annually on the way it has regard to the guidance each year.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para14"></a>The Sustainable Energy Act 2003 placed a statutory requirement on the authority to produce regulatory impact assessments for all important decisions. These must include environmental impact assessments.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para15"></a>Helping protect the environment is one of the seven themes in the authority's draft corporate strategy 2004&#150;07. The authority reports to Parliament, therefore there is already the opportunity for Parliament to address the authority should there be concern that this area of work is not being addressed or meeting the standards required.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para16"></a>It should also be noted that early in 2003, Dr Robin Bidwell was appointed as a member to the authority. He has substantial environmental experience.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para17"></a>The overall duties of the energy regulator were debated in some detail during the passage of the Utilities Act 2000 and also when the Energy White Paper was published. The current drafting of the principal objective and the general duties strikes a fair balance between protecting the interests of consumers and safeguarding the environment.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para18"></a>There was general agreement, through the Energy White Paper consultation, that the principal objective and general duties did not need addressing. This ensures regulatory certainty, which is a must if our energy markets are to work. Piecemeal rearranging of the regulator's general duties does not provide for  regulatory certainty, which is an important objective.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para19"></a>We consider that the authority already has the clear duty, which the noble Baroness is seeking to impose through this amendment, to have regard to environmental, social and economic considerations. <P>


<a name="column_GC402"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Through the social and environmental guidance, we have the ability, from time to time, to give guidance to the authority on these matters. We therefore do not see the need to amend the authority's duties.
<P>

<a name="40204-30_para20"></a>Because we understand and sympathise with every objective outlined by the noble Baroness and because we think we have the structure in place to guarantee that we meet those objectives, we hope she will consider that her amendment is not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-30_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I shall read carefully what he said. I think that there is a difference between the spirit of his reply&#151;and that of course that was an important objective and so on&#151;and the actual wording of my amendment which wanted to ensure that having regard to sustainability was part of the principal objective. Perhaps he can explain whether the duty laid on Ofwat is greater than we propose to lay on Ofgem. If there is a difference, why does the DTI think that difference is necessary?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Ofwat is a different structure from Ofgem. Ofwat has clear environmental and sustainable factors built into its remit and its role. The broad objectives fit into the overall pattern of the principles which affect a range of these utilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I would suggest respectfully to the Minister that the factors are built into the role much more firmly and much better because we gave Ofwat that particular duty during the passage of the Water Bill. So I think I shall have regard to what the Minister has said. I shall attempt to return to this issue at a later date. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>


<a name="column_GC403"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para3"></a>Amendment No. 109AAA is a probing amendment. It extends the current requirement to notify local planning authorities of applications to develop an electricity generating installation under Sections 36 or 37 of the Electricity Act and to include&#151;as far as possible&#151;any competent authorities of relevance to that application. The requirement to notify local planning authorities of these applications may not be widely applicable in the marine environment, where they do not have jurisdiction. So the amendment is necessary to ensure that the relevant competent authorities&#151;such as English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales or the Joint Nature Conservancy Council&#151;are given adequate notice of such applications.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para4"></a>The amendment also ensures that, where there are outstanding objections from any authority consulted, the Secretary of State will be required to hold a public inquiry; for example, if English Nature were giving contrary advice. Public inquiries provide a tried and tested way in which all the pros and cons of development proposals can be examined in detail. I move the amendment partly because&#151;as I said before&#151;we do not have a Marine Act to protect marine areas or a strategic environmental assessment; and, as the Minister told me yesterday, there is no intention to bring forward such a provision within the next few years. Therefore, I feel that we should consider these amendments.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para5"></a>Amendment 109AB seeks to impose a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that regulations exist that set out how all interested parties can comment on applications made under Sections 36 or 37 of the Electricity Act. The Secretary of State currently has a permissive power to produce regulations that set out how applications to develop an electricity generating installation should be advertised and dealt with. The amendment would change that power to a duty.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para6"></a>In addition, there are questions about whether the current regulations will apply in the marine environment. The existing regulations are The Electricity (Applications for Consent) Regulations 1990 (SI 455). They are comprehensive but need to be replaced to reflect the changes to the Electricity Act in relation to offshore wind farms for the simple reason that they are drafted to deal with terrestrial applications. We are now considering applications that would fall within the marine environment and I should like to know if those changes are adequately covered by existing regulations. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The effect of the amendments taken together would be to expand considerably the list of organisations which have the power to force the Secretary of State to hold a public inquiry if they object to an application for a Section 36 consent for a generating station or a Section 37 consent for an overhead line. At present, under Schedule 8 of the Electricity Act only the planning authority has the special power to force the Secretary of State to hold a <P>


<a name="column_GC404"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public inquiry. That is because the planning authority represents a democratically-elected body representing people who live in the area, and has the responsibility for planning. It is right and proper that it should have that ability.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para7"></a>However, in my view it would be wrong to go further. Expanding the number of organisations which could require the Secretary of State to hold a public inquiry would almost certainly lead to more public inquiries based probably on the views of special interest groups. The whole planning system could be re-prioritised in a way that would thwart the Government's renewable energy objectives.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para8"></a>Under Schedule 8 the Secretary of State already has the power to consider objections from anyone and to decide whether to hold a public inquiry. She is therefore bound to see any proposal in the round and to take a balanced view of it.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para9"></a>The list of competent authorities could be interpreted to include some strange entries. It seems a nonsense to give a power to a government Minister to force a public inquiry on another Minister when the Government take their decisions collectively. While Scottish Ministers have devolved responsibility for consents under Sections 36 and 37 in Scotland and Scottish territorial waters, it would be odd to give them a power to force a public inquiry into a wind farm in southern England, which I believe would be the effect of the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para10"></a>The amendments also go over ground which is already covered in the Electricity (Applications for Consent) Regulations 1990. Among other things, those regulations set out that a notice of application for consent must be published in a number of relevant newspapers. They provide for the Secretary of State to direct that a notice should be served on a specified person or persons and set out minimum timescales within which objections to any applications for consent should be sent to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para11"></a>The regulations apply to onshore and offshore consents and have been used satisfactorily as the basis for applications received, for example, in relation to the sites in round one of offshore wind farm leasing. The regulations will be amended or replaced after the Bill has been enacted to take account of changes introduced in the Bill. However, it would be more appropriate for the objectives in Amendment No. 109AAB to be covered by those regulations; in effect they are already covered by them. Therefore, I do not think that it would be sensible to accept the amendments, the last of which is already provided for in secondary legislation.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-31_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40204-31_para17"></a>The noble Duke said: This is a probing amendment. New Section 47A(1) of the Bill states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The matters to which the Secretary of State may have regard, in exercising or performing the powers and duties conferred or imposed on him by or under this Act, include, in particular&#151;

<a name="40204-31_para19"></a>
The Secretary of State has enormous powers and responsibilities in the exercise of his office. Many of his decisions will affect individuals, companies, employees, families and other classes of people. Is it right that he should take into consideration not only the matters brought before him but others that it appears to him,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may be made in the future"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40204-31_para20"></a>
Is it proper that he should allow the "likelihood" of similar activities occurring sometime in the future to sway his judgment in the present? Will the Minister give examples of the kind of situations that might justify paragraphs (c) and (d) of the new section? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   This is an important issue. I am grateful to the noble Duke for giving me the opportunity to show how we shall approach these important issues in the future.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para21"></a>The noble Duke will recognise that the Petroleum Act 1998 is concerned with the licensing and control of oil and gas activities. Clause 90 of the Energy Bill amends the 1998 Act in a way intended to allow the Secretary of State, in exercising the Act's powers, to take into account existing and possible future offshore electricity generation activities. That is wholly sensible. We need to control the use of our energy resources that lie offshore on a strategic basis, looking at the different ways they can best be utilised, both now and in the future. Clause 90 enables the Secretary of State to consider actual and possible future electricity generation activities when exercising oil and gas responsibilities. It really does no more than that.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para22"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 109B would be to leave the Secretary of State able to take into account existing and currently proposed electricity generation activities in exercising 1998 Act powers, but unable to take into account anticipated future proposals or the likelihood of current or future proposals becoming reality. That would be too short-term an approach. It is essential that we are able to look ahead and plan <P>


<a name="column_GC406"></a>

<B>4 Feb 2004 : Column GC406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>properly. That means looking ahead at the scenarios for oil and gas and for offshore renewable energy generation in the context of the UK's overall energy needs.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para23"></a>It is essential that the two sectors are able to co-exist in a sensible way. There are already examples of the relationship being very productive&#151;for example, wind energy generation capacity being developed on oil and gas infrastructure. The Government are also doing their bit. Licensing and consents responsibilities for oil and gas and electricity are combined in a single unit at the Department of Trade and Industry. That unit is responsible for the programme of offshore strategic environmental assessments, SEAs being an essential tool in determining where energy activity will be directed. The SEA programme has now been redirected and involves integrated assessments of oil and gas and renewables.
<P>

<a name="40204-31_para24"></a>For those reasons, we consider that the 1998 Act needs amendment. Clause 90 needs to remain as drafted so that we can continue to move towards a fully joined-up approach to oil, gas and electricity. That is the substance of Clause 90.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204-32_spmin4"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40204-32_para2"></a>First, may I say that our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims of this tragedy?

<P>

<a name="40204-32_para3"></a>It is too early to speculate about the cause of the fire. Investigations are already under way in Scotland and we will be looking very closely at their findings and considering the implications for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40204-32_para4"></a>The cornerstone of our policy remains the prevention of fire. When fires do occur, simple precautions such as keeping fire doors closed and installing smoke alarms can play a vital role in reducing death and injury. Integrated risk management plans will make sure that more work is done by the fire and rescue service to prevent fires in the first place, by identifying those people in the community most at risk and targeting resources more effectively.
<P>

<a name="40204-32_para5"></a>Sprinklers can also play an important role in suppressing fires where they have broken out, though it is too early to conclude that if the Rosepark Nursing Home had been fitted with a sprinkler system, any loss of life could have been prevented.
<P>

<a name="40204-32_para6"></a>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been actively investigating the effectiveness of sprinkler systems in tackling fires in residential properties. The results of this work, which is being undertaken on our behalf by the Building Research Establishment, are being fed into the review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations (England & Wales), which is currently under way. A report of the work will shortly be published, enabling those involved with fire safety in buildings to gain a more comprehensive understanding of residential sprinkler systems. However, the tragic incident at the weekend indicates that sprinklers may have a role to play in protecting vulnerable groups such as homes for children, homes for elderly people, homes for disabled people and higher risk houses in multiple occupation.

<P>

<a name="40204-32_para9"></a>On 5 December 2002 I placed the independent review of BBC News 24 by Richard Lambert in the Libraries of both Houses, together with a letter setting out my response.

<P>

<a name="40204-32_para10"></a>In response to the review, I attached two further conditions to the approvals of BBC News 24. These required the governors to publish their response to the Lambert report by the end of March 2003, and to promulgate revised commitments for the service, taking account of Richard Lambert's recommendations, by the end of May 2003.
<P>

<a name="40204-32_para11"></a>In addition, I was minded to attach a third condition requiring the governors to report more fully on the delivery of News 24 in the BBC's annual reports. I stated that I would reconsider the intention in the light of the BBC's formal response and subsequent 2003 annual report.
<P>

<a name="40204-32_para12"></a>I have judged that these two documents provide enough information and demonstrate sufficient improvements to remove the need for a further condition on the approval.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Turnberg </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>In the light of the recommendations of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in its report The Use of GM Crops in Developing Countries, whether the investment in publicly-funded research into genetically modified crops is adequate to fulfil the United Kingdom's obligations to third-world countries.[HL1022]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204w01_spmin0"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  The Government welcome the report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics on The Use of GM Crops in Developing Countries. The report offers a constructive contribution to the on-going debate on genetic modification technologies. The Government share the report's conclusions that achieving food security and reducing poverty in developing countries are complex issues, that GM crops are unlikely to feed the world but that in some circumstances they could make a useful contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="40204w01_para0"></a>The Department for International Development is currently preparing a new strategy to guide its future research investments. Under this, the department expects to maintain a substantial programme of agricultural research. In support of this intention, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development recently announced an additional &#163;30 million over the next three years for the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, a major part of the global effort to mobilise agricultural science to reduce poverty. Some of this funding may support research on genetic modification technologies provided that they have the potential to benefit poor farmers if used safely and responsibly and that developing countries themselves are able to make their own informed choices on whether to adopt these technologies. DfID seeks to ensure that all technologies that it promotes are safe, affordable, appropriate and respond to demand from poor people.

<FONT SIZE=3>infrastructure steering group. This group includes the European Investment Bank, World Bank, European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, Council of Europe Bank and is chaired by the European Commission. Under the framework of the stability pact, 57 infrastructure projects in phase 1 have received a total of 3.68 billion euros in three sectors: regional transport, energy and environment. The next phase will also focus on infrastructure investment and is on-going. The stability pact has also encouraged foreign direct investment by helping to create free trade in the region.

<P>

<a name="40204w01_para2"></a>The river Danube is open for navigation. All of the debris from the bridges destroyed in 1999 was cleared from the river by May 2003 and almost 7,000 vessels passed through Novi Sad in 2003. The Danube Commission is not responsible for rebuilding the bridges. However, one bridge has been replaced by a pontoon bridge (river traffic is allowed through every second night), one by a temporary bridge and one bridge is being rebuilt, with completion expected by the end of 2004.

<P>
<UL>Whether the Gay Police Association and the Black Police Association are officially recognised by the Metropolitan Police and other police forces in the United Kingdom; whether they have any negotiating rights of representation; and, if so, whether the same recognition and rights would be extended to other police associations seeking to promote interests involving race, colour, sexual preference or particular lifestyles.[HL969]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  None of the staff support associations, including the Black Police Association and the Gay Police Association, is formally recognised by the Metropolitan Police Service for collective bargaining purposes; nor do they have the representational or negotiating rights of the Police Federation, Superintendents' Association or the recognised constituent trade unions. The staff support associations are however consulted regarding policy changes, particularly with regard to diversity issues.
<P>

<a name="40204w01_para3"></a>The Government have a shared interest in working collaboratively with these and other staff associations, including the British Association for Women in Policing. They are represented on a number of Home Office groups and are consulted on a wide range of policy initiatives to improve diversity in the workplace and to ensure effective delivery of policing services to all communities. The National Black Police Association, for example, is represented on the Lawrence Steering Group, contributing to diversity issues and providing a vital perspective on the link between communities and police.

<P>
<UL>What proportion of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is found in:
<P>
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>(a) most cannabis; and
<P>
<P>
<br>
(b) skunk cannabis; and[HL987]
<P>
What proportion used in the United Kingdom they believe to be skunk cannabis.[HL988]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40204w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The THC content of different cannabis products has varied and continues to vary widely. The Forensic Science Service (FSS) regularly analyses drug seizures and indicates that new growing techniques since the 1990s have led to some new products, such as skunk, coming onto the market with average THC levels two or three times greater than for other cannabis products.
<P>

<a name="40204w01_para5"></a>There is no accurate estimate available for the proportion of skunk available as a proportion of all cannabis used in the U.K. The FSS has little recorded information on the type of herbal cannabis encountered. However, anecdotal information from FSS scientists suggests that there has been an increase in "skunk" type cannabis in both police and customs seizures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Acton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis can produce a psychotic reaction.[HL986]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  Research suggests that cannabis, especially in high doses, can produce a "toxic psychosis" in individuals who have no history of severe mental illness, and that one constituent delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) itself has dose-related effects producing acute symptoms and signs. These resolve themselves once the effect of the drug wears off.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40204w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   The Department of Health has recently commissioned a &#163;120,000 study into the relationship between antifungal drug use, salivary gland dysfunction and antifungal drug resistance in patients with advanced cancer. The department also supports fungal disease research carried out within the National Health Service. South Manchester University Hospital NHS Trust and Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust have an ongoing programme of research on invasive fungal diseases. The two trusts spent &#163;227,000 on this programme in 2002&#150;03. In addition, the department supports fungal disease research carried out by the Health Protection Agency.

<a name="40204w01_para7"></a>The Medical Research Council has supported research on fungal diseases and is currently funding one grant.
<P>

<a name="40204w01_para8"></a>The total value of grants and studentships awarded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council since 1997 for research into the causes and treatment of fungal diseases is approximately &#163;3.5 million.

Such applications have included proposals from schools to introduce innovative changes in the school day.
<P>

<a name="40204w02_para1"></a>The Education Act 2002, Section 4, requires that if the governing body of a qualifying school, maintained by a local education authority, wishes to make an application for an order under the "Power to Innovate", they must consult that local education authority and such persons as appear to them to be appropriate. In doing so they must have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State which sets out advice for applicants on the issue of consultation.

<A NAME="40204w02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The Government's aim is that there should be increased participation of disabled people in public appointments. Statistics on disabled people holding public appointments show that since 2001, when statistics were first collected, there has been an increase in the representation of disabled people on the boards of public bodies from at least 1.5 per cent in 2001, to at least 3.1 per cent in 2003.
<P>

<a name="40204w02_para10"></a>Information abut the progress made by individual departments is provided in Delivering Diversity in Public Appointments 2003 published on 17 December 2003, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
