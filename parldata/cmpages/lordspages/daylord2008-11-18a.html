Co-operation with international partners is crucial to an effective global response, and to this end we will continue to work with those partners, including the Financial Stability Forum and the G20. Given their role in hosting offshore financial centres, the Crown dependencies and Overseas Territories have an important role to play in this international response.</p>

In his Statement yesterday, the Prime Minister promised that he would bring greater transparency to tax havens by including them in the scope of the financial system. Will the Minister confirm that &#147;tax haven&#148; and &#147;offshore financial centre&#148; are interchangeable concepts? I know that some Crown dependencies object very strongly to being called tax havens, but actually an offshore financial centre is a place where people put their money in order, among other things, to minimise their tax obligations, and therefore it is a tax haven.</p>

Under certain definitions, could the United Kingdom be considered to be one of those centres? Some billionaires, and even modest millionaires, come here from time to time and are evading or avoiding tax. Apparently, we are counting how many days a lot of these people spend here.

In recent years, we have taken steps to tighten up the process to reduce tax evasion, including through the tax and information exchange agreements to which I referred earlier. As a result of information exchanges with major banks, we recently secured more than &#163;400 million of tax repayments, and we believe that there is considerable potential to extend the programme further. We also announced last year further changes to non-domicile status, in particular to ensure that those who stay here for longer than seven years make a fair contribution to British society and the British economy. I cannot quantify tax evasion because by its very nature it is not a figure that is easy to place. However, we are vigilant in our pursuit of tax evasion.</p>

In part, that is a consequence of tax policies, the national minimum wage and benefits. The proportion of tax paid by the wealthy continues to increase. The top 10 per cent of income tax payers pay more than 50 per cent of all income tax proceeds.</p>

Does he see the merit in having a capital gains tax rate that applied at the same level as income so that the wealthy did not have an incentive to go down a capital gains tax route, which means that they are paying tax at a lower rate than ordinary rate taxpayers?</p>

Perhaps we ought to revise our consideration and include houses not at current prices but at the long-run supply price: that would give us a more realistic account of what wealth is. We cannot have wealth being high one day and low the next: that cannot be true economics.</p>

They use the Gini coefficient, which is derived from the Lorenz curve. They use probate material that they supplement by modelling adjustments. At the heart of the question of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, is a very acute and correct observation. More importantly, a new wealth and assets survey has been introduced, covering a cohort base of more than 32,000 people, which will measure the progress of their wealth, including assets such as pensions claims. As times goes by, we will get much more reliable data from this new series, on which we will make our first report next year.</p>

It is not just the MoD that is involved; work very closely with other government departments, and all the potential customers for DIS have been consulted. Many of the reductions will be made because we are significantly reducing the business support staff, and that can be achieved as a result of the planned co-location in London, where we are going from three sites to one site, which in itself will have significant benefits in London.

I thank the Minister for a number of useful explanations, which have been sent to us over the past few days and have helped to clarify the various issues with which we have been concerned. I have tabled the amendments because some areas of national infrastructure are clearly devolved and within the competence of the Scottish Executive, for which the correct convention for any legislative process is that a Sewel motion would be required. However, in addition, I get the sense that the Government are concerned that there might be areas where we stray unwittingly into devolved territory. To my mind, my amendment deals with an important area that is clearly  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1016"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1016</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not devolved but has great importance to the future, especially the economic well-being, of the whole country. As noble Lords will be aware, we have touched on the subject at various stages in the passage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81118-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08111872000096"></a>When the Scotland Act was passed in this House, the provision and regulation of rail services was clearly a reserved matter. Since then, an interesting series of statutory instruments have made many useful amendments to the situation. The first enabled the Scottish Parliament to transfer to certain Scottish public authorities the same rail responsibilities exercised by a passenger transport authority. The second was to give the Scottish Executive power to provide grants to the Strategic Rail Authority for the funding of services for the carriage of passengers by rail, specifically those which,</p>
<ul><a name="08111872000323"></a>&#147;start and end in Scotland and are provided under a franchise agreement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000278"></a>Of course, that has now been modified to allow Scottish Ministers to take over from the Strategic Rail Authority. It is only when we come to the next measure, Statutory Instrument 2002/1629, to which I drew your Lordships&#146; attention on Report, that the legislation deals with anything to do with the powers for,</p>
<ul><a name="08111872000324"></a>&#147;the promotion and construction of railways ... in Scotland&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000279"></a>which is of course the area where a national policy statement would have any effect. When we debated that, the Minister made it clear that cross-border railways would continue to be dealt with at Westminster. Two further statutory instruments that I have seen allow the Scottish Parliament itself to exercise the functions previously confined to the passenger transport authority.</p>

<a name="81118-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08111872000097"></a>I recognise that devolution has been an ongoing process, and the Government may wish to make further adjustments. The measures taken so far have made good sense and enabled useful improvements to be made to the running of railways in Scotland. As the Bill stands, the Infrastructure Planning Commission has a role in Scotland, as do national policy statements. My amendments are to ensure that it can consider cross-border railways. The point at which its powers might stray into the territory of the Scottish Executive would be if a policy were proposed that tried to lay down some specific structure or route for a national infrastructure project once it got into Scotland. At that point some kind of devolved consent would certainly be needed, and the commission will need to keep that at the forefront of its mind.</p>

<a name="81118-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08111872000098"></a>Taking things forward from this, I ask the Minister to confirm that only the promotion of railways in Scotland and the funding of passenger services that start and end in Scotland are a directly devolved responsibility. Noble Lords will probably be aware that cross-border passenger trains that run to Edinburgh and Glasgow are the responsibility of the Department for Transport, and certainly will be of concern in considering national policy.</p>

<a name="81118-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08111872000099"></a>Throughout all this legislation, there is no specific mention of the regulation of goods transport by rail, another area where a national policy statement would have an important bearing. Does the same degree of devolution that is stated as applying to passenger rail transport apply to goods?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08111872000100"></a>A rather curious adjunct to this occurs in Section 8(2) of the Railways Act 2005 which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08111872000301"></a>&#147;The Scottish Ministers shall also have power, whether they do so wholly or primarily for Scottish purposes, to provide ... financial assistance to persons otherwise than under franchise agreements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000280"></a>This suggests that the Government can see a scene where the Scottish Government would take the initiative and pay for construction of a cross-border railway if it was felt to be in Scottish interests and there would be no need for an initiative from Westminster. Is that likely to be part of government policy?</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08111872000101"></a>As the Minister will also be aware, at an adjournment debate last week in another place some of the problems that arise from our current position were aired. The main one related to the station at Lockerbie, which is run by the Scottish Transport Authority. No trains call at that station other than the cross-border trains. The maintenance of the station, therefore, is of no interest to anyone other than the people running the trains. The same thing happened at Dunbar but I believe that the Scottish Transport Authority now runs a train to Dunbar to help to overcome this problem. The people in Lockerbie were very exercised as there was no co-ordination on the timetables between any train they could catch going north that would link them up with trains that would run to either Glasgow or Edinburgh and get them into their work before nine o&#146;clock. This was discussed at length. It shows that the national infrastructure plan should encompass the whole range of cross-border traffic. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08111872000103"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, has moved an interesting amendment in relation to cross-border railways. He is right to say that the responsibility for cross-border railways lies with the United Kingdom Government but I believe that the consenting process would be a matter for the Scottish Parliament. The noble Duke may be interested to know that the commission has received submissions in relation to nuclear power, which is a reserved matter but where the consenting and planning process would be a matter for Scottish Ministers. The commission is considering these representations. If the noble Duke wishes to make representations to the commission in relation to cross-border railways, we will be pleased to look at them.</p>

We need to make a distinction between two separate issues here. The first is the issue of services. As my noble and learned friend has just said, where those services are cross-border, my department through the franchising arrangement takes the lead role. The issue at stake in the Planning Bill is not services but infrastructure. The Infrastructure Planning Commission will not have vires in respect of the  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1018"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1018</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Scottish part of rail infrastructure proposals which cross the border. That does not mean, however, that the United Kingdom Parliament could not play a role in consenting to such schemes. It would be open to the promoters to seek authorisation by means of a private or possibly hybrid Bill presented to the Westminster Parliament, which would be likely to require a Sewel motion. In seeking consent for such a rail infrastructure scheme across the border, that would be one of two possible ways forward. The other would be for the IPC to consider the English part and for Scottish Ministers to consider the Scottish part.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08111872000105"></a>Discussion on which of those options would be best would take place at the appropriate time, taking full account of the circumstances of the case. I am certainly not closing the door to the possibility of the United Kingdom Parliament deciding the planning issues relating to those infrastructure projects, but that would be by means of a private or hybrid Bill, requiring a Sewel motion; it would not be done through the IPC which, under the Bill, would not have powers in respect of the rail infrastructure required for cross-border projects. The issue of services is distinctly different. It relates to the contracting process with train operating companies for services which, as the noble Duke said, run from Glasgow, Edinburgh and other Scottish cities to south of the border.</p>

One knows perfectly well that planning is a devolved matter and, as I understand it, would require consideration of specific areas, items, routes or anything else within Scotland. Is it the Minister&#146;s contention that national infrastructure is not a reserved matter and that, therefore, it is a proper matter for the Scottish Administration to consider? If so, does that relate only to national infrastructure as regards Scotland? The clauses at the beginning of the Bill apply to Scotland, so I would have thought that the Scots should be able to consider cross-border railways.</p>

We support government Amendment No. 9, which takes away the deadline for the deadline&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;for the provision of the local impact report, which will not now be required to be the deadline for completion of the examination. We support the thinking on this, which is to allow the applicant and other parties to ask questions about the local impact report and test it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08111872000113"></a>However, it seems to me that there is a danger in leaving the matter open.

I hope that the Minister can give me some assurances on that. Clearly, the commissioner needs to set a realistic timescale proportionate to the size of the task of the local authority. Ideally, there should be agreement between the parties&#151;I use that term in its widest sense&#151;on what is a reasonable time for the preparation of reports. I hope that the noble Baroness can assure me that common sense will apply and that the parties will all act as civilised adults in addressing the issue. I beg to move.</p>

I will put on record some of the reasoning behind it and then address the amendment itself. I hope that I can reassure her. It may be useful if I set out why the Bill provides for the commission to invite the relevant local authority, or authorities, to produce a local impact report.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08111872000116"></a>We are absolutely clear that local authorities, as the democratically elected representatives of the local community, have a vital role to play in the consent regime for major infrastructure, particularly in ensuring that national decision-makers, including the proposed IPC, take proper account of relevant local factors and considerations. Therefore, the Bill provides local authorities with a vital role in representing their communities in the new process and in ensuring that their local communities are adequately consulted. I say to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that we will certainly put out guidance and take early action with local authorities to ensure that they understand the process. This is an important question, because so much will rest on their understanding of what this offers their planning procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08111872000117"></a>Relevant local authorities will be consulted by the promoter of a project before they submit an application under the provisions of Part 5 of the Bill. The IPC must have regard to any report on the adequacy of the promoter&#146;s consultation received from a local authority  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1020"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1020</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when deciding whether to accept an application. Relevant local authorities will be interested parties to the examination of an application. In addition, Clause 60 requires the IPC, on accepting an application for development consent, to invite the relevant local authority, or authorities, to produce a report on the likely impact on their area of the proposed development being applied for. Clause 104 then requires the commission to have regard to the local impact report when making its decision. Clause 105 requires the Secretary of State to do the same in a case in which she decides, for example, to exercise her power of intervention. This all adds up to the local impact reports being central to the IPC decision. As such, we have sought to give local authorities the longest time to prepare the reports, which will, I envisage, be quite detailed documents. They will reflect the impact of a development on the local development plans; they will reflect what the community feels and thinks.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08111872000118"></a>However, the importance that the new process gives to local impact reports needs to be balanced against the need to ensure that the applicant and other interested parties are also given a reasonable opportunity to comment on the report to the IPC. We are looking for a balance of fairness and access. On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, raised the concern that the Bill does not appear to provide for a local authority&#146;s local impact report to be seen and commented on by the applicant and any other interested party before the end of the examination of the application by the IPC. My noble friend&#146;s concerns arose from the provision in Clause 60(6), which provides that the deadline for submission of the local impact report is the same as the deadline for the completion of the examination of the application by the IPC. My noble friend made a compelling case and I gave an assurance that I would consider this further ahead of Third Reading, which I have done.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08111872000119"></a>I accept that provisions in Clause 60(6) may inadvertently suggest that the applicant and other interested parties might not have an opportunity to comment on a local impact report. This was not our intention. Our Amendment No. 9 therefore removes subsection (6) of Clause 60 so that instead it will be for the commission to specify in each case the date by which the local impact report must be received. That will be subject to procedural rules made by the Lord Chancellor under Clause 97, which we expect will clarify that the deadline must give sufficient time for the parties to comment on the local impact report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08111872000120"></a>What we have are rules that will strike the right balance between giving local authorities the longest time possible to complete these detailed and important reports and ensuring that the applicant and interested parties are given a reasonable opportunity to see and comment on the report to the IPC before the completion of the examination of the application.

I am happy to give her that reassurance because, above all, we will make sure that the procedural rules make it clear that the IPC should give local authorities the longest time possible to complete these reports and ensure that the applicant and the interested parties can see and comment on the report to the IPC. That will be achieved by procedural rules, which is the best way, because it allows for discussion. I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied with that.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08111872000129"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we now turn to a small group of amendments to Clauses 104 and 105, which provide how decisions on applications are to be taken by the decision-maker. Government Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 clarify that NPSs that identify a location as suitable or potentially suitable for development do not pre-empt the IPC decision to grant development consent. Amendment No. 12, which was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would clarify that the fact that any relevant national policy statement identified a location as suitable or potentially suitable for a particular description of development would not prevent Clause 105(2) from applying where the Secretary of State was the decision-maker.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08111872000130"></a>As context for these amendments, it is worth restating that the Bill provides a clear framework for decision-making, which, as noble Lords know, consists of the relevant national policy statement and the matters set out in Clauses 104 and 105, including matters to be prescribed in the statutory instrument or instruments that we will lay before Parliament in due course following consultation. Within this framework, the national interest, as developed in the national policy statement, will be the prime consideration for decisions. NPSs will set  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1022"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1022</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out our national policy on, and the national need for, infrastructure, but only after they have been consulted on and have been scrutinised by Parliament. As we know, national policy statements will vary in specificity depending on the sector to which they apply. In some cases, the relevant Secretary of State may decide that it makes sense to specify the location where it is considered that it would be appropriate for investment to take place. We have already stated that the NPSs for aviation and nuclear will be location-specific. That will help us to focus the task of the IPC.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08111872000131"></a>It is important that I set out clearly at this point that NPSs will indicate, as appropriate to the particular infrastructure with which they are concerned, places that are suitable or potentially suitable locations for development. We discussed at earlier stages the difference between site and location. NPSs will not identify specific sites. The developer will bring forward the site application and it will be for the IPC to determine whether it is appropriate. It will be left to the IPC to consider the detail of specific sites, layout, access and, of course, local impacts.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08111872000132"></a>It is clear from Clause 104 that the NPS will not be the only factor on which the commission&#146;s decision is based, because it provides, as we debated on the previous amendment, that the IPC must also have regard to the local impact report from the local authority, other matters that may be set out in secondary legislation and any other matters that the commission thinks are important and relevant. We have made it clear that the commission will be able to take account of a range of other factors in its decision. The Bill requires the commission to take into account any matters that it believes are important and relevant. Where appropriate, it will be able to refuse consent for a development, notwithstanding the fact that the application accords with the relevant NPS.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08111872000133"></a>Subsections (4) to (6) of Clause 104 provide that the IPC can, in reaching a decision, depart from the national policy statement where not do so would lead the UK to being in breach of its international obligations, would lead the commission to being in breach of any enactment or would be unlawful by virtue of any enactment. That will ensure, for example, that protection of sites under enactments such as the habitats directive is respected in the commission&#146;s final decision.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08111872000134"></a>Clause 104(7) allows the panel or the council to turn down an application that is in accordance with a national policy statement if it is satisfied that the adverse impact of the proposed development would outweigh its benefit. The IPC would still consider issues specific to the application at the local stage&#151;detailed layout and so on&#151;as well as environmental impact. If it decides that the adverse impact of a development would outweigh its benefit, it can refuse consent.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08111872000135"></a>I have gone through that process for the last time because I wanted to show that the Bill clearly provides that the IPC can reject an application even where it accords with the relevant NPS in the circumstances outlined in subsections (4) to (8) of Clause 104. I make it clear that the provisions of Clause 104 apply to all decisions taken by the commission, whether or not the relevant NPS has identified suitable or potentially suitable locations for development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08111872000136"></a>On Report, noble Lords, notably the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, sought an assurance that we would reconsider the wording of the Bill to make it clear that the IPC must consider the issues raised as a result of subsections (4) to (8) of Clause 104 in cases where the relevant NPS identifies locations that are suitable or potentially suitable for development. I accept that it is important to be quite clear about that. I assured the noble Baroness on Report that I would consider the point further ahead of Third Reading to see whether clarification in the Bill to that effect would be helpful.</p>

<a name="81118-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08111872000137"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 make clear in the Bill that to identify a location as either suitable or potentially suitable for development in an NPS will not pre-empt the IPC&#146;s examination of the issues referred to in subsections (4) to (8) of Clause 104. The amendments will clarify that in all cases the IPC must have regard to the other factors provided for in subsections (4) to (8) of Clause 104 and that, if any of the circumstances outlined in those subsections apply, it can reject an application even if it is in accordance with the NPS. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Baroness. I am grateful for her help in enabling us to clarify that point. I beg to move.</p>

Throughout the passage of this Bill, the Minister has devoted time and a considerable degree of care to listening to noble Lords and responding to their concerns wherever possible. As ever, the wording which the Government have produced is considerably better than mine and I thank the Minister for the two amendments. In introducing them, she said quite rightly that there have been occasions when the term &#147;site&#148; has been used. In fact the Bill deals only with &#147;locations&#148;. We have all been guilty of referring to &#147;sites&#148;. There was even an occasion at the last stage when the Minister talked about &#147;potentially suitable sites&#148;. I am glad that that has been corrected and we have slightly broadened the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08111872000139"></a>Amendment No. 12 reflected my concern that the Secretary of State should be in the same position as the commission in cases where the Secretary of State takes a decision on matters to which he or she must have regard. I appreciate that it will be rare for there to be a national policy statement in place when there is a Secretary-of-State decision, but it is possible and the Bill allows for that. The Government&#146;s drafting clearly includes confirmation&#151;and I use that word rather loosely&#151;of the status of the NPS vis- -vis other considerations. Having had it explained to me that it is in a different part of Clause 104 from those to which the panel and council must have regard, and that those parts of Clause 104 are not repeated in Clause 105, I can see that my concern is misplaced; that concern being that a court looking at the two clauses might say that Parliament had a different view as to how Clause 105 would operate and national policy statements would have a different status in that clause. Third Readings are useful occasions. I can see now that that should not apply. I am grateful for the time of the House and for the opportunity to explain my concern, as well as to thank the Minister and make sure that it is understood how the two clauses operate.</p>

Is the Minister willing to elaborate a little on what she considers the clause as amended to mean for the duties of the panel and council and the Secretary of State as they arrive at their decisions in relation to respect for the landscape?</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08111872000141"></a>I am happy to see my noble friend Lord Hunt in his place and most grateful to him for his willingness to meet the noble Lord, Lord Reay, and me and for the letter that he has written to us. He said on Report that national policy statements will take account of all relevant government policy, including PPS7, and I appreciate that PPS7 confirms that great weight should be given to the designations of national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty in planning policies and development control decisions. Can the Minister confirm that PPS7 will be among matters prescribed in subsection (2)(c) of Clause 104 or other matters which the panel and the council may consider important or relevant, as in subsection (2)(d)?</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08111872000142"></a>The major development test set out in paragraph 22 of PPS7 says that major developments should not take place in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty except in exceptional circumstances. Will my noble friend tell us a little more about how strong that protection is, and how strong the protection in PPS22 and its companion guide is? Some of us fear that it will be argued, for example, that the need to provide more renewable energy in coming years constitutes an exceptional circumstance, and that adverse effects on the quality of the landscape will be considered to be outweighed by other environmental, social and economic benefits, thus justifying the festooning of our most beautiful and treasured landscapes with wind-power apparatus. Can my noble friend reassure us to any extent on that point, and can she assure us that the forthcoming national policy statement on renewable energy will robustly protect important landscapes?</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08111872000143"></a>I appreciate that local authorities are instructed in PPS7 to take account of landscape quality in preparing local development documents, and that local authorities will be statutory consultees where national policy statements are location-specific, as well as for pre-application and examination processes in the development consent regime, and that they will have the opportunity to provide local impact reports to the IPC. Clause 104 refers to all this. My noble friend said in the debate on a previous amendment that local impact statements will be key.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08111872000144"></a>Clause 104(4) applies,</p>
<ul><a name="08111872000325"></a>&#147;if the Panel or Council is satisfied that deciding the application in accordance with any relevant national policy statement would lead to the United Kingdom being in breach of any of its international obligations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000281"></a>Will my noble friend tell us whether the Government will regard the European Landscape Convention as being among those international obligations, and will she confirm that PPS1 reflects that convention and will be interpreted in that sense? Will she also confirm that the Government will pay very careful heed to the advice of Natural England, as a statutory consultee  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1025"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1025</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for all national policy statements? Such reassurances would be helpful, but they would remain somewhat flimsy.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08111872000145"></a>So, finally, I ask my noble friend for two specific assurances. Will she assure the House&#151;in terms that can be noted by the courts, which will interpret this law in due course&#151;that, as an important environmental consideration, the conservation of the landscape falls within the scope of the Secretary of State&#146;s duty to contribute to sustainable development in Clause 10? When, before designating a national policy statement, Ministers carry out an appraisal of its impact on sustainability, will they assess and take account of its impact on the landscape? The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, gave the noble Lord, Lord Reay, and me such assurances in his letter, but it would be hugely helpful if my noble friend could place those assurances on the record in <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08111872000147"></a>I will answer quite a lot of the questions asked by my noble friend Lord Howarth by referring to the letter which my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath sent to the noble Lord, Lord Reay, but I will have to write him about others because they were even more detailed than some of the answers that he received. I will do my best not to weary the House by referring to the letter, which answers most of these questions.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08111872000148"></a>National parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty have the highest status of protection for their landscape and scenic beauty, and great weight indeed should be given to them in planning policies and development control decisions. Of most relevance to this in the context of the Bill is the major development test. This is set out in paragraph 22 of PPS7, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08111872000306"></a>&#147;Major developments should not take place in these designated areas, except in exceptional circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000282"></a>As my noble friend Lord Hunt said on Report, national policy statements will take account of all relevant government policy, which will include PPS7 where it is relevant to that NPS.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08111872000149"></a>PPS7 recognises non-designated areas of landscape outside nationally designated areas that are particularly highly valued locally. It sets out that local authorities should draft criteria-based policies in local development documents, utilising tools such as landscape character assessment. The noble Lord asked how strong those planning provisions are: they are very strong indeed.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08111872000150"></a>Specific policies on planning for renewable energy, including on landscape protection, are set out in PPS22, which is supported by a companion guide to provide practice guidance on assessing the visual and landscape effects of planning applications for wind turbines. PPS22 recognises that the landscape and visual effects of particular renewable energy developments will vary on a case-by-case basis according to the type of development, its location and the landscape setting of the proposed development.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08111872000151"></a>PPS22 advises that in sites with nationally recognised designations, such as sites of special scientific interest, national parks and AONBs, planning permission for  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1026"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1026</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>renewable energy projects should be granted only where it can be demonstrated that the objectives of designation of the area will not be compromised by the development and any significant adverse effects on the qualities for which the area has been designated are clearly outweighed by the environmental, social and economic benefits. Small-scale developments should be permitted within these areas provided that there is no significant environmental detriment to the area concerned. We intend that there will be an NPS for renewable energy, which will be drawn up and consulted on in due course.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08111872000152"></a>The noble Lord asked me about the European Landscape Convention, which has been mentioned several times during the passage of this Bill. As my noble friend said on Report, the Government believe that the UK is already fulfilling the requirements of the convention; therefore, it does not have any immediate implications for the planning system in England. National planning policies, including PPS1: Delivering Sustainable Development, recognise the need to provide appropriate protection and enhancement of rural and urban landscapes in England, in line with the principal aims of the convention.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08111872000153"></a>The noble Lord mentioned Natural England. Defra has asked Natural England to take the lead on the implementation of the ELC in England, working closely with English Heritage and others. I should like to underline that Natural England will be a statutory consultee for all NPSs and will be able to raise those issues that it feels are appropriate, including any arising from the ELC.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08111872000154"></a>The Bill also requires that, before designating a national policy statement, Ministers must carry out an appraisal of their sustainability. That will assess the impact of the NPS on the landscape and other environmental issues, and ensure that they are taken into account. As with Clause 10, it will capture not just environmental but also economic and social impacts, which will ensure that we understand the impact of NPSs holistically as we seek to deliver our sustainable development objectives.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08111872000155"></a>The Government agree that high quality landscape is important and should be protected. They have put policies in place to that effect, and NPSs will take account of all relevant government policy. Local authorities will be able to report to the IPC on the impact of specific proposals. The noble Lord asked about regulations under Clause 104(2)(c) in relation to PPS7. I will write to him on that, but I can tell him that a number of provisions on protecting landscape will be incorporated into NPSs. With that reply and with the promise of reading <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow and picking up on any detailed questions that I did not address, I hope that the noble Lord will be content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08111872000163"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to government Amendment No. 30. These amendments result from the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on common land. We had short debates in Committee and on Report, and I hope that our amendment answers the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and others.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08111872000164"></a>As I mentioned on Report, we share certain core principles about how land registered as a common should continue to benefit from the protections of the Commons Act 2006, and this has two aspects. First, we continue to believe that a promoter should not be able to conduct development works on common land without consent. Secondly, where development of a nationally significant infrastructure project does take place on a common, that land should be deregistered as a common and replacement common land should generally be provided. Our amendments ensure that these points are covered.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08111872000165"></a>Subsection (2) of the new clause confirms that consent will still be needed under Section 38 of the Commons Act where development consent orders grant authority for works on common land, except where the order authorises compulsory purchase under Clauses 131 and 132 of this Bill. If a promoter already owns the common land in question and does not wish to seek consent under Section 38 of the Commons Act, he will have to apply for deregistration of the land as common land under Sections 14 and 16 of the Commons Act, in which case the requirement to provide replacement land will still usually apply. Subsections (1) and (3) confirm that no development consent order could override these principles unless that order authorises

The reason for this exception is that the procedure set out in these two clauses will generally require the replacement of the common land. In the case of compulsory acquisition, the development consent order will trigger deregistration automatically because it would be considered a relevant instrument for the purposes of Section 14(3)(c) of the Commons Act. Government Amendment No. 30 is a consequential amendment to the extent clause so that the extent of the new clause on commons covers England and Wales only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08111872000166"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured that the points he raised in earlier debates are good ones, and that I always enjoy agreeing with him. It is right to ensure that no loophole exists in the Bill to allow promoters to skirt around the protections in place for the precious notion of common land. I beg to move.</p>

I first raised this issue in Committee and moved amendments on Report in the hope that a satisfactory compromise could be reached. I have to say that a satisfactory compromise has not been reached because as far as I can see, the amendments now being proposed by the Minister do everything I had hoped and intended my amendments to do.

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08111872000170"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I suspect that this amendment will give the House even greater pleasure than did the amendment regarding common land, which is hard to believe. It concerns design in the town and country planning system. It inserts into Section 39 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 a requirement that those exercising development plan functions in England, whether regional or local, must have regard to the desirability of achieving good design when pursuing the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development; similarly it applies to those exercising development plan functions in Wales in regard to the Wales spatial plan or local development plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08111872000171"></a>Noble Lords who have sat through our debates on the Bill, from its optimistic beginnings, through the heavy pounding of Committee, as the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, described it, to the calmer waters of Report, will know that design has come up continually. I thank noble Lords for the nature of the debate we  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1029"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1029</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have had; it has been an important debate, and we have listened. There is no dispute that ensuring good quality design is an important component of sustainable development. We have already introduced a duty for the Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of achieving good design in seeking to achieve sustainable development when exercising functions in relation to national policy statements for nationally significant infrastructure, and new Clause 14 does the same with respect to development plan functions.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08111872000172"></a>We have made clear how design contributes to sustainable development in Planning Policy Statement 1, an important and generous statement, and other policy statements, from the broad juxtaposition of buildings and facilities to orientation on site and contribution to streetscape. The provision will also complement and reinforce the new climate change duties we have introduced in respect of development plans. Good design can help reduce carbon emissions and encourage more sustainable behaviour such as walking or cycling. Noble Lords will know that local planning authorities already have to take account of our existing national design policies in development plans and make clear local policies where they add to national policy guidance.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08111872000173"></a>What pleases me about the amendment is that the measure we are introducing will raise the profile of what planning authorities should be doing. Development plans play a key role in guiding users of the planning system. We are therefore keen to see these documents completed as soon as possible&#151;I am glad to say that we are making good progress&#151;and we would not want to see the new design duty delaying the process. However, we will want to consult and discuss with local planning authorities how to give effect now to the design duty in the context of plan-making. I indicated on Report that our chief planner would be writing to all local planning authorities shortly to encourage them to take further positive action to achieve good design, and we will be considering what further support can be given to them and others in delivering good design&#151;for example, through design panels, the HCA and other partnerships.</p>

<a name="81118-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08111872000174"></a>I have indicated to the House that we are committed to achieving good design and to supporting local planning authorities and others through strong partnership programmes. I believe that the new clause represents a proper and proportionate response to the excellent and thorough debates that we have had at all stages in the Lords thus far, and I hope noble Lords agree. I pay particular tribute to my two noble friends Lady Whitaker and Lord Howarth for their relentless capacity for not giving up. Credit is due to them and to all who supported the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08111872000175"></a>Amendment No. 31, regarding Clause 24, is consequential to Amendment No. 14 and relates to the commencement of that provision.

Looking at <I>Hansard</I>, on Report, she was uncharacteristically truculent on design, even suggesting that it was quite impossible to put something in the Bill because there was no time to consult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08111872000180"></a>I pay tribute to the Minister for the speed with which she and her team in the department have managed to come up with something in the Bill that meets many of our concerns. As a relative newcomer to your Lordships&#146; House&#151;I have been here only three and half years; until you have been here 33 years you are not regarded as a native&#151;I have seen how the Minister and her team have responded with meticulous efficiency to issues in the House, and by correspondence with many of us involved in the passage of the Bill. That is in sharp contrast to my experience on the Front Bench in the other place over 14 years, when Ministers did not think it necessary to explain and persuade. That is to the credit of this House, and to the Minister and her team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08111872000181"></a>The elegant U-turn that the Minister has undertaken over the past few days is to her personal credit and that of her team in the department. The result is a great step forward. I say to her and to other Members of your Lordships&#146; House who have made this such an important part of our discussions on planning that it is a pity that we did not have this requirement clearly in previous legislation&#151;notably the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, to which it has now been added. It is a great step forward, and I am sure that it will be recognised as such outwith this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08111872000183"></a>The new clause and this legislation will be timely. The Government are extremely anxious to accelerate construction activity, and house-building in particular, for good reason. We understand that there are 1.7 million households on the waiting-list for social housing. It is widely agreed that a stimulus is needed for the economy under the present conditions. However, there is a danger that, in our haste to accelerate construction, quality is sacrificed. We must not repeat the disastrous mistakes that were made decade after decade in the second half of the 20th century. With a great deal of public-sector activism and expenditure, and a depressed private sector and&#151;I hope not, but perhaps&#151;a depressed social housing sector operating in circumstances of great difficulty, there is a danger that we will revert to the policy of creating estates, with all that word&#146;s bad connotations, instead of continuing to create integrated communities. That is an aspect of design.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="081118108000010"></a>There is a continuum between economic policy, social policy, planning policy, functionality, sustainability, building regulations, green spaces, design and aesthetics. All are interdependent. My noble friend has been right to reject the view that it would have been inappropriate to state the requirement for design alongside the requirement for sustainable development in this legislation. Good planning, plus good design, plus good building tend to make for good communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08111872000185"></a>Where questions of style are concerned it does not matter whether a development is modern or traditional. I personally do not think that is any business of government, but it is government&#146;s business to help everybody involved in design and construction in this country to raise their game. How is that to be done? It is not easy. We have a plethora of planning policy statements and DCLG and CABE manuals of design. There is a mass of local policies in every planning authority on shop fronts, fenestration materials and so forth. So why, then, is good design not widely prevalent? Part of the answer is that knowledge and judgment are hard won. We need to do better on education and training. While the Government should always respect professional and academic autonomy, I hope that they will lend all their weight and drive to improving education and training in this field.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08111872000186"></a>However, I think that the main problem arises from pressures imposed on planning committees, for example, by house-building targets, the need to create new infrastructure fast, local campaigns to stop things being done and from developers who want to cut costs and improve their profit margins. Planning officers and members of planning committees often lack the time to go into the necessary detail. They sometimes lack the interest and the knowledge, too, but they mainly lack the time. The agenda for a fortnightly planning committee meeting can easily run to 100 pages and more, so that the advice from the Government, CABE and the local community is paraphrased by planning officers for the working papers of the committee and too much is lost in translation. The detail in such

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08111872000187"></a>If we do not want identikit new developments spread all across the country, we must also foster the vernacular. However, by definition the vernacular is diverse and needs to be interpreted locally by local people who are knowledgeable about it. That means that we need to think about how to use the resources that local advisory committees can offer to local planners. That is one of the reasons I am such a strong believer in design review. One interesting model for advice lies in conservation area advisory committees.</p>

That is a wasted opportunity. We should better use these advisory bodies, design review and other advisory bodies of this kind. However, this amendment to the town and country planning regime, together with the amendments which my noble friend previously brought forward, strengthens our drive for good design and strengthens the duty to have regard to design on the HCA and in the development consent regime.

I apologise to the noble Baroness for this, but we now have in the Bill, as a result of an amendment that we slipped in at the end of Report stage, when we were all suffering from exhaustion and perhaps not thinking as clearly as we might have been, a provision under Clause 208(2) that CIL regulations may provide for,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08111872000196"></a>There is a difference in principle between the noble Baroness and myself. She has argued consistently that infrastructure generates employment and employment generates infrastructure liabilities. It is a chicken-and-egg argument and I put it the other way round: it is the fact that people in communities require services that generates the need for infrastructure. In her missive last night, the Minister gave two examples, one of a power station and the other of an airport extension. I acknowledge that both have clear infrastructure implications. However, the chicken-and-egg argument applies. Are those developments the cause of the population, or the result of the population? I argue that, if they are the result of the population, the payment of CIL is not appropriate. That said, I acknowledge that, in life, we all spend a great deal of money paying tax that goes to do things that help us: the money goes round, and this is another part of the roundabout.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08111872000197"></a>The question on which I would like clarification concerns projects of that nature that are subject also to Section 106 agreements, which at the moment are the only way of getting infrastructure projects into a development. Developers, and indeed local authorities undertaking negotiations prior to granting planning permission, both have in mind a sum of money.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08111872000198"></a>With the introduction of the infrastructure levy, we are pre-empting a part of that negotiation&#151;we have to realise that&#151;and to the extent that that is so, the flexibility of those negotiations will be diminished. It really was to try and determine, or get some increase clarity on, what that relationship is that I felt moved one last time to table an amendment to see whether I could persuade the Minister to explain exactly how they will work together.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08111872000199"></a>My feeling is clear; these clauses were designed in a different age, and now it seems to me that their purpose, for a few years at any rate, is seriously redundant. I

All that will do is transfer the responsibility for deciding whether to introduce the infrastructure levy from the Government to the local authorities. It would be better if the whole thing were in abeyance until the country&#146;s construction industry is sufficiently robust and active again, when we could begin to consider the charges in a sensible light. Even Section 106, to which it is entirely accustomed, is going to be very difficult to negotiate at present on any major development. I beg to move.</p>

It gives me the only opportunity to ask the Minister a couple of questions about CIL. I am certainly not happy with the way that the Bill is at the moment, or with the way CIL is. We have no regulations, which we were promised in another place, we have no information on which we would have been able to discuss the matter and at each stage there have been a substantial number of government amendments. This is an ill-conceived policy.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08111872000201"></a>The Minister said on Report that CIL is very much a general charge. If a local authority is looking at funding infrastructure, it has to work out what percentage can come from other areas and what percentage can come from CIL. Given what the Minister said on Report, how is she going to prevent a local authority transferring CIL into other pockets of money? If a local authority is looking at CIL as a general charge rather than as a specific charge for a development, it will be wide open for it to transfer CIL money into other areas of the local authority. Can she explain how that will be prevented and how local authorities will stop that?</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08111872000202"></a>I have one other question. As the Government have refused to remove the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act from the statute book, confidence in the Government among the construction community and surveyors is at rock bottom. They do not trust the Government on this. If the Government spend any money under the PGS Act, can the noble Baroness give a categoric assurance that a Minister will make a Statement in both Houses that money is going to be so spent? There is great fear, despite what she said on Report, that her department sees CIL as a short-term measure and really it wants to go back to the planning gain supplement. Will the noble Baroness confirm that a Statement will be made in both Houses before any money is spent?</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, raises a reasonable point. It would be helpful if the Minister could remind the House where in the impact assessment documents there is an estimate of the amount to be raised from CIL in the first five years and whether that takes account of the inevitable effect that it will replace Section 106 money. In almost all cases, I find it difficult to conceive of a situation where a developer will continue to pay Section 106 money as well as CIL.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08111872000204"></a>In the impact assessment for the Planning Bill, there are no figures in relation to CIL. It might well be that I have been negligent in not reading every document that one could have read in preparation for this Bill, but I cannot remember them. However, it would be a great pity if, for all this effort, the result was a bit of a damp squib and that, on balance, the amount raised from CIL was modest. Certainly the outlook for the next few years in the development business is that it will be a tough time.</p>

The timing is immaculate. However, to allow him to get to his place, perhaps I may say that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, took up the question of what is meant by the phrase &#147;roads and other&#148; in the line,</p>
<ul><a name="08111872000328"></a>&#147;roads and other transport facilities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000285"></a>in the definition of &#147;infrastructure&#148;&#151;not so much what is meant by it but why it is necessary. I felt at the time that the noble Lord had a good point, but it was late at night and we were all finding it a bit difficult to articulate things. I believe it was suggested that it would be answered in writing. I do not think that I have seen a response to that. I may have missed it, in which case I apologise, but I have no doubt that the Minister has an answer now and it would be a shame if she did not have an opportunity to give it.</p>

I intervene at this late stage in this Bill with some trepidation, partly because I spent 26 years as an elected member of local and regional government trying to avoid ever having anything to do with planning decisions, but more particularly, because I have not previously successfully intervened in these debates. Having twice put down amendments at Committee and on Report, I thought it was inappropriate, having not been available to move them on those occasions, to put them down at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08111872000207"></a>However, Amendment No. 26, which we are considering in this group, gives me the opportunity to make a point. I am grateful to the Minister for arranging for me to meet officials on the question of why there is actually quite a long list of items of infrastructure in Clause 215, yet policing and emergency services are missed out. If I understand the argument that was put to me, I was told that the list was not intended to be exhaustive, but merely to set the boundaries of the sorts of things that might be included in the term &#147;infrastructure&#148;. If things such as emergency services, policing and fire services and so on were included that might turn it into an exhaustive list, which it is not.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08111872000208"></a>I am concerned that we will end up with a dog&#146;s breakfast in Clause 215. We will have a list of items which will include some things and not others. It will include so many things that it might no longer be said to be just giving a few vague examples of things that  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1036"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1036</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might be deemed to be infrastructure for these purposes. It will end up providing a list. There is already evidence that local authorities are looking at it and saying that its implication is that those items included specifically in Clause 215 are what is really meant by infrastructure and those should be the priority in any community infrastructure levy.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08111872000209"></a>I hope that, in responding to Amendment No. 26 and the group, my noble friend will therefore make it clear that the list is not exhaustive and that she will give us a few more examples of what might be included, for the benefit of local authorities. Obviously, railways and airports&#151;they have been discussed at previous stages of the Bill&#151;could be included, but it should also be clear that the list includes policing and emergency services. I hope that she will be able to say that, because it is without question that many large developments require additional investments in policing and emergency services. The evidence is that large developments often bring with them increases in crime, and that there are issues about police response times and how you make sure that the development combats crime and disorder.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08111872000210"></a>Interestingly, the recent PPS12 advised that the core strategy within a local planning authority area should be prescriptive in terms of certain infrastructure requirements. It then listed a number of areas that should be identified as part of that process, including everything listed in Clause 215(2) and&#151;it was the only &#147;and&#148;&#151;the police. For some reason, when the list turns up in Clause 215(2), policing and emergency services are missed out. I hope that my noble friend will understand why there is concern about that strange list and that, in her response, she will clarify once and for all not only that the list is not exhaustive but that policing and emergency services&#151;and, of course, railways&#151;should be included.</p>

The points were made perfectly adequately both by my noble friend and from the Minister&#146;s side of the House. Simply, the list should not be focused on one thing; it should include all the infrastructure requirements of a local authority.</p>

I applaud his tenacity in bringing forward his concerns. He and I disagree about the issue&#151;as he described it, the chicken and egg. I will address the amendment before I come on to questions raised by other noble Lords.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08111872000213"></a>It should be noted that the amendment presents two clear and perverse opportunities to avoid paying CIL, which I am sure is not something that the noble Lord wants. First, there are no specified limits on the minimal amount of infrastructure that a building must house if it is not to become liable for CIL. That is because &#147;infrastructure&#148; in the amendment is not tied to the CIL definition of &#147;infrastructure&#148; in Clause 215. In the context of the amendment, &#147;infrastructure&#148; could have its ordinary meaning and  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1037"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1037</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cover things such as pipes. Therefore, it could exclude large numbers of new buildings on the grounds that they contain pipes, ducts or electric cables. Secondly, by providing that only new buildings housing infrastructure will be exempt from paying CIL, rather than allowing for changes to existing buildings housing infrastructure, the amendment risks distorting the behaviour of developers, who might seek to disguise changes to existing buildings as entirely new buildings housing infrastructure and thus not liable to pay.</p>

<a name="81118-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08111872000214"></a>We cannot support the amendment. However, I am aware that, in our conversations about the nature of infrastructure and its impact, the noble Lord made it clear that the amendment on Report was probing and directed at finding what was and was not included in the definition of development liable to pay CIL. On the basis of the question that he raised about the text of the Bill, I think that that is still his intent. To answer the question, I will have to expand the argument a little.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81118-0006.htm"/>


<a name="81118-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08111872000215"></a>Noble Lords are aware that the purpose of CIL is to raise funds to provide infrastructure to support the development of an area. CIL is intended to spread costs of providing such infrastructure more fairly. I remind noble Lords that only 14 per cent of developments contribute to Section 106. As noble Lords will recall, there is a principle of fairness behind the logic. Infrastructure generates impact and costs. I take the point about chicken and egg but I do believe there is an ethical argument that it should contribute to the costs of local and sub-regional infrastructure given these impacts. I give two examples: schools generate huge amounts of road traffic and hospitals generate huge amounts of clinical and other waste. These are demands that those infrastructures can place on other infrastructures. That is why we believe that infrastructure should contribute to those needs because otherwise other development will have to pay higher rates of CIL in the generalised assessment to cover those costs.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08111872000216"></a>We have limited the notion of infrastructure. We principally sought to delineate liability in relation to buildings, because buildings by their nature are places where people congregate or travel to and from and they represent the sort of developments that local authorities plan for when considering their infrastructure needs. I know that this is not an entirely straightforward concept&#151;there are powers in Clause 208(2)(a) to deal with difficult cases&#151;but the word &#147;buildings&#148; should be interpreted in its ordinary sense. If you look at the <I>Concise Oxford English Dictionary</I>, you see that &#147;building&#148; is,</p>
<ul><a name="08111872000329"></a>&#147;a permanent fixed structure forming an enclosure and providing protection from the elements etc (e.g. a house, school, factory, or stable)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000217"></a>Given the impact that such buildings have on local infrastructure, we are right to explore in regulations whether they might contribute to these infrastructure costs through paying CIL.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08111872000218"></a>We have always said that exemption from CIL is a matter for regulations. We have not ruled out that there could be an exemption from CIL for infrastructure in addition to what is not covered because it is not a building&#151;we have had some interesting exchanges on wind turbines, for example. However, we do not want  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1038"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1038</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to rule things out now on the face of the Bill before we have consulted on them. Any exemptions from CIL need to meet the criteria that we set out in paragraph 4.10 of the August document. I hope that the noble Lord will take some comfort from that.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08111872000219"></a>We have to think about things such as warehouses. These have a major impact on transport infrastructure, although in these cases the charging authority might decide to charge different rates of CIL for such developments because they have a different level of impact. On that basis, railway stations and harbour buildings would also be CIL-liable whereas structures such as railway lines and power lines would not. I appreciate that there is a power in Clause 208(2)(b) to cover other structures, but our intention in making regulations would be to cover those structures that are similar to buildings because they might place demands on infrastructure or benefit from it.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08111872000220"></a>As we indicated in our August document on CIL, we also intend that some development that might otherwise fall under Clause 208(1) will not be liable to pay CIL. Household developments by home owners are one such example. We also intend to exclude many developments for which planning permission is granted under the GPDO because such development is likely to have minimal impact on local infrastructure.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08111872000221"></a>These are complex issues. We have struggled with them at each stage of the Bill. We are pledged to continue to work closely with stakeholders on which development should be liable to pay CIL and which should not. We will certainly consult on the detail.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08111872000222"></a>The noble Lord asked about Section 106. We are very aware of the short-term problems in the housing market. The way in which CIL will be assessed will be driven by the development document, which will be a separate document alongside the development plan. It will take into account the various sources that can help to fund the needs that additional housing in particular will make on the local community. Section 106 and CIL will have to be assessed side by side along with the contribution that central government make. As we work through the transition and CIL comes on stream, Section 106 may be scaled back to cover fewer things. We want to discuss that with stakeholders. I know that the Benches opposite have urged caution on Section 106, so we will certainly consult on that.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08111872000223"></a>I turn to the question raised by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. On the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007, the Minister for Local Government in the other place gave such a commitment, so I hope that that will satisfy him. His second point was about how we will prevent CIL from leaking into the other coffers of local government. As I said, there will be a development plan document. CIL will be extremely specific and will go through a rigorous and transparent process, for the reasons that we have discussed as we have gone through the Bill. However, it will be ring-fenced in general terms and it must be applied to infrastructure. The Bill says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08111872000319"></a>&#147;CIL regulations must require the authority that charges CIL to apply it ... to funding infrastructure&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000286"></a>I hope that that will reassure the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08111872000224"></a>My noble friend raised a question about the police. Having been fully prepared at two previous stages of the Bill when he was not able to be in his place, I do not now have the speaking notes with me. I believe that he was asking for reassurances, which I can give him. We are certain that the list is indicative. We are also certain that police infrastructure can receive CIL funding. Guidance will be used to remove any doubt, if doubt remains. Of course, we will have the regulations, on which we shall be able to consult. I hope that that reassures him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08111872000225"></a>My other noble friend asked how much will be raised by CIL.

Where in the documents before the House is there an estimate of revenues to be raised&#151;that is, before the figures are revised&#151;and do those estimates take account of the certain reduction in Section 106 contributions that are made to local authorities? I appreciate that those contributions are made by a small proportion of developers, but they relate to the major developments and the figures will be substantial. It would be helpful to me, if not to the House as a whole, to have a feel for the amounts expected to be raised and the amount of offset from Section 106. Those are important matters, which I am sure were carefully considered before the proposal was brought forward.</p>

Paragraph 4 of that document states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08111872000320"></a>&#147;The Government is already investing substantial additional funds to support housing growth and economic development. CIL will also provide further new resources. Estimates as to how much CIL will raise are heavily dependent on the number of local authorities that elect to charge CIL, and the rates that they charge. However, CIL is expected initially to raise hundreds of millions of pounds of extra funding per year towards the infrastructure that local communities need. While CIL will make a significant contribution to infrastructure provision, core public funding will continue to bear the main burden, and local authorities will need to utilise CIL alongside other funding streams to deliver infrastructure plans locally&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08111872000235"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now come to the subject of charities, linked with the word &#147;clarity&#148;. Before I move on to the substance of the amendments tabled in my name, I express my gratitude to the Minister for her exemplary dealings with Members of the House, not only in the written word but in meetings. Since we last discussed this Bill, I have received 29 pages from the Minister and we have had a couple of meetings. That is a good way of doing business. I hope to return here tomorrow to talk about the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill, which has been dormant now for 10 months. I have not had as much as a picture postcard from Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury, but that is another matter.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08111872000236"></a>In moving Amendment No. 16, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 18, 20 and 24. There are three deletions and one addition. I bear in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said earlier about this being Third Reading, so I will not go into great detail about the splendour of the charitable sector, save to say this. Unlike the state or local government, the charitable sector seems able to get round it. The charitable sector has supporters&#146; clubs of serious magnitude in the people who are prepared to back it. Not only that, but the charitable sector finds itself, from time to time, the repository for gifts, whether of shares, cash or, indeed, land. Therefore, it is a sector in which people have great confidence.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08111872000237"></a>Amendment No. 16 would move towards greater clarity. The deletions would leave us with regulations that provide for exemptions from CIL, for persons who would otherwise be liable, where the development is a relevant charity. If one deleted the items that, in my view, should come out, CIL would not apply when the charity wanted to develop for its own purposes or if it wanted to develop and recycle the proceeds for its own charitable purposes. Amendment No. 24 would give that opportunity to areas that may not yet be seen as charitable or be classed as charities under the Charities Act, such as community enterprises or community sports clubs. With these changes, it would be clear that charities were exempt and that there were opportunities for work that is seen by many members of the public as similar to charitable work to be exempt or, in certain circumstances and depending on the regulations, to have some degree of reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08111872000238"></a>I do not want to be bobbing up and down, so I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. The effect of the amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Cameron and Lord Hodgson, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham is similar to that of my amendments. Deleting &#147;may&#148; and inserting &#147;must&#148; and changing subsection (3) would be very helpful. If it comes to the point, I will be happy to support them.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08111872000239"></a>Amendments Nos. 22 and 23, tabled by the Minister, change subsection (3). The language is strange, but I believe that it is meant to clarify. Regardless of what happens to my amendments and those tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, it will be important for the Minister to talk about clarity. I know that she will want to speak about the improper use of a charity. I do not believe that any noble Lord would want to see charities used in an improper way. Any regulations will need to take care of anybody who is up to no good and is trying to use a charity in an improper way. The Minister will also want to speak about state aid, although I am far from clear whether that is real or imagined.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08111872000240"></a>If today two charities are each given &#163;10 million, the first in stocks and shares and the second in land, and in five years&#146; time they sell, for the first there will be no capital gains tax and for the second, with today&#146;s law, there will be no CIL. Yet there is the prospect of CIL. It is important to be clear about where we are on that. It is particularly important that the Minister sets out how she sees the position on investment property and whether CIL applies. It will be helpful to hear what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.</p>

I have no wish to repeat the arguments that I set out in previous stages of the Bill. It has been proven again and again that charities deliver public benefit, including benefit that comes within the definition of community infrastructure, at far better value that any public administration can, usually because of the voluntary input of labour and the localised nature of many charities. The idea of raising money in any form from charities to be spent by the public sector is a negative benefit for society. For the Treasury to be shy about giving a total exemption for charities is short-sighted.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08111877000002"></a>My second general point is that the charitable sector is already very heavily regulated, with no room for manoeuvre for charities outside their charitable purposes and with every aspect of their business having to be explained to and audited by the Charity Commission. I cannot believe that there is any room for underhand dealings&#151;certainly nothing that any extra regulation or control can do to make a ha&#146;p&#146;orth of difference in this field, apart from causing all charities, especially the very small ones, unnecessary extra costs in the form of lawyers and accountants to comply with an extra layer of unnecessary regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08111877000003"></a>Lastly, before turning to our amendments, as we have progressed through the Bill&#146;s stages and watched the Government's prevarication on the simple question of a clear&#151;I mean clear&#151;exemption for charities in the Bill, I have become more certain that under no circumstances should we leave anything to chance in the form of secondary regulations in which, subject to Amendment No. 27, this House will play no part.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08111877000004"></a>I do not say that in any way as an attack on the noble Baroness, because I know that she has been working very hard on our behalf with the powers that be. I add my praise to her to that which has already come from other Members of the House for her general ability throughout the Bill to listen to what the House has had to say, to amend and to reach an accommodation with the views expressed from all quarters of this House. As has already been said, she deserves her place in history. That does not undermine my point about the general government prevarication in getting exemption for charities into the Bill.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08111877000005"></a>On Amendment No. 19, in conversation with the Bill team, I discussed the restrictive nature of subsection (1)(b), referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt: the difference between charities that may own investments as opposed to property. When I explained my dismay at the change of tack that seemed to be taking place compared to other tax exemptions and the disadvantage that charities that owned property would have in this case, I was told that my concerns could be catered for under subsection (2)(a). I immediately jumped on the word &#147;could&#148; because, at the moment, that is all that subsection (2)(a) promises. Actually, it promises endless hours of expensive individual negotiations&#151;hence the rationale behind Amendment No. 19. I add in passing that even with the amendments tabled to subsection (3), the regulators are still left with a huge degree of flexibility regarding subsection (2) charities, even if &#147;may&#148; is turned to &#147;must&#148; with reference to subsection (2).</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08111877000006"></a>On Amendment No. 21, at Report, we were pushing for a total withdrawal of subsection (3), because as it stands it undermines the certainty that we sought in both subsection (1) and subsection (2). However, following the response of the noble Baroness on Wednesday and her subsequent letters, we are prepared to agree a compromise and to allow subsection (3) to refer to subsection (2) only, but not subsection (1) charities, as defined in subsection (4). That is our bottom line. It is a good compromise between our position and the Government's position. Even with the new government amendment, subsection (3) as proposed seems for the first time to bring conditionality into charity legislation. As I said, we can understand why DCLG wants to impose conditions on institutions to be exempted under subsection (2), especially Scots, Northern Irish and EU charities, because their charity law is different from that of England and Wales, but under statute and common law in England, a charity is a charity is a charity.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08111877000007"></a>We certainly do not want any additional test of public good or public benefit beyond that already set out in the Charities Act 2006, especially if that test is being set by people who are either from central  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1043"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1043</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>government, in the form of the regulators, or from local government, in the form of local authorities&#151;people who are without experience in the sector. I believe that would be totally invidious. Charities in England are already regulated by charity law, company law, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in respect of tax, and also the common law of trust. Subsection (3) appears to impose another layer of regulation on a sector that is already incredibly heavily regulated. I am sure there are ways of cheating the system but they are frankly fairly unlikely. I do not believe another set of rules is going to change that. If a subsection (1) charity develops property, it is impossible to extract any profit from that charity as all dispositions of land, where there is a change of purpose for that land, have to go to the Charity Commission for clearance. The Charity Commission audits the transaction and follows the money.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08111877000008"></a>The Minister has said she is worried that any concession in this area might engage the EU state aid rules. She has argued that subsection (3) is there not just as an anti-avoidance provision but because of state aids. We can see why that might be needed for subsection (2) but not for subsection (1). Charities cannot normally trade except where it is primary purpose trading so the state aid rules are much less likely to be applicable because there is unlikely to be any cross-border distortion of competition between suppliers of a service which is undertaken as a primary purpose of a charity. As I have said many times before, and we have consulted various top lawyers on this, we regard this state-aid distraction as little more than UK gold-plating.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08111877000009"></a>Amendment No. 25 follows on logically from Amendment No. 21 and the acceptance of one, with or without a vote, implies acceptance of the other. Amendment No. 25 is really only a clarifying drafting point. The department admits that subsection (5) is only intended to apply to institutions exempted under subsection (2). Some lawyers have claimed that the semi-colon in the middle could be interpreted as indicating that the second half refers to both subsections (1) and (2). Our amendment merely removes all element of doubt. It is clarifying and also it succeeds or fails along with Amendment No. 21.</p>

<a name="81118-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08111877000010"></a>Finally, I repeat that the acceptance of our Amendment No. 21 is the bottom line for the charity sector. There is enormous support, inside and outside both ends of the Palace of Westminster, for unequivocal exemption for registered charities. The longer certain parts of the Government have prevaricated on this Bill, the more convinced I have become that we need our Amendment No. 21.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08111877000012"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with Amendment No. 16 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. As he graphically pointed out, it is discriminatory against charities which happen to have ended up with their assets in land as opposed to in investments on the stock market. The Government have concerns about a windfall from development. It seems strange that you could get a windfall from a takeover on the stock market and be liable to no tax but on the other hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, pointed out, you could be CIL-able in terms of a land holding. Charities tend to be quite rich in land because schools and care homes will have land. Therefore, there will tend to be discrimination against them and against people who seek to leave property to charity in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08111877000013"></a>I take slight issue with the Minister&#146;s officials about one aspect of the letter. In our previous debate, I referred to the fact that Section 36 of the Charities Act 1993 contained an anti-avoidance provision. I felt that it underlined the reasons why Amendment No. 16, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, was worth pursuing. Her officials describe this as a reasonably undemanding requirement on the charity and what it can do. It is worth pointing out that the Act requires that, if there is a connected party, the disposition must go to the Charity Commission, whatever happens. In any case, the trustees have to,</p>
<ul><a name="08111877000021"></a>&#147;obtain and consider a written report on the proposed disposition from a qualified surveyor instructed by the trustees and acting exclusively for the charity&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08111877000018"></a>and&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08111877000022"></a>&#147;advertise the proposed disposition for such period and in such manner as the surveyor has advised&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111877000019"></a>Having considered the surveyor&#146;s report, they must consider,</p>
<ul><a name="08111877000023"></a>&#147;that the terms on which the disposition is proposed to be made are the best that can reasonably be obtained for the charity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111877000020"></a>There follows a definition of who the qualified surveyor must be.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08111877000014"></a>It is not fair for the Minister and her officials to say that these are reasonably undemanding requirements, as they force the charity to consider very carefully what they are doing and to take appropriate advice. If the charity fails to do that, the charitable resources requirement requires the Charity Commission to ensure that charitable resources are being used properly. One therefore wonders whether the Government have the appropriate confidence in the Charity Commission to carry out this task. I understand why they wish to leave this to the regulations. Indeed, the Minister says that draft regulations will be published in the spring and that they will listen carefully to the views of the sector, but this is the heart of the difficulty; we will have passed the Bill before the regulations come out. Moreover, the regulations are not amendable and will not come to this House, so it really is good night from us tonight on the detail of this part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08111877000016"></a>On our Amendment No. 21, the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, has a rather more draconian, scorched earth approach in that he wants to blast the whole thing out of the way, but I think that we need to make the change that the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, has outlined: no ifs, no buts, no maybes. There are very clear controls on the way in which the clause will operate: you have to be a relevant charity, so there is no question of you being able to sneak into this; and, unless the Minister accepts Amendment No. 16, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, there will be regulations, which can be drawn up in such a way that they are anti-avoidance measures. We therefore do not need to think of a further, final failsafe in an anti-avoidance provision. I very much hope that the Minister will see that Amendment No. 21&#151;and Amendment No. 25, which would ensure that the clause applies only to subsection (2)&#151;is absolutely critical to maintain the confidence that the charitable sector should have in the way in which the Government propose to apply CIL to charities.</p>

I would simply appeal to the Minister and the House to strive to produce crisp, clear-cut and unambiguous legislation, which is unencumbered with unnecessary compliance or regulatory complexity, so that the whole of the charitable sector can get on with its valuable work for the public good and for the public benefit, and so that scarce resources do not have to be diverted into overcoming a plethora of new, complex hurdles.

The charities most affected by the possibility of paying the community infrastructure levy are the housing associations, which are building tens of thousands of homes on which this new levy would be charged over and over again. We have reached a point where it is clear that those housing associations that are charities will be excluded and will not have to pay CIL. In all normal circumstances, Clause 209 will cut them out, which is extremely good news and very positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08111872000260"></a>The housing associations divide between the 70 per cent that are charities and the remainder that are not charities because, usually for slightly obscure historical reasons, they decided not to register as charities.

About 30 per cent of them are housing co-operatives or organisations that are industrial and provident societies without charitable status. Even though they make up only 30 per cent of housing associations, they make up about 50 per cent of the total housing association output. If they are not also excluded we will run into all kinds of anomalies. When one looks at the two types of organisation side by side, it is hard to be sure which is and which is not a charity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08111872000261"></a>It is my hope that the Minister will place on record some of the very helpful comments that she made to us in a letter. She expressed the view that she hopes it will be possible, after consultation with the National Housing Federation and others, to find the regulations to ensure that those organisations that do not happen to be charities but are also providing this much needed affordable housing are included in the same exemption from CIL.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08111872000262"></a>I am hoping to hear&#151;again, it is a matter of saying this on the Floor of the House, which is important to those in the world outside&#151;that it is the Government&#146;s intention that all housing associations that are making the same provision of social housing for the same kind of people will be placed in the same position for CIL, which I hope is a fairly straightforward statement. Otherwise, we will have half the production line of affordable housing by these organisations disadvantaged and confused. All kinds of anomalies will creep in as to which kind of organisation a builder or a local authority wants to work with. It would be immensely helpful if we could have clarity regarding the Government&#146;s intention to place all housing associations on the same footing if they are doing exactly the same job with the same subsidies and the same governmental support.</p>

I have followed the ebb and flow of this debate very closely and with a good deal of interest. Obviously, we must recognise that the Minister has already&#151;perhaps she has not been given a sainthood for this part of the Bill&#151;moved a long way towards putting in the Bill the fact that there will be a 100 per cent non-negotiable exemption for charities in all normal circumstances. That is the effect of the way in which the Bill is phrased. However, she has reserved unto government the fact that in regulations there will be the opportunity in exceptional circumstances to say &#147;no&#148; to that overarching 100 per cent general exemption. It would not be like rate relief which, for example, is 80 per cent relief or VAT which is 0 per cent relief. As someone who runs charities, I know that we have to pay some taxes, such as VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08111872000264"></a>I turn to those that have invested in land. I ran the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust for many years and we had a portfolio that included land that will go for future development. Indeed, the trust still owns such land. I was musing on the point that an investment by charities in land should be treated in the same way as an investment in stocks and shares; that is, if they are sold, no capital gains tax is payable. But if land is held for investment, when it is sold, the charity would not pay CIL at that point; it would be payable further down the line by the housebuilder who purchases the land. However, it would not be payable if the purchaser was a charitable housing association. Therefore, this

I absolutely take the point.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08111872000265"></a>The question for us, having put into the Bill a 100 per cent exemption in normal circumstances, is whether we can be given sufficient reassurance about the exceptions to those normal circumstances in which the Government reserve the right to say no. I chair the Giving Forum which looks at ways in which giving and donations can be increased. We have promoting, for example, the idea of lifetime legacies, ways of giving during someone&#146;s lifetime but still getting some benefit. I have come up against the staunch resistance of the Treasury to measures that might be abused by clever lawyers using obscure charity law to benefit individuals or companies. Tedious as it is, I have come to recognise that it is possible for avoidance measures to creep in to such schemes.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08111872000266"></a>On state aid and the European dimension, I am afraid that I have no understanding of why that is an inhibition at all, but I appreciate that the Treasury has its own lawyers who will put up a very hard fight to ensure that there is in regulations a safety net for the Government that provides that although in normal circumstances there will be a 100 per cent exemption, the Government can reserve the right in some perhaps obscure situations nevertheless to call in the CIL exemption. We are not going to get past that because the government lawyers are going to be fairly adamant. That seems to be a pretty solid brick wall. We can take a rush at it, although possibly the rush would go a bit too far with the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. However, those tabled by my noble friend Lord Cameron of Dillington, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, do not. I hope that we can be given sufficient reassurance not to have to push this too hard. I have a great deal more sympathy with those amendments rather than seeking to go at this head on. I hope, too, that the Minister can give us a few more words of comfort before we take the next steps on this.</p>

Over 25 years, I have found that the most vexatious and time-consuming work is creating structures for real estate and for regeneration which avoid charitable and non-profit-making organisations from falling into the trap of state aid. I have to say to the House that of all the areas I have been involved in, this is one in which the European Union has tremendous expertise and, I have to say, incredibly long tentacles in terms of its reach into such

The Union is very proficient at understanding how to realise value from these and when state aid is in fact being granted. It took me two and a half years to secure claims for the English Cities Fund in a way that did not contravene state aid rules. It is immensely sophisticated in its application of state aid, and at our peril would we take lightly the advice coming from the Minister on this point.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08111872000270"></a>I shall speak briefly on those in a moment, but I have a problem with government Amendment No. 22. I much prefer Amendment No. 20 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. If Amendment No. 22 is carried, I do not, in my ignorance, see how it makes sense. Unless I have completely misinterpreted it, Clause 209(3) would then read:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08111872000322"></a>&#147;Regulations under subsection (1) or (2) may provide that an exemption or reduction does not apply if specified conditions are satisfied&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111872000290"></a>That appears to be a contradiction in terms, although I may be quite wrong on this. I do not like the clause, but it would make more sense if it read, &#147;reduction does not apply unless specified&#148;, and so on. Perhaps the officials could scribble a memo or two to the Minister to clarify that.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08111872000271"></a>I return to the other amendments. In Amendment No. 19&#151;the &#147;must/may&#148; argument&#151;I found it incongruous that subsection (1) has &#147;must&#148; while subsection (2) has only &#147;may&#148;. On Amendment No. 21 I can do no better than support what my noble friend Lord Hodgson has said, while Amendment No. 25 is to an extent consequential on Amendment No. 21. I urge the Minister to look again at the whole question of charitable status, particularly for those who are building and renovating buildings that are themselves in the charitable sector.</p>

I am involved in 15 charities and voluntary bodies, which are declared in the Register of Lords&#146; Interests. There is no question that the ability of these charities to survive is very tenuous in some cases, while others are doing exceptionally well. The ones I am associated with that I have great concerns about are environmental charities, which often own property and land and which provide a superb service, not only for country dwellers but also for those in metropolitan areas. They would be captured in the net as the Bill is currently phrased. The amendments would provide a lifeline to many charities by ensuring that they were not unfairly penalised.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08111872000274"></a>I was much persuaded by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Best. He was talking, of course, about exemptions for charities. Speaking generally, the term &#147;charity&#148; covers a wide range of undertakings, and the activities of charitable institutions are also very varied&#151;the charity owned by Northern Rock had some curious aspects.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08111872000275"></a>Some charitable trusts put up buildings that have significant infrastructure implications; for example, a big art gallery in a city centre. Such trusts are economic undertakings when they charge to make a return on investments and to create additional funds. We are party to treaty obligations not to create unfair competition through state aid, with penalties, including for the charities, if we do. I live not far from the piers of the south-east coast, which could be a case in point. There is a real difference between what non-government Members may suggest and what Governments can actually do. I hope we do not accept constraints that would be quite unsuitable.</p>

I am extremely grateful for all the kind things that have been said across the House. I pay tribute to my officials for an extraordinary job of work. The issues raised by the amendment have taxed us all.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08111881000002"></a>On the other hand, of course, I have been accused of prevarication and obscuration. I wish that I had gone through the Charities Act 2006 with noble Lords. I suspect that, having been here for the passage of that Act, which was pretty heavy going, I would have understood many things that I have had to learn quickly in the past few days. I understand why the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and the right reverend Prelate call for clarity. We are trying to make things as unambiguous as possible in legislation, so that we can have certainty about outcome and impact. That is absolutely the right thing to do.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08111881000003"></a>Sometimes, however, clarity comes at the expense of risk. Things are complex. The problem with the third sector, as the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, pointed out, is that it is hugely diverse and complex in terms of what it does, charities&#146; objectives, how they work, their relationships, their economic arrangements with trading funds and so on. We are incredibly privileged to have this sector, but it is by no means simple. In all my dealings with noble Lords over the past few weeks, discussing these amendments with the Charity Tax Group, listening to debates and so on, I am reminded time and again how complex these areas are and how vital it is to be careful about what we are doing. Underlying everything I say this evening is a deep desire to do what is right and safe for the third sector, and to make absolutely sure that what we have will be as fully protective and enabling as possible.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08111881000004"></a>I know that noble Lords originally had a number of concerns about Clause 209 and how we will use the powers it gives us to help charities in the important  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1050"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1050</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work that they do. I shall address those first. I think that noble Lords have now received the letter that was sent by email at 11 pm last night. I am sorry that it was not sent earlier, but it was complex to draft. It might be helpful if I quickly run through the purposes behind the various components of Clause 209 again.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08111881000005"></a>The heart of the clause is subsection (1) and the guarantee which it represents; that is, that CIL regulations must include a 100 per cent exemption from CIL where the liable party is a,</p>
<ul><a name="08111881000072"></a>&#147;relevant charity in England and Wales&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000057"></a>and the development is to be used wholly or mainly for its charitable purposes. The noble Lord, Lord Best, spelt that out in his contribution. A relevant charity in this context is defined in subsection (4) as any charity registered with the Charity Commission or which is excepted or exempt from the duty to register with the Charity Commission. It is not just about registered charities. The subsection covers many scenarios: a lifeboat station developed for use by the RNLI, for example, or a hostel which would be used by a homelessness charity. It would also apply to a building only to be used as a head office for a charity.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08111881000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, was talking about land on this point. However, CIL becomes liable only if there is development on it. It is extremely important to recognise that when charities buy and sell land alone, CIL is not directly engaged. Charities are in fact asked for Section 106 contributions, reflecting that their developments have impacts. We are looking at whether Section 106 could be scaled back so that charities might benefit from that. That is the reality.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08111881000007"></a>I shall plough on. Not all types of charitable body will fall within the scope of subsection (1) and, in addition, some charities and charitable bodies may perform development, perhaps for investment purposes, which may not constitute using a building for charitable purposes, to which the 100 per cent exemption in subsection (1) is tied. We certainly want to explore providing as wide a range of relief as is legally and practically possible in regulations.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08111881000008"></a>One noble Lord&#151;I am sorry that I do not know who&#151;talked about &#147;regulations by chance&#148;. There will be nothing chancy about these regulations. The Charity Tax Group is committed to working with us assiduously on this, as it has done so far. I have no doubt that it will be as tough and comprehensive as it needs to be.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08111881000009"></a>Because we want as wide a range of relief as is legally and practically possible, subsection (2) provides a power for regulations to go further than the duty imposed in subsection (1). It does this in two ways. First, subsection (2)(a) provides a power in CIL regulations to provide an exemption to institutions established for charitable purposes which fall outside the coverage of subsection (1). We have expanded the scope of the clause precisely to enable us to help more charities. For example, this would allow us to cover those in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and, if appropriate, other EU charities where they wished to develop in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08111881000010"></a>Secondly, subsection (2)(b) empowers CIL regulations to require charging authorities to make arrangements for an exemption or reduction to CIL to institutions  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1051"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1051</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>established for charitable purposes. This will allow us to comply with EU law when giving relief, and, expanding the clause, allows us to explore providing exemptions or reductions for charities which are engaging in fundraising activities which fall outside the scope of subsection (1)&#151;for example, where land is developed for investment purposes. I will come to investment activity, as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, invited me to do, because there are some complex issues. They require serious discussion and further exploration with interested parties such as the Charity Tax Group.</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08111881000011"></a>I reassure noble Lords who are concerned that subsection (5) may be used to cut back the range of charities that may enjoy the 100 per cent exemption in subsection (1) that this is not legally possible. We cannot do that. This subsection applies only to the powers in subsection (2) and cannot be applied to the duty in subsection (1).</p>

<a name="81118-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08111881000012"></a>We introduced subsection (3) in an amendment on Report. The original subsection stipulated that regulations may provide that an exemption or reduction under subsections (1) and (2),</p>
<ul><a name="08111881000073"></a>&#147;applies only if specified conditions are satisfied&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000058"></a>That caused noble Lords concern, which I understand. I gave assurances on Report that we could not lawfully use the powers to render the duty in subsection (1) meaningless or hollow. There was a feeling, which I regret, that somehow that qualification would render subsection (1) null and void. It does not, and would not have. I therefore undertook to take away the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, seeking to delete the subsection.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81118-0008.htm"/>


<a name="81118-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08111881000013"></a>It has been put to us that this subsection does not provide sufficient comfort to the charities that regulations implementing this subsection will reflect our broad policy aims. It seems to presume non-exemption with unspecified conditions. That was the problem with the original drafting. We came back with Amendment No. 22, which amends subsection (3) so that regulations can provide that an exemption does not apply if certain conditions are satisfied.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08111881000014"></a>I understand that this is not elegant, but we have had to be deliberate in our drafting. As we have amended this clause, it will convey the message to charities that being exempt where a development is used for the charitable purposes of the charity will be the usual situation, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, said. Where very specific conditions are satisfied, however, an exemption may not apply. I shall come to those conditions in a moment.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08111881000015"></a>It is symbolic that we are approaching the giving of exemptions to charities as being our presumption. There is now a presumption as regards exemptions. I should also make it plain that we are not intending to use this power to find some general way out&#151;I should feel deeply insulted if anyone thought that we were&#151;of providing an exemption of the sort required under subsection (1). It is for exceptional circumstances. Far from intending to be harmful, subsection (3) is intended to help because it will allow us to work with the sector to decide what sort of conditions should feature in regulations. I have spoken to many of your Lordships over the past few weeks and they will know that the  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1052"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1052</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two conditions we particularly will apply to subsections (1) and (2) concern anti-avoidance and compliance with state aid law. We are talking about risk. That is why the relevant amendment was tabled.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08111881000016"></a>As regards the anti-avoidance measure, it is important that regulations have powers to outline anti-avoidance measures. It is not without parallel. For example, Schedule 8 to the Finance Act 2003 stipulates the condition to the relief for charities from stamp duty land tax. It states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111881000074"></a>&#147;the transaction must not have not been entered into for the purpose of avoiding tax under this Part (whether by the purchaser or any other person)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000059"></a>I am aware of the argument about bureaucracy and imposing another layer of regulation. I know that noble Lords are unwilling to countenance what they see as further regulation in a heavily regulated sector, but the charitable sector is heavily regulated because there is a lot of public interest and public money at stake. Private money is also involved. It is a hugely complicated financial sector which has to be regulated in the way that it is. However, subsection (3) does not automatically impose further regulation. It is a starting point for discussions with the sector and other stakeholders on what conditions relating to anti-avoidance might look like. I assure noble Lords, not least with the Better Regulation Task Force in mind, that avoiding unnecessary duplication of existing regulation will be uppermost in our minds during this process.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08111881000017"></a>As regards Europe, I was very grateful for the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, because few people know about what she referred to as the long tentacles of Europe, and the sharp eyes. I believe that we are absolutely right not to take any risks, however remote people feel they may be. It is vital that regulations can protect the charity sector from a breach of state aid rules, the penalties for which are serious and could involve charities having to repay relief, with interest. I understand that some noble Lords are sceptical about this issue but we cannot afford to ignore the risk of this happening. Again, this is an issue which has been brought up in other regimes giving charitable exemptions. For business rates, the guidance on rate reliefs for charities and other non-profit making organisations published by a former incarnation of my department in 2002 brings this issue to the attention of local authorities and sets out how they should respond where a state aid is given under this regime. This is not a distraction, as a noble Lord said. The European Commission rules on state aid state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08111881000064"></a>&#147;Aid must have a potential effect on competition and trade between Member States. It is sufficient if it can be shown that the beneficiary is involved in an economic activity and that he operates in a market in which there is trade between Member States. The nature of the beneficiary is not relevant in this context (even a non-profit organisation can engage in economic activities)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000060"></a>The European Commission takes a very wide, purposive approach to EU law in practice. Therefore, we are trying to be careful, to anticipate, to use foresight and to use evidence as the basis of our judgment.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08111881000018"></a>Our view is that state aid law can be engaged even where a development is to be used for a charitable purpose since charities can be engaged in an economic activity, be in competition with other undertakings and are engaged in an activity where there is trade

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08111881000019"></a>Government Amendment No. 23 is a purely technical change. Currently, Clause 209(4)(b) applies only to institutions registered in the register of charities kept by the Charity Commission under Section 3 of the Charities Act 1993. However, as a consequence of the commencement of Section 9 of the Charities Act 2006, the register will be kept under Section 3A of the 1993 Act. This amendment therefore amends Clause 209(4)(b) to cater for this change when it comes into force.</p>

We have listened to what Peers and those in the charity sector have told us and acted appropriately. I believe that the provision we now have, as modified by these government amendments, delivers the reassurance which the sector seeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08111881000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, invited me to put on the record the point about the definition of &#147;charitable purposes&#148;. I reassure all noble Lords that, legally, references to a charitable purpose implicitly include the plural &#147;charitable purposes&#148;. Section 6(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978 provides that, in any Act, words in the singular include the plural. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Best, that I wish I could give him as simple an assertion as he wants with regard to his question. He understands the complexities of this sector far better than I do, particularly as regards the housing sector and the range of social housing providers, including those in the private sector, and the diversity of development schemes. A single approach cannot be provided because we must avoid unintended consequences. I can certainly promise him that the Government will seek to work with the sector to explore the possibility of achieving our goal of a relief for charitable providers of social housing through the powers provided by Clause 209 to make provision for charities and institutions established for charitable purposes. However, where there may be providers of social housing whose developments we cannot make provision for through those powers, the Government will&#151;as I made clear on Report&#151;explore arrangements for differential rates for social housing development, which would mean that they would be liable to a significantly reduced rate of CIL. The use of powers to impose differential rates to significantly reduce CIL charges could extend to benefit all providers of social housing and help ensure wider and continued provision of affordable housing. So to the extent that the charitable exemption cannot be used to assist a certain social housing provider, we will be exploring how we can provide support through another route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08111881000022"></a>I distinguish between the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, would drive a coach and horses  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1054"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1054</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through the clause, and the more moderate exemptions asked for by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, in his amendments. Originally, the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, wanted to wipe out subsection (3) altogether. Now he wishes to keep it but detach it from subsection (1).</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08111881000023"></a>I wish to speak to government Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 and then address the other amendments. These amendments make three key changes to Clause 209. First, they include development activity which is not for the charitable purposes of the charity in the duty in subsection (1). Secondly, they limit or even prevent conditions applying to exemptions given under subsections (1) and (2) and finally they clarify the boundaries between subsections (1) and (2). Opposition Amendments Nos. 16, 18, 19 and 24 are all concerned with placing a duty on the Secretary of State to provide exemptions from CIL.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08111881000024"></a>Opposition Amendment No. 16 would delete subsection (1)(b), so the Secretary of State would be under a duty to provide 100 per cent exemption from CIL, regardless of whether the development was to be used for the charitable purposes of the charity. Presumably as a result of this change, the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, has deleted subsection (2) to Amendment No. 18 and replaced it with a similar provision to Amendment No. 24. This would allow CIL regulations to enable institutions other than charities to be exempted from CIL under the duties of section 1, and would require charging authorities to provide exemptions from, or reductions in, liability to pay CIL. Crucially, it would not allow regulations to remove certain kinds of charitable institutions from the purview of the clause. We believe that this is an important safeguard, for example in trying to cover charities from outside England and Wales, for the reasons I explained.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08111881000025"></a>Opposition Amendment No. 19 would put a duty on the Secretary of State to provide exemptions from CIL for institutions established for a charitable purpose, and to require charging authorities to provide an exemption or reduction from CIL. I understand that its primary aim is to compel us to use subsection (2) to exempt charitable investment activity from CIL. However, it would also render otiose subsection (1) and lead to duplication of duties, and could also lead to unworkable results with competing duties.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08111881000026"></a>I am aware of many concerns about development by charities that is not for the charitable purpose, and the fact that it will not be covered by the 100 per cent exemption under subsection (1). We have powers under subsection (2) to provide exemptions or reductions for charities in CIL regulations. These have been specifically taken so that we can build on subsection (1) to do more to help charities, but they need to remain discretionary; &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;must&#148;. I assure noble Lords that our aim in principle is to exempt development by charities for investment purposes. Now we must explore these complex issues in detail, inside and outside government, to set out a final position in regulations.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08111881000027"></a>Unlike development for charitable purposes, development for investment purposes brings into play a much wider and more sensitive range of activities, not all of which we believe should be covered by CIL exemption. Furthermore, development of land for sale by charities has the potential to bring the sector  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1055"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1055</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into competition with private sector activity of a similar nature. Perhaps this is the example that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, was looking for: the development of market housing, or a retail outlet. It may therefore involve state aid issues. Some of these developments can be very large. Deciding whether investment by charities should be covered by exemptions or reductions is a matter not for the Bill but for regulations when we have sufficient time to explore the issue thoroughly with the charity sector. We will publish our draft regulations in the spring and will work closely with the charity sector, as we have done with the development industry over other proposals.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08111881000028"></a>Opposition Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 seek to blunt the effect of subsection (3). Amendment No. 20 seeks to delete subsection (3) entirely. Amendment No. 21 prevents subsection (3) from specifying conditions under which the duties of Section 1 would apply. I hope that I have persuaded noble Lords that subsection (3), as it would be amended by Amendment No. 22, cannot be changed any further: it is a starting point for discussions with the charities sector on the conditions that might apply, particularly in relation to state aid and anti-avoidance. If my own amendment is accepted, subsection (3) would be worded in a way that symbolises that, in terms of duty, this clause provides as our starting point a presumption of exemption.</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08111881000029"></a>Finally, opposition Amendment No. 25 seeks to amend subsection (5) to make it clear that the powers contained in subsection (5),</p>
<ul><a name="08111881000075"></a>&#147;but CIL regulations may provide for an institution of a specified kind to be or not to be treated as an institution established for a charitable purpose&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000061"></a>apply only in relation to subsection (2). This is an unfounded concern, as the whole of subsection (5) can only define the institutions that can be given exemptions or reductions under subsection (2). It has no bearing on the 100 per cent exemption from CIL for charities under subsection (1).</p>

<a name="81118-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08111881000030"></a>I have gone into some detail: I hope I have not wearied the House. I was challenged to be clear and set out what may be a minority position. I have done my best to show that what we are trying to do is not perverse or stubborn; it is to be as careful as we can in a situation where we cannot predict the future. The fact that we have not been challenged does not mean that we will not have to deal with this issue in future. I would be the last person to put the charitable sector at risk. I hope that the House will accept my amendments and reject the others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08111881000039"></a>I should like to comment on the remarks made by the noble Baronesses, Lady Ford and Lady Whitaker, on state aid. I have made these points before, although I have not made them today. Charities in this country are exempt from income tax and they are exempt from capital gains tax, which are huge sums of money hundredfold times greater than the exemption that we are trying to get today. Stamp duty land tax recently gave a full exemption for charities, and I cannot understand why the Government have changed their mind on this particular levy. Council tax has an 80 per cent exemption, and most local authorities give the other 20 per cent. Virtually every other country in Europe, with the notable exception of Sweden, gives roughly similar exemptions to its charities. I do not believe the EU Commission would be politically so insensitive or bring down on its head the wrath of all the charities in Europe, and all those who support them&#151;which may amount to as much as 50 per cent of the population&#151;by attacking such a small exemption from what is only a local levy, when it has long ignored all the other much larger exemptions.

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08111881000050"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, last week noble Lords divided on an amendment that would have given both Houses of Parliament, in our bicameral legislature, the power to approve the regulations to be made under Part 11&#151;the CIL regulations, which the House has just debated. The Bill seeks to restrict the power to another place. As a number of noble Lords said in the debate that has just ended, the whole business of CIL depends on regulations. The word &#147;regulations&#148; appears on every page of Part 11, sometimes  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1061"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1061</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>many times. If the amendment is not carried, this House will have no say in that at all. Last week, the amendment was defeated by just six votes, with the consequence that although this House has spent many hours debating Part 11&#151;at Second Reading in July, in Committee of the whole House, last week on Report and today at Third Reading&#151;we are to have no role whatever in relation to the many sets of regulations that will fall to be tabled.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08111881000051"></a>Of course last week&#146;s vote must be respected. I respect it; I accept that it will be for another place&#151;and that place only&#151;formally to approve those many regulations. However, I find it surprising that the noble Baroness has taken this line. She has been full of praise for what this House has done to the Bill, including to Part 11, and about the contribution that noble Lords have made. I have in my hands a letter that she sent to me only a few days ago, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08111881000070"></a>&#147;I thought the debate was outstanding, and I continue to learn a great deal from the collective wisdom of the House&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000062"></a>That is what we can bring to bear on this matter. The amendment recognises, of course, that the actual approval of the regulations must now rest with another place. We seek to provide opportunities for noble Lords to bring their &#147;collective wisdom&#148; to bear on the process.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08111881000052"></a>This House has always recognised that certain financial matters are open to the claim of privilege by another place, and I do not seek in any way to challenge that. The purpose of the amendment is to provide, between the tabling of the draft regulations and their approval by another place, time for both Houses to consider them and express their views, and for Ministers to respond. I emphasise &#147;both Houses&#148;&#151;this House as well as another place. In other words, this House should be consulted, even if we do not have power to approve the regulations. Anyone who listened to the last debate will realise just how much of CIL will depend on the regulations. How much each House might use that opportunity is not for the Bill, of course, but for discussions between the usual channels. The amendment does no more than offer several possible ways of doing it.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08111881000053"></a>If the amendment is carried, as I hope it will be, it will be open to the other place to accept it or redraft it in a form acceptable to parliamentary counsel. Alternatively, another place might choose to draw a distinction between the regulations that bear directly on the charging of CIL and the rest, which are of a more administrative nature. That distinction was made in paragraph 26 of the Delegated Powers Committee&#146;s report, which referred to &#147;matters referred to&#148; in certain clauses which are &#147;not obviously financial&#148;. That must be for another place; it is not open to me to table an amendment to make that distinction. The important point for us this evening is that another place will not be given the chance to decide what to do unless we return the Bill to it with this amendment in it.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08111881000054"></a>What lies behind my concern is the increasing tendency of the other place to regard references to &#147;Parliament&#148; as meaning the House of Commons only, a point made on the Bill by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull. I am sorry that he is not in his place; I drew his attention to the fact that I was going to quote him. He said:</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="08111881000071"></a>&#147;I am beginning to think that the other place has got into the habit of conflating the word &#145;Commons&#146; and the word &#145;Parliament&#146;, when they are two different things&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/08; col. 660.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111881000063"></a>As I said a moment ago, we are a bicameral legislature and that must never be forgotten. We had a striking example of the tendency with the statistics Act last year. The Act provided that the new statistics authority was to be accountable to Parliament. The Liaison Committee of this House unanimously recommended that that should be via a Joint Committee of both Houses. That was accepted by noble Lords, but Ministers in the other place interpreted the Act to mean accountability to the House of Commons alone. Despite appeals from the then Leader of the House&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton&#151;the proposal by this House was simply rejected. Tonight we have another example.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08111881000055"></a>I accept that it is for the other place to assert its financial privilege, but that should not exclude this House having a role in the consideration of the CIL regulations. There may be honourable and right honourable Members in another place who want further reforms of this House, but that should not lead to the exclusion of this House from any role with respect to the regulations to be made under Part 11. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="08111881000056"></a><a name="81118-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81118-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08111881000556"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, the Government have been constructive, through the Minister, in response to many amendments proposed by other Members. However, the response to the issue of the involvement of your Lordships' House in the making of the regulations that will be needed under the Bill has been negative, to say the least. I must make it clear that I do not speak today on behalf of the Delegated Powers Committee, because it has not had an opportunity as a committee to consider the amendment. However, one necessary function of the committee is to see that the rights of your Lordships&#146; House are not overlooked or diminished by legislation that the Government propose to introduce. That, I am afraid, is what is happening now.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08111897000010"></a>We should surely start from the presumption that the roles of your Lordships&#146; House and of the House of Commons in respect of delegated legislation are equal, subject to the exception of supply Bills and other financial Bills and to the exercise of financial privilege of the House of Commons. I therefore greatly regret the vote last week that resulted in your Lordships&#146; House rejecting its own right to claim involvement in the making of statutory instruments. That weakened your Lordships&#146; House. It would have been a good thing if new regulations had required resolutions of both Houses&#151;certainly in many cases. That is especially so because the secondary legislation gets far less attention in the House of Commons than it does here. The House of Commons has nothing equivalent to the Delegated Powers Committee or the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. Debates in the House of Commons on statutory instruments are notoriously brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08111897000011"></a>We are a revising House. The exercise of our revising powers in recent weeks has shown the importance of these powers, both in this Bill and in others that have  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1063"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1063</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been before your Lordships&#146; House in the last few days. It is obvious, however, that a great deal of work on the Planning Bill remains to be done. Although the Delegated Powers Committee has accepted that Part 11 is no longer to be regarded as a skeleton, an enormous amount is still left to be exercised by secondary legislation. No fewer than 18 of the 21 clauses in Part 11 contain powers relating to the making of regulations. This amendment would merely enable your Lordships&#146; House to express its views on the draft regulations and to require the Secretary of State to respond to those views. The House of Commons would thereby have the benefit of the views of your Lordships&#146; House but the House of Commons would not be bound by them in any way. This plainly would not trespass on the privilege of the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08111897000012"></a>I do not see this as a party-political matter. The question is whether your Lordships&#146; House, having played a large part in the development of Part 11, should be excluded from any further involvement in development through regulations. We have already been excluded from the right to vote on resolutions needed to implement Part 11. If we in your Lordships&#146; House are also to be denied the lesser right to have our views expressed and considered before the House of Commons approves these regulations, that will set a dangerous precedent, which may well weaken our powers of revision. That is why I support this amendment.</p>

We owe him a debt of gratitude for identifying the issue and pursuing it so resolutely. The arguments that he and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, presented to the House in our debate on Amendment No. 130 on Report and the arguments that they have presented today are irrefutable. I have never seen my noble friend the Minister so miserable in dutifully defending the indefensible.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08111897000014"></a>In our vote on the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on Report, this House deprived itself of the power and the responsibility&#151;long-established without peradventure and amply demonstrated in the many precedents cited by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin&#151;to approve or disapprove regulations governing charges or levies as opposed to taxes raised for the Exchequer on the principle that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, just explained. That was a gratuitous act of self-immolation.</p>

<a name="81118-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08111897000015"></a>If significant constitutional change is to be introduced, it should not be introduced as an incidental aspect of legislation. Although I make no personal criticism of my noble friend the Minister, I believe that in introducing this change the Government should have been candid with the House. Equally, the House should have been vigilant. The House should not abandon its rights and its responsibilities without the most careful consideration, in a fit of absence of mind. That is what happened last week when we had a vote on a poor turnout and, by 96 votes to 90, as I recollect, the noble Lord&#146;s amendment was lost. This amendment gives us the chance to retrieve at least a good part of what we threw away last week. I hope that the House will acquit itself better today than it did last week.</p>

Although I was in the building, I absented myself from the vote. That was because I am a member of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which had reached a clear view on what the proper procedure should be. For those reasons, I felt that I could not support the Government. I would certainly have no difficulty, however, in supporting the Government in the Lobbies tonight if this matter is pushed to a vote. There are three reasons for that. First, although the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, says that he respects the vote last week, it seems clear that this is an attempt to revisit that vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08111897000019"></a>The second reason why I oppose this is that it seems to bring a new procedure into the legislature.

During that period of 60 days, either House of Parliament would have the opportunity to debate the regulations or to refer them to any committee for a report. What would happen if, on the 59th day of that period of 60 days, one of the Houses&#151;particularly this House, as it might be seen as obstructive of the House of Commons&#151;referred the regulations to a committee? Would that suspend the operation of the 60 days?</p>

I find the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, very depressing. In earlier stages of the Bill, it was quite clear, in discussions on other matters, that there was a view on the government Benches that it would be completely alien for Members of this House or of Parliament to behave efficiently and in a businesslike way, that that would never happen and that progress could not be made. I am sorry, but I do not believe or accept that. It is very depressing that anyone could even make those kinds of remarks. We have spent a great deal of time already in this House considering CIL. If we have no place in the decision-making on this, what have we been doing? As the result of consideration here, the Bill has been greatly improved. That justifies my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

I had not thought it likely that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, and my noble friend, who worked together closely on this amendment, would have made a basic drafting error, although, for about 30 seconds, I thought that the noble and learned Lord had spotted one.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08111897000034"></a>It has been put to me that, even without this amendment, this House could do what is suggested by having a debate, passing a resolution and setting up a committee. That is so, but paragraph (b)&#151;the provision that the Secretary of State must respond&#151;is at the heart of good scrutiny; it requires a response and feedback. The attention to detail shown by your Lordships&#146; House to Part 11 over the past few days demonstrates the value of such scrutiny. The arrangements proposed in the amendment would perfectly capture the skills of this House, although they do not go as far as those that some of us supported when dealing with the amendment last week.</p>

However, the development and regeneration that might come about as a result of this levy will certainly be affected by the detail as well as by the principle. Again, this House would have a valuable role to play. Finally, the comment was made&#151;possibly by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin&#151;that the House of Commons and the House of Lords have equal roles in a bicameral Parliament. I would say that they are complementary&#151;perhaps they are equal and complementary&#151;and the complementary element is captured by this amendment, which we on these Benches support.</p>

I put my name to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in Committee, as I believe that it is important that this House should be consulted at least in this small way. Without the work that we have done in Committee, on Report and, today, at Third Reading, this Bill would be in considerably worse shape. To exclude this House is purely a political decision; it has nothing to do with the policy in the Bill. The Minister should think carefully about the route that she is taking.</p>

I absolutely understand the genuine passions expressed so consistently, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. However, I need to remind the House that last week we resolved, on Report, not to accept the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, which would have provided for all CIL regulations to be made subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses. This is a question not of what the Minister wants, but of what the House wants, and the House decided last week that it did not want affirmative regulations. This is not a political issue.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08111897000038"></a>While I understand the disappointment that has been caused, I think that the amendment would create more problems than it would solve. It would provide, alongside the affirmative procedure in the other place, for a 60-day period during which either House could debate or pass a resolution on the draft regulations, or refer the draft regulations to any committee for report. The Secretary of State would then have to respond to any debate, resolution or report before the other place could give its approval to the regulations. The amendment would control the circumstances in which the other place might approve any CIL regulations. Sixty days would have to pass and the other place could not approve regulations until the Secretary of State had responded to any debate, resolution or report.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08111897000039"></a>I will come to the procedural issues in a moment. On the practical details, I ask noble Lords to think about what would be involved. Part of the problem is that we do not know. The amendment risks turning the process for making CIL regulations into a long and complex one. It would permit this House to refer a draft of the CIL regulations to a committee to consider and issue a report. My noble and learned friend Lord Boyd asked some pertinent questions and some clarification was forthcoming. All I can see is that there would be considerable delay in making CIL regulations. The process would also apply to amendments to CIL regulations to close a loophole or to correct a minor error. We are looking at a long procedure every time that we try to amend CIL regulations.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08111897000040"></a>Throughout this process we have tried to balance fairness and transparency with greater speed so that we can put arrangements in place to raise the funding that we now so urgently need for local infrastructure. On timing, I indicated that the Government would not make the CIL regulations before autumn 2009. However, once it is right to do so, surely those regulations should be made promptly to enable charging authorities to generate additional revenue for infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08111897000041"></a>The substantive response to the amendment rests on two arguments. The first is that&#151;with the exceptions of delaying the other place&#146;s affirmative resolution debate by 60 days and compelling the Secretary of State to respond to the debate or resolution&#151;what the noble Lord seeks to achieve is already achievable. My noble friend Lord Howarth referred to last week&#146;s debate and the Motion tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. There is nothing to prevent this House from debating anything that it wants on a Motion, if it should so choose. There are two issues there. The amendment would also require the Secretary of State to respond to any debate, resolution or report made by either House. It is unclear what form this response would take. How useful would it be? Exactly what duty would be placed on the Secretary of State? What would it do to the relationship between the two Houses in terms of secondary legislation?</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08111897000042"></a>I argue that, as noble Lords have emphasised in practically every speech, the role of our House is one of scrutiny and revision. My fear is that we would not have scrutiny and that this procedure would diminish the value of the scrutiny that we offer; it would dilute the notion of scrutiny. This would be a debate without powers to annul, at a time when we are absolutely insistent on the value of this House. What I said to the noble Lord in my letter was perfectly compatible with what I have just said and with my respect for this House. There is a genuine problem there with the role of this House.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08111897000043"></a>Secondly, my noble friend Lord Howarth talked about a constitutional change suddenly being imposed. This is my real anxiety. We are inventing a new form of parliamentary procedure for secondary legislation. This is a new convention, which raises fundamental issues about the relationship between the two Houses in considering secondary legislation.</p>

As I said, it raises profound questions, not only about the relationship between the two Houses in considering secondary legislation but about the role of the Secretary of State in this. When this House chooses to change and improve, it does so on the basis of serious consideration that crosses all parties. I have sympathy with what the noble Lord has tried to do, but I am seriously concerned that it would have dire consequences for the business of the House, the making of regulations and, perhaps, even the nature of regulations. It is not the way to reform the conventions of this House at the final stages of a complex, much improved Bill, in response to the failure of an earlier vote. I know the noble Lord is not revisiting that, and that what he wants is to give this House a voice at all costs. I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

The noble Baroness began by saying that we were trying to reverse last week&#146;s vote. That is absolutely not true. We are now asking for a say in what happens here, that is recognised in the legislation. If the Minister does not like the procedure which I have set up, it is open to the Government to come forward with some other way in which this House could have a say. They can only do that if we send this amendment back to the other place. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08111897000065"></a>I shall take Clause 6 as an example. It includes a power to make provision consequential on, or supplementary to, Clauses 2 to 5. Clause 6 goes on to state that this includes the power to amend,</p>
<ul><a name="08111897000135"></a>&#147;any enactment (whenever passed or made)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111897000124"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 10 is to clarify that the power would enable future secondary legislation to amend provisions contained in the Local Transport Act itself, or provisions as amended by that Act, as well as other enactments.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08111897000066"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 to 8 amend the consultation requirements that are imposed on the senior traffic commissioner. The main change is that, before issuing directions or guidance to the other commissioners, the senior commissioner would be required to consult such organisations representing the interests of public transport users as he thinks appropriate. Amendment No. 9 confirms that the Secretary of State may issue guidance to the senior traffic commissioner about any of his functions.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08111897000067"></a>At this point, I refer to the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Rosser, Amendment No. 9A, which is intended to ensure that the senior traffic commissioner has regard to any recommendations made by the Public Transport Users Committee for England or the Rail Passengers&#146; Council, now popularly known as Passenger Focus, so that enforcement action could be considered against poorly performing operators. I believe that I can meet the concerns that my noble friend has in this regard. Back in April, the Secretary of State announced that, subject to further consultation on the details, additional functions would be conferred on the Rail Passengers&#146; Council to enable it to represent the interests of bus passengers. That reflects the fact that many respondents to our consultation on strengthening bus passenger representation had a clear preference for Passenger Focus taking on this role. Passenger Focus already does a good job representing rail passengers, and there are economies of scale in giving the role to an existing statutory body; therefore, we do not intend to establish a public transport users&#146; committee at the current time.</p>

<a name="81118-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08111897000068"></a>However, I assure my noble friend that, were we to establish such a committee, the powers in the Bill would be wide enough to place certain requirements on the senior traffic commissioner to take account of recommendations made by the committee if that was thought desirable. Similarly, the current clause enabling the Secretary of State to confer bus and coach functions on the Rail Passengers&#146; Council through secondary legislation would be wide enough to make similar requirements of the senior traffic commissioner, if thought desirable. Due consideration would, nevertheless, need to be given to ensure that it was done in such a way as not to prejudice or diminish the authority or independence of the senior traffic commissioner. The secondary legislation will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so there will be a proper opportunity for your Lordships' House and the House of Commons to debate the detailed proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08111897000069"></a>Amendments Nos. 11 to 16 relate to local transport plans. Amendment No. 11 makes explicit that local authorities must have regard to government policies and guidance relating to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as other environmental issues. This responds to points raised in the House in earlier debates on the Bill, as well as to debates in the other place.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08111897000070"></a>I shall say a few words about the amendment to the Motion proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. We entirely share his view that the planning and delivery of transport, whether by central government or local authorities, should play its full part in mitigating the threat posed by climate change. I reassure him that we will be emphasising the importance of taking that goal into account both in the guidance that we give to regions on planning regional transport priorities and in the draft guidance to local authorities on local transport plans, which we will publish before Christmas.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08111897000071"></a>We are also developing the tools that regions and local authorities urgently need to help them assess the impact of their proposals and policies on the emission of greenhouse gases. Measuring such impact is, I fear, far from simple. It is well known, for example, that a well intentioned but badly planned measure to reduce congestion, and the emissions that result from that congestion, may have the unintended effect of encouraging more people to use their cars. We need to ensure that local authorities are encouraged not only to reduce emissions but to do so effectively.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08111897000072"></a>Given our current state of knowledge, it is simply impossible for local authorities to estimate with any great accuracy the total impact of their transport policies on climate change. We do not believe that making such matters a potential issue for the courts to determine, as might happen under the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, is the right way forward at this stage. In addition, it is important that local authorities consider the threat of climate change against the totality of their policy, taking into account the need to integrate transport policies with, for example, housing and land use planning.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08111897000073"></a>Measuring the impact of transport policies alone carries a significant risk of perverse results. Impacts need to be measured across local authority policies, so that the best measures overall may be planned and implemented. I stress again to the noble Lord that we will be emphasising the importance of taking the threat posed by climate change into full account in the guidance that we give to both regions and local authorities on local transport plans.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08111897000074"></a>Amendment No. 16 makes explicit that local authorities must consult transport providers and transport users when developing their local transport plans. Clause 12 would transfer responsibility for local transport policies and plans in our major cities outside London to the Integrated Transport Authority for the area concerned, but the ITA would be required to consult the councils falling within its area.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08111897000075"></a>However, there are some statutory references to local transport policies developed by metropolitan district councils. Those councils will no longer be developing such policies, so those statutory references will no longer work. Amendment No. 17 and

I do not intend to say too much, except to welcome one or two things, but we have one or two concerns that we should discuss about provisions that might reduce the democratic aspect of the Bill. We are also obviously concerned about the imposition on local authorities. That will come up during the evening.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08111897000078"></a>I especially welcome the amendment that means that we should consult passengers. We all think that we should do that; we discussed it at an earlier stage. I also welcome the Minister's comments on climate change; however, I hope that the Government practise what they preach. When you cross the QE2 Bridge as you go round the M25, a cloud continuously hangs over the toll booths. The Government may solve such things. Charges for the Dartford Crossing should be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08111897000079"></a>The Government should practise what they preach, but I tend to agree with the majority of the amendments, so I have no further comments.</p>

To be effective Passenger Focus is going to need to have some teeth, particularly given the problems that some passengers face with bus services outside London. I recognise that secondary legislation will deal with the powers of that watchdog in more detail but I would like to see secondary legislation ensure&#151;and I would be grateful if my noble friend could confirm if this is his intention&#151;that the watchdog Passenger Focus has a role on appeals on complaints because that would bring it into line with its equivalent for London, which applies to bus services in London as well as rail services. I would also like to see Passenger Focus given the powers to access performance information from operators which at present is not readily available and without which it is difficult to see how Passenger Focus could do its job.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08111897000081"></a>Obviously the purpose of the amendment was to enhance the authority of the watchdog by ensuring that the traffic commissioners have regard to the views of the watchdog. If passengers are unhappy with what is happening to their services, they will surely expect the passenger watchdog to be able to do something about it. I ask the Minister to repeat the commitment that he appears to have given to ensure that I have understood it. At present the watchdog has no powers to make operators do anything about the service problems that passengers might be complaining about. However, the traffic commissioners have the powers to act on poor services because they can investigate and penalise poor performance. The amendment would mean that the body designated as the passengers&#146; champion can

I urge the Minister to look very hard&#151;and I am asking for a very clear response to make sure that I have understood the commitment he appears to have given&#151;at how secondary legislation can ensure that the passenger watchdog has the full range of powers it needs to represent passengers, including a role on complaints and appeals arising from complaints, the ability to access performance information, and the ability to ensure that traffic commissioners have regard to its representations on behalf of passengers. Can the Minister say whether the issues I want to see Passenger Focus be able to deal with are covered by the assurances he gave?</p>

He spoke entirely about complaints by users to Passenger Focus and yet in a presentation last night which the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, and I were at, the problems that people are bringing to Passenger Focus relate to such things as the overcrowding of trains, which is entirely in the hands of government. It is not much good having a passenger watchdog that can bite in one direction but cannot bite in the other. It needs to be a two-way-facing organisation, not a one-way-facing one.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08111897000083"></a>On my Amendments Nos. 11A and 11B relating to climate change, I accept what the Minister has said. My worry is that the guidance issued might be issued in such a way that local authorities which choose to do so may ignore it. I remember the debate we had on the Traffic Management Act 2004. That was supposed to bring some discipline to the use of the highway by utility companies and it has not worked at all well because certain local authorities either ignore it or are too weak to enforce it. As congestion is the major reason for the unreliability of bus services and the escalating cost of the bus industry, it is important for central government to address issues such as traffic management and climate change in a way that will bring about some advance.</p>

Indeed, the strengthening of the powers of Passenger Focus is not something, I would have thought, that any of us in your Lordships&#146; House would object to. However, whether inadvertently or not, I felt that he glossed over many of the problems that give rise to complaints where bus services are concerned. I am not surprised about that because the brief that he delivered was prepared by the Passenger Transport Executive Group which believes that the only problem with buses is the question of ownership. Yet a countrywide survey made of passengers earlier this year&#151;and I do not propose to read out the figures again because I did so at an earlier stage&#151;revealed that in passenger transport executive areas in particular the main complaints of passengers were not the matters raised by my noble friend Lord Rosser but those of overcrowding on some services, congestion and the lack of information about where buses go to and how to pay fares, because many towns and cities have a different system of fare

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08111897000085"></a>While supporting the aim behind the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Rosser, I hope the Minister will agree that other matters ought to be addressed, such as the recalcitrance of some local authorities to provide proper paths for their buses, proper areas restricted for bus users&#151;bus lanes in other words&#151;and the habit in some cities, including Birmingham which is run by a Conservative-Liberal coalition, of removing bus lanes because the leaders of those councils are in thrall to the private car. I hope these matters will be addressed by the Minister and he will bear in mind that the main complaints of many of our passengers in our major towns and cities lie at the feet of the passenger transport executives rather than those who own and operate the buses.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, is right that it is not sufficient simply to produce guidance. The guidance needs to be taken seriously by local authorities. However, it appears to the Government that local authorities are taking the need to give much greater priority to the tackling of climate change very seriously indeed. The number of local authorities which have chosen to include an emissions target among their priorities in local area agreements is very encouraging. One hundred out of 150 local authorities have selected National Indicator 186 measuring the per capita reduction in CO2 emissions in the relevant area as a priority in their local area agreement with the Government. All 150 will monitor progress against this indicator and this will feed into the Audit Commission&#146;s comprehensive area assessment starting next year. So the trend is encouraging but as I stressed in my opening remarks, it is very important that the Government provide local authorities with much better tools with which to assess the impact of their proposals and policies on the emission of greenhouse gases because this is not an area in which many authorities have had much experience.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08111897000125"></a>This is a collaborative process between us and local government. We are working together to identify best practice. Local authorities are willing to take action, and we now need to capitalise on this spirit of good will to see that it leads to real change on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08111897000088"></a>My noble friend Lord Rosser asked specific questions about the powers of Passenger Focus. I hope that I can give him some reassuring replies. We will consult early in the new year on the secondary legislation about Passenger Focus, but I can tell him that powers under Section 6(9)(k) of the Transport Act 1985 could be used to require operators to provide information; for

It is important that Passenger Focus has the information that it needs to go about its job. We believe that it will play a significant and positive role in relation to buses, as it has been doing in relation to rail. The recent South Central franchise process, for which we recently issued an invitation to tender, took substantial account of the views of Passenger Focus. Indeed, we made a number of changes to the design of the tender as a result of its comments.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08111897000089"></a>My noble friend also asked about complaints and Passenger Focus having a complaints-handling role in relation to buses, as it does in relation to rail. As he will be aware, an existing body&#151;the Bus Appeals Body&#151;already performs a complaints-handling role. However, we recognise that there are some concerns about the way in which complaints are sometimes dealt with in the bus sector, and we will ask Passenger Focus to undertake a review of the existing complaints-handling process. If this provides evidence that the current system is inadequate, we expect Passenger Focus to work with the industry to explore options for addressing this. Our future action will depend on the outcome of this work.</p>

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="08111897000104"></a><a name="81118-0011.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="81118-0011.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08111897000433"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 18, 147, 148, 152, 153 and 156 to 158. Again, these are relatively minor and technical amendments. Amendment No. 18 relates to quality partnership schemes and specifically the power for the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers to make regulations about admissible objections. As noble Lords may recall from earlier debates, the idea of admissible objections is that bus operators should have the opportunity to object to requirements relating to fares, frequencies or timings in a quality partnership scheme which they believe are unachievable or commercially unviable, but they should not have the opportunity to veto local authority proposals on spurious grounds.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08111897000105"></a>It is therefore envisaged that the traffic commissioners will play a role in determining whether operators&#146; objections are admissible, in cases where the operator and the local authority cannot reach agreement. The Government have in mind that a traffic commissioner may need to call on an independent expert to assist him, in which case it may be necessary for that expert to be paid for his or her assistance. Amendment No. 18 simply enables future regulations to provide for such payments.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08111897000106"></a>Amendments Nos. 147 and 148 are about the powers of the traffic commissioners where a bus operator is failing to run his services properly. The Bill already includes a new power for the traffic commissioners to order a failing operator to expend money to improve his services. The amendments make it clear that the traffic commissioner can be more specific about the precise improvements on which the operator is to spend money delivering, and that he can also require money to be spent on improving facilities such as information at bus stops.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08111897000107"></a>Amendments Nos. 152, 153 and 156 to 158 relate to bus passenger representation. Clause 69 already empowers the Secretary of State through secondary legislation to confer new functions on the Rail Passengers Council&#151;commonly known as Passenger Focus&#151;to allow them to represent the interests of bus as well as rail passengers. We considered this issue a moment ago in our debate on the previous group of amendments. The amendments now under discussion provide flexibility to allow the remit of Passenger Focus to be broadened to cover matters relating not only to bus and coach services but to tram services and passenger transport facilities. The department will consult on whether Passenger Focus should represent tram passengers in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08111897000110"></a>Part 3 is aimed at enhancing the powers available at a local level to secure improvements in the standard of local bus services. Buses are a crucial part of our local transport system and over the past few years we have seen the first sustained increases in bus patronage  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>across Great Britain for half a century. A number of places around the country where local authorities and bus operators work in partnership have delivered real improvements to services. As a result, more people are getting on buses.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08111897000111"></a>However, there are still too many places where passengers are not enjoying improvements and where patronage continues to fall. Where voluntary partnerships are working well, the Government applaud them. But it is also important that other options are available, particularly for those areas where partnerships are not delivering improvements. This Bill seeks to devolve decisions to those who understand the needs and requirements of their local areas and to ensure that the right tools&#151;voluntary partnerships, quality partnership schemes and quality contracts schemes&#151;are available at a local level.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08111897000112"></a>The Bill includes various provisions to make quality contracts schemes a more realistic option for local authorities, while also preserving appropriate safeguards for bus operators. This group of amendments covers four aspects of these provisions. The first effect of this group is to ensure that in England the elected local authority takes the final decision about whether a quality contracts scheme should be made in its area. The amendments replace the proposed approvals boards with QCS boards. Rather than making the final decision as to whether a scheme should go ahead, the role of a QCS board would be to provide an opinion and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to the local authority. It would be for the local authority to take the final decision, having considered the board&#146;s opinion and any recommendations.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08111897000113"></a>The amendments also spell out more clearly the precise role of these boards. The boards will be expected to consider two things; namely, first, whether the local authority has fulfilled the statutory requirements to give notice of their proposed scheme and to consult on it and, secondly, whether the proposed scheme meets the &#147;public interest&#148; criteria set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81118-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08111897000114"></a>The amendments retain a role for the Transport Tribunal in hearing appeals against a local authority&#146;s decision to make a scheme. The scope of this appeal right would depend on whether the proposed scheme had received a clean bill of health from the QCS board. If it had received a clean bill of health in terms of meeting the five statutory public interest criteria and in terms of consultation, the appeal is restricted to points of law. The intention of this right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal is to provide a quicker, more accessible and less costly alternative to judicial review. Consistent with the preferences of the devolved Administration, the existing arrangements as regards schemes in Wales are left unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08111897000115"></a>The second issue dealt with in this group of amendments relates to employment protection. At earlier stages of the Bill&#146;s passage through your Lordships&#146; House, amendments were made to strengthen the protections available to bus workers in an area where a quality contracts scheme is being introduced. The principal effect of those amendments was to provide certainty that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08111897000116"></a>Amendments Nos. 132 to 136 strengthen further the protections available. They define an additional situation where TUPE would apply. They also make provision about pension protection, placing a duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations to ensure that workers involved in the provision of bus services in the scheme area before the scheme was made do not lose out in pension terms as a result of the scheme.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08111897000117"></a>The third issue, covered by Amendments Nos. 20, 70 and 122 relates to local authority powers to operate bus services in certain circumstances. This responds to questions raised during the Bill&#146;s passage through your Lordships&#146; House and the House of Commons. These amendments would provide a power for a local transport authority to operate local bus services in a very specific set of circumstances; namely, where an operator of services under a quality contract had ceased to provide those services before the contract was due to terminate&#151;for example, if the contractor goes into liquidation. In such a situation, it may be in the interests of passengers for the local transport authority to be able to step in for a limited period while it takes action to make appropriate arrangements for the longer term.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08111897000118"></a>Because this is intended to be no more than a temporary, emergency power, the amendments include a clear time limit of nine months, after which the authority can no longer operate the services. The Government have listened to the concerns of local authorities that they could face a very difficult position if they had not quite concluded their negotiations with a &#147;replacement&#148; operator at the end of that nine-month period. The amendments therefore also include a provision whereby the nine-month period may be extended by up to a further three months by the local traffic commissioner. The Government consider that this allows more than ample time for a competent local authority to make the necessary arrangements for a new contractor to be appointed and builds in an appropriate degree of flexibility through the three-month extension. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="081118108000012"></a>I am aware that we have had a long summer of lobbying. Indeed, we have had eight long years of lobbying on quality contracts. I am also aware that there has been some glee and jubilation from certain members of the passenger transport executives up and down the country over the recent amendments to the quality contracts scheme process. Those of us who have taken a long interest in these matters are aware that a great deal of face saving is involved and that the amendments under discussion in this group fall some way short of what the more control-oriented, let us say, brethrens of the local authorities sought. Ministers have been at pains over the past few months to allay any fears that the industry might have and to point out to bus operators that any quality contract proposal will still be subject to independent and sequential scrutiny. I know that many members of the bus industry are still comfortable that quality contracts are some way from the easy option portrayed by some in the Passenger Transport Executive Group. Will the Minister assure us that quality contracts will be used only as a last resort by sensible authorities that have exhausted all faster, more economic and passenger friendly options?</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="081118108000013"></a>Some people in the bus industry think that pressing for these amendments is something of an own goal by the would-be regulators as it could open the door to longer and more expensive legal action. &#147;Bring it on&#148; was the response, as I understood it, from certain more active members of the Passenger Transport Executive Group, but it is not their money. If you are paying for court cases with local ratepayers&#146; money, it is less of a problem than it would be perhaps to a commercial operator.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="081118108000014"></a>I believe that passengers will be best served if the legitimate interests of the bus operators are, as Ministers have continuously promised, properly protected. Bus operators got a bad and inaccurate press from those rather few honourable Members of the other place who participated in the debate throughout the most recent stages of the Bill. But it is important that Ministers concentrate on fact rather than rhetoric. It is a fact that &#163;2.2 billion has been invested in buses outside London over the past 10 years. In seven of those 10 years, that investment exceeded net profit in the bus industry.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="081118108000015"></a>FirstGroup, the company I work for, has built up over the past decade from a small municipal undertaking based in Scotland to a multinational company employing many thousands of people in the United Kingdom. In replying to the debate, the Minister should tread very carefully indeed so as not to cause any further anxiety in the bus industry, particularly during this somewhat delicate economic period. It is important, and I think both legitimate and right, that passengers as well as operators should have their legitimate interests protected under this legislation. Many people in the bus industry believe that if the quality contract route is to be followed without some of the safeguards that Ministers have indicated will be provided, much of their business&#151;whether lawfully or not will be for the courts to say&#151;will be confiscated. I understand that Ministers  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have assured the bus industry privately that even though this is far from an easy option, if the proposals were to be taken forward, not only would operators have every opportunity to put their own case, they would also have a proper right of appeal against any decision. It would help to allay many fears in the bus industry if the Minister could confirm that it is indeed the case that the amendments I would have proposed had he spoken at the time I expected him to speak&#151;that is, on this particular group&#151;would therefore be superfluous. I trust that he can do so because I have already indicated that I do not propose to move Amendment No. 44A.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="081118108000016"></a>I want to ask my noble friend why the appropriate approvals authority for a quality contract scheme in Wales may approve the scheme if it is satisfied not only that the new public interest test in Clause 19 is met but also if it is satisfied that the scheme is in the public interest. I expect to be told that it is because Wales has a devolved Administration, but I do not think that the public interest is any less important in the rest of the United Kingdom. Indeed, I would point out that Ministers and the Government generally have been consistent in saying that the legitimate interests of bus operators have to be taken into account when the merits of a quality contract are being assessed. In order to do that and to ensure that the benefits of a quality contract are proportionate to the disbenefits, surely it is essential that the QCS board is able to assess fully the financial losses that any operator might incur as the result of a quality contract being introduced, not just the collective position of all operators. Can the Minister confirm that the government amendment which creates new Section 124(1A) of the Transport Act 2000 will oblige QCS boards to assess each operator&#146;s financial interest, not just an overall assessment of them all?</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="081118108000017"></a>I want also to press the Minister on government Amendment No. 69. As currently drafted, the Bill restricts the scope of an operator&#146;s appeal to the Transport Tribunal. Where a QCS board has approved a quality contract or recommendations to change the quality contract have been taken on board by the relevant authority, an operator&#146;s appeal can be made only a point of law, not on a point of fact. As far as I can see, this prevents operators appealing to the Transport Tribunal against the assumptions that might have been made by the authority and the QCS board in justifying a quality contract. It also prevents operators making representations to the tribunal on matters taken into account or not taken into account by the authority or QCS board. An operator&#146;s only right of appeal to an independent tribunal against an approved quality contract would be his submission to the QCS board on the authority&#146;s consultation. I ask my noble friend whether such a procedure actually makes sense and indeed whether it would be defensible in law. Surely there can be no justification for restricting the scope of an operator&#146;s appeal to the tribunal, and this amendment therefore removes the restriction currently applied by the amended Bill. It will enable an operator to appeal to the tribunal on a point of law and fact, regardless of the view of the QCS board. This is a further amendment designed to ensure that the legitimate interests of operators are taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="081118108000018"></a>I apologise for the length of this speech, but it is the only one I intend to make during the passage of this Bill, and these matters are of enormous concern to the bus industry. I turn finally to the question of the invitation to tender to be issued while appeals are outstanding. It is possible, under the terms of the amended legislation, for an authority to proceed to issue an invitation to tender to operators who may wish to bid for a contract to run a quality contract even if an appeal against a quality contract is outstanding. Again, we are in the realms of certain members of the Passenger Transport Executive Group saying, &#147;If there is legislation, so what?&#148;. I would point out that legislation of this kind is likely to be protracted and expensive, and that there ought to be a proper justification from PTEG to justify this course of action. Surely it cannot be right for public authorities to proceed with an ITT and all the costs that involves while an appeal is outstanding. If the appeal is successful, all the time and expense of proceeding with the tendering process would be wasted. The position is even more serious if a tender is awarded before an appeal against the particular contract has been won. It is, to say the least, a bizarre arrangement and there appears to be a fundamental lack of common sense and of justice in the procedures as they are presently laid down. It may well be that common sense would prevail and an authority would not proceed to prepare and issue an ITT while an appeal is outstanding, but there is nothing to stop it doing so under the terms of the Bill before us today. By stating expressly that an ITT can be issued even when an appeal is outstanding, the Bill almost encourages local authorities to proceed in that way. The straight question for my noble friend is this: how do the Government propose to ensure that authorities use their powers wisely?</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="081118108000019"></a>In conclusion, having taken a deep interest in the Bill and having some years&#146; experience in the bus industry, I cannot say personally that the prospects for companies and bus passengers have been enhanced by the Government&#146;s amendments. I hope that the Minister will take it upon himself to give an assurance to bus operators that the last stage of any change in the quality contract will not be made as easy as some, in my view overly optimistic, members of the Passenger Transport Executive Group apparently believe.</p>

I have no financial interest in the bus industry, but I have a lot of experience of it. I want first to reiterate the point I made earlier: traffic congestion is by far the biggest enemy of bus services. Unless there are effective ways of dealing with congestion, bus services will continue to deteriorate.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="081118108000021"></a>Secondly, quality partnerships, where they are working and where they bring bus companies into partnership with the local council and the police, have a lot of virtue in them. In fact, many local authorities have not yet taken up their powers to clear their highways, monitor bus lanes and fine those who invade them. In my opinion, attention to these areas would result in much better bus services than are likely to be brought about by quality contracts. A further point to make on quality contracts is that many people look jealously at  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>London and say, &#147;If we had that system in our city, we would be all right&#148;. I ask the Minister to pause and reflect on how much subsidy is put into public transport in London. It is vast compared with that provided outside, and any move along the road to quality contracts outside London will presumably come with a price that I think those who are proposing it intend to present to the Government. That has to be considered.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="081118108000022"></a>London has a huge number of people who arrive in the city by public transport without their cars and therefore use the bus services. Again, that is not the case in every city. Some cities still offer cheap and plentiful parking, and they wonder why the bus services they operate are not efficient&#151;there is obviously a cheap alternative and the cars being driven into those car parks are in fact blocking the roads along which the buses are to operate.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="081118108000023"></a>I am not convinced that anyone has shown that vast profits are being made in the bus industry that could be redistributed through a quality contract to subside less well served or less used areas. Where you can make even a modest profit running a bus service, that will be done commercially. It is only in areas where traffic is very thin that a bus service does not work, and you will not make a sensible adjustment by cutting services in busy corridors where there are lots of people travelling&#151;often quite poor people&#151;and saying to them, &#147;You can have a less good bus service so we can take some of the profits from there to run bus services in the more remote areas&#148;.</p>

No doubt he will strongly disagree with this, but I get the impression that the enthusiasm for the Bill from the Liberal Democrats in this House was considerably less than from the Liberal Democrats in the other place. From reading the debates it seems to me that their support was pretty wholehearted, which cannot be said of the Liberal Democrats in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

I suspect that the Bill will be supported by my party in this House as well. Furthermore, I do not accept the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that quality contracts go with high levels of subsidy. The two are separate issues and one does not necessarily go with the other.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="081118108000027"></a>I am pleased that the Government have accepted the principle behind the amendment. The issue is that, in the event of a quality contract operator defaulting for any reason, a local transport authority must be able to use any means at its disposal to keep bus services running, including operating services itself. Although I listened carefully to what my noble friend said, I remain concerned that the time limits being  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1085"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1085</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placed on the operator of last resort are too stringently set out in primary legislation, which is emphatic that while 12 months may be needed, 12 months and one day will not.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="081118108000028"></a>In the Bill, those powers of last resort are restricted to nine months, with an additional three months at the discretion of the traffic commissioner. In the other place, concern was expressed that that was too restrictive, given the wide range of scenarios that could result from an operator defaulting on a franchise. What would happen if a deal with a replacement operator for the franchise fell through at the last minute? What would happen to bus services then? Another scenario could be a franchise deal involving significant investment in new vehicles, to which reference has already been made, but where that programme of investment had not been completed when the initial quality contract operator, or contractor, defaulted. It might be a difficult task for a local transport authority to secure a replacement operator for the quality contract and ensure that the new vehicles were supplied at a competitive price when potential bidders knew that the local transport authority had a fixed period in place whereby it could keep services running as the operator of last resort. That does not seem to place the local transport authority in a strong position in any negotiations.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="081118112000008"></a>There are other possible scenarios, although one accepts that they would be exceptional. The independent or local transport authority might no longer require the use of a particular operator because of poor performance and could be subject to legal challenge. Surely in that situation the challenge might go on for a considerable time. Would any other operator be prepared to touch the provision of services with uncertainty remaining over the status and position of the original quality contract operator?</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="081118112000009"></a>What happens if an operator goes out of business 13 months before the end of their contract? What would the position be, then, if the local transport authority could operate services, if necessary, only for 12 months, when the contract itself was going to end after 13? What happens if there is an argument between competing operators and an independent transport authority over the ITA&#146;s decision on who should get a contract following the existing operator&#146;s defaulting? That, too, might be subject to legal challenge. As I said a moment ago, if a deadline to negotiate on contracts is approaching, considerable power is handed to the bidders when they know that the local transport authority is in the position that it can no longer operate those services after a maximum period of 12 months.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="081118112000010"></a>It is also worth noting that when the Government used their power of last resort in the operating role to take over the operation of south-east trains, following the failure of the Connex South Eastern franchise, I believe that those powers were exercised for almost two and a half years. How would passengers and the taxpayer have fared on south-east trains if the Government had been subject to a fixed time limit set out in primary legislation on their own powers of last resort on rail franchises?</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="081118112000011"></a>I realise that the Government are concerned that a local authority might seek to abuse these powers to, in effect, municipalise local bus services, taking them back into public ownership. Even if that were a likely  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1086"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1086</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>threat, though, under the terms of the amendment the traffic commissioners would provide a safeguard against that, as they would decide whether or not the last-resort powers were to be granted. The Government&#146;s guidance to the traffic commissioners could be used to ensure that these last-resort powers could be extended only to protect passengers in exceptional circumstances following the default of an operator and the restarting of the franchise under a new operator.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="081118112000012"></a>I hope that my noble friend will be prepared to consider this amendment. The deadline seems unnecessarily restrictive; it allows no room for manoeuvre if, in exceptional circumstances&#151;and one accepts that they would be exceptional&#151;the specific date could not be adhered to. The amendment would allow the traffic commissioner, if he or she so desired, to agree to an extension. I have no doubt that they would want some compelling reasons for granting an extension rather than seek to use the power that I propose they should have in a way that did not reflect the need for exceptional circumstances to be proved.</p>

As was the case in the House of Commons, so here. We pay tribute to the entrepreneurial zeal and public service commitment of so many of our bus operators, in precisely the way that my noble friend Lord Snape would wish us to do. They make a great contribution to public transport in this country and we need them to make a greater contribution in the coming years. We recognise, as my noble friend said, that in a good many areas buses are doing well&#151;London, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, being a case in point, where we have seen a welcome transformation for the better in the pattern of bus service usage in recent years. As I said earlier, in some areas buses are not doing as well as we would wish. There are many reasons for that. I recognise the importance of addressing congestion, which the noble Lord mentioned. It is because of these issues that we need to address that we brought forward the provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="081118112000014"></a>My noble friend Lord Snape&#146;s overriding concern is that the Government should stand by their commitment to protect the legitimate commercial interests of bus operators. We absolutely stand by that commitment. The amendments I am speaking to in this group are designed precisely to ensure that appropriate safeguards are preserved in the interests of bus operators. First, the amendments retain a clear role for independent scrutiny of a local authority&#146;s proposals. That scrutiny will take place after the authority has concluded its public consultation process. This is important because it ensures that the quality contract scheme boards can take full account of any concerns raised by operators during the consultation process.</p>

<a name="81118-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="081118112000015"></a>Secondly, the amendments retain the five public interest criteria already set out in the Bill. These include a requirement that any adverse effects on operators must be proportionate to the benefits of the scheme, which is a crucial safeguard for operators. Thirdly, the amendments retain a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="081118112000016"></a>To deal with my noble friend Lord Snape&#146;s Amendments Nos. 44A and 69A in more detail, the first, on a public interest test, would require QCS boards to consider proposed schemes not only against the five statutory criteria already in the Bill, but also against a more general test of the public interest. The five criteria in the Bill already provide appropriate benchmarks against which any scheme should be judged, and are designed to provide clarity about how the public interest is to be assessed. They require an authority to show that the proposed scheme will, first, increase bus patronage; secondly, will benefit passengers; thirdly, will contribute to the implementation of the authority&#146;s local transport policies; and, fourthly, will do so in a way that is economic, efficient and effective. In essence, this means that the scheme must deliver value for money which, in turn, means that the authority needs to take account of all of the costs and benefits likely to arise from the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="081118112000017"></a>The crucial safeguard for bus operators is the fifth criterion: that any adverse effects on bus operators, both inside and outside the scheme area, must be proportionate to the benefits arising from the scheme. These five criteria make plain, in somewhat more detail than a general public interest criterion, what requirements a scheme needs to fulfil and what questions a QCS board needs to consider. They meet my noble friend&#146;s concerns and the legitimate interests of bus operators.</p>

Under the devolution settlement, it is of course up to Wales to frame the precise test that it wishes to apply. There would not be much point in devolution if we had to replicate the provisions that the Welsh put in place in every respect. The effect of our tests is to protect the public interest precisely as we would wish to ensure effective bus services, and to protect the legitimate commercial interests of bus operators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="081118112000020"></a>On my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 69A, on appeals to the Transport Tribunal, under the amendments made in the House of Commons the grounds for appeal against a local authority&#146;s decision to make a quality contracts scheme would depend on whether or not the QCS board had in effect given the final version of the scheme a clean bill of health. Where the QCS board, which will be independent of both central government and the local authorities, has given such a clean bill of health, having examined all the facts of the case and considered all the opinions expressed in the consultation, the Government consider that it is entirely appropriate for the onward right of appeal to the tribunal to be limited to points of law.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="081118112000021"></a>That would enable an appeal to be brought, for example, on the grounds that the authority had acted unreasonably in deciding to make the scheme, had acted with bias, or had fettered its discretion. There would therefore be a clear safeguard in the most unlikely event of a QCS board failing to identify a major flaw in the authority&#146;s proposal. It is not correct to say that an operator would, as a general rule, have

However, where the final version of the scheme had not received a clean bill of health from the QCS board, an appeal could be brought on either points of law or on questions of fact, enabling a full-case review. The Government consider that these proposals provide an entirely appropriate level of protection, while avoiding unnecessary stages in the process, which, after all, could delay the implementation of schemes that are manifestly in the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="081118112000022"></a>My noble friend asked me specifically why local authorities should be able to issue invitations to tender for quality contracts while an appeal to the Transport Tribunal is in progress. There is no statutory bar to local authorities beginning a tendering process while a judicial review is under way. We see no reason why the position should be different here. Of course, no local authority will be in a position to actually sign quality contracts until any appeals are fully discharged. I emphasise that we are not saying that local authorities must begin tendering during an appeal. Far from it; it would be for the authority to judge whether it would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case, bearing in mind the costs that the authority and others are likely to incur during the tendering process.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="081118112000023"></a>My noble friend Lord Rosser&#146;s amendment to Commons Amendment No. 122 seeks to provide added flexibility to allow a local authority to continue providing services as operator of last resort, beyond the proposed 12-month period. Nine months should be more than adequate time for an authority to procure a replacement service under a new quality contract. Even so, however, as I set out earlier, our new clause leaves the option to apply to the traffic commissioner for an extension of up to three months in case this should prove necessary.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="081118112000024"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to provide an emergency stop-gap measure for a local transport authority, not to re-establish local authorities as long-term providers of local bus services. The Government consider that a line needs to be drawn somewhere. If a local authority has been trying to find a replacement operator for a whole year and finds itself unable to do so, it is extremely hard to see what is going to change in month 13 or beyond. I therefore hope that my noble friend is persuaded that his amendment is unnecessary. We have given considerable powers and discretion to local authorities to act as operators of last resort where services have not proved viable, or have had to be terminated for any other reason.</p>

If we find ourselves in that scenario, what happens the day after the 12 months are up?</p>

It is hard to predict the circumstances in which services might come to a halt. However, if there were to be a scenario of the kind painted by my noble friend of a service coming to an end in circumstances where legal proceedings followed, even by the rather lengthy proceeding standards of our learned friends, one would realistically expect them to have been concluded well within a 12-month period. Therefore, we would not expect such a scenario to justify an extension of the 12-month period. However, I come back to the central point that this is intended to give local authorities the power to act as operator of last resort, not to put in place their own bus services on an ongoing basis. Recognising that we have to make a judgment about a cut-off point at some defined period, our view is that 12 months is the longest period in which one could justify a local authority acting as operator of last resort, and that any local authority which is fulfilling its duties responsibly would be able to put in place a replacement service over that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="081118112000027"></a>If a local authority was incapable of putting in place a replacement service in 12 months, it is very difficult to see what circumstance will change in the thirteenth month that is suddenly going to make it possible to act in a way it was incapable of acting in the previous 12 months. Therefore, even in the scenario that my noble friend paints of there being complicating factors surrounding the ending of a bus operation, we believe that the 12-month period is sufficient to put in place successor arrangements, and that we should not need to extend the 12-month period further. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

These amendments relate to integrated transport authorities and local road charging schemes. Before dealing with them, I wish to set out again the issues which we are trying to address in Part 5. As I said earlier, in the main urban areas outside London, current transport leadership and delivery arrangements do not always work as well as they might and need updating to reflect changing travel patterns. Current arrangements date from the Transport Act 1968, which allowed establishment of passenger transport authorities with responsibility for public transport across each city. There are now six PTAs covering areas such as the West Midlands.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="081118112000048"></a>In 1985 the power to create further PTAs was repealed, and the broad arrangements for local transport decision-making have remained the same since. However, over the past 20 years there have been many changes in the transport needs and patterns of different areas. Despite this, existing legislation offers little flexibility to update local arrangements, or for one PTA area to do things differently where local needs differ.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1091"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1091</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="081118112000049"></a>We believe that reviewing existing arrangements is a priority, and that local areas are best placed to identify the changes needed. The Bill changes the generic names of the six passenger transport authorities to integrated transport authorities. This change reflects the wider responsibilities that all ITAs will have in relation to local transport policies and plans, and their powers to act for the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area. The Bill also allows local authorities, both in areas with ITAs and in those without, to review existing arrangements in their area and come forward with proposals for improvements.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="081118112000050"></a>It will be up to the authority in each area to decide how wide a review it wishes to carry out. A review could cover, among other things, how well public transport services operate, the management of roads and the current distribution of powers over transport between local authorities and ITAs. The Bill would then allow the Secretary of State to respond to the proposals put forward by authorities by making individual orders for each area; for instance to establish a new ITA or to make changes to the constitution of an ITA that already exists. These orders would be subject to affirmative resolution in each House.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="081118112000051"></a>Amendments Nos. 159 to 163 are about the membership of integrated transport authorities. These amendments have two principal effects. The first is to guarantee that each of the &#147;representative councils&#148;, as defined in the amendments, will appoint at least one representative to the ITA. This supports democratic accountability by ensuring that every part of the area of an ITA must have at least one representative on the ITA, and no part of the ITA&#146;s area can be unrepresented. The provisions of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 will continue to apply to such appointments as they do now. This provides a further safeguard: that the appointment of elected members of a local authority to an ITA reflects the political balance of those councils.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="081118112000052"></a>The second effect of the amendments relates to a potential role for non-elected members of an ITA. The Bill allows the flexibility for non-elected members to be appointed to an ITA&#151;for example, representatives of transport users, businesses and other groups&#151;so long as they will be a minority of the members of the ITA. These amendments provide that such non-elected members may be granted voting rights on the ITA only by the existing voting members of the authority. This will ensure the democratic accountability of the ITA.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="081118112000053"></a>Amendment No. 166 restricts the power to make secondary legislation under Part 5 and makes clear that supplementary provision made under the powers in Clause 86 cannot amend or disapply the political balance requirements contained in the 1989 Act.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="081118112000054"></a>Amendment No. 164 provides that Clause 80 includes the power to delegate functions relating to local road-charging schemes. It also incorporates the safeguard that such functions may be delegated only with the consent of the majority of those authorities whose functions are to be delegated.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="081118112000055"></a>Amendment No. 168 relates to local road-charging schemes. It puts beyond doubt that English local authorities outside London, before making a local  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1092"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1092</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>road charging scheme, will be required to consult such local persons, and representatives of local persons, as they consider appropriate. The key point is that there must be local consultation. That was a concern of the party of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="081118112000056"></a>Amendment No 167 provides that orders made under Part 5 of the Bill, establishing new ITAs or reforming existing ones, will not be subject to &#147;hybrid instrument&#148; procedures in this House. I apologise to the House that this provision was not included in the Bill at its introduction. It is regrettable that the question of hybridity was not raised until after the Bill had passed through the House of Commons. It is all the more important, therefore, that I set out to the House today the compelling reasons that have led us to seek this new provision, given the concerns set out by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, in Amendment No. 167A.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="081118112000057"></a>There are four reasons for the course of action that we propose. First, the Bill, together with the new duties introduced on 1 April this year by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act, provide that orders under Part 5 will receive detailed scrutiny inside and outside Parliament. The order to set up or amend an ITA would be made only after a local area had had the opportunity to review its existing governance arrangements and to develop proposals for reform, in consultation with interested parties.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="081118108000213"></a>Clause 73(10) and Clause 85(4) provide that the Secretary of State must consult relevant local authorities and other parties with an interest before any orders are made. These are two substantive consultation processes, one at local level and the other at national level, which must be conducted before any order can be laid before Parliament. Furthermore, the Secretary of State, before preparing any order, would have full regard to the quality and outcome of local consultation. If proper consultation and reasonable decision-making were not observed at either local or national level, proposals and draft orders would be subject to judicial review. That is all before any order comes to this House and to the House of Commons for an affirmative vote. Therefore, there is no want of transparency, or of consultation, or of power and ability to object, or of checks and balances in the proposals that I commend to the House this evening.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="081118108000214"></a>Secondly, over and above the provisions in the Bill, we will be making explicitly clear in guidance the necessity for local authorities to consult widely with affected bodies and persons in carrying out reviews of their governance arrangements ahead of any proposal for change being submitted to the Secretary of State. This guidance could be a further basis for judicial review if it were not observed and conformity with the guidance will be a key factor in the Secretary of State&#146;s judgment on whether local proposals can proceed.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="081118108000215"></a>I emphasise that the Secretary of State&#146;s resulting proposals are subject to further statutory consultation. If noble Lords are by now seized of the scale and scope of the consultation that is involved, they are right to be so. Our expectation is that it will take around two years for this process to be complete in respect of each successful ITA scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="081118108000216"></a>Thirdly, I know that there is concern about the precedent that the dehybridity provision may have in terms of the powers and prerogatives of your Lordships&#146; House. Let me address that issue directly. Provisions of a dehybridising nature are not uncommon for secondary legislation dealing with governance issues of the kind that we are considering here. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee specifically says as much in its report on the Bill, when it concludes that the provisions are &#147;not unusual&#148;. The committee goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="081118108000258"></a>&#147;We draw the disapplication to the attention of the House so the House may satisfy itself that the alternative consultation procedures are an adequate alternative&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="081118108000217"></a>I have dealt with that point at some length and I hope that the House will agree that the alternative consultation procedures are adequate.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="081118108000218"></a>The precedents for the dehybridity provision are recent and relevant. They include the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, covering orders to establish new unitary councils, the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, in respect of orders designating areas as suitable for development, and the Local Government Act 1992, in respect of orders to change local authority boundaries and establish new authorities. Those provisions are directly comparable with those that I am proposing to your Lordships&#146; House now.</p>

<a name="81118-0013.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="081118108000219"></a>In respect of the 2007 and 2008 precedents that I have cited, neither was objected to by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The committee did not exist in 1992 to comment on those proposals, but in respect of the 2007 precedent, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, the committee reported in precisely the same way as it reported on the provisions in this Bill. It did not regard the provisions as inappropriate but said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="081118108000259"></a>&#147;We draw the disapplication to the attention of the House so that the House may satisfy itself that the alternative consultation procedure is adequate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="081118108000256"></a>Having looked at the <I>Hansard</I> record of the debates both on the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 and on the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, I can tell noble Lords that there was no objection from either of the parties opposite to those proposals when they came forward in almost exactly the same form as the proposals have come forward in respect of this Bill. Therefore, the dehybridisation provisions in this Bill have good precedents and go alongside robust local and national consultation procedures, which we believe meet the points raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="081118108000220"></a>Let me move to my fourth point, which is about why, in this context, we believe that the provisions in Amendment No. 167 are so necessary. After all the consultation that I have set out, which, as I said, could lead to two years of consideration, if an order was ruled hybrid and petitioned against, perhaps by just one interested party, that would extend the length of time needed to approve the order by as much as, on the precedents that we have studied, six months. That would not only substantially delay changes to governance arrangements that enjoyed widespread support locally and had undergone the thorough consultation process  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1094"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1094</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I have just described, but would also add considerably to the expense of bringing proposals forward, introduce uncertainty into the timing of making orders and act as a potentially significant deterrent to the use of powers provided by Part 5 in the first place.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="081118108000221"></a>This would be an especially perverse outcome, as I know that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and my noble friends wish integrated transport schemes to come forward in appropriate circumstances. They would not, I hope, wish to see a further&#151;and I would argue unnecessary&#151;duplication and complication of consultation and decision-making procedures act to dissuade authorities from coming forward with the very proposals that we are seeking to promote in the first place. For all these reasons, I venture to suggest that the proposal is sensible, proportionate and necessary if we seriously want to see effective integrated transport authorities established in our major urban areas.</p>

I welcome the moves that the Government have taken to clarify local authority rights to determine the powers that are available to any non-elected members that are co-opted on to the new integrated transport authorities following local reviews. That is a change since the Bill left this House.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="081118108000224"></a>It is absolutely right that the power should lie with the reformed ITAs to determine whether non-elected members have a voting role to play on their ITAs and what that role should be. However, there is a possibility that the powers given to the reformed integrated transport authorities under the Commons amendments before us today could, in certain limited circumstances, be abused. This issue was discussed at some length in the other place, but I am not sure that the significance of the arguments was fully taken on board.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="081118108000225"></a>I tabled my amendment because I believe that only those integrated transport authority members elected by their constituent councils can properly decide what the powers of non-elected members should be. This is in contrast with the Commons amendment, which requires that the voting members of an integrated transport authority are those that should determine the rights of non-elected members.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="081118108000226"></a>If a political group came to the conclusion that it was likely to lose power on an integrated transport authority, it might be tempted ahead of an election to ensure that it had politically sympathetic non-elected members in place and then to confer full voting rights on those non-elected members to keep it in power after the election, given that the number of non-elected members can be just below 50 per cent of the ITA membership. The voting rights conferred could include the right to determine future voting rights of those same non-elected members. That would surely be a negation of local democracy. The purpose of this amendment is to prevent that from happening by ensuring that the members appointed by the constituent councils could determine at any time the voting rights of the non-elected members.</p>

First, I ask the Minister to give us a clear statement on what is meant by &#147;political balance&#148;. Does it mean that the ITA should reflect the votes given for each party in proportion, or does it mean the political balance in each council? The two things are quite different. Secondly, is it proposed to issue any guidance to ITAs on the sort of people whom they should seek to be non-elected ITA members? Thirdly, will he give thought to creating safeguards against an outgoing administration who know that they will not win an election packing the ITA with their friends and, as it were, lumbering the incoming administration with a group of people who will not work with them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="081118108000229"></a>Amendment No. 167 is on hybridisation, which is a complicated subject. The Minister emphasised the delay that would be occasioned by coming to the Chairman of Committees, who would rule whether the governance order was hybrid. Then this House would proceed quickly through hearing an aggrieved party; it might be an authority that does not want to be part of the ITA. When such a party has the opportunity of coming to Parliament, the House of Lords would convene its Hybrid Instruments Committee. The party has to have sufficient standing; it has to be someone who is protesting not just for old times&#146; sake, but from a point of proper locus standi.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="081118108000230"></a>I take the Minister back to the passage of the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 2004, which I am certain is not at his fingertips. It was dealt with rapidly in this House. Five groups of petitioners were found to have standing, including a local authority, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, a group of individuals and two campaign groups. However, the report of the Select Committee was published two weeks after the hearings, so there was no delay in this House.</p>

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 2004 was laid before Parliament on 13 May 2004. The order was not referred to a Select Committee until 7 September because of the processes that had to be gone through. The committee began its consideration on 25 October. It sat for seven days, visited Northamptonshire on 3 November, announced its decision on 4 November and published its recommendations on 17 November. By my calculations, the time between the order being laid and the final process having been gone through is precisely six months and four days, which supports the point that I made earlier. He is referring simply to the time for which the committee itself sat, but that is only a small

The Minister will know&#151;and he will probably gain considerable experience of the way in which affirmative orders are dealt with in this place&#151;that there is usually no way that such orders ever get voted against. This procedure would allow people to have their say. Therefore, I would defend it as being superior to the affirmative procedure, which no doubt government officials would like to put in place because they like nothing better than to have everything organised. Occasionally, the interests of democracy are best served by allowing the people to approach Parliament and to have their say.</p>

Let me return to the amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser. I have been in local government for a long time and I know that there can be gerrymandering before elections. It is important that the democratic results of an election are reflected in the membership of ITAs, so I share some of the concerns expressed by the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Bradshaw. I know that this will be referred to in secondary legislation, so I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance on that point. On hybridisation, I have a lot of sympathy for what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, was saying, but I have become more confused about it as a result of the timescales that the Minister has put forward and the delays that this might cause. I, too, support the democratic process through which people have a right to present their case to us, but perhaps the Minister might clarify how he can help this situation.</p>

The Government moved Amendment No. 166 to ensure that the political balance rules that apply under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 cannot be amended or disapplied by supplementary provision in an order under Part 5. Section 15 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 sets out the principles by which appointments to bodies such as ITAs are to be governed. Among other things, the effect of this is that when political composition of the representative councils on a relevant local authority body changes, for example at a local election, the duty on those authorities is to review the membership as soon as is practicable thereafter to ensure that the principles of political balance are correctly maintained.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="081118108000235"></a>In addition, Clause 89 allows the Secretary of State to issue guidance on, among other things, the carrying out of governance reviews and the membership and  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1097"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1097</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>constitutional arrangements for ITAs. A draft of this guidance was issued in December 2007 and is currently being revised. We intend to use the guidance to underline a series of principles in relation to the appointment and granting of voting rights to non-elected members of ITAs, which meet the concerns raised by noble Lords.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="081118108000236"></a>These include, first, that where persons other than elected members have been appointed to an ITA, the elected members of that ITA should review periodically whether and on what issues the non-elected members are entitled to vote. This would apply most obviously where there have been changes to the elected membership of an ITA after local council elections. Secondly, voting rights for non-elected members can be withdrawn in appropriate circumstances as well as granted. Thirdly, any limitations on the right of appointed members of an ITA to vote and the circumstances in which the entitlement to vote might come to an end should be clearly set out in any resolution giving them an entitlement to vote.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="081118108000237"></a>In response to my noble friend Lord Rosser, I stress that the elected members of an ITA can revisit an earlier decision of theirs to grant voting rights to one or more non-elected members. That is clearly supported by Section 12 of the Interpretation Act 1978 which makes it clear in relation to powers conferred on bodies through legislation that,</p>
<ul><a name="081118108000262"></a>&#147;it is implied, unless the contrary intention appears, that the power may be exercised ... from time to time as occasion requires&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="081118108000257"></a>The clear implication is that the power for an ITA itself to confer voting rights on non-elected members is not a one-off power that, once exercised, cannot be amended or reversed. I think that meets my noble friend&#146;s concerns on the status of non-elected members and any voting rights which may be conferred on them.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="081118108000238"></a>In response to the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, on the hybridity procedures, I believe I set out the fullest possible explanation about why we regard these proposals as necessary. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, wished to be satisfied that there were good precedents for what we are doing and that we had adequate processes of consultation in place. I can reassure him on both points. The Bill already provides that there should be detailed scrutiny, both at local and national level, before any orders are made in respect of an ITA. We shall be issuing guidance on the type of consultation that will be required. The Secretary of State will have full regard to the quality and outcome of a local consultation before making any orders at national level and, of course, if proper consultation and reasonable decision-making are not observed, either at local or national level, proposals and draft orders could be subject to judicial review. That is an elaborate and very thorough process of consultation, which I believe meets the full, legitimate expectations that one can have of the decision-making process set out by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="081118108000239"></a>On the precedents, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, did not answer the points I made. There are clear precedents for this action, not only in the recent past but in the very recent past, in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, both of which  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1098"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1098</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have provisions which are almost identical to the provisions we are proposing in the Bill, and in the Local Government Act 1992, in respect of orders to change local authority boundaries and establish new authorities, a situation very similar to that in which we envisage proposals being brought forward in respect of ITAs.</p>

<a name="81118-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="081118108000240"></a>Not only are those precedents, but they are precedents of proposals which were not opposed by either of the other parties. There is a good and, to my mind, sufficient reason for bringing this proposal to the House: we do not regard it as reasonable and over and above the extensive consultation requirements before orders in respect of an ITA can be made at national and local level, that there should be a further process which could be gone through in this House. That would only duplicate previous consultation processes, delay the decision-making process and, crucially, make it less likely that proposals in respect of ITAs will come forward in the first place, which is the very purpose that this Bill seeks to serve and which, I believe, has widespread support across the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="0811196000012"></a>Amendment No. 169 relates to the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. Government policy is to encourage efficient and effective working in the highway, with works properly co-ordinated by the highway authority. Key to that is the need for the authority to be given notice of works in its highways carried out by undertakers, whether they are placing, maintaining or removing apparatus in or below the highways or consequential works&#151;for instance, carrying out a permanent reinstatement as a separate phase or works to remedy a failure to complete a reinstatement to the correct standard in the first place. All occupy the highway and impact on our crowded roads and, as I know from my one month in this job, are matters of acute concern to the public and to Members of your Lordships' House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="0811196000013"></a>Following a judgement by the Divisional Court last November, there is a lack of legal certainty about what works are required for or incidental to placing, maintaining or removing apparatus, and fall within the definition of street works. The amendment is intended to confirm the existing view and practice that &#147;street works&#148; includes reinstatement or remedial works and remove that uncertainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="0811196000014"></a>Amendment No. 170 relates to the Traffic Management Act 2004. Government policy is to encourage local authorities to take over from the police service the enforcement of parking restrictions. When a local authority does that, police resources are released for more serious matters. It also means that a single body&#151;the local authority&#151;is responsible not only for developing parking policies, but for enforcing<I></I>them. The parking components of Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 came into force on 31 March this year.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0811196000015"></a>Despite comprehensive consultation and scrutiny, it subsequently came to light that the definition of &#147;local authority&#148; in the Traffic Management Act, read with other provisions of that Act, means that shire district councils may not be able to make full use of the new enforcement powers in their off-street car parks or in relation to any free on-street parking they authorise. The anomaly has no impact in relation to enforcement by London boroughs, unitary authorities or metropolitan district councils nor does it in any way affect the enforcement of yellow bands or pay-and-display restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0811196000016"></a>Furthermore, the department considers that parking attendants appointed before 31 March under provisions of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 are unaffected by the anomaly. However, to enable shire councils to continue to enforce off-street controls and appoint sufficient numbers of parking attendants to do so,, the department also introduced temporary amending regulations under the Traffic Management Act. Provided that the amendment is accepted, the amending regulations will no longer be necessary and can be revoked.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0811196000017"></a>Amendment No. 170 makes clear in primary legislation for the long term that a shire district council has the power to appoint the civil enforcement officer who would serve the penalty charge notice to the motorist who has parked in contravention of the parking regulations in a local-authority-owned, off-street car park. Amendment No. 170 also makes minor amendments to other provisions of Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act to make sure that council waste-collection vehicles operated by non-metropolitan district councils are exempted from restrictions on double parking and parking at dropped kerbs, as originally intended under those provisions. Finally, the amendment makes it clear that guidance issued on parking will have statutory force in relation to non-metropolitan district councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="0811196000018"></a>Amendment No. 171 amends the definition of conditional offers in Section 90F of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 so that it refers also to conditional offers made by the Department for Transport&#146;s vehicle examiners in Scotland. The amendment is needed to ensure that the provisions inserted by the Road Safety Act 2006 into the Road Traffic Offenders Act work as originally intended. Unfortunately, when the Road

Unless this deficiency is corrected, it will undermine the scope for VOSA&#146;s vehicle examiners to take effective enforcement action against foreign vehicle operators while operating in Scotland. This error was only identified recently in the finalising of secondary legislation and the Local Transport Bill provided a useful opportunity to make this minor technical amendment.</p>

The follow-up report, published on 10 October 2008, analyses the responses of the Government and the judiciary to the report. The committee was chaired by the late Lord Holme of Cheltenham who is remembered by your Lordships&#146; House and by the committee with respect and gratitude, and in my own case, with great personal affection. Your Lordships&#146; committee was greatly assisted by the specialist advice of Professor Andrew Le Sueur and by the clerks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="0811196000028"></a>The report of your Lordships&#146; committee made a series of recommendations to both the Government and the judiciary. It referred to the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, and the Ministry of Justice, which was created in the course of our inquiry. It also emphasised the importance of the Lord Chancellor fulfilling his or her duty to defend the independence of the judiciary&#151;recognised by Section 3 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005&#151;by ensuring that Ministers do not impugn individual judges, and restrain and reprimand those who do. It recommended the inclusion in the <I>M</I><I>inisterial </I><I>C</I><I>ode</I> of strongly worded guidelines setting out the principles governing public comment by Ministers on individual judges.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="0811196000029"></a>Your Lordships&#146; committee was critical of the Government&#146;s handling of the creation of the Ministry of Justice and recommended a transparent process for setting the budget of Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, with appropriate judicial involvement. Other recommendations to the Government included the status of the Lord Chancellor, the involvement of the Law Officers in policy-making and legislative drafting, and the possible use of advisory declarations by the courts to rule on whether recently enacted legislation is compatible with the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="0811196000030"></a>The report also examined the judiciary&#146;s channels of communication with the media and the public, and criticised some of the media for what was seen as irresponsible coverage of judicial decisions. It concluded that the senior judiciary should act more quickly to explain judicial decisions in controversial cases, and that consideration should be given to appointing one or more spokesmen, with appropriate qualifications and legal experience, who would be permitted to speak to the media with the aim of securing coverage that accurately reflects the judgment or sentencing decision. Your Lordships&#146; committee considered the appearance of judges before Select Committees, the role of the Lord Chief Justice and his annual report, and the interaction of individual judges and the media.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="0811196000031"></a>In October 2007, the Government published their response to the report, and the Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, appeared before the committee.

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0811196000033"></a>In its report, under the heading, &#147;Ministers and Judges&#148;, the committee discussed reaction to the Sweeney case. The then Home Secretary, John Reid, attacked the minimum tariff sentence as &#147;unduly lenient&#148;. Vera Baird MP, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the DCA, also publicly criticised the sentence. Your Lordships&#146; committee found that the,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000137"></a>&#147;then Lord Chancellor, had failed to fulfil his duty to ensure that ministers do not impugn individual judges and to restrain and reprimand those who do and that the senior judiciary could&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000110"></a>and should,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000138"></a>&#147;have acted more quickly to ... the unfair press coverage that followed the sentencing decision&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000111"></a>The committee recommended that the <I>M</I><I>inisterial </I><I>C</I><I>ode </I>should be amended,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000139"></a>&#147;so that it gives clear and unambiguous guidance to ministers about how they should or should not comment about judges in public&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000112"></a>and has made a commitment to reviewing the issue after the Government next update the code.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0811196000034"></a>I shall not delay your Lordships with further debate about the creation of the Ministry of Justice. It is sufficient to say that lessons have, we hope, been learnt about involving the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice at a sufficiently early stage of the policy-making process,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000140"></a>&#147;in the event of constitutional reforms or &#145;machinery of government&#146; changes impacting ... on the judiciary&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81118-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0811196000035"></a>On Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the then Lord Chancellor, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the then Lord Chief Justice, agreed a concordat in 2004, which set out the division of responsibilities between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. Your Lordships&#146; committee expressed its concern in the follow-up report that this document had not been amended to reflect the new arrangements for Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service. I hope that the Lord President of the Council will find it possible to address this issue in her response. In the view of the committee, a practice should be established to amend the concordat whenever necessary to ensure that it remains a relevant and binding document.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0811196000036"></a>In the follow-up report, the committee recommended:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="0811196000130"></a>&#147;The posts of Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice should continue to be combined in future&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000113"></a>Again, you Lordships will wish to hear the views of the Lord President of the Council, as opinions vary greatly on this point. The follow-up report assesses issues relating to the response by the judiciary to the first report. The response by the judiciary was its first ever given to a parliamentary Select Committee and we are grateful for that.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0811196000037"></a>I turn now to the accountability of the judiciary. The committee sought to ascertain how, under the new constitutional arrangements, the judiciary could remain accountable in what one of our witnesses termed the,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000141"></a>&#147;explanatory role in the sacrificial sense&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1105"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0811196000114"></a>The committee concluded that Select Committees have an important role to play through the questioning of senior judges in public and welcomed the decision of the Judicial Executive Board that the Lord Chief Justice should lay an annual report before Parliament. The judiciary&#146;s response acknowledged the need for accountability in respect of their administrative duties, but expressed concerns about the frequency of judges&#146; appearances before Select Committees and the topics that should or should not be discussed. The committee understands these concerns, but reserves the right to call judges to give evidence whenever necessary and to ask about issues as appropriate. The position of judges will of course be respected, and speaking personally, I do not envisage any difficulties in the foreseeable future in this area.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="0811196000038"></a>Since the publication of the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s first annual report, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, and Sir Igor Judge&#151;now the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge&#151;have suggested that the Lord Chief Justice might not produce a report on a strictly annual basis. The committee believes that such a report would be an effective way for the judiciary to be accountable and hope to see it published on an annual basis.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="0811196000039"></a>I turn to communications by the judiciary. The committee assessed the way in which the judiciary communicates with the media and the public, and concluded that the Judicial Communications Office should give consideration to appointing one or more spokesmen with appropriate qualifications and legal experience who would be permitted to speak to the media with the aim of securing media coverage that reflects accurately judgments and sentencing decisions. The judiciary has now appointed five judges to act as spokesmen where appropriate.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0811196000040"></a>I turn to advisory declarations. In the report, the committee considered whether the courts could, in appropriate cases, provide greater guidance on the compatibility or otherwise of proposed or recently enacted legislation with the Human Rights Act. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, told us in oral evidence that he was open to this proposal. I hope that the Government too have an open mind on whether, in appropriate cases, seeking an advisory declaration might be beneficial. Perhaps the noble Baroness will have words to say on this.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0811196000041"></a>Finally, I wish to address relations between the judiciary and the media. The committee believes that the media, especially the popular tabloid press, all too often indulge in distorted and irresponsible coverage of the judiciary, treating judges as fair game. A responsible press should show greater restraint and desist from blaming judges for their interpretation of legislation which has been promulgated by politicians. If the media object to a judgment or a sentencing decision, the committee suggests that they focus their efforts on persuading the Government to rectify the legal and policy framework. In order to ensure more responsible reporting, the committee recommends that the Editors&#146; Code of Practice, which is enforced &#147;by the Press Complaints Commission&#148; be regularly updated to reflect these developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0811196000042"></a>In the follow-up report, the committee published correspondence with the Press Complaints Commission and the Editors&#146; Code of Practice Committee, which reviews the editors&#146; code of practice. Your Lordships&#146; committee does not seek to restrict press criticism of judges, but calls for an end to inflammatory and misleading coverage of specific judgments to which judges are not allowed to respond. In a recent article the distinguished journalist Joshua Rozenberg, whose every word merits study by everyone in Parliament, called, in this context, for the &#147;application of common sense&#148;. He did not proceed to say how rare common sense is.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0811196000043"></a>The Select Committee does not believe that the points made in reports are adequately covered by the editors&#146; code of practice and expects to see an outcome to the Editors&#146; Code of Practice Committee&#146;s deliberations that will respond to your Lordships&#146; committee&#146;s concerns. I have every confidence in the judgment and resolution of Sir Christopher Meyer, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, with whom I was at university.

We must await publication of the Government&#146;s proposals, but meanwhile I shall briefly explain where I stand on issues affecting the relations between the three branches of government.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0811192000045"></a>Many of my views were set out in my Constitutional Reform (Prerogative Powers and Civil Service etc.) Bill, which was given a Second Reading in March 2006. With expectations raised by the <I>Governance of Britain</I> Green Paper, I hoped, when agreeing to act as independent adviser, that the thrust of those proposals would find favour in a Government ambitious to move further towards a coherent and enduring constitutional settlement of the relations between the three branches of government and the individual. Instead, I am afraid that what will be offered will be weak measures, tinkering at the edges of much needed constitutional reform.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0811192000046"></a>In brief, my Bill proposed transferring the source of prerogative powers to Parliament; putting the principles governing parliamentary scrutiny of treaties and war powers on a statutory footing; defining the fundamental principles underlying appointments to, and operation of, the Civil Service; preventing special advisers from managing, directing or issuing instructions to a civil servant in the discharge of public functions; providing an express duty for civil servants and special advisers to act with honesty and integrity; giving British citizens the right to a passport and to freedom of movement to and from this country; and creating the office of Commissioner for Public Appointments to advise on appointments to some major public offices, and setting up a Parliamentary Appointments Committee to approve them.</p>

<a name="81118-0015.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0811192000047"></a>Prerogative powers are a necessary incident of government. However, as the Law Lords held in the Chagos Islanders&#146; case a couple of weeks ago, it is anomalous that the Crown is able, through the Queen&#146;s Ministers, to exercise public powers without parliamentary authority. It is an anomaly that could readily have been removed by the forthcoming Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0811192000048"></a>As a result of what happened to the Attorney-General&#146;s advice before the invasion of Iraq and the blocking of the BAE inquiry, I also hoped that the Constitutional Renewal Bill would remove the inherent conflict of interest in the office of Attorney-General, so that the chief legal adviser to the Government would not also be a serving politician and Minister. I also hoped that the Justice Secretary would abandon his attempt to seek the power to interfere with the crucial independence of the Judicial Appointments Commission by imposing targets or giving directions. The JAC is an essential guardian of judicial independence and the rule of law, and should not be given directions by the Justice Secretary. I also hoped that the Government would take the opportunity of the Constitutional Renewal Bill to strengthen human rights, at least by overruling the majority ruling of the Law Lords in the YL case that narrows the reach of the Human Rights Act in relation to private bodies exercising functions of a public nature&#151;a matter requiring urgent attention by Parliament; by including a right to good governance and administrative justice; and by including a

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="0811192000103"></a>&#147;The integrity of the legal system depends on it being properly funded ... we do urge the Lord Chancellor to ensure that it receives maximum protection from short-term budgetary pressures upon and within the new Ministry&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811192000090"></a>The right of access to courts in civil as well as criminal proceedings is a fundamental constitutional right protected by the common law and Article 6 of the convention. The Courts Service has agreed to save &#163;145 million and the tribunal system has agreed to save &#163;73 million in the next three years. These cuts are likely to impair the ability of the courts and tribunals to maintain an effective system, especially as they have a direct effect on levels of staffing and computer systems.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0811192000051"></a>The Government&#146;s full-cost recovery policy, unique in the common law world, and changes to the legal aid system do not adequately protect the right of access to justice. Changes in the funding of cases involving children at risk may mean that local authorities will not be able to afford to bring the statutory proceedings needed to protect children. The dramatic increase in fees for such cases has already led to a drop in the number of childcare cases brought by local authorities, and members of the judiciary and family lawyers have warned that this may increase the numbers in danger of suffering domestic abuse. The same applies to effective legal protection against forced marriages threatened by these funding cuts. Legal aid has already been cut for both criminal and family cases and there are rumours of further cuts for civil cases. This also seriously impedes the right of access to the courts, as does the closure of so many community law firms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0811192000052"></a>The Constitution Committee&#146;s original report published the evidence given by the editor of the <I>Daily Mail</I>, Paul Dacre, who is also chair of the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice committee. In his evidence Mr Dacre expressed his and his newspaper&#146;s hostility to the Human Rights Act because of the role it gives to the courts to protect the convention right to personal privacy.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="0811192000053"></a>Mr Dacre returned to the attack in his recent speech at the Society of Editors&#146; conference. I agree with much of what he said about the abuse of conditional fee agreements by claimants&#146; lawyers in libel cases, unnecessary restrictions on public access to freedom of information and libel tourism, but his attacks on the Human Rights Act are misconceived and unfair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="0811192000054"></a>I have acted for the press in a number of cases where the convention right to free expression&#151;now made part of our law via the Human Rights Act&#151;has been successfully used to combat unnecessary restrictions  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1109"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in English statute and common law. Yet the <I>Daily Mail</I> and some other sections of the British media have been unremitting in their daily attacks on the Human Rights Act because of their opposition to any legal restraints on excessive media intrusion. They do not give credit to the judiciary for the careful way in which it has interpreted and applied convention rights, and they do not accept that a fair balance has to be struck between the right to free expression, the right to a good reputation and the right to personal privacy. They do not recognise that even in the United States&#151;the land of the First Amendment&#151;there are effective legal safeguards of personal privacy, or that the Human Rights Act, and its specific recognition of the paramount importance of freedom of expression, gives them and the public necessary protection. They attack the British judiciary whose decisions are more favourable to free speech than some recent and troubling decisions of the Strasbourg Court. They do not understand that, without the constitutional protection given by the Human Rights Act, the threat to freedom of expression would significantly increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="0811192000055"></a>I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, on her appointment as chair of the Press Complaints Commission, and hope that she will be able to convince Mr Dacre and others of the need to make the PCC stronger and independent, and to make self-regulation more effective in deterring abuse and giving effective remedies. If she is unable to do so, a future Parliament will surely intervene and the outcome may not be what Mr Dacre or I would welcome.</p>

In the two weeks since my introduction, I have spent a lot of time listening, watching and, indeed, eating in this House. I am very grateful to noble Lords for the warmth and the generosity of the welcome that I have received and I am extremely grateful to all members of staff for the considerable help that they have given me.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="0811192000057"></a>I am particularly pleased to be speaking in this House on the important subject of the relationship between the Executive, the judiciary and Parliament. I declare an interest. For the past 28 years I have practised as a barrister. My first case was not a success; my client was hanged. He was a drug trafficker from Singapore whose appeal was dismissed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. My record could only improve after that.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="0811192000058"></a>I mention that first case because in it, as in many others thereafter, I had the very good fortune to be junior counsel led by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. Therefore, it is appropriate that I should follow him in this debate. I thank him for his kind words about me. Over the years, I have heard in court almost as many excellent speeches by the noble Lord as have been heard in this House, although the speeches that I have previously heard from him have occurred rather earlier in the day.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="0811192000059"></a>In the past 20 years I have frequently appeared in court defending Ministers, sometimes successfully, against allegations that they have acted unlawfully. I want to make four points arising out of the excellent reports of your Lordships&#146; committee that we are debating tonight.  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1110"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The first is that my experience of representing Ministers is that, with very rare exceptions, they respect the independence of the judiciary and recognise the importance of doing nothing to undermine the rule of law. They seek advice on the legality of their conduct, they follow it and they take their legal medicine, even when courts find that they have acted in an unlawful manner. Section 3 of the Constitutional Reform Act imposes a duty on all Ministers of the Crown, not just the Lord Chancellor, to,</p>
<ul><a name="0811192000110"></a>&#147;uphold the continued independence of the judiciary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811192000091"></a>In my experience, with very rare exceptions, Ministers understand that and comply.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="0811192000060"></a>My second point is that there is nevertheless a tension between Ministers and judges. That is inevitable. Judges are deciding the legality of policy issues of great importance and sensitivity. Every Government of recent times have experienced unwelcome defeats in court that have caused disappointment and concern to Ministers; there is nothing new about this. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, wrote about his experience in the 1970s as Treasury devil, or Crown counsel. Burnt on his heart, as the noble and learned Lord described it, were the names Laker, Tameside and Crossman&#151;a few of his defeats when acting for the Government in politically controversial cases. It is inevitable that these disagreements between judges and Ministers will arise and it is inevitable that they will cause tension. The only societies in which there are no tensions between judges and Ministers are those where the Government always get their way.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="0811192000061"></a>Some years ago, I acted for a foreign Government involved in litigation in the English courts. One of its representatives asked me, before the court case, whether it was true that the Government of this country were intervening in the legal proceedings to support my client, the foreign Government. I confirmed that this was so: yes, the British Government were intervening to support the foreign Government. How, then, could it be, I was asked, that I was worried about our chances of success in court?</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="0811192000062"></a>In a free society, tensions between the judiciary and the Executive are a confirmation of the vibrancy and vigour of the rule of law. Government and judges must, of course, have mutual respect for the distinct and valuable constitutional roles that each of them is performing. However, in a free society, government and judges will not, and cannot, always see eye to eye.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="0811192000063"></a>My third point concerns ministerial criticism of judicial decisions. Of course, I agree with the powerful criticisms made by your Lordships&#146; committee of the inappropriate comments made by the then Home Secretary on the Craig Sweeney case. I also agree that Ministers should be slow to comment on judicial decisions, particularly decisions involving government departments. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, said as Lord Chancellor in 2003:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="0811192000104"></a>&#147;Maturity requires that when you get a decision that favours you, you do not clap. And when you get one that goes against you, you don&#146;t boo&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811192000092"></a>Those were wise words, in my view. The noble and learned Lord&#146;s comments were widely understood as a well deserved rebuke for the then Home Secretary&#146;s criticisms of judges who had ruled against the Government on asylum law.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1111"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="0811192000064"></a>But noble Lords will not wish to suggest that Ministers may never express a criticism of judicial decisions, however well reasoned and well informed the criticism may be and however moderate the language in which the criticism is expressed. Ministers, by reason of their constitutional position, have a special responsibility to ensure that any criticism by them of judicial decisions is well reasoned and expressed in moderate language, but I do not think that judges should be protected, need to be protected or indeed want to be protected from well informed criticism by politicians or from anyone else. Ministers should not be placed in a special class of disadvantaged persons unable to comment critically on judicial decisions. Indeed, given their responsibilities, Ministers will sometimes need to comment critically on judicial decisions to explain why they are bringing an appeal or considering a change in the law.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="0811192000065"></a>My fourth and final point concerns the means by which ill informed criticism of judges should be answered. Good judges welcome constructive criticism, but every so often judges are subjected to unjustified criticism, which may, unless answered, damage the reputation of the judiciary. A recent example was the well publicised speech given last week by Mr Paul Dacre, the editor of the <I>Daily Mail</I>, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. Mr Dacre accused Mr Justice Eady of,</p>
<ul><a name="0811192000111"></a>&#147;an animus against the popular press&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811192000093"></a>Mr Dacre suggested that the judge had created a privacy law,</p>
<ul><a name="0811192000112"></a>&#147;with a stroke of his pen&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0811192000094"></a>by &#147;arrogant and amoral judgments&#148;.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="0811192000066"></a>Noble Lords will, I am sure, agree that there was no justification whatever for these personalised criticisms of Mr Justice Eady, who was performing his duty to apply the Human Rights Act, which includes a legal right to the protection of private life. Now is not the time to debate the merits of a law protecting privacy. I should declare an interest on that topic, as I act for Mr Max Mosley in relation to a pending application in the European Court of Human Rights. However, the right to privacy has been developed not by Mr Justice Eady, but by the Court of Appeal and by the Appellate Committee of this House in a number of recent cases.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="0811192000067"></a>How, then, is the judiciary to respond to ill informed criticism? Most judges are understandably unwilling to enter into a public debate with their detractors, so who is to respond on their behalf? I would welcome the views of Leader of the House on whether the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice sees it as his responsibility to respond to criticisms of judges such as those from Mr Dacre.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="0811192000068"></a>I well understand the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor for rebuking any of his colleagues in government who make ill informed or abusive attacks on the judiciary. However, I have concerns about an independent judiciary relying and being seen to rely on a government Minister to defend judges from unjustified criticism. An independent judiciary should, where necessary, be seen to defend itself. I therefore welcome the support given in the report of your Lordships&#146; committee to the role of the Judicial Communications Office in providing judicial spokesmen to respond to criticism. I hope that, when necessary  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and appropriate, there will be senior members of the judiciary able and willing urgently to communicate a judicial and judicious response to ill informed criticism which may, unless answered, damage the judiciary&#146;s reputation.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="0811192000069"></a>In conclusion, judges have a very difficult job to perform. It is, of course, not a simple &#147;Strictly Come Dancing&#148; approach of marking a performance and making a few comments of an insulting nature. Judges are all too well aware of the unreliability and inconsistency of the evidence that they hear in court, the lack of clarity in the laws that they apply and the conflict in the competing values that they need to uphold. Judges know above all that people&#146;s lives may depend on their judgments. Should this child be taken away from his parents? Should this woman be deported to a country where she fears persecution? What rulings should be made in this criminal trial that may result in the defendant spending years in prison? We are fortunate in this country in the quality of the judiciary that makes these difficult and important decisions. An independent judiciary should not be shy about responding to ill informed and damaging criticism.</p>

This debate is clearly tailor-made for someone with such great experience in the law. We have already heard about some of that experience from the noble Lord, Lord Lester. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, touched upon, he was called to the Bar in 1979 and served as a deputy High Court judge. He is well known for appearing in some of the leading cases of recent years, one or two of which he has already alluded to. He is also well known for his erudite and informative column in the law section of the <I>Times</I>. I declare an interest as a regular reader. I speak for the whole House when I say that we look forward immensely to his contributions to future debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="0811192000071"></a>I add my congratulations to the Constitution Committee on producing this report. I speak as someone who was not a member of the Committee at the time of the main inquiry, although I was a member when it published its follow-up report.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="0811192000072"></a>The relationship of the judiciary to the Executive and Parliament has changed dramatically over the past four decades. Our membership of the European communities created a new judicial dimension to our constitutional arrangements. As the Constitution Committee report makes clear, that judicial dimension has been reinforced by the Human Rights Act. These changes have thrust the courts into a new role, one not of their own choosing but imposed upon them by Parliament. I entirely take the point that we should not be criticising the courts for doing the very thing that we, as Parliament, require them to do. To the European Communities Act and the Human Rights Act we must now add the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. That has produced and will produce important changes in how the judiciary operates in this country. We are therefore dealing with a dynamic situation. It is important that we are able to make sense of the complex dynamics at work.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1113"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="0811192000073"></a>The Constitution Committee addresses the changing landscape from the perspective of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Those it rightly recognises as core constitutional principles. Its recommendations flow from its focus on those principles. Those recommendations are appropriate and, as is clear from the Government&#146;s response and developments since the report was published, have helped to shape the debate about the relationship of the judiciary to Parliament and the Executive.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="0811192000074"></a>I would pose a broader starting point, which is to identify the constitutional framework that we want for the United Kingdom. Once we have determined that, we can locate the role of the courts within it, otherwise we have a judiciary that is being given new roles as a consequence of implementing disparate policy goals. It is moving in new directions without us being clear as to the eventual destination. We need to be clear as to the intended constitutional end-point, otherwise where we end up is determined by a series of disparate and discrete changes, each justified on its own merits but not related to a wider view of where we should be going. I therefore believe that there is a case for establishing a royal commission on the constitution, to look holistically at our constitutional arrangements. I shall return to that on a later occasion. The report before us will make a significant contribution to such a study.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="0811192000075"></a>In analysing and influencing what is happening, the report makes a weighty contribution. In particular, it helps to identify and influence the way in which the judiciary has adapted to implementation of the Human Rights Act and the Constitutional Reform Act. Taken together, those two Acts have placed the judiciary in a difficult and exposed position. The courts are vested with responsibility for interpreting and applying the 1998 Act. The nature of convention rights offers scope for interpretation on important measures of public policy. Cases in which the Act has been engaged have been relatively few in number but some have been extremely high profile and contentious, not least in respect of privacy and anti-terrorist legislation. The courts have been subject to criticism as a result, from both journalists and Ministers, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, explained.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="0811192000076"></a>The judiciary will be even more exposed as a result of the designation of a Supreme Court and its location away from the Palace of Westminster. The current position is that the Law Lords do not participate in legislative deliberations&#151;there is separation in this House between the judicial and legislative parts&#151;but they observe what goes on. They have an appreciation of the parliamentary process. Conversely, the Members of this House have some appreciation of the work and quality of the Law Lords. The House is able to operate as something of a buffer between the Law Lords and the Executive. Once the court moves across the road and, more especially, in time, as current Law Lords are replaced by judges who have no experience of this House, the advantage will be lost. We may even witness clashes between Parliament and the courts, in part because of the Acts of 1998 and 2005, but also because of the decisions of the courts to look not only at the parliamentary record in case of ambiguity but at why Parliament enacted a measure to determine compatibility  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1114"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with convention rights. I believe the Wilson case in 2003 to be even more important than Pepper v Hart for its implications for the relationship between the courts and Parliament.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="0811192000077"></a>The changes thus create the potential for conflict. That is where the report comes into play and has proved extremely valuable. How are the courts to adapt to the new situation? How is a constructive relationship with Parliament to be achieved? The committee has done a valuable job in identifying not only what the responsibilities of Ministers should be, but how judges may be accountable to Parliament without Parliament itself encroaching on judicial independence. One of the findings of the Constitution Committee in its report <I>The Regulatory State: Ensuring its Accountability</I> was that independence and accountability do not necessarily conflict with one another.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="0811192000078"></a>I therefore see no insuperable problems deriving from the committee's recommendations covering the relationship of Parliament and the judiciary. The report was published over a year ago, and we already see some of its proposals beginning to bear fruit, not least the recommendations for an annual report and for the Lord Chief Justice to appear each year before the Constitution Committee. Though the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips, said, as my noble friend has mentioned, that he did not want to bind his successor by committing to an annual report, he did produce a weighty and informative report earlier this year that sets an admirable standard for his successor to emulate, all being well, on an annual basis.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="0811192000079"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips, has appeared before the committee, accompanied on the last occasion by his successor, Sir Igor Judge, now the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge. Those meetings have established that it is possible to discuss issues of general concern without going into the merits of particular cases, and to do so in a way that is beneficial to the judiciary and to Parliament. I believe that this is apparent from the committee's follow-up report, not only in its content but in the fact that it embodies, as my noble friend mentioned, the first response from the judiciary to a Select Committee report. This form of engagement may serve to indicate to members of the judiciary that appearing before a Select Committee may be appropriate in certain circumstances, in the way suggested in the report.</p>

<a name="81118-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="0811192000080"></a>We are thus seeing a relationship form between Parliament and the judiciary that maintains the independence of the judiciary while allowing it to discuss with Parliament matters affecting the administration of justice. That engagement needs to be measured and transparent. The initial experience is positive, and I pay tribute to the committee both for its report and for pursuing it in the way that it has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="0811192000081"></a>The proposal for written representations from the Lord Chief Justice, under Section 5 of the 2005 Act, to be published in <I>Hansard</I> and then debated, with a response from government as quickly as possible, is a sensible one. It received a welcome from the judiciary, and I note the Government's commitment to endeavour  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1115"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to respond in good time to such representations&#151;though it may have been even better had the words &#147;to endeavour&#148; been omitted.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="0811192000082"></a>The only other recommendation I wish to touch upon&#151;and it will come as no surprise to the noble Baroness the Leader of the House&#151;is that concerning post-legislative scrutiny. The report discusses it in the context of judicial interpretation of parliamentary legislation in particular contexts. The Government in their response noted that the courts would be under no obligation to consider a Select Committee's views in relation to interpretation. I accept that, but I doubt if this is what the committee had in mind. Judicial interpretation is relevant where it has an effect on the implementation of legislation and thus can be taken into account in evaluating whether a measure has achieved its intended purpose.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="0811192000083"></a>Since the Government's response to the report was published, they have published their paper on post-legislative scrutiny, which is very welcome and a great step forward, although I believe that a dedicated committee on the subject is needed, as recommended by the Law Commission. As the noble Baroness the Leader of the House will be aware, I think it is desirable for the House to debate the Government's paper and, indeed, the Law Commission's recommendation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="0811192000084"></a>I revert to my earlier observation. There is a need to look at our constitutional arrangements holistically. The role of the judiciary has to be set within a clear view of what we expect it to do within our constitution. We need to look at this from the top down and not simply from the bottom up. This report is extremely welcome; I believe it has already proved its worth. We need to build on it in looking at the type of constitutional framework we think is appropriate for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="0811196000047"></a>Looking round the House this evening, I feel as though I am the Daniel in a den of legal minds, which puts me in the embarrassing position of being the novice or the lay man. In that capacity, I shall do my best to pick up one or two points that seem to me, as the non-expert, to be important and I shall reflect some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Norton, about the need for a more holistic approach to questions raised by the committee in its reports. In doing so, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and his colleagues on the Constitution Committee. I was delighted that he made mention of our late and much lamented friend Richard Holme.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="0811196000048"></a>This debate comes at a salient moment, because we are due to consider a constitutional renewal Bill in the new Session. The noble Lord, Lord Norton, my noble friend Lord Maclennan and I have been sitting on a Joint Committee conducting pre-legislative scrutiny on that Bill. It is significant that some of the issues that have been raised this evening have reappeared  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1116"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already in draft form, but perhaps not in as satisfactory a form as we had hoped. A number of colleagues on that committee and I filed a minority report on the role of the Attorney-General, to which I shall refer.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="0811196000049"></a>The reports before us this evening touch on the ministerial code. I certainly agree that Ministers should keep their sabre-rattling to a more muted tone than they have in the recent past. Frankly, irresponsible, headline-grabbing soundbites such as those made by Dr Reid or Mr Blunkett, designed to play to the Murdoch media gallery, should be consigned to the previous era of spin over substance.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="0811196000050"></a>In evidence to the committee, the Lord Chancellor pointed out how important that restraint was for him. The fact that he recognised that is very healthy, given that he is the first Lord Chancellor to sit in the Commons. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said, his discipline is shared with other Ministers. Section 3(1) of the Constitutional Reform Act states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="0811196000131"></a>&#147;The Lord Chancellor, other Ministers of the Crown and all with responsibility for matters relating to the judiciary or otherwise to the administration of justice must uphold the continued independence of the judiciary&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81118-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="0811196000051"></a>There is also the broader question of how the ministerial code is determined and enforced. Again, the committee has given us helpful advice. It surely cannot be satisfactory that the code under which Ministers of the Crown conduct themselves is solely in the gift of the Prime Minister, like a sort of headmaster&#146;s rule book, and that Parliament has no role in scrutinising its principles or agreeing its content.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="0811196000052"></a>A separate but related issue is not just how Ministers conduct themselves, but how Prime Ministers behave when they decide, at a stroke, to reorganise the way in which government works. That was true with the Ministry of Justice, but that was not the first occasion on which there was a dramatic change to the architecture of Whitehall without any reference to Parliament. It is important that, in future, we should consider carefully how major changes to the responsibilities of government departments are put in place and ensure that they are justified and scrutinised here in Westminster. Frankly, Friday afternoon changes by press release, sometimes even during recess, are no substitute for effective parliamentary scrutiny. It is clear that new mechanisms to make the process more rational would not just be an unhelpful roadblock for the Prime Minister of the day but might help him to get the changes right at first attempt.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="0811196000053"></a>No one can seriously believe that the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor would have been left in the dark about the creation of the Ministry of Justice if those matters were not drawn up on the back of Downing Street envelopes. Very often, I fear, the architecture of governance has become a game of musical chairs&#151;how do we move individuals around within the Cabinet?&#151;rather than about ensuring that the way in which departments are given responsibilities is logical, rational and well examined by Parliament. You cannot knock down a terraced house without other houses in the row being affected and Prime Ministers cannot simply demolish the operation of one department without it fundamentally affecting others.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="0811196000054"></a>Similarly, as the reports have indicated, the fundamentally important relationship between the Executive and the judiciary should not be the exclusive province of either or both together to agree. There is a role for Parliament here, just as there is in endorsing the ministerial code. The committee&#146;s report uses fairly typical &#147;committee-ese&#148; in recommending,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000142"></a>&#147;that consideration be given to introducing a formal mechanism for laying revised versions of the Concordat before Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000055"></a>I hope that the Leader of the House will this evening be able to respond rather more formidably and forcefully to that recommendation.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="0811196000056"></a>The committee repeats and endorses the view of the Lord Chief Justice, who has warm words for our present Lord Chancellor. Indeed, I think that this House and another place believe that Jack Straw has proved himself a deft&#151;and even rather crafty&#151;political operator in respect of constitutional reform. His evidence to the committee shows that he takes his role in that respect, and in relation to the judiciary, very seriously. The combination of his responsibilities with those of the Secretary of State for Justice&#151;again covered by the work of the committee&#151;appears to work well with him. Whether it would always work well, with another individual of less capacity or experience, is something that we should be concerned about.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="0811196000057"></a>Paragraph 20 of the follow-up report raises the important issue of whether judges should appear before Select Committees and how they should do so. There is an important issue here about the separation of powers. I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Norton, and I entirely agree about the need for a written constitution, but if we were writing a constitution for anywhere else in the world&#151;as, indeed, British jurists have&#151;the separation of powers between the judiciary, the legislature and the Executive would be an absolutely fundamental principle. Making judges in any way answerable to a Select Committee seems a step too far. I think that the balance is right in the committee&#146;s report, but it is still something that we should be careful about.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="0811196000058"></a>Similarly, I note the comments about the code of practice for editors in paragraph 33. I would regret Parliament going too far down the road of instructing how editors should regulate themselves. That seems to be the sort of censorship that other countries have suffered from and to which, perhaps, the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, was referring. I have been a journalist and, frankly, what editor is not going to use a quote like that given by David Blunkett when he was Home Secretary? He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="0811196000132"></a>&#147;I just want judges that live in the same real world as the rest of us&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000059"></a>By legitimising that sort of wording, Home Secretaries and other Ministers are giving the media, particularly the tabloid media, opportunities that they will inevitably take. There are plenty of other examples. If it were not so late, I could report several such instances involving previous Home Secretaries. Dr John Reid learnt much at the feet of his predecessors.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="0811196000060"></a>Where do we go from here? The Joint Committee on the Draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, on which I sat with my noble friend Lord Maclennan and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, was clear in  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chapter 8 of its report that the draft Bill did not meet the expectations raised by the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement in July 2007, the Green Paper that followed it and even the White Paper that followed that. Although it would not be appropriate at this hour to quote in extenso from chapter 8, I hope that the Leader of the House will be prepared to take back to her colleagues the strong view of the Joint Committee that the very narrow scope of the draft Bill did not fulfil the hope and expectations that the Prime Minister raised in his original Statement on constitutional reform. Uniquely, I think, both Houses and Members of all parties were unanimous in this. Specifically, The Prime Minister said that it was necessary for Parliament to be given a much wider role in controlling the work of the Executive and holding Ministers to account. Frankly, the draft Bill does not do that. There are strong comments to that effect not only in chapter 8 but throughout the report.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="0811196000061"></a>I referred earlier to the role of Attorney-General. Colleagues from all parties and I submitted what was, effectively, a minority report. Again, I am not going to quote from it at length, as that would not be appropriate. We started from the premise that the Prime Minister was right when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="0811196000133"></a>&#147;The role of Attorney-General, which combines legal and ministerial functions, needs to change&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/7/07; col. 817.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000115"></a>He said that, not the committee. It was in his first Statement on the important issue of constitutional renewal. The primary colours in those bold words had faded to a murky grey by the time we reached the draft Bill.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="0811196000062"></a>Anyone who thinks that this problem has gone away should read the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, about the advice given by the then Attorney-General on the war in Iraq. I regret that it was not possible for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, to be with us this evening; I was not aware of that until the debate started. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="0811196000134"></a>&#147;If I am right that the invasion of Iraq by the US, the UK and some other states was unauthorised by the Security Council, there was, of course, a serious violation of international law and of the rule of law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81118-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="0811196000063"></a>The reports are extremely interesting, but the interrogation of the present Lord Chancellor by the committee on 23 October 2007 was even more interesting. I read it again this evening; one of the advantages of starting rather late is that one gets an opportunity to read all the evidence. In his evidence in that appearance before the committee, Mr Jack Straw said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000143"></a>&#147;the Prime Minister thought&#151;and so did Baroness Scotland&#151;that it was sensible to try to ensure that there was stronger protection for that role&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000116"></a>the role of Attorney-General&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000144"></a>&#147;and maybe in some respects to separate the role or to make it clearer&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000117"></a>That is strong stuff, but the fact is that, as the draft Bill is constituted, that is not likely to happen.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="0811196000064"></a>When the Queen&#146;s Speech takes place in a couple of weeks&#146; time and when, in due course, the Government publish their Bill, I hope that they will look carefully  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at the recommendations of the Joint Committee, but I hope that they will also think carefully about what Mr Straw said to the committee at that hearing. I refer to his answer to question 10, in which he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000145"></a>&#147;fundamental to the operation of the Rule of Law within a democracy is that there should be an understanding about the separation of powers and particularly the separation between the Executive and the Legislature on the one hand and the Judiciary on the other hand, and a mutual respect about the different roles that each has. That therefore requires there to be a responsibility on politicians, those in the Executive and Legislature&#151;and of course in our system we are all mixed up&#151;to respect the role of the courts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000118"></a>The Joint Committee strongly recommended broadening the Long Title of the draft Bill, and it seems that Mr Straw intended that all along. I hope that the noble Baroness the Leader of the House will be able to give us an undertaking that some of the concerns expressed in this House, by our committee and during this debate, as well as by the Joint Committee, will be taken into account.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="0811196000065"></a>Lord Holme, who was then in the chair, said to Mr Straw:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="0811196000135"></a>&#147;So you see it as a positive advantage that it is a portmanteau Bill and people can put other things in the portmanteau?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000119"></a>Mr Straw replied simply: &#147;I do&#148;. It is not often that a senior Minister gives an answer as specific or as brief as that. I hope that the Government will now respond not just to the Constitutional Committee&#146;s reports but to that of the Joint Committee looking at the draft Bill.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="0811196000066"></a>My noble friend Lord Lester, who has done such pioneering work on the royal prerogative, will have a great deal to contribute to that portmanteau. So will other Members of your Lordships&#146; House, not least the noble Lords, Lord Pannick and Lord Norton, who have made such sensible contributions to this debate. If we do not take that opportunity, not just the work of our committee but all the preparations since the very moment that the Prime Minister indicated the priority that he was going to give to constitutional renewal will be wasted.</p>

It has been made a memorable debate by the outstanding maiden speech by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, whose presence in this House adds not just great experience of the interrelationship of the judiciary and Parliament but great wisdom and sensitivity, which was reflected in the four points he wanted to make in the relatively short time available.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="0811196000068"></a>The noble Lord was right to say that tension between Ministers and judges is inevitable, as he was right to point out that sometimes criticism of judges is appropriate, provided that it is delivered in a reasoned way with measured language. The tone of his contribution was immensely encouraging and we very much look forward to hearing from him again. The thrust of our interest in this place in constitutional reform and the acceleration of the consideration of such matters is something that will no doubt bring him back on a number of occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="0811196000069"></a>It is appropriate to express the warmest appreciation to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and his committee and to remember with gratitude the role played by my late friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham. The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, refreshed our recollection of the outstandingly important points in the report. I would not presume at this hour to rehearse the main issues that it lighted on. Rather, I shall confine my remarks to one or two points of interest. I am grateful to the committee for having raised them; I may have a slightly different emphasis in animadverting about them.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="0811196000070"></a>One of the greatest achievements of the committee may be to have induced agreement that there should be an annual report from the Lord Chief Justice. There must be&#151;notwithstanding the independence of the judiciary, which Parliament must respect&#151;an interface between Parliament and the judiciary, and that is best handled in this way, with the considered deliberations of the judiciary expressed by the Lord Chief Justice, especially with regard to issues of management and budgetary concerns. Those are entirely proper issues for Parliament to consider. It is also right that they should be discussed in advance of determinations being made.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="0811196000071"></a>I note the criticisms made about the creation of the Ministry of Justice without much prior deliberation, but these matters have led to the valuable framework document, which will bring together the responsible Minister and the head of the judiciary. Here I slightly disagree with the committee report. That document has to a considerable extent been overtaken by the concordat set out in 2004 during the passage of the Constitutional Reform Act. That document&#151;although an important historical document, and one that set out the understanding of the Minister, the Lord Chancellor of the day, who was responsible for the proposed reform, and of the judiciary as to how it might operate in practice, and some of the fundamental values and principles to be supported by the legislation&#151;is none the less an historical document. It is a document which is of value in that context but I doubt whether it makes sense to treat it as though it were some sort of statutory instrument which needs to be revised if there are changes of political emphasis. If there are such changes, it is of course desirable that they should be made explicit so that they can be discussed, but it should not be seen as a kind of fundamental law governing the relations between the Executive and the judiciary.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="0811196000072"></a>My noble friend Lord Lester in his comprehensive speech raised a number of extremely important issues, not least his reflections on the prerogative powers. These are matters which, as my noble friend Lord Tyler mentioned, will be reviewed again if the Government bring forward their Constitutional Renewal Bill in anything like the form considered by the Joint Committee prior to the Summer Recess. There will be other opportunities for deliberating on these matters but I wish to say how strongly I support the view of my noble friend that the prerogative powers should be drawn from Parliament and based on statute. There was a clear watering-down of the Prime Minister&#146;s initial statement expressed so eloquently in his Green Paper on the role of Parliament, particularly in respect of the prerogative powers, which was not  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1121"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>welcome. I hope that matter has been reviewed in the light of the consideration given by the Joint Committee.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="0811196000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton, as we might expect from such a thoughtful Member of the House, raised the remarkably interesting question of the need for an agreed constitutional framework in which the relationships between the Executive, Parliament and the judiciary can be developed. I was not entirely certain that he was suggesting that a written constitution is the answer, though my personal view is that the kind of discussion that he proposed, led by a royal commission, might very well point in that direction. In so far as we have two major constitutional matrices&#151;the European Communities legislation and the Human Rights Act which now cover a major part of our constitutional provision&#151;it would not be such a departure from British tradition to move a few steps further in that direction.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="0811196000074"></a>One step further which I would not welcome, however, is the proposed Bill on rights and duties to sit beside the Human Rights Act. My noble friend Lord Lester, in a charitable spirit as one would expect, expressed the view that if such a piece of legislation was proposed, it might assist in clarifying areas of uncertainty. I hope I do not misrepresent him. In the sphere of human rights the drafting by those distinguished British lawyers and politicians of the original European convention was very apt. Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, I believe, was one of them&#151;a Member of the Conservative Government and subsequently Lord Chancellor. It is worth saying that these rights are expressed in the broadest and most general terms, and that their effectiveness in protecting the citizen depends on the wise judiciary applying the jurisprudence that has grown over the 50 years of their existence, both in Strasbourg and now more recently in our own country. Parliament would not necessarily find it an easy task to define these matters, the application of the principles of which may well be best left to the judiciary.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="0811196000075"></a>I fear that the complexities of seeking to embody aspirations for a law of privacy in a separate law might have a contrary effect to the one intended. The balance between freedom of expression and privacy is clearly contained in the convention, and in the Human Rights Act as a result, and no amount of distortion by such witty and amusing writers and speakers as Mr Paul Dacre can or should be allowed to detract from the power of the courts to apply these things. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, for reminding us of the extent to which the Court of Appeal and others have considered these issues; they have not been decided entirely by one judge, who was the butt of the attack by the editor of the <I>Daily Mail</I> in his speech to the Society of Editors.</p>

<a name="81118-0017.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="0811196000076"></a>It is worth putting on to the record of our proceedings two statements made by Paul Dacre in that speech. First, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000146"></a>&#147;no day is too busy or too short not to find time to tweak the noses of the liberalocracy which effectively run Britain&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000120"></a>Secondly, he drew attention to what he described as,</p>
<ul><a name="0811196000147"></a>&#147;the sheer bloody mischief that is the chemistry of any good paper&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="0811196000077"></a>It is also worth noting that Mr Paul Dacre, in his remarks about human rights and about privacy in particular, rather candidly expressed an opinion that may offset some of his criticisms of the judge. After praising the press for its role in public shaming&#151;and, as it were, in setting standards&#151;he went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="0811196000136"></a>&#147;Put another way, if mass-circulation newspapers ... don&#146;t have the freedom to write about scandal, I doubt whether they will retain their mass circulations with the obvious worrying implications for the democratic process&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811196000122"></a>It seems to me that that consideration was very much at the front of his mind when he delivered that speech, and I am bound to say that I cannot see that all journalists regard the peddling of scandal as a necessary duty to retain the freedom of the press and its role in our democratic processes.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="0811196000078"></a>This debate has been valuable, not least for giving wider attention to an important and valuable report. Some of its recommendations have already been acted on, and I hope that we will continue to hear more from the Constitution Committee about these matters.</p>

Equally, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, on his memorable maiden speech and echo everything that has been said about it by other noble Lords.

<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="0811196000080"></a>Three initiatives have influenced the relationship between the Executive, the judiciary and the legislature since the Government came to power in 1997: the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, and the amalgamation of the office of the Lord Chancellor with that of the newly created Secretary of State for Justice in 2007.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="0811196000081"></a>I do not propose to say very much about the impact of the Human Rights Act, partly because we are very late and partly because your Lordships will have an opportunity to consider precisely that matter in the debate scheduled for next Monday. I will simply underline the importance of two generally accepted, indeed obvious, features. First, there is little doubt that the courts are making more searching analyses of the exercise of executive discretion than hitherto as a consequence of applying convention principles to government decision-making. Secondly, judicial reasoning by reference to the articles of the convention gives the impression that the judges are acting independently of, and above, Parliament. Hitherto, whenever a court quashed a judicial decision, it always did so by construing an Act of Parliament and concluding that their judgment was what Parliament really intended. For both those reasons, the courts are often described as encroaching on territory hitherto occupied by the Executive and Parliament, thus justifying, according to the fourth estate, their heightened profile in the media. That is a fact that the judiciary will have to accept.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="0811196000082"></a>The decision to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor in June 2003 and, having failed to achieve that objective, the decision to amalgamate it with a newly established Ministry of Justice in June 2007, were made without any prior consultation with Parliament or the judiciary. The Select Committee is rightly scathing about this.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="0811196000083"></a>Neither change, I should add, was inspired or foreshadowed by any form of constitutional analysis in government. Just as the removal of the Lord Chancellor was motivated by the desire to get rid of someone&#151; Mr Blair did not have the courage to fire the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, so he sought to make him redundant&#151;so the creation of the Ministry of Justice in 2007 was motivated by Mr Reid&#146;s desire to get rid of something, a responsibility he no longer wished to face up to; namely, the appalling state of prisons and the Prison Service.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="0811196000084"></a>In its subsequent legislative quest to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor, the Government totally failed. Some of the changes proposed in the Bill they advanced were long accepted as necessary, such as removing the right of the Lord Chancellor to sit as a judge and making the judicial selection process more transparent. Of much more significance is the way in which the legislature extended and strengthened the Lord Chancellor&#146;s role in protecting our judges and preserving the rule of law. As a result, the Lord Chancellor emerges as, at least potentially, a more powerful figure constitutionally than hitherto.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="0811196000085"></a>Before the Act, the only protection for judges lay in the centuries-old statutory provision that High Court judges and above could be dismissed only by an Address of both Houses of Parliament. This guaranteed the independence of individual judges against arbitrary dismissal by the Executive; however, it did no more than that. Since 2005, however, the Lord Chancellor has been responsible for protecting the independence of the judiciary as a whole from any form of political interference, including from within the Cabinet itself, and he is provided with statutory powers to do so. Moreover, the constitutional convention, hitherto applied unevenly by successive Lord Chancellors, that the Lord Chancellor is the guardian of the rule of law, is now enshrined in the 2005 Act. Accordingly, the Lord Chancellor is now under a statutory duty to ensure that draft parliamentary legislation and executive decision-making in Cabinet reflect the rule of law. These new statutory duties are now expressly enshrined by Section 17 of the 2005 Act in the text of the oath that the Lord Chancellor is required to take before assuming office. In the light of these powers and responsibilities, it is hard to understand how the events surrounding the Sweeney case were allowed to develop in the way they did.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="0811196000086"></a>Since June 2007, the office of Lord Chancellor has been merged with the newly established Ministry of Justice. The present incumbent, the right honourable gentleman Mr Jack Straw, enjoys good relations with the judiciary and, as the committee observes, some progress is being made in immunising the courts budget from the depredations of other spending departments. However, I wonder whether such an amalgamation is constitutionally desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"></a><a name="0811196000087"></a>Criminal justice decision-making is highly sensitive to popular opinion. As the policy-making Minister, the Lord Chancellor is subject to myriad, often inconsistent spending, sentencing and legislative demands to which he must respond, and all of which are themselves capable of conflicting with his duties under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. For example, in the design and application of criminal justice legislation, legislation which is at the intersection of state power and individual rights, the Lord Chancellor is the target of many judicial reviews, bringing him into conflict with the judiciary, with whom he has a legion of obligations to co-operate, and undermining his status as the individual with responsibility for upholding the rule of law by constantly being sued for the alleged breach of it.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="0811196000088"></a>The responsibilities of a Lord Chancellor, I suggest, are not those of a policy-maker. Policy-making is essentially majoritarian, reflecting the mood of the nation. Justice is, among other things, about ensuring that the structures and processes are in place which guarantee that the conversion of policy into law conforms with constitutional principle. There is inevitably conflict between these two roles. They simply do not mix.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, rightly pointed out that progress has already been made on some of the conclusions, including on post-legislative scrutiny. It is clear from today&#146;s debate that a healthy relationship between the judiciary, the Executive and Parliament is one that respects that the independence of the judiciary is fundamental to the effective working of our constitution and judicial system.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="0811196000090"></a>I also thank the members of the Constitution Committee for their careful consideration of how we might best protect and enhance that relationship. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, on his excellent maiden speech. He is right that the tensions between the Government and the judiciary that he cited are healthy. I pay tribute to the work of Lord Holme of Cheltenham. I also take this opportunity to thank the noble Lord, Lord Lester, for the invaluable contribution he has made as an adviser to the Government. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on this occasion on the views expressed about the Constitutional Renewal Bill. I shall merely say that the Government are now considering the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations, but I note the strong views expressed in the House today and I will bring them to the attention of my colleagues.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="0811196000091"></a>The noble Lord rightly said that citizens have a fundamental right of access to the courts, but he then added that the cuts to the Ministry of Justice undermine that right. I agree that access to justice is a fundamental right, but the Government are acutely aware of the need to balance responsible management of the public purse with ensuring that those who require access to the courts are able to do so, especially the vulnerable.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="0811196000092"></a>The Government have taken, and continue to take, active steps to reinforce the independence of the judiciary by the establishment of the Supreme Court and the Judicial Appointments Commission; bringing forward the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which reinforced the obligation on Ministers to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary and clarified the respective roles of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales; making the Lord Chief Justice the head of the judiciary in that jurisdiction, with equivalent provisions applying in Northern Ireland; and taking practical steps to improve the way in which the judiciary is consulted and involved in key decisions in the operation of the justice system, such as through the concordat and the framework document now in place that defines the partnership approach agreed between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice with respect to the operation of Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="0811196000093"></a>I shall refer today specifically to the issues raised in the committee&#146;s follow-up report, as they represent areas where the committee had some continuing concerns. The committee is concerned that the independence of the judiciary is effectively protected. On that point, we are in full agreement. The Government recognise, too, that the role of the Lord Chancellor is of central importance in this regard. As stated by the Lord Chancellor in his evidence to the committee, there are no plans to separate the roles of Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice at this time.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="0811196000094"></a>Lord Chancellors have always been mindful of the respective responsibilities of the judiciary and the Executive. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 obliges Ministers to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary and reinforces the separation of powers. It also clarifies the respective responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice, with the Lord Chief Justice having responsibility for the welfare, guidance, training and employment of the judiciary and for representing the views of the judiciary to Parliament and Ministers. The establishment of the Supreme Court will contribute further, creating a separate and visible final court of appeal.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a><a name="0811196000095"></a>There can be no disagreement between us on the principle that Ministers should not undermine the rule of law through inaccurate or ill-considered comment with respect to the actions of any individual judge. The committee was concerned that there should be clear and unambiguous guidance to Minister generally setting out the principles governing public comment by Ministers on individual judges. Section 1 of the <I>Ministerial Code </I>specifies that it should be read against the background of the overarching duty on Ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations, and to uphold the administration of justice and protect the integrity of public life. The Government will further consider the committee&#146;s recommendations when the code is next revised.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="0811196000096"></a>We also agree that the responsibilities of Ministers should extend to consulting the judiciary as early as possible on issues that affect it. As the committee identified, there are issues where the Executive and the judiciary must work in partnership in the interests of justice. This is an area where both have made significant efforts to make that relationship work effectively. The  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1126"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 1126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Goodlad, expressed concern that the concordat had not been updated, and I noted the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="0811196000097"></a>I agree that any fundamental change in the nature of the relationship between the Executive and the judiciary is a matter for Parliament. I also agree that, while the concordat is not statutory, it is important that the principles underpinning the relationship between the judiciary and the Executive are kept under review. The framework document sets out in detail how the relationship between the Executive and the judiciary should work in practice with regard to Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service. The Government will consult and work with the judiciary to ensure that the concordat remains live and relevant, and that changes to both the framework document and the concordat are properly put before this House.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="0811196000098"></a>The framework document agreed in April 2008 between the Lord Chancellor and the then Lord Chief Justice sets out in detail how the partnership approach agreed between them should work in practice. The Government welcome the evidence given to the committee by the noble and learned Lord that this resolved perceived tensions in the relationship between the judiciary and the Executive. Clearly, the committee&#146;s recommendations in relation to the judiciary must be a matter for the judiciary, although the Government will obviously work with the judiciary if requested to do so, and will consider carefully any proposals put forward for parliamentary scrutiny in this area.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a><a name="0811196000099"></a>Another matter raised by the committee was the possibility of the courts, in appropriate cases, giving advisory declarations on the compatibility or otherwise of proposed or recently enacted legislation with the Human Rights Act. As we stated in the Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s recommendations, we are not convinced of the utility of advisory declarations at this stage. The Government attach considerable importance to the grounding of cases before the courts in real and substantial factual situations. This assists the courts in considering the compatibility of the law with convention rights, by enabling them to consider not only the strict words of any given statute, but also the legal and practical framework and the context in which it is given effect. I must add, however, that the Government are prepared to keep an open mind upon this issue.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="0811196000100"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, asked for the Government&#146;s view on the committee&#146;s recommendations on a responsible press. We all wish to see accurate and responsible reporting, and any assistance that the Press Complaints Commission can give in this regard is of course welcome. I join other noble Lords in wishing the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, well in her new position.</p>

<a name="81118-0018.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="0811196000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, asked if the Lord Chancellor should speak on behalf of the judiciary. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, rightly pointed out that it is the Lord Chancellor&#146;s responsibility to uphold judicial independence. While it must be right that an independent judiciary can speak for itself, the Lord Chancellor has a role in so far as this is consistent with his responsibilities to uphold judicial independence.</p>

In conclusion, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and all noble Lords who have spoken for their invaluable contributions to the debate. I hope that all will be reassured that the Government both recognise the fundamental importance of the relationship between the judiciary, the Executive and Parliament, and are prepared to act to support the effective working of that relationship. However, we cannot afford to be complacent in this area. Therefore, I thank the committee for all that they are doing to ensure that we keep this relationship under continual review. I end by thanking the staff of the House for unexpectedly being here at this late hour.</p>

<p><a name="08111883000009"></a>We exercise choices as we go through life; so why should we not do the same as we leave this life? Personal choice at the end of life is my theme today.

<p><a name="08111883000010"></a>I begin by congratulating the Government on their end-of-life strategy document. It is a thorough and comprehensive piece of work that does the Government great credit. I like the way in which it builds on the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which gives statutory force to the right to refuse treatment by giving people more positive choices at the end of life. It is very much of a piece with the Government&#146;s 2005 manifesto commitment to double the number of people with cancer who could be treated at home, which is what we know most of the public want.</p>

<p><a name="08111883000011"></a>The strategy, rightly in my view, identifies lack of open discussion between health and social care staff and those approaching the end of life as one of the key barriers to the delivery of good and dignified end-of-life care. That is why I welcome the commitment in the strategy that patients should have the chance to discuss personal needs and preferences with professionals and to have their preferences included in an end-of-life care plan. I assure noble Lords that I have my list of   


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>preferences ready for when my time comes. I also know that they may not count for much in the UK unless the care culture changes, more options are open to me and my legal rights are strengthened. That brings me to the <I>Charter for Dignity at the End of Life</I> produced by Dignity in Dying in June this year, for which I had the pleasure of providing the foreword.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000012"></a>Some critics of that document have, in my view rather foolishly, branded it as &#147;A Deadly Charter&#148;. Perhaps I may summarise for the Committee what the document actually calls for: first, giving everyone the opportunity to create an end-of-life care plan; secondly, placing a duty on healthcare professionals to consider that plan; thirdly, the Government promoting awareness of advance decisions by patients; fourthly, parliamentary approval to giving terminally ill, mentally competent people the option of an assisted death; fifthly, more resources to be made available for palliative care; sixthly, consistent palliative care commissioning to end the postcode lottery in provision; seventhly, better support for carers, including more access to respite care and stronger legal protection against employment discrimination; eighthly, specialist training for health and social care professionals on end-of-life issues; and, ninthly, better access to support services for bereaved people.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000013"></a>That hardly seems to me a charter of death. I hope that the opponents of any form of assisted dying will not rubbish everything that Dignity in Dying says or does. The organisation campaigned&#151;courageously, in my view&#151;for advance decisions, and has also campaigned for more resources for palliative care. There is no philosophical or practical reason why a person or organisation cannot be committed to both better palliative care and assisted dying within strict safeguards. That is certainly my position. Both options are part of a range of choices that should be available to us in a civilised society. It is worth bearing in mind that in those countries and jurisdictions where assisted dying has been legalised, palliative care has flourished and received extra investment.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000014"></a>I note, too, that the Government have produced a further consultation document, which provides for PCTs to demonstrate that they are aware of the views of their population with regard to the delivery of care at the end of life and that local population needs have been assessed. I welcome the fact that the Government are working on some outcome measures for these quality markers and that these could include &#147;place of death&#148; and surveys of bereaved relatives. This more informed approach will mean that policy making on end-of-life issues will be made less on the basis of ignorance and prejudice and more on the basis of solid and reliable information.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000015"></a>That brings me to the final part of my remarks, which relate to how we respond better to people's real preferences on end-of-life issues. The available evidence shows that the legislature in this country is significantly out of step with public views on assisted dying. Surveys&#151;and I include in this the very reputable British Social Attitudes Survey 2007&#151;consistently show that 80 per cent of the population support a change in the law so that a terminally ill, mentally competent person can have the option of an

Indeed, an ICM poll last month showed that 29 per cent of people think that assisted death is already legal in this country.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000016"></a>Both here and in the other place, parliamentarians seem to be in a diametrically opposite position on this issue to their constituents and fellow citizens. The Government have so far remained neutral on this issue. I do not doubt that my noble friend the Minister has the same brief on neutrality that used to be served up to me when I was a Health Minister, but I should like her and her colleagues to reflect on the fact that the situation is changing. International opinion is moving to where British public opinion has been for some time. Assisted dying laws are in place in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon state. Washington state has now voted in favour of an assisted dying law modelled on Oregon&#146;s law. Luxembourg has just approved a new law. In France, President Sarkozy has ordered a study of possible amendments to the law&#151;and the Spanish Minister of Justice is to study a possible law change.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000017"></a>Noble Lords will be relieved to know that I do not think that today is the occasion on which to deploy the arguments for a UK law change on assisted dying. However, I ask my noble friend and her colleagues to reflect on what is going on abroad on this issue and to consider the strong possibility that, the Government having produced this excellent end-of-life strategy, people may begin to take the Government seriously about choices at the end of life. They may even, dare I say, believe that one choice should be legally assisted dying for terminally ill and mentally competent people. We cannot have it all ways; if we have an end-of-life care strategy and we give people a chance to offer their views, we cannot always expect them to maintain the status quo in this area.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000018"></a>Finally, I ask my noble friend to consider commissioning an up-to-date authoritative study of UK public and medical opinion on the issue of assisted dying using a respected independent body and comparing this information with similar assessments of opinion in the United States and the EU jurisdictions that have already moved in the direction of assisted dying legislation. That would be a major service to parliamentarians and is something on which, in due course, I would welcome the views of the Government.</p>

It found that an overwhelming majority of the public believed that terminally ill people should be allowed to exercise choice over the care that they receive. Two-thirds of respondents said that they would be more likely to have a dignified death if they could discuss and record their wishes around end-of-life care and treatment.

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000021"></a>However, in one crucial regard Parliament is failing in its role to represent the will of the people. In 2006, an opinion poll conducted by YouGov found that 76 per cent of people believed that the law should change to allow terminally ill patients to receive a prescription from a doctor to end their suffering, subject to a range of safeguards. Another opinion poll, conducted by YouGov this year, again found that 76 per cent of people believed that terminally ill patients should be allowed medical assistance to die.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000022"></a>If we readily accept that people should have choice, control and access to services at the end of life, why is Parliament so reluctant to discuss this specific issue? Those who oppose assisted dying for the terminally ill insist that a change in the law poses a threat to vulnerable people. It is thus imperative that Parliament balances enacting the will of the people with ensuring their protection. When the law is changed, as I believe it will be&#151;I repeat that it is critical to enact stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable from abuse&#151;it will be our responsibility to make sure that such a Bill is fit for the purpose. By calmly debating the safeguards needed, Parliament will enact a law which not only promotes greater choice at the end of life but provides greater protection for the vulnerable.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000023"></a>I accept that this is a difficult issue for many, but we have a responsibility to debate and resolve it. The current law on assisted suicide is nearly 50 years old. Society&#146;s views have moved on, and Parliament should seek to reflect them. This has occurred in other contentious areas such as homosexuality, the death penalty and human embryology. In this contentious matter, let not bitterness and rancour pervade our debate, but rather let reason and understanding exist on both sides, at all times listening to the voice of the people whom we serve.</p>

<p><a name="08111883000025"></a>Reasonable legal certainty is especially important when a patient is suffering from a terminal illness and facing the prospect of severe suffering and indignity. Patients have the right to life; they also have the right to personal autonomy and to live and die with dignity. They and their doctors need to know what exceptions there are to the law of homicide which will enable a doctor, acting in accordance with the patient&#146;s wishes and with the doctor&#146;s judgment as to the appropriate medical treatment, to administer that treatment even though its probable effect will be to shorten the patient&#146;s life.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000026"></a>There is a lack of certainty about the nature of the legal justification or excuse for what would otherwise be homicide, in relation to the medical treatment of the terminally ill. Where a doctor acts in good faith in accordance with what she considers to be responsible medical practice, with the aim of relieving pain or  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>severe distress but with the foreseeable and probable consequence of shortening the patient&#146;s life, the risk to the doctor is that the jury, as directed by the judge on currently declared principles, will impute the necessary specific intent to find them guilty of culpable homicide, and the judge will have to impose a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. The absence of an adequate legal framework and the risk of prosecution under current law deter some doctors from treating their patients in accordance with those patients&#146; wishes.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000027"></a>The law should allow a doctor to have a defence to a prima facie case of murder based on foresight of consequences where the patient&#146;s life is an intolerable burden to her, she is dying and the only humane treatment left is one that has death as its consequence. It should surely be a defence if the doctor satisfies the jury of three matters: first, the fact that she administered the treatment in good faith for the purpose of relieving her patient&#146;s pain, suffering and severe distress; secondly, the fact that the treatment was given with the patient&#146;s informed consent; and, thirdly, the fact that the treatment administered accorded with accepted medical practice. That approach avoids any artificial distortion of the well established legal concepts of causation and intention, and it provides much greater certainty than an approach based on the vague and confusing standard of primary and secondary intentions or double effect.</p>

Most of them were able to remember someone who had recovered in spite of being beyond any expectation of life. What would happen to these recoverable cases if this law were adopted? Scientific progress continues to enable us to challenge human suffering from pain, breathlessness and such like, and there is much hope for even greater progress in this area.</p>

The physician, or anyone else, has no right whatever to terminate human life, and there is a very clear instruction in Islam, as in other religions, against taking your own life. Therefore, I suggest that the highly controversial proposal to ask Parliament to give terminally ill, mentally competent people the right to an assisted death be removed from the charter and submitted to the House, and it will then have my support and the support of many others in the House. </p>

I welcome the call for better resources for palliative care, the end of the postcode lottery in palliative care and improved support for carers. Better advice and counselling support for bereaved people is also greatly to be encouraged. The churches already contribute massively to this work. However, we cannot avoid the fact that these noble objectives are wrapped up in a package which, as its key objective, asserts the right of all to claim assistance in dying. To that end, we have already heard a great deal about choice and control. Choice and control are not bad things, of course, but they do not add up to a very rich anthropology. They point us to some important aspects of being human but they do not give us a rounded picture of how most people in total experience their lives.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000033"></a>Many of us, including most of us in your Lordships' House, are used to shaping our lives through the autonomous choices we make. But I ask noble Lords to reflect on the many people in the world and in this country whose experience of life is much more about being done unto, sometimes by those closest to them, and whose experience of professionals is not of jolly good folk, like you and me, but of remote, aloof and often faceless people who make decisions which may not immediately appear to reflect the client&#146;s own interests. I ask noble Lords to consider whether a person whose life experience is not all about being in control and making free choices is likely to see the prospect of choosing the time of death as so great a boon as it may sound. For many&#151;and I declare an interest as a parent of a Down&#146;s syndrome child&#151;the promise of more choice has so often turned out to mean pressure to choose that which suits others. People who have not led assertive lives, exercising their own choices, have often internalised the notion that others know best and end up valuing their own lives too cheaply. Are we to offer them the ultimate opportunity to give way to the will of those around them? I ask that in the context of requested legislation which, by definition, would involve the state in affirming the view of an individual life as intolerable and not worth living.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000034"></a>One of the prime functions of law is to protect the weak, so let us be very wary of a charter that imagines all human beings to be like us&#151;confident, articulate and used to choosing the direction of our lives. For many others, choice is not always a promise&#151;it can feel like a threat. Time and time again, history has shown that once a principle is breached, it becomes very hard to police the boundary.</p>

<p><a name="08111883000035"></a>The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre describes human beings as dependent, rational animals. We are part of a greater creation; we have a unique capacity to reflect; but most of all, he says, the fundamental truth about being human is not that we are autonomous individuals but that we are dependent upon one another. Through good palliative care, our nature as dependent creatures can be given eloquent expression through the skill of

As I am sure the Government are aware, this is an issue of growing public as well as political concern. There are 22 noble Lords scheduled to speak, and this is the second parliamentary debate on this subject in as many weeks. A member of the judiciary recently called on Parliament to act to clarify the law on assisted suicide, and hardly a day passes when some aspect of end-of-life care and choices is not covered by the media. Personally, I very much welcome such open, lively discussion. Death, and how we die, have been taboo subjects in public policy for far too long, and the Government are to be warmly congratulated on the first official end-of-life strategy.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000037"></a>In this brief contribution, my purpose is to urge the Minister, as she takes forward the Government&#146;s strategy, to broaden the terms of consultation specifically to include further work on the choice of assisted dying which is contained in the Dignity in Dying charter. The time has surely come when that choice for terminally ill and competent people must be responsibly considered.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000038"></a>I hope that the Minister will pay special attention to the suggestion of my noble friend Lord Warner that the Department of Health look closely at overseas experience. In my view, it is particularly important to examine the impact on palliative care in those jurisdictions where assisted dying is now legally permitted. The importance of extending good palliative care in this country is an ambition we all share, but the UK opponents of assisted dying often assert that professional good practice is threatened and palliative care services are undermined when the option of assisted dying is introduced.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000039"></a>My experience of hearing evidence to the Select Committee on the Bill of my noble friend Lord Joffe and visiting the American state of Oregon, where medically assisted suicide has been available for a decade, is that this is emphatically not the case. As the chief executive of the Oregon Hospice Association wrote recently in the <I>Guardian</I>:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111883000057"></a>&#147;Palliative care in Oregon is ranked among the top 10 states ... Hospice care ... is provided by highly qualified, licensed, interdisciplinary teams of professionals ... The team approach was established by one of our great heroes, Dame Cicely Saunders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111883000055"></a>Official Oregon figures show that the number of patients enrolled in hospice care when they died has more than doubled from 22 per cent to 57 per cent since the Death with Dignity Act was passed.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000040"></a>I hope the Government will accept that it is increasingly recognised that palliative care, however excellent, is not a universal panacea. There are and will always be a minority of terminally-ill competent people who would prefer to end their own lives. The empirical evidence from overseas now shows that this is a small and stable group; numbers do not shoot upwards in

<p><a name="08111883000043"></a>I wish to briefly address the issues raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter about the vulnerable, particularly the mentally vulnerable. I speak as a psychiatrist who has worked most of my career with older people with mental disorders. I know that many are depressed at the end of life, and that there is a very high likelihood that if they are treated for that depression they will recover. It is important that, as the studies in Oregon show, one can assess clinical depression on a wide range of spectrum, from those who are mentally competent, understandable and have a not-treatable depressive response to those who have a treatable serious illness. It is not sufficient to give a person a one-off interview; you have to listen. Just as you would not take one blood test to diagnose diabetes, you would make a further assessment over a period of time. So it is with patients at the end of life.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000044"></a>We know from Battin&#146;s studies published last year that, on the whole, over the past 10 years there has been no significant change in the number of people requesting death in other countries. It is a very small and containable group of people who seek an assisted death.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000045"></a>The Mental Capacity Act has had a positive impact on giving people greater choice to express in advance what they wish at the end of life. A change in the law to allow assisted dying would offer a much clearer framework for the protection of vulnerable people, including those who have lost capacity, those who are depressed and those who might be unduly influenced by others looking to their inheritance, among other things. Such a law would protect doctors. It would make clearer what they could and could not do and would immeasurably improve the trust that patients have in their doctors, knowing that their choices will be respected at the end of life.</p>

<p><a name="08111883000047"></a>Never before has there been a squeak of a suggestion that religion should be brought into this arena. Is this the road to Damascus? I do not think so. I do not think that, all of a sudden, the Voluntary Euthanasia Society has changed. It is trying to fool us. It is a bit like slipping a bottle of cyanide into a weekend shopping list and hoping that it will not be noticed among the Daz, eggs and vegetables. What we are actually talking about is encouraging people to kill themselves and, worse, opening the way for relatives to get elderly and sick people out of the way&#151;which can be a boon, especially when they have money or property to leave. Make no mistake, it is very easy to give an old lady or old gentleman the impression that their continued existence leads to great problems and great expense for their sons and daughters. They love their relatives and they do not want to cause problems, either.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000048"></a>We also know that it is very costly and, heaven save us, that hospitals are severely hampered in meeting their all-important government targets when patients linger on in a bed for which there is a waiting list. &#147;For goodness&#146; sake let us shoo them out of the way and into the graveyard or crematorium&#148;. Terminally ill but mentally competent people will, if the true aims of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society are realised, submit themselves to a lethal injection or a fatal dose, when it is made clear to them in a subtle or direct way that it is time that they shuffled off this mortal coil for the general good. I cannot support this proposal, which worries me very much. Every proposal in the paper worries me, but especially the one that we should allow euthanasia.</p>

The Government worked for two years through various working groups and consulted widely on their excellent strategy for end-of-life care. These same ideas are presented as if they emanate from the voluntary euthanasia lobby, now known as Dignity in Dying. The document before us seems to be an attempt to import a very different additional proposal into the government strategy&#151;that Parliament must give terminally ill, mentally competent people the right to an assisted death. I emphasise the word must because this is the only point in the charter that the voluntary euthanasia movement feels &#147;must&#148; be followed. That word alone shows that it is a key priority, but I cannot sign up to it.</p>

<p><a name="08111883000050"></a>Perhaps I may address the contents of the leaflet with which I agree. Carers and the bereaved need support. The Mental Capacity Act already requires professionals to take account of end-of-life care plans and preferred priorities for care documentation. Awareness of advance decisions is being actively promoted by the

Indeed, in 2001 I wrote an editorial calling for death plans. They did not, and do not, include euthanasia. Good care does not require the excuse of &#147;double effect&#148; to which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, alluded. Patients die of their disease and deserve good care and support, not shortcuts in care to end life. Good care is hard work.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000051"></a>Those who wrote this so-called charter seem remarkably ignorant of the increased resources that the Government are putting into end-of-life care. They seem unaware that a transparent formula for commissioning services is already being used in Wales; that carers are at the heart of many initiatives; that care and respite by Marie Curie nursing and others is cost-effective; that Dr Bee Wee has been appointed to develop the national training programme; and that communication skills training is already underway.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000052"></a>This charter masquerades behind the many years&#146; work of all those organisations that it alludes to as being supportive&#151;clever wording indeed on page 6. It creates the impression that the hospice movement supports this charter. It certainly does not support item 5, which is the nub of the charter. Palliative care investment and education have increased around the world&#151;not preferentially in countries that legalised euthanasia and assisted suicides, as has been asserted. In Oregon, one in six of those whose suicides were assisted had their depression missed by those assessing the request. The pro-euthanasia lobby&#146;s approach in this document is reminiscent of Orwell&#146;s <I>1984</I> and the Ministry of Truth.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111883000053"></a>So I ask the noble Lord whether this is an illusion. Are the people pictured next to the case vignettes the ones described in the document? Why is the euphemism &#147;assisted death&#148; used? Midwives assist at birth and palliative care assists at death; assistance is supportive help, not accelerating death or cutting life short by months or years. Why not be honest? What are the authors of this document frightened of? What they are really proposing is aiding and abetting suicide or giving doctors a therapeutic option of killing their patients. Palliative and other end-of-life care is being used like bubble-wrap around a sharp and dangerous object in an attempt to assisted suicide by the back door.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000003"></a>I want to speak about the suggestion that assisting suicide should become lawful. I disagree fundamentally with my noble friend Lord Lester. His argument is for legalising precisely those hard cases that make bad law and which may indeed have the perverse effect of disadvantaging the very people he wishes to help. It is said that it is inappropriate to retain as an offence the assisting of something that is not unlawful&#151;suicide&#151;but do we not have to look at end of life with a quite different set of ethical values? If you assist a thief, the stolen goods can be returned. If you assist a suicide, only the body can be returned; there is no going back. At the moment we have a law that has a stern face and a kind heart with a discretion not to prosecute exercised

The existing law protects the vulnerable. The proposed law could well not protect the vulnerable in the same way and I believe that it would not.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000004"></a>The sort of legal certainty of a statutory kind espoused by my noble friend would lead to a prescriptive law. We do not have purposes for statutes in this country, we have very precise statutes. The result would be the perverse result of more prosecutions for murder and manslaughter in a situation where Government after Government still set their face against the removal of the mandatory life sentence for murder.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000005"></a>I have two further things to say for the future. The first is that I have read a lot&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, and I should talk more and exchange fewer letters through the columns of the newspapers&#151;about the influence of religion on this debate. I probably come at this debate from exactly the same point as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, in non-religious terms. However, I do not see the contribution of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter, or of someone whom we already miss, the Bishop of St Albans, as being a contribution that has any less validity than that of those of us who are non-religious or humanists. Indeed, I say to those who say that this debate has been taken over by the religious that they are coming close to the sort of religious intolerance that I believe went out 100 years ago.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000006"></a>My final point is on where any Bill should occur. I simply challenge those who would wish to change the law to bring their Bill in the right place&#151;where the law can be changed and where there can be a vote by democratically elected people on whether the law should be changed&#151;and to bring it to your Lordships' House afterwards. This is plainly something that should now be considered, if at all, by a Bill in the House of Commons. It should not start next time in the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000008"></a>The Government&#146;s own strategy document was published at about the same time, following extensive consultation. It is an excellent document. Indeed, I have described the strategy as,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000193"></a>&#147;an overdue but welcome recognition that this branch of health care has been neglected and needs to be better resourced and coordinated&#148;.</ul>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000010"></a>Yet the so-called principles for dignity at the end of life do not make reference to this&#151;they talk coyly of &#147;how I die&#148; and,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000195"></a>&#147;information on the choices for end of life care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000170"></a>The foreword by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, fails to make any mention whatever of assisted dying. This omission is truly extraordinary. It is hard to escape the impression, as one reads the charter, that there is a veritable elephant in the room&#151;a presence which is obvious to anyone who reads it with a little care but about whose existence there is a good deal of embarrassment and reticence. It is pretty obvious what is going on.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000011"></a>By contrast, the Government&#146;s own end-of-life care strategy takes a wise and statesmanlike approach to the topic. It is a true strategy for improved end-of-life quality of care and enhanced dignity, and it provides a specific and fair assurance on the euthanasia debate. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111891000186"></a>&#147;The strategy has been developed within the current legal framework. Whilst the debate about changing the law to allow euthanasia and assisted suicide will continue in this country and elsewhere, these issues are beyond the scope of this strategy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000171"></a>Indeed, not only is it beyond the scope of an end-of-life strategy but it is not a health issue at all. It is one of justice and human rights&#151;the right to life. None of us can escape death but we must have the right to have healthcare provided free from the risk of coercion to suicide.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000012"></a>The Voluntary Euthanasia Society is trying, in my view, to piggyback the Department of Health&#146;s strategy for care at the end of life as a mule for carrying its single-issue thinking into government policy. The Government should wisely smell a rat and resist that. Further attempts to change the law on assisted dying must be declared before Parliament for what they are. This is far too important an issue for sleight of hand and confusion.</p>

I would certainly welcome a full debate in Parliament and a Bill because I support Dignity in Dying for a number of reasons.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000014"></a>Some time ago, I visited a friend of mine who had motor neurone disease. He was still able to communicate by typing. His family was gathered and I wondered why they were all there on that occasion. It turned out that they wanted to raise with me directly the issue that we are debating. They wanted to know what I would do and how I would vote in Parliament. When I asked my friend how he would like me to vote, he said that he would want me to support what Dignity in Dying is saying. The family had gathered there to lobby me. His wife said that, in her view, if a person in her husband&#146;s position had one single thing to live for, they should stay alive. If they did not, they should seek a way out.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000015"></a>At the time, I asked myself what right I had to contradict that view. I thought to myself&#151;as I still do&#151;that I do not have the right to support something that imposes on others something that I would not want for myself. In other words, if I were in that unfortunate position, I would want the choice of ending, or being helped to end, my life. If I want that, what right do I have to deny it to anyone else?</p>

<p><a name="08111891000016"></a>I know that public opinion is on the side of the argument that I am putting forward, and I think that public opinion must count for something because some of the people, like my friend&#146;s family, are seeing relatives, friends or loved ones move to the end of their life and they want to meet their wishes. Of course, the tragedy with some of these dreadful diseases is that at the point when people can make the choice easily&#151;that is, when they can do something about it themselves&#151;they are too well to want to end their lives, but when it comes to the point when they cannot do it themselves, they need help. Surely one is simply saying, &#147;We don&#146;t want you to have to make a decision against your life too early. If you can wait until nearer the time and you can be helped, then you have the right to end your life in that way&#148;.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000017"></a>Finally, I understand that in the state of Oregon, where the palliative care is excellent, people use it more because they know that they have the option of being assisted in ending their life if that is what they want. Surely that is the way in which we should go forward. It is a human right which I support.</p>

There are only a few people who want to be assisted to be killed, but there are thousands of vulnerable disabled people who fear that if the law is eased, their lives will be put at risk. Not long ago, a male nurse killed several patients recovering from operations in hospitals in Leeds. Medical and nursing staff have the opportunity to procure dangerous drugs which will kill patients.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000172"></a>It is felt that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000196"></a>&#147;the lives of disabled people are valued less than the lives of the typically abled&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000173"></a>I know personally of young people who had been taken off their antidepressant drugs by their social workers. One threw himself over Beachy Head on a foggy day and the other, a young married woman, drove her car into a train. This subject is complex. The young rugby player, Daniel James, was one of the few who did not want to live, but I can assure your Lordships that, with the help that they need, many members of the Spinal Injuries Association, of which I am president, do splendid things and achieve good lives.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000020"></a>I wholeheartedly agree with the suggestion of better choice and better palliative care. At the moment, like so many aspects of healthcare, it is patchy across the country. My husband would have liked to die at home, but because the Sunday out-of-hours doctors said that they could not or would not set up a drip, he died in an A&amp;E department.

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000022"></a>There is a certain logical inconsistency in the law as it stands. It is not clear, as the courts have pointed out. Many members of the public may find it difficult to understand why some choices are legal and others are not. Why is it morally and legally justified for a doctor to remove a ventilator or switch off a life support machine, but not to provide a lethal drug to a terminally ill person of sound mind?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000023"></a>The first is an act that intentionally and actively ends life. The second is an act that may or may not end life depending on whether the patient takes the drug&#151;in Oregon, one-third of patients do not. The final decision is the patient&#146;s. The reason that the first is moral and legal, and the second is immoral and illegal is not exactly clear.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000024"></a>When a doctor gives a large dose of morphine that will hasten death, it is legal if the intention is to relieve pain. However, the doctor knows that it is likely to cause death. Everyone knows that, in practice&#151;certainly, in a large number of cases&#151;he or she is doing it to ease death. We are all legally responsible for the consequences of our actions, and the doctor knows the consequences of his or her actions. Is there not a distinction without a difference between causing death to relieve pain and relieving pain in a way that will cause death?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000025"></a>Some may argue that the doctor cannot be sure that a very large dose of medicine will cause death, only that it is likely. But nor can a doctor who supplies the patient with a lethal drug be sure that it will cause death, because a patient may decide not to take it.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000026"></a>I hope that, whatever else our differences, we can all face the issues rationally, and avoid making distinctions which are confusing to the public and seem to have a basis neither in morality nor in common sense.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000030"></a>I shall make only two more points. First, those who want to see, in exceptional circumstances, people openly being able to be helped to die are not seeking premature death for anyone; it should happen only at the very last stage of life when people are in intolerable pain. We are talking about extending the double effect to something which is clear and acceptable to everyone with all the safety measures built in&#151;otherwise I would certainly have terrible doubts about ever introducing any legislation.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000031"></a>Secondly, we have to understand that we will be judged as a society on our ability to reassure and clarify for people what will happen to them if they find themselves in intolerable pain and losing their dignity at the end of life. As a society, we will be judged on that. I hope the Committee will consider carefully how this can best be done, taking into account the arguments about autonomy and control wherever that is appropriate and necessary for adults of competent mind.</p>

During that time, I witnessed a wide variety of care, often delivered by committed health professionals working under considerable pressure.

<p><a name="08111891000033"></a>It goes without saying that health and social care professionals are crucial to delivering high-quality care and greater choice at the end of life. However, it is also true that during the development of the end-of-life care strategy many people identified a lack of open discussion between staff and those approaching the end of life as one of the key barriers to the delivery of good end-of-life care. It is a sad fact that health and social care staff often find it hard to initiate discussions with people about the fact that they are nearing the end of their life. This makes it difficult or impossible to elicit people&#146;s needs and preferences for care.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000034"></a>This lack of open discussion is particularly problematic in care homes, often due to inadequate training of care home staff, but poor communication regarding end-of-life issues between patients, family and staff is also a huge problem in acute hospitals. For example, the Healthcare Commission found that 54 per cent of all hospital complaints received in 2007 were regarding end-of-life care, and these complaints often related to poor communication.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000035"></a>So what needs to be done to improve the contribution of staff to end-of-life care? The new strategy rightly acknowledges that there are major deficiencies in the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours of staff groups in frequent contact with those nearing the end of their lives. But before we focus in on the staff, we have to address the overriding issue that, as a society, we do not talk openly about death and dying. There will need to be a cultural and behavioural shift in attitudes if we are to deliver the open and honest discussion which will underpin an effective end-of-life care plan. This needs to be addressed by improving training and education for professional staff to help them to overcome those barriers. That is why I welcome Dignity in Dying&#146;s charter, which calls for adequate training on end-of-life issues for health and social care professionals, including communications skills training.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000036"></a>Finally, and crucially, for health professionals to carry out their new responsibilities effectively, they must be given the tools to enable the terminally ill to exercise real choice over their care plan. This might include a wish not to have their life unnecessary prolonged and, in some cases, it may include a wish to be assisted to die. Regrettably, at the current time, staff embarking on these difficult and sensitive discussions risk leaving the patient feeling less, not more, empowered if they have to explain that some of those personal choices and preferences are simply not open to them.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000037"></a>In conclusion, I believe that the Dignity in Dying charter helps to fill the gaps in an otherwise admirable government strategy to improve end-of-life care, and I hope that the Minister will feel able to take on board its recommendations.</p>

I believe that the Government&#146;s strategy is very important, and I looked at the charter with that in mind. Most of it seems fine to me; I believe that people should be encouraged to make plans for care at the end of life. Greater support should be given to those unsung heroes and heroines who care for people in the closing days of their lives, and I strongly support the giving of more resources for ensuring that our outstanding palliative care can be and is made available to everyone who needs it, irrespective of where they live. However, I am not at all happy with the proposal that assisted death&#151;which I understand to mean assisted suicide&#151;should be legalised and become part of the choice agenda.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000039"></a>Like many noble Lords, I have been watching the recent furore in the media on this subject. Those who want to see our laws change for terminally ill, mentally competent people tell us that there is no slippery slope of fear, yet, even as they say that, others are calling for people with dementia to be encouraged to regard themselves as a burden and to consider whether they ought to end their lives. We are told that legalised assisted suicide has proved to be without hazard in the American state of Oregon, yet only a week or two ago we heard of research published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I> indicating that as many as one in six of those

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000040"></a>Although society treats attempted suicide with compassion, it rightly regards suicide as not to be encouraged, yet here we have a proposal that it should be facilitated for particular categories of people. This is a road along which we should not be going, and as long as this proposal remains part of the charter, I cannot support it. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that the Government share this view.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000041"></a><a name="81118-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81118-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08111891000238"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> This charter appeared at about the same time as the Government&#146;s strategy on end-of-life care, which I welcome. So far as I can see, the Government&#146;s strategy, with its emphasis on ensuring palliative care and more effective co-ordination among the many end-of-life care services, has rendered this charter redundant. I can only assume that the aim of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, is to focus on the one proposal in it which does not feature in the Government&#146;s strategy&#151;namely, that Parliament should legalise euthanasia. Let us be quite honest here: why is that proposal not proclaimed in the title of this debate?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000042"></a>The proposal is not only redundant, it is wholly inappropriate. The organisation that produced this charter, Dignity in Dying&#151;although most of us know it better under its former name of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society&#151;claims to be campaigning for greater dignity at the end of life. As a principle, I can most certainly agree with that: it is humanitarian and, indeed, desirable. However, along with many other people, I cannot accept that promoting dignity among people who are dying includes asking doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for them. That in certain circumstances can be a negation of a doctor&#146;s role. In fact, I know of a Jewish doctor who refused, in illegal circumstances, to carry that out because he had experienced the same process in a concentration camp.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000043"></a>Many different kinds of experiences come to bear on this. For example, I believe that in the state of Oregon there is the phenomenon of doctor-shopping, in which a small number of doctors who do not normally write such prescriptions for people who are not their regular patients carry out this process when hunted out.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000044"></a>The proposal also flies in the face of society&#146;s attitude to suicide. We have had contributions on that, and I do not think it appropriate to repeat them. There is certainly no place for suicide to be facilitated. Although one sympathises with people who find themselves in this position, there are many worse forms of suffering in society for which we would not countenance legalised suicide. I fear that it may be the influence of&#151;shall we say?&#151;relatives with other agendas who may be in a position to influence the situation. It is one thing to treat cases of suicide or attempted suicide compassionately but quite another to give them official blessing in the way that these people are suggesting. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that

I am much struck that we are meeting here in the Moses Room today under the painting of Moses bringing down the tablets of law to the Israelites. One of their clear injunctions is &#147;Thou shalt not kill&#148;. It seems to me that not only is that at the heart of all religious thinking on this issue but, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, many secularists also share that view. Indeed, the Hippocratic oath was based on the same principle.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000046"></a>When he gave evidence to the Select Committee that considered these issues, the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, very honestly said that he saw his Bill as the first stage. Perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, gave us a glimpse a few weeks ago of what the following stages might be. In an article in the <I>Times</I> on 10 October, the noble Baroness is quoted as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111891000188"></a>&#147;If you&#146;re demented, you&#146;re wasting people&#146;s lives&#151;your family&#146;s lives&#151;and you&#146;re wasting the resources of the NHS&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000047"></a>There is a fundamental divide between those of us who measure life in terms of the right to life and the duty to protect life and those who measure life by its quality. From the hospice and palliative care movements, I see many of the things that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, aspires to and with which I would agree in nine of the 10 points in his charter. However, in this provision for assisted suicide, there is this fundamental divide.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000048"></a>To die with dignity we do not need doctors to kill us. I place rather more reliance on these age-old injunctions than I do on polls. Indeed, the Select Committee took exactly the same view. Having asked researchers to look at the value of opinion polls on issues of this kind, it said that they are,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000197"></a>&#147;limited in value and cannot be accepted at face value as an authentic account of opinion within the United Kingdom. The subject matter is extremely complex and sensitive and therefore very challenging for anyone attempting to gain a meaningful understanding of opinion&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000174"></a>I place more reliance on all the royal colleges, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and the British Medical Association, which remain opposed to any change in the law.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000049"></a>Mention has been made in our debates about the situation in the state of Oregon. I have one example&#151;the case of Michael Freeland, who had a long history of depression and suicide attempts. Dr Gregory Hamilton, an Oregon psychiatrist, said that this man was not in pain because his pain was not treatable; he was in pain because nobody bothered. This was, commented Dr Hamilton,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000198"></a>&#147;just one case among many&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000050"></a>For me, the issue does not ultimately revolve around religious values but around public safety and the vulnerability of those who would no longer be protected should we change the law. I remind the Committee of the 1994 Select Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, which said that,</p>

The death of a person affects the lives of others, often in ways and to an extent which cannot be foreseen. We believe that the issue of euthanasia is one in which the interest of the individual cannot be separated from the interest of society as a whole&#148;.</ul>

I declare an interest in that I also support the Dignity in Dying charter.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000052"></a>I want to tell two brief stories of patients at the end of their lives. The first case is of a cancer patient who was refused surgery after attempts were made unsuccessfully to halt the tumour with chemotherapy. She decided, in consultation with her family, that she wanted to stay at home and receive palliative care. That was organised by the local hospice in conjunction with Macmillan nurses, and she received superb 24-hour care with the help of her family. That patient&#146;s death was planned according to her wishes and, although painful at times&#151;something about which she did not complain&#151;was dignified; she had her way.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000053"></a>The second patient has a variant of motor neurone disease. Fully aware of the course of that disease, she discussed the manner of dying with her doctors a couple of years ago. Like many patients with neurological disease whom we read about in the press, the patient wanted to die at a time of her choosing because she did not want to have to go through the final stages of the disease&#151;what we call the locked-in syndrome. Despite advance directives and discussions, she is now helpless, unable to speak, swallow or move. She still just about breathes, but her eyes say it all. I wish I could help her but I cannot.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000054"></a>Why do we treat these two patients differently? Some of us would like them to be treated equally. They both wanted to plan their own final days, and they both surely had a right to do so, but one achieved her plan and the other lives on unhappily.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000055"></a>Noble Lords have rightly pointed out the concerns that we would all have if doctor-assisted dying were allowed in this country. We are right to be worried. I shall not repeat the counter-arguments&#151;the slippery slope and coercion by relatives. Even pressure on hospital beds has been mentioned. However, their fears have not materialised in the Netherlands or Oregon. In fact, palliative care in those countries has become more important and facilities have improved.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000056"></a>We all want to die well and, if possible, with dignity. We should not allow this for some patients and not for others. The patient must choose and we must help them with their choice.</p>

They would do much to remove the fear of death and dying and the fear of unwanted medical treatment. The Voluntary Euthanasia Society&#151;now Dignity in Dying&#151;has every right to promote its views, but it really does not have a right to make statements such as the one made in another place, that doctors,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000200"></a>&#147;administer pain relief in the absolute knowledge that their patient will die&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/11/08; col. 234WH.]</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000176"></a>That is not true. It is an insult and, what is more, shows a profound ignorance of the use of drugs.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000058"></a>The definition of a good drug such as a pain-relieving drug is that the dose required to relieve is a fraction of the dose required to kill. We doctors are often accused of being hypocritical in giving these drugs. Chemotherapeutic drugs are much more dangerous than pain-relieving drugs; does Dignity in Dying accuse oncologists of hypocrisy?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000059"></a>These recommendations are in operation in many places already. Where I part company with Dignity in Dying is on the issue of assisted suicide and euthanasia, which is what this charter is all about. One of its fund-raising letters speaks of a,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000201"></a>&#147;ground-breaking campaign in Parliament on palliative care&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000177"></a>which is needed,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000202"></a>&#147;to keep the issue of assisted dying in the spotlight&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000178"></a>The organisation goes on to say that this,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000203"></a>&#147;is precisely how similar organisations in other countries prepared the ground before eventually succeeding in changing the law&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000179"></a>to legalise euthanasia. Last month, another fund-raising letter stated that every day the organisation receives messages from people who are terminally ill but who are,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000204"></a>&#147;people we are not allowed to help&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000180"></a>Why would an organisation such as Dignity in Dying, which professes to campaign for hospice care, say that it is not allowed to help people? Because what it is not allowed to do is to help the terminally ill people kill themselves. That phrase, &#147;not allowed to help&#148;, reveals its one overriding objective&#151;namely, the legalisation of euthanasia.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000060"></a>I congratulate the Government in that they have already rejected euthanasia in their own strategy for care at the end of life. Many people who would have obtained assistance in dying if it had been legal survived and are now very glad that their earlier wish to die was not granted. Alison Davis is a case in point; she is very grateful that assisted suicide remains illegal. When I spoke to her this past weekend, she wished me to repeat the evidence that she gave in 2004. Her serious illnesses rendered her permanently disabled and breathless. When she was diagnosed with a fatal illness 13 years ago, she decided that she had had enough and asked for euthanasia. When this was refused, she made three serious attempts on her life, but was rescued by her friends, who persuaded her that her life was worth living. She then established an orphanage in India&#151;and these 13 years, she tells me, have been the happiest of

If euthanasia had been legal, she would have been deprived of the best 13 years of her life. She would like to know what the noble Lord, Lord Warner, et al, have to say about that.</p>

I congratulate noble Lords on their discipline in sticking to the time that they were allocated and succeeding incredibly well in making the points that they wished to make.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000062"></a>This is the first occasion on which we have had the opportunity to debate the Government&#146;s end-of-life strategy since it was published in July this year. It is a matter that is clearly of great interest to all of us. It seems unlikely that I shall be able to address all the points that noble Lords made in my 12 minutes, but I shall do my best to cover the points that seem pertinent to the question raised by my noble friend from the outset on how far the proposals from Dignity in Dying will be taken into account in the Government&#146;s strategy.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000063"></a>The Government are committed to improving end-of-life care services for all. The end-of-life care strategy sets out a clear direction for the future development of services for adults and confirms our commitment to this important area of healthcare. I am grateful to the support expressed by noble Lords throughout this debate. The strategy was created after two years of discussion and debate with all those with an interest&#151;patients and carers and their organisations, clinicians and nurses, families and many others, as was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and my noble friend Lord Warner. The strategy has benefited hugely from the care that went into it, and we are but at the beginning of its implementation.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000064"></a>Although my noble friend will be aware that the strategy has been developed within the current legal framework, he will be pleased to learn that many, but not quite all, of the proposals in Dignity in Dying&#146;s <I>A Charter for Dignity at the End of Life</I> are compatible with the direction set out in the strategy. Seven of its 10 proposals are compatible, but we have difficulty with points 4, 5 and 8 for different reasons.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000065"></a>On point 4, the advance decisions, it is a matter of emphasis rather than disagreement. Point 8 raises an issue of resources which I shall address later in my remarks. On Point 5, which concerns assisted death, our reasons have been admirably illustrated today in what has been probably a 50-50 debate.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000066"></a>In line with the charter&#146;s cause, the Government&#146;s strategy covers the whole pathway of care for those at the end of life. It addresses the responsibilities of the NHS, local authorities, commissioners and the providers of services as well as the Department of Health. It deliberately does not include targets or recommendations, but does include helpful case studies and sets out measures that those bodies will wish to consider taking to improve end-of-life services. Importantly, it builds on and supports the visions for the end-of-life care developed by strategic health authorities as part of the NHS next stage review.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000067"></a>The strategy has been well received both within the NHS and the voluntary sector, including by Dignity in Dying. The measures set out in the strategy are based on what we heard from stakeholders and others as being needed to bring about real improvements in end-of-life care. They set out the key elements for the delivery of the high-quality care that we would wish all people to receive. Among these measures are, first, the need to ensure that all patients and carers have care plans to meet their needs, a point mentioned, for example, by the right reverend Prelate. An important component for care planning is advanced care plans, an element of which might be advanced decisions.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000068"></a>The second strand is to ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to facilitate co-ordination of care across all sectors and providers. We also need to ensure that the range of services, which people need to enable them to live and die at home, is available 24/7. For example, we need such key services as rapid response community nursing, and we need that care, if I may use jargon, to be seamless so that people do not experience the kind of situation faced by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000069"></a>It is important that the needs and wishes of those that are dying are identified and addressed. Information on all relevant local services needs to be available to support those approaching the end of life and we also need to provide for the needs of the bereaved. For all of this to happen, all staff need to receive adequate and appropriate training and development, including training in the communication skills that are necessary to deal with those at the end of life, a matter outlined with great wisdom by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and my noble friend Lady Jones.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000070"></a>In line with the NHS next stage review, PCTs are working with councils that have been asked to develop local strategic plans for end-of-life care. These will be based on the framework outlined in the strategy. In developing these plans, PCTs and local authorities will need to engage with all the relevant local provider organisations, partners, the public and families. We want to end the patchwork of uneven care.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000071"></a>The Government are committed to investing an additional &#163;286 million in end-of-life services in the two years up to 2011 to support this important programme of work and to take forward a range of initiatives at a national level to help ensure that improvements are delivered in developing the tools to measure the quality of care received; developing workforce competences and training in end-of life care; and developing markers against which PCTs and providers can assess themselves, and indeed can be assessed by regulators. We are funding the new national end-of-life care programme to support the work being undertaken by strategic health authorities and PCTs, including the commissioning of end-of-life care services, and to share good practice.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000072"></a>Let me answer three specific points, which were raised during the course of the debate. On the issue raised by my noble friend, he will not be surprised that I will not be able to give him much satisfaction on his request.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000073"></a>This debate highlights people&#146;s strong and opposing views on this issue. Some have deeply held convictions, religious or otherwise, about the sanctity of life. Some have been influenced by personal experience of caring  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for a terminally ill relative and wanting to end their suffering. Others are passionately convinced that they and others have the right to decide on the circumstances of their own deaths, and that those who help them, whether clinicians or relatives, to achieve this should not be vulnerable to prosecution. Some people can see compelling points on both sides of the argument and have not reached a firm view. This debate illustrates that completely.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000074"></a>We might also have to ask ourselves how we weigh up the views of particular groups. For example, how do we balance the views of the public with the views of health professionals or people who have direct relevant experience, or with the views of those who can only speculate about what their wishes may be in the future? There is no easy way to do this, and on behalf of the Government I can offer no answers. I remind Members of the Committee that the Government have no plans to change the law in this area and we have it made very clear that we take a neutral stance when others seek to change the law. This means not standing in the way of such a change, but not actively pursuing it. Equally, we have no plans at present to carry out any associated research in this area.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000075"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and others raised the issue of more specialists being required. We know that the majority of people would prefer to be cared for and to die at home. It is not practical that all such care be provided by specialist staff, and most care will continue to be delivered by GPs, district nurses, care home staff and other generalist staff. But to ensure that everyone has access to improved end-of-life care, it will be essential that health and social care staff at all levels have the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes related to care for the dying. For this to happen, end-of-life care needs to be embedded in the training curriculum at all levels and for all staff groups, not just those specialising in end-of-life care. This is what we aim to do through the strategy.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and others raised the issue of advance decisions. The Government fully support the fundamental and important principle that everyone has the right to consent to or refuse treatment. The courts recognise that people have the right to make a decision in advance to refuse treatment if they lose capacity in the future. The Mental Capacity Act puts advance decisions to refuse treatment on a statutory footing and sets out the rules and safeguards governing advance decisions. We are quite clear that advance decisions are legally binding refusals of a particular treatment, and must be followed if they are valid and applicable. We believe that advance care plans and advance care decisions are appropriately addressed in the strategy.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000077"></a>In conclusion, we are only at the beginning of an important process of implementing the end-of-life care strategy. It will take time for many of the changes that we envisage to happen. However, we can confidently look forward to continuing improvements to end-of-life care services for all patients as a result of implementing this most important strategy.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000080"></a><a name="81118-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81118-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08111891000244"></a>Lord Luce</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government why they propose to end the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Scheme relating to the whole Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000081"></a>The noble Lord said: I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for replying to this debate and noble Lords who are contributing to it. Looking round the Room, I can see noble Lords of great distinction. I was going to describe them as heavyweights, metaphorically, but a very powerful team in any event. I am sure that the Minister will see the importance that we attach to this subject. I declare an interest as a former Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister of State and a former vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000082"></a>The purpose of the debate is to test the commitment of Her Majesty's Government to the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Scheme, particularly in the light of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&#146;s Statement in another place on 13 March when he announced that Foreign and Commonwealth Office support for the Commonwealth scholarships of the eight developed countries of the Commonwealth will be terminated and that Chevening scholarships would be very substantially reduced.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000083"></a>As many will know, the Commonwealth scholarships are financed mainly by the Department for International Development which is financing about &#163;17 million a year for developing countries and, until very recently, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was financing &#163;2 million for the eight developed countries of the Commonwealth. The scheme was launched in 1959, so next year is its 50th<sup></sup>anniversary. There have been no less than 26,000 awards by Commonwealth countries since 1959, of which Britain has provided 17,000. It is worth noting that 1,000 United Kingdom students have benefited from the scheme in other Commonwealth countries. It has now been supplemented by a 12-week fellowship programme for professional people in the public sector, and there is also a distance learning element.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000084"></a>The distinctive features of this scheme are that, first, it gives long-term links for the United Kingdom with leaders in all walks of life in the Commonwealth. Secondly, it is important in helping to weld the Commonwealth together. Thirdly, it has a high reputation for excellence, with a rigorous selection procedure. The two key points are academic merit, which is very important for any scholarship scheme, and identifying, where possible, leadership potential. On balance, the schemes have been 60 per cent for taught Masters and 40 per cent for doctorates, although I know the desire is to increase the number of doctorates.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000085"></a>If we look at the list of the alumni, there is a remarkable record of leadership right across the board, including top judges, vice-chancellors and deputy prime ministers. In Canada, for example, the governor of the Bank of Canada and the present Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet are alumni. The list goes on and on and is a very impressive indication of the calibre of the scheme.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000086"></a>A survey published yesterday shows that 70 per cent of all those who are awarded these scholarships maintain vigorous links with their country of origin. There is therefore a very important link between the country, the host and the recipient country. Last night I had the pleasure of meeting a number of serving scholars gathered in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. They are very impressive people of great calibre from Africa, Asia and all over the Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000087"></a>How has this gone wrong, if I may put it that way? If we go back a year, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting took place in Uganda. The Prime Minister took a formidable team of Ministers with him and placed great importance on the Commonwealth during that meeting. On 18 December, the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth for Her Majesty's Government, wrote me a letter. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111891000189"></a>&#147;The Commonwealth today is as important to the UK as ever. It has a unique role to play and is well placed to take action and move the debate forward on issues of global importance, such as climate change, development, education and trade&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000181"></a>The Minister continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111891000190"></a>&#147;You mention the Foreign and Commonwealth Office contribution to the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan. I am pleased to tell you that we have decided to maintain our commitment for 2008/09 at the same amount as this year (&#163;2.05 million)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000182"></a>Subsequently, we were told&#151;and I am glad&#151;that a little extra money would go to the developing countries scheme through the Department for International Development. Then the bombshell came on 13 March in the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&#146;s Statement. When one looks at that Statement, not by any stretch of the imagination can one regard it as his finest moment. He announced a switching of &#163;10 million from the Commonwealth scholarship scheme to support new priority programmes on climate change&#151;first, by ending the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#146;s scheme for developed countries altogether and, secondly, by reducing substantially the Chevening scholarship scheme while saying that it could pick up some of the developed countries of the Commonwealth&#146;s scholarships.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000088"></a>The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a reduced focus on quality in the Commonwealth scheme and that we needed to create relationships with potential international leaders. However, it was subsequently revealed that there had been no proper review of the scholarship scheme, no proper analysis and no co-ordination or consultation with other departments&#151; or, indeed, with the outside world, the universities  and other Commonwealth countries. In other words,  the situation rapidly seemed to become an unholy  muddle. It gave a damaging signal on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the scheme, and before the launch next year of the Commonwealth scholarship endowment scheme, that Her Majesty's Government were not fully committed to the scheme or to the value of the Commonwealth, of which this scheme is a litmus test.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000089"></a>In the following months, it became evident that not only was the Chevening scheme being cut substantially, but the Marshall scheme was being cut in real terms. Indeed, in August, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, but not for Wales or Scotland, announced plans to end the overseas research student award scheme and to pull out, by 2011, &#163;15 million a year of support for a large number of overseas students.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000090"></a>By then, a serious message had been given that Her Majesty's Government no longer attached importance to international scholarships. There have been widespread protests in Parliament in recent months. From Canada, the Speaker of the Senate, Mr Kinsella, wrote to a number of noble Lords pointing out that Canada was to lose the 1,500 scholarships that it had under the scheme. On 14 July, former Secretary-Generals and former Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth wrote a robust letter condemning the ending of this aspect of the scheme.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000091"></a>At the end of September, the Foreign Secretary owed the Secretary of State for Innovation Universities and Skills, Mr Denham, a drink because he realised how much damage had been done by the Foreign Secretary&#146;s decision and announced that he had agreed to contribute &#163;400,000 per annum for two years to partially restore the Commonwealth scholarships for developed countries, provided that the funding was matched by university participation and partnership. To indicate the importance that they attach to these scholarships, 70 universities have agreed to take part. So the scheme has been partially restored and will offer about half the number of scholarships that we had hitherto.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000092"></a>I end by asking the Minister four key questions. First, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, will he reaffirm their commitment to the importance of the Commonwealth? Secondly, to give substance to that commitment, will the Minister give assurances that the comprehensive scholarship scheme of the Commonwealth will continue for the foreseeable future; will the Government take the opportunity of the 50th anniversary of the scheme to give it renewed vigour; and will they pledge to donate in 2009 to the new Commonwealth-wide endowment scheme?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000093"></a>Thirdly, will he reiterate Her Majesty's Government&#146;s recent commitment to the importance of British universities competing internationally as centres of excellence? To help to do that, will the Government agree on the need to fuel the expansion of postgraduate research, in which 40 per cent of all students are international? This requires a coherent and consistent financial commitment by the Government to international scholarships, working in partnership with universities and the private sector. It is an ideal opportunity for the Government to demonstrate that they will revive faith and commitment in the scholarship schemes.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000094"></a>Finally, to give coherence to all of this, will the Minister confirm that Her Majesty's Government are now pulling the strands together across departments and with universities? I understand that a working party has been established. It would be helpful if the Minister could say what its terms of reference are and whether that is its purpose. I look forward to hearing what he says.</p>

Although I adopt all that he has said, that would never stop anyone adding a few additional reflections.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000096"></a>The first of them is: what does the decision in March tell one about this country&#146;s commitment to the Commonwealth generally? When I joined the Diplomatic Service in 1960, there was a separate Commonwealth Relations Office. Indeed, a close friend with whom I shared a flat enjoyed said that he was the last PPS of the PUS of the CRO, which confused many people at the time. Since then, due to many other factors, the weight of the Commonwealth in our foreign policy formulation has diminished, and there are a number of pointers that the Commonwealth is today perhaps considered as an afterthought, not as a substantial resource for us and an important tool in our international relations.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000097"></a>I know of no other precedent for separating the Commonwealth in this way. I have served on the executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for a large number of years. It would be quite inconceivable for the CPA or any other Commonwealth institution to separate the Commonwealth in this way. Relatively small sums were saved; it breached a principle; and the roll call of the alumni, as the noble Lord, Lord Luce, said, is most impressive, hence the welcome increase in DfID funding which followed the upsurge of concern about the decision.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000098"></a>My second reflection is: what does the decision tell us about this joined-up Government? We know that the first decision in March was that the scholarships should be abandoned for the developed countries. The second decision, taken in September, was a partial restoration of the scholarships, due to the initiative of another department. Surely, that better solution could have evolved from interdepartmental discussion and debate before the first decision. Was no civil servant or Minister prepared to think creatively before that decision and consult on a co-funding basis with universities, which, as is clear from their response, value the scheme?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000099"></a>My third and final reflection is this: it is clear that there is a case for learning lessons, looking at a longer-term funding solution and in the round at scholarship schemes. I know that my noble friend Lord Montgomery was ready to make a contribution about the Chevening scholarships in Latin America, but I make it on his behalf as he is not able to be here now. As the noble Lord, Lord Luce, said, there is a clear need for a fresh commitment from the Government to the international scholarship scheme, a need to look at the range of scholarships and to look at the departmental responsibility for the scholarships in the round, because this exercise shows, if nothing else, the way in which several government departments have been involved. Let there be much greater integration within Whitehall in this most important field. I congratulate yet again the noble Lord.</p>

If he has not, he should look again at the list of speakers and perhaps remember the wise advice of Denis Healey that when you are in a hole, stop digging.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000101"></a>As has been pointed out, this decision shows no sign whatever of joined-up government. When you see an alphabet soup of departments&#151;DIUS, FCO, DfID&#151;you wonder where the decision is coming from. One has to look only at the Statement by the Foreign Secretary on 13 March:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111891000191"></a>&#147;As we reviewed our schemes we found a number of weaknesses. The purpose of scholarship schemes has not always been clear&#148;&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/3/08; col. 23WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000183"></a>Yet on the Downing Street website now it states that the Government regard the Commonwealth scheme as good and well run. So an element of confusion is compounded by the fact that there was no consultation with external bodies, including the universities, and no meaningful impact assessment before this decision was taken.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000102"></a>I worry sometimes about what I call &#147;bean counter&#148; foreign policy making, where these hard realists take decisions to write off whole countries and areas of policy because the real concentration now has got to be on China or whatever is top of the pops at the moment. I believe that foreign policy is part heart, guts and instinct as well as bean-counter calculations. For example, I have been wholly committed to European membership for 40 years, but I have also always thought that one of the great gifts we can take into the European adventure is the wonders of the Commonwealth connection. I wonder about the thinking that suggests that we are going to focus on picking leaders. About 30 years ago, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral and I were on a group that modestly called itself the Atlantic Association of Young Political Leaders. I sometimes think that picking political leaders is a dangerous game; perhaps you are picking the teachers of political leaders.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000103"></a>I worry that we see this contact purely in terms of development. That is a mistake as well. It is massively to our interests that we have scholars and students from developed Commonwealth countries. I want to see young New Zealanders, Australians, Canadians, Bahamians or whatever on that list and coming into our system&#151;not only for their benefit, but because it gives immeasurable benefit to British students to have that contact with a wide range of Commonwealth students.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000104"></a>I hope that the Minister will think very hard about this. As has been indicated, there has been some rowing back but, looking forward, we would like to see a positive approach to the 50th anniversary of the Commonwealth scholarship programme and a long-term commitment to funding.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000105"></a>I did say that I was going to be helpful. In the recent report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life on a survey of public attitudes, the key priority for improvement from Ministers, as identified by the public, was owning up to mistakes. So tonight the Minister has a wonderful chance to be in total empathy with public opinion by owning up to what has clearly been a very bad mistake.</p>

When I put my name down to speak in this short debate, I fully expected that it would have concluded by six o&#146;clock. In view of the change in timing, I fear that I may have to leave for an unalterable commitment by 6.15. If that happens, I hope that the Minister and your Lordships will forgive me.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000107"></a>I propose to speak briefly. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Luce, for drawing attention to a problem that appears to reflect a shocking lack of co-ordination between departments. I presume&#151;although I hope that the Minister will confirm this&#151;that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&#146;s regrettable decision announced on 13 March was driven solely by financial pressures on the inadequate diplomatic service budget, rather than reflecting any lack of commitment to commonwealth scholarships or, indeed, the Commonwealth. As a former head of the Diplomatic Service, I confess to a feeling of shame regarding my own department that it fell to two other departments&#151;the Department for International Development and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills&#151;to rescue it from an act of sheer diplomatic folly. It must surely have been realised in advance of Mr Miliband&#146;s announcement that one effect of turning these scholarships over to DfID would be to reverse the long-established principle that they should be available for citizens of all member countries, not only to the poorest.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000108"></a>I was made acutely aware of the importance that at least one of our Commonwealth friends and allies attached to these scholarships when I attended an Anglo-Canadian seminar in Cambridge a few weeks ago. Attention was drawn to the large number of distinguished and influential Canadians who have benefited from these scholarships in the past and the importance which Canada, as one of our Commonwealth friends who would have been affected by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&#146;s Statement, continued to attach to the Commonwealth scheme. It was acknowledged that there had been some rethinking of the Foreign Secretary&#146;s decision as a result of another department&#146;s initiative. Was there any consultation with our diplomatic posts abroad or, indeed, with other Commonwealth Governments, before the Foreign Secretary announced his decision? If not, why not?</p>

There is so much expertise among noble Lords here that I thought that perhaps in the short time available to me I should concentrate on just two specific areas. One is Hong Kong&#151;and I shall explain why in a moment&#151;and the other Scotland, because of my position at Aberdeen.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000110"></a>Hong Kong is, of course, no longer a member of the Commonwealth, but it is a very interesting historical example. From the start of the scheme in 1959 until 1997, when Hong Kong was no longer a member of the Commonwealth, 400 scholars from Hong Kong came to the UK. About 100 went elsewhere in the world; interestingly, about 120 went to Hong Kong

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000111"></a>What would be the historical lesson from that? Those who came on the scholarships, to the UK and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, helped to cement over a long period of time relationships between Hong Kong and the Commonwealth, which remain strong now. That has been for the benefit of Hong Kong, then and now, in helping to create Hong Kong as the international city which is its very essence.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000112"></a>Furthermore, I argue that it would be of benefit to mainland China, of which Hong Kong is now a part, if the better-informed leaders in China realised the value of those historical Commonwealth connections. Incidentally, they are very strong in the universities. Finally, it is of great historical and continuing significance in the relationship with the United Kingdom. Therefore, there is the historical example of Hong Kong, where there have been numerous scholarships and they have been wholly beneficial to those three different parties.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000113"></a>I turn briefly to Scotland. At the moment, there are 66 scholars in Scotland, 12 of them in Aberdeen, and they have also benefited from distance learning, as referred to by my noble friend Lord Luce. That has been a major part of the scheme. Most of the scholars in Scotland have been from the academic world&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, they have been the teachers of the future leaders&#151;but there has also been a considerable number of future leaders. The Deputy Prime Minister to whom my noble friend Lord Luce referred, is, I think, the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, or was until some two weeks ago. That is a very good example of a political leader, and there have been other political leaders from around the Commonwealth whose names it would be wrong to list. Of the 66 scholars who are currently on this scheme in Scotland, only one is from the developed Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000114"></a>That brings me to the general point to which other noble Lords have referred. It is a good thing that the Department for International Development is continuing the scheme for the underdeveloped, or developing, Commonwealth. It is good in a way that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has picked up the dropped ball from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and is continuing for a short period a scheme for those coming from the developed Commonwealth. However, like other noble Lords, it seems to me enormously important that there should continue  to be Commonwealth scholars from the developed Commonwealth as well as from the developing Commonwealth, and that we should, as the Foreign Secretary said in that Statement in March, try to identify future leaders. That will be valuable to their countries and to us. However, even though the scheme for the developed Commonwealth has been reprieved for a short time, I cannot believe that you can run a decent scholarship scheme if it lasts for only a year or two. It just does not work like that.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000115"></a>Like other noble Lords, I finish by saying that I hope that, in replying, the Minister will assure us all that there will be continuity in this scheme, as well as some joined-up government, so that, wherever it comes from, there will be continuing funding.</p>

I only hope that the Minister will find better arguments to justify the Government&#146;s action than his colleagues have hitherto been able to muster. The Foreign Secretary&#146;s justification of the decision as a switch to expenditure on climate change, although laudable in itself, was as clear a case of apples and oranges as I have ever heard.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000117"></a>I should like to cast my net rather wider than the Commonwealth scholarship scheme and look also at the impact on the Marshall scholarship scheme for US citizens. That has been the object of similar damaging attempts at cheese-paring, to which this latter scheme has been subjected. The 2009-10 funding for Marshall scholarships is being held at the same figure as for 2008-09. That means a substantial reduction in real terms and a reduction in the number of Marshall scholarships which the Government are funding, thus continuing a process of reduction in that figure over several years. If there is no increase in this figure in future years, even more serious damage will be inflicted. I hope that the Minister will not try to mask these reductions in government-funded places by lumping them together with scholarships funded by the private sector, as was attempted in replies to Questions in the House some months ago.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000118"></a>Quite apart from the singular lack of generosity epitomised by these cuts in a scholarship scheme designed as a way of thanking the US people for the Marshall Plan, the timing of these cuts is pretty breathtakingly obtuse. After eight years of considerable strain in the transatlantic relationship and a lamentable rise in feelings of anti-Americanism in this country, a new president has been elected in the United States who is committed to repairing the damage caused by his predecessor and to reaching out to America&#146;s friends and allies, among whom, I imagine, this country figures. We choose that moment to reduce, in real terms, the financing for a scheme designed to achieve precisely those objectives. I really do not envy the Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary having to defend those cuts when first meeting President Obama or his as yet unnamed Secretary of State. It could prove singularly embarrassing to do so.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000119"></a>The case for protecting, indeed expanding, the Marshall scholarship scheme, goes far beyond questions of generosity on our part; it goes to the heart of what is now often called a nation&#146;s &#147;soft power&#148;&#151;the influence it exerts in the world and its capacity to summon up support and backing in the future even when its relative position in the world pecking order may be reduced. Few schemes offer better value for money in that respect than the Marshall scheme and, indeed, the Commonwealth and Chevening schemes, all considered by various speakers. It will be interesting to see how many members of President Obama&#146;s new Administration

We may not be able to say the same thing in 15 or 20 years&#146; time if this process of reduction continues; and we shall be the poorer for it.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000120"></a>I think that it is well understood how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office got into this pickle. A tight spending round is being applied to a department with a relatively small budget, almost entirely consisting of sharp-end personnel costs, and with only a very few, very small expenditure programmes such as these scholarship schemes. Leviathans like DfID or the Ministry of Defence could protect valuable schemes such as these without turning a hair. However, the Foreign Office cannot, and it feels compelled to squeeze some of its own best valuable assets. It is surely high time for the Government to recognise that it is against our national interest to have created this quandary and to find some way of extricating themselves from it, as they seem to have begun to do by getting some funding for the old Commonwealth scholarships from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. I hope very much that the Minister will be able to tell us how that process of extrication from this lamentable decision is going to be carried on in future years.</p>

I want simply to tell the human story of Commonwealth scholarships, perhaps in a much more humble way than others have cited. I am not talking about great political leaders or deputy Prime Ministers; I want to talk about the five students in my department at Cardiff University, who have been Commonwealth scholars since 2006. That cohort entered and competitively gained scholarships&#151;three from India and two from Pakistan. They were all highly motivated. One lad had to drop out because his father was desperately ill and he could not combine study with caring for him. That scholarship has been awarded to another student.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000122"></a>The others have done astoundingly well. I shall name them because I think that they deserve it. They are Dr Jeba and Dr Barathi from India and Dr Rozilla Khan from Pakistan. They all passed phase one  of their courses in the top third. Two&#151;Dr Jeba and  Dr Barathi&#151;were in the top 10 per cent. Dr Jeba went on, in phase two, to be the top student out of the whole of the world cohort that we have on our course and won the Cicely Saunders medal. She is now undertaking her MSc, as is Dr Khan. Dr Barathi will start next year. They all started with moderate communication skills. One of them, Dr John, had communication skills that would not pass our criteria. However, they have all improved so much that we are training them up as facilitators. These are medical readers in their own parts of their own country.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000123"></a>Dr Kahn is a gynaecologist, who looks after thousands of women every year dying from cancer of the cervix, with terrible pain and haemorrhaging and those with carcinoma of the ovary, who die with intestinal obstruction. She describes her own practice as having radically altered and is actively teaching others while she is studying. There is a real ripple-on-the-pond effect from these scholarships.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000124"></a>The other two, Dr Jeba and Dr Barathi, will certainly be major leaders in the academic discipline of palliative medicine as it develops across India. They are already affecting clinical practice enormously.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000125"></a>Is this expensive? It costs &#163;8,776 to educate each one of those right through to MSc level. I do not think that that is a huge expenditure, but the impact of that money is absolutely phenomenal. These students have enriched our course and taught the other students what it is like to work in an area in which healthcare is desperately under-resourced, where they are hitting old-fashioned attitudes and need to change how things happen in their society.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000126"></a>I simply make the plea that the distance-learning courses to which the noble Lord, Lord Luce, referred and the medical courses that I asked the Minister about when we debated this matter after a Question in May are somehow allowed to continue. They represent true humanitarian aid, which affect how people live and how their families can live when faced with devastating disease in areas of the country, irrespective of the economic growth, which medically are way behind and drastically under-resourced. These are terribly important scholarships.</p>

It was certainly disconcerting to learn in March that the FCO was culling its fellowship and scholarship scheme. In the summer, HEFCE announced that the ORS award scheme was being phased out&#151;a real loss of opportunity for all outstanding students from outside the EU. We all welcomed the palliative action of the recent DIUS scheme, but there are surely concerns about the zigzag, unco-ordinated policies and the signal sent by a department that is still called the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000128"></a>Academically, the UK is in a position of strength and opportunity. No other country apart from the United States has so many universities high in the global league tables, but we are losing ground by not exploiting our competitive advantage. Back in the 1960s, advanced study at a British university was a prime ambition for most Commonwealth students, but now it is to the United States that the very best students generally aspire, whether they are from Australia or India. Obviously, given the scale and quality of American higher education, this is unsurprising, but we should surely ensure that we do not slip below number two.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000129"></a>We attract large numbers of students from the Commonwealth, as we do from the rest of the world. Most of them pay high fees to come here&#151;higher, of course, than EU students. But our focus in this debate is on a small but crucial fraction of the students, the really top students for whom universities are competing and whom United States universities are enticing with generous grants. Those very best graduate students are academic assets. There is an international market for them. They are offered generous packages by leading private universities in the United States. None of our UK universities has endowments to match Harvard,

That is why prestigious publicly funded scholarships are so important; they are an investment in our universities and a down-payment that gains us influence in the long term. That is surely why we should build on the Commonwealth scholarships. We send all too few signals that we value the Commonwealth, but here is one that it is very much in our interests to stabilise and strengthen.</p>

Not only do we want to compete but our own academic institutions are greatly enriched by Commonwealth students and vice versa. I declare an interest&#151;or, rather, an expertise&#151;as a former trustee of the Rhodes scholarships, many of whose scholars are from the old or developed Commonwealth. In my youth, I was one of those who benefited from a graduate scholarship given to me by a university in the United States.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000131"></a>Scholarships are not, in my view, a significant tool of foreign of policy, as they have been described; they are tools of academic and personal excellence. It was often joked that education at prestigious British universities did not seem to have had the expected beneficial effects on leaders of some countries in turmoil in the past in Africa and Asia. But the quality of the scholars from the developed Commonwealth is evident in the list of names that we have seen of those who have held scholarships in the past and in the contribution that they have made to the UK and to their own countries.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000132"></a>International students have given us so much: they have invigorated our higher educational institutions and they have sparked off competition to attract them. International scholarships equate with prestige. Our international scholars have turned British universities into international institutions. Our overseas graduates are at the forefront of efforts in conservation, in law, in science, in politics and in business. Just by being here they represent international friendship and a lesson in fruitful diversity.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000133"></a>In my view, there should be an overall review of the scholarships for graduate foreign students involving the universities, all the government departments with an interest and the Higher Education Funding Council. We must also keep scientific research programmes going. These are heavily reliant on international students, especially when so many British students are abandoning pure science at A-level and beyond. Australia, for example, has increased the number of its awards and is now seen as an excellent place for Asian students, in direct competition with us. Other students will, of course, go to the United States.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000134"></a>Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College will make great efforts to find and fund graduate doctoral students and they have the muscle to do so. Other universities, if they do not get Commonwealth scholarships, will fall further behind in this competition. That will threaten the Government&#146;s policy of driving up the quality of

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000135"></a>Let me put in a word for my own discipline, law. There are special ties with the developed Commonwealth countries through their legal systems. We share a system of common law and human rights that makes joint academic study especially appropriate. We know that there are vice-chancellors of distinguished universities in this country who have come through Commonwealth scholarships. We know of judges, former MPs, people of influence in the Wellcome Trust, which gives out funding to other universities, and&#151;I am sure she will not mind being named&#151;Germaine Greer, the iconic feminist who is well on her way to being a national treasure.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000136"></a>I suggest that Commonwealth scholarships are a legacy that will outlast much more expensive expenditure, for example on the Olympics, for a tiny fraction of the price. To use the Government&#146;s favourite word, Commonwealth scholarships are a genuine investment, the return on which we will see for decades to come.</p>

The Government occasionally, although not often, seem a little timid and do not actually take credit where it is due. They can have immense influence in this area and on the university system, but not by withdrawing funds. They can influence the climate within which all British universities operate, the climate of saying that it is important to have overseas students and to have future leaders in our midst. The Government set the climate of opinion. At the moment, they are setting it in an important direction, which puts scholarship funds towards poorer students in this country. That is quite right&#151;but if, at the same time, they withdraw funding from overseas students, the message becomes distorted.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000138"></a>The input of government money allows universities to spend sums that they might otherwise have to commit in ways that are wide and various in their impact. I want to crystallise and to particularise. This is a tale of three men who were scholarship students in this country&#151;Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Archbishop Ndungane, his successor as Archbishop of Cape Town, and Barney Pityana. I declare an interest because I had the privilege of teaching the latter two. I did not teach them very much, but formally I was their teacher. They were able to come to the UK in the darkest times of apartheid in South Africa because there were people in this country who were prepared to put money into creating scholarships.</p>

I do not know about choosing future leaders; all three were clergymen who studied theology. I am not sure that that is topical, but there you are. All three are key figures in post-apartheid South Africa, and all three have had a massive influence in the development of that country since the creation of a presidency under Mandela and free open elections.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000140"></a>There is no need to rehearse the great contributions which Desmond Tutu has made, but his aides told me when I once visited him of his personal bravery by standing as chancellor of the University of the Western Cape between, on the one side, discontented and protesting students in the early hours of the morning, and on the other side, the armed militia and policemen who were intent on stopping the protest. His personal courage is often not recognised in the way that it should be, because we concentrate on his wider contributions.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000141"></a>His successor, Archbishop Ndungane again had to flee South Africa with his family and was able to study in this country because scholarships were available; the climate was right. Eventually, he was able to return to his own country to become in the late 1980s principal of a theological college, Bishop of the Orange Free State&#151;not a sinecure by any means in the late 1980s and early 1990s&#151;and, finally, he was Desmond Tutu&#146;s successor. Archbishop Ndungane, when he more recently visited this country, was asked by a student, &#147;You were on Devil&#146;s Island. Did you see Mandela&#146;s tomb?&#148;. He answered, &#147;I think I built it&#148;. That was the position he was in; he had to get out, he came here with his family and the rest is good news.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000142"></a>Barney Pityana is perhaps less well known. Desmond Tutu was asked to take on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Barney also had to flee with his family. We used to get strange guttural South African voices asking for his address in London. &#147;We are friends of Barney&#148;, they would say; we took that with a pinch of whatever. Barney was talent-spotted by the then very enlightened vice-chancellor of Cape Town University, and was taken back to South Africa, where he became an assistant principal. Then he was in a position to chair the Human Rights Commission there, which was thought to be a poisoned chalice. But he carried it out in a way that I suppose his great mentor, Desmond Tutu, did, creating reconciliation, a sense of what was true and an attachment to human rights.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000143"></a>Bringing these people here is not simply an enhancement of the experience of UK students, although it is that. It is not simply a means of advertising the qualities of UK higher education, although it is that. And it is not simply a way of enhancing UK direct influence, which we have heard much about. It is a way in which, albeit indirectly, this country made a contribution to the future of South Africa. These three went back and held key appointments at a time when it could all have gone wrong. They have helped create a country which will have a huge influence in that troubled continent, a country based on truth, reconciliation, decency, human rights and democracy. The climate of opinion that brings folks like that here is in part the background to the very specific question that has been raised by my noble friend Lord Luce.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="08111891000228"></a>5.50 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08111891000144"></a><a name="81118-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81118-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08111891000254"></a>Lord Bew:</b> Like other noble Lords who have spoken, I thank my noble friend Lord Luce for the work he has carried out in bringing forward this issue. I begin by declaring an interest. As a practising academic, like the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, I have experience of some of the students who have come to this country as a result of the schemes which the FCO is planning to prune. I also speak as an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, which has a tradition of attracting Commonwealth students, which is probably as marked as any Cambridge college. Everyone knows that these students are among the very best that we will ever have the good fortune to teach. It was therefore rather shocking for me to contemplate, earlier this year, the FCO&#146;s suggestion that there would, for example, no longer be any scholarships for PhD students from the developed Commonwealth countries. It was a simple, brutal shock to the system.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000145"></a>There are issues here of intellectual competitiveness. We cannot afford to be complacent about the UK&#146;s place in the world higher educational rankings. It is in our interests not only to attract graduate students in large numbers, which we already do, but to attract the already high achievers. To do that, our country has to make an investment of its own. Such an investment builds up a benign, reciprocal interest with scholarly institutions around the world.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000146"></a>It is clear, however, that the Government are now more focused on leadership, and they have good reason for that focus. When my noble friend Lord Hannay raised the issue of the Marshall scholarships, the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, asked a very pertinent question. He observed that a quarter of a century ago, two dozen heads of state around the world had been educated in this country. I remind noble Lords that the noble Lord spoke as a former education Minister, and therefore with some authority. He asked what the figure was today. The answer can be found in the Library of the House in October 2007. Essentially, we do not know&#151;we cannot give a figure in the way that we once could. I suspect that like other noble Lords, I regard that as a rather sombre and worrying conclusion.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000147"></a>For that reason, I welcome one aspect of the Foreign Secretary&#146;s Written Statement of 13 March this year, which said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08111891000192"></a>&#147;We will maintain a much closer relationship with those scholars who do come, making sure that right from the start of the selection process we begin to build links with them ... while they are here&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000184"></a>The Statement said that we would maintain connections with them through a,</p>
<ul><a name="08111891000205"></a>&#147;web-based alumni networking system&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 13/3/08; col. 23WS.]</ul>
<p><a name="08111891000185"></a>That is all well and good, but something in me fears that it is a fig leaf. If you are reducing resources, it can be a fig leaf simply to say that you will work harder to maintain contact with those who actually come.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000148"></a>I have a similarly uneasy feeling about the decision to transfer &#163;10 million to what are considered to be more priority programmes on climate change intended to engage China and India. There is a sense&#151;it may

We can say that while fully respecting the fact that one of the Foreign Secretary&#146;s achievements has been to focus, with greater intensity, British foreign policy on China and India. There is a sense, too, of rash decision-making, designed to achieve an already preordained end. One can see this when, for example, one looks at the way in which the FCO has failed to produce hard evidence of any valid comparison of the past records of the Chevening and FCO-funded Commonwealth scholarships.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000149"></a>In conclusion, I share the unease about the lack of serious consultation with the higher education sector on this issue. I do not want to add to the Minister&#146;s torture by touching again on the lack of joined-up government but I want to ask a different question concerning consultation with the higher education sector. There is now some sense that the Government know that a mistake was made and that there will be further consultation on these matters. I hope that the Minister can say something about that this evening.</p>

This morning, I was talking to a group of people from the Industry and Parliament Trust about the work of the House of Lords, and I instanced the importance of our role in holding the Government to account. I think that this debate is a good one, as it illustrates how the House of Lords does hold the Government to account. As the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said, we have perhaps been torturing the Minister and he has many questions to answer.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000151"></a>The issue before us is the withdrawal of approximately &#163;10 million of funding from two schemes for graduate students&#151;specifically the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, which is now to be restricted to those from developing countries, and the Chevening scholarship programme, which has been funding graduate students from around the world. These decisions, taken last March, have been compounded by the decision taken in August by the Higher Education Funding Council to withdraw funding from the Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme. As the noble Lord, Lord Rees, mentioned, all these schemes fund graduate research students in this country. The quality is very high and our universities depend on these overseas students. The fact that we are withdrawing these scholarships does nothing for the quality of our research.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000152"></a>In addition, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, has just emphasised, these decisions were taken without consultation with the universities, in spite of the compact back in 1999 that students on the Chevening scholarships would get a 20 per cent reduction in their overseas student fees in return for increased government funding for the scheme. In response to government urging, many universities have been expanding their intake of overseas students, developing new bursary schemes, often in conjunction with private partners. At a time when this Government have been urging the universities to reach out overseas and bring more overseas students

It is hardly an encouraging one.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000153"></a>Many noble Lords have criticised the lack of joined-up thinking that we have seen. It is to be welcomed that the DIUS, late in the day, has stepped in to make good some of the deficit, but it is a small amount in relation to the total that has been withdrawn: &#163;400,000 over two years is very little compared with the &#163;10 million that has been withdrawn.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000154"></a>In answer to the question why the FCO cut  funding to Commonwealth students, in its Statement on 18 March the FCO implied that the scheme was not well managed. However, there is considerable evidence to show that this scheme was not the one that was investigated by the FCO&#151;the FCO had actually reviewed the Chevening scheme. Independent consultants had looked at the Commonwealth scheme and had given it a very good bill of health. On top of that are rumours that one reason that it was criticised and withdrawn was that it was selecting students on the basis of academic excellence. Again, that sends completely the wrong message.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000155"></a>In terms of effectiveness, it might have been useful to review what former students are doing now. Again, round this table we have managed to put together a considerable list of former students&#146; achievements. I pick up one point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, which is the Hong Kong experience of the two-way flow.</p>

<p><a name="08111891000156"></a><a name="81118-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81118-gc0006.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08111891000256"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Colwyn):</b> We should stop for the Division in the House unless the noble Baroness is about to wind up her remarks.</p>

It is the two-way flow. Some noble Lords have stressed that we are no longer necessarily top of the league. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore all provide excellent universities, and the exchange is important. All in all, this appears to be typical Treasury chicanery. It has gone to the FCO, it has looked round and asked, &#147;What schemes do you really need to do? Do you really need to fund this?&#148; It has picked on it and it has been withdrawn. There is no particular rhyme or reason behind the cuts. It is another example where this Government, so profligate in some areas, are spoiling the ship for a ha&#146;porth of tar.</p>

Like others, I am immensely personally happy that the noble Lord, Lord Luce, secured this very important debate. In fact, it would be an impertinence for me to try to sum up all the hugely distinguished, authoritative and learned contributions that we have just heard over the past hour or so on this situation.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000161"></a>What is the situation? We know that the blunt statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office back in March was to the effect that it would be the end of FCO contributions to the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan and that about 100 scholars would be affected. The statement went on to explain that there would be a release of &#163;10 million for other policy goals. I must say that when I read that those other policy goals were going to be principally on climate change, my heart sank at the sheer lack of understanding behind such a statement. Everyone knows that international scholarship, political leadership and scientific momentum are the practical gateway&#151;practical, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, emphasised&#151;to a successful environmental policy and to energy security and making any progress at all towards effective fighting of global warming.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000162"></a>That is by the way. The deeper worry that I have in all this is the one that has been articulated by several of your Lordships, which is that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office today in its collective mind does not understand the significance of the Commonwealth network, which now contains seven or eight of the leading hi-tech dynamic nations of the 21st century, or the enormous attraction of the Commonwealth to many newcomers, countries outside the Commonwealth. Today I had a delegation of Japanese senior mayors of great cities whose number one question was, &#147;How can we observe and get closer to the activities of the Commonwealth?&#148;. We are looking here not at nostalgia or a past relationship but forward realistically to the network of the 21st century.</p>

I was coming to the point of saying how worried some of us are that the Commonwealth is not grasped and understood in its full significance as an ideal network for promoting the interests of this country and our contribution to the world in the 21st century. It is not a question of looking back nostalgically at the Commonwealth but of understanding how the modern world really works, and the Commonwealth network is more relevant than many of the institutions we inherited in the 20th century.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000166"></a>Can the Minister reaffirm recognition of the immense value and importance of international scholarship schemes running, as one noble Lord said, between countries and through countries in a latticework  of exchanges, bringing immense power, common understanding and common values to a very large part of the world? Can he reaffirm that education is near the heart of the Commonwealth agenda? Those are government words uttered in good faith which now need to be supported by a stronger line on this

Can he reaffirm&#151;or perhaps I should say affirm&#151;that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office understands the place of a strengthened Commonwealth in our nation&#146;s future and our national interest?</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08111891000167"></a>I have spoken for only a few minutes but I have to say frankly that, in the impression of many people, some of them giving voice to it today, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has lost the plot over this issue. It did not understand that the structure and architecture of the modern world requires a strengthened Commonwealth with Britain as part of it; not necessarily as the centre, as in the past, but certainly as a leading player in this remarkable network which history has placed in our laps and, by good fortune and chance, has preserved for the future. Can the decision be reopened at the first opportunity so that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has the chance to regain grasp of the changes in the modern world and how the Commonwealth fits into them? If we can have  reassurance on those points we will feel that this debate has not only been brilliant and informed but also worth while.</p>
<h5><a name="08111896000027"></a>6.23 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08111896000002"></a><a name="81118-gc0006.htm_spmin6"></a><b><a name="81118-gc0006.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="08111896000028"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Luce, for raising what is undoubtedly an important topic and for the way in which he has done so. I welcome the opportunity to reiterate the Government&#146;s commitment to the Commonwealth and their continuing support for the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan. The distinguished cast of speakers today has spoken with deep passion about the importance of this country&#146;s connections with the Commonwealth and the role that scholarships play in helping to build relationships between its member countries. All I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is whether it has only been 60 minutes. It seems rather longer to me.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000003"></a>I start, as I think I must, by reminding noble Lords of the context of the announcement by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in March that the FCO would stop funding scholarships for developed Commonwealth countries. A year ago, the FCO went through a process to establish a new strategic framework in place of 10 international strategic priorities in place when the new ministerial team took office in the summer. The Foreign Secretary announced the outcome on 23 January. Essentially, the new strategic framework has three elements, reflecting the FCO&#146;s three core roles: advancing the UK's international policy goals, providing services internationally to UK citizens and businesses, and delivering both through a global network.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000004"></a>The Foreign Secretary also announced that he would put more of the FCO&#146;s overall resources into the four new policy priorities on which his department would focus. This reprioritisation of resources included a reduction of the overall FCO budget for scholarships and fellowships, and a refocusing of that budget, which is a limited budget, in line with the FCO&#146;s policy priorities. As has been said during the debate, the FCO is using its scholarships to build a global network of future leaders who will be friends to this country, particularly in countries which are in political transition  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or are major emerging markets. I should remind the Committee that they include a number of Commonwealth countries.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000005"></a>Top of the 15 countries for the FCO&#146;s Chevening scholarships this year is China&#151;I gently chide the noble Lord, Lord McNally, who said that it was top of the pops little more than for the moment; I think that it will be top of the pops for a while yet. China is followed by India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq, Turkey, Mexico, Malaysia, Iran, South Africa&#151;about which we heard&#151;and Hong Kong. There are more than 100 Chevening scholars from China this year, helped by large co-sponsorship from Hutchison Whampoa in Hong Kong and other organisations. There are more than 30 Chevening scholars from India, and more than 20 from Pakistan&#151;in which I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, will be interested. Concentrating its scholarship resources on the two schemes, Marshall for the USA and Chevening for the rest of the world&#151;including, of course, developing and developed Commonwealth countries, too, except the EU&#151;gives the FCO the flexibility to ensure that its scholarships are targeted at those countries which will be most important to its policy goals over the coming years. I emphasise that the Chevening scholarship scheme continues to available to all developed Commonwealth countries, except the two EU members, although the number of scholarships is admittedly lower than under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Scheme.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000006"></a>The department&#146;s decision to stop funding Commonwealth scholarships for developed Commonwealth countries does not reflect any lessening of the Government&#146;s commitment to that institution. We are a proud member of the Commonwealth and we value the opportunity to work closely with the secretariat on a range of issues. We fully support Commonwealth programmes on a range of topics: democracy, human rights, gender, youth, good offices, and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. We work closely as a Government with the Secretary-General, Mr Sharma, and his team across these programmes.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000007"></a>The Commonwealth is of course about much more than money, but I could read out the contributions that will be paid by the department to the Commonwealth in broad terms during this year. I could also read out the same figures as far as DfID is concerned. I shall not waste the Committee&#146;s time by doing so, but I know that it will accept that the Government and the FCO spend a lot of money on the Commonwealth&#151;and quite right, too. Recent examples where we have collaborated with the secretariat include the Maldives, Pakistan, and Kenya.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000008"></a>The Government recognise the excellence of the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan. The Government&#146;s commitment to the whole scheme has increased from nearly &#163;17 million in 2007 to nearly &#163;18 million this year. Next year the Government will give nearly &#163;19 million and in 2010-11 about &#163;18,300,000, as the continuing cost of FCO-funded Commonwealth scholars reduces. That increase is largely because the Department for International Development is increasing its contribution each year up to 2010. It has increased by &#163;1 million this year to nearly &#163;16 million and will  


<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>increase to nearly &#163;17.5 million in 2009, and then to &#163;17.5 million in 2010. That is the contribution of DfID to this plan. That was what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister promised at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kampala in November 2007. It reflects the importance the Government attach to helping developing Commonwealth countries.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000009"></a>Of all the outstanding speeches, I shall mention two. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, talked with great passion about Indian and Pakistani doctors who have done brilliantly in this country, and the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, talked about South Africa with great affection and skill. We are talking in each of those three cases about developing countries, none of which is part of the eight countries whose scholarships the FCO used to meet. These are developing countries. The criticism that may be made of the Government as regards stopping the &#163;2 million each year for the developed Commonwealth countries is one thing&#151;and the criticism has been well made. But it must be remembered that as regards developing countries the amount of money that will be spent, not by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but by DfID, which is an associated branch of Her Majesty's Government, is going up, as the Prime Minister promised at Kampala. I would argue that the overall government commitment to Commonwealth scholarships and fellowships will have increased&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08111896000012"></a>I am also delighted to be able to say that, since the noble Lord, Lord Luce, tabled his Question for Short Debate in the summer, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has decided to provide funding for developed Commonwealth countries through the plan, at &#163;400,000 each year. This will be for new doctoral awards in 2009 and 2010, allowing 16 new PhD scholars in the first year, the same number as the FCO is funding this year, and a minimum of six in the second year. The universities will match these costs through to 2012-13.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000013"></a>The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has agreed to provide this funding because it recognises that the availability of funding for PhD students from developed Commonwealth countries is important to the competitiveness of UK universities&#151;a point made time and again, very effectively, in this debate&#151;in attracting the best international research talent.

There is much competition, particularly from the USA. It is important to have as broad a base as possible from which our institutions can choose their researchers. To remove the option to award scholarships to research students from the developing Commonwealth would work against this and so disadvantage our own important institutions.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000014"></a>Although the FCO has reduced its overall budget it is still spending more than &#163;79 million in the three years 2008-11, which represents&#151;the Committee will forgive me for using these figures&#151;respectively 19.8 per cent, 17.25 per cent and 15.25 per cent of its annual discretionary programme budget, and there are nearly 1,000 Chevening scholars in this academic year 2008-09. There should be a similar number in 2009-10. The Chevening scholarship scheme remains one of the largest of its kind in the world and is more about future leaders than the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, which places greater emphasis on academic excellence. There is an argument to be had about that but the Government have gone down the leadership route, as has been acknowledged&#151;although not always approved of&#151;in the debate.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000015"></a>The FCO is further refining Chevening&#146;s selection procedures and working with co-sponsors to ensure it is targeting the right people. Chevening connects scholars and alumni probably more directly to our network of diplomatic missions than, frankly, the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, and it is less expensive student for student because it is a one-year award or an award for even shorter courses. Through it the FCO can direct resources in a way that more accurately reflects our priorities.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000016"></a>The FCO is continuing to develop the Chevening fellowship scheme, selecting more than 200 mid-career professionals a year for a range of tailor-made 12-week courses in this country directly related to FCO policy goals. This scheme is leading to long-term beneficial relationships between us and the fellows, helping us to develop global networks in key areas. We thank the universities involved for their positive attitude to the scheme.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is, quite rightly, a great supporter of the Marshall scholarship scheme, and I have had an opportunity to read his various questions on it over the course of the past year. We place a high value on the scholarship scheme for US students and &#163;2.2 million for 2009-10 has just been confirmed to the Commemoration Commission despite the reduction that we are making in the FCO scholarships budget. The noble Lord is right about it not being inflation proof, but it should allow the commission to offer a higher number of scholarships than for 2008-09 because the continuing costs of a smaller number of existing scholars will be lower.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000018"></a>We are developing closer links with Chevening scholars and alumni, including through the introduction of a web-based alumni networking system this autumn. This new website is up-to-date with the most modern networking sites such as Facebook. A few years ago the very idea of that would have been frowned on, but not today. Chevening alumni are a significant part of our overseas audience and the FCO will use that

We hope to do the same with Marshall alumni through the Association of Marshall Scholars in the USA. We also want to strengthen its links with Commonwealth alumni.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luce, asked about the Government&#146;s plans for future funding of Commonwealth scholarships. I am afraid that I am not in a position to make any financial commitments beyond the period covered by the last Comprehensive Spending Review. However, the Government take seriously the need to continue to offer scholarships to attract the best overseas students to the UK. A departmental group is being set up by the FCO, including Universities UK and British business, to map all the UK scholarships on offer to international students, to look for ways of maximising their impact and to explore the possibility for additional funding, including doctoral awards.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000020"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, complained about the Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme and the decision taken in the summer. The new departmental working group on scholarships will also consider the impact of the decision to stop funding for those awards.</p>

<a name="81118-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08111896000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luce&#151;I hope that I am now dealing with his fourth point&#151;asked for the terms of reference. They have not yet been finalised; once they have been, I shall be happy to provide him and all other noble Lords who have spoken with a copy as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08111875000014"></a><a name="81118-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81118-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08111875000165"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Kevan Jones) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08111875000015"></a>I wish to inform the House of the outcome of a competitive exercise for the provision of inpatient mental health care for our serving Armed Forces personnel. </p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08111875000016"></a>The Ministry of Defence recognises mental illnesses as potentially serious and disabling conditions, but most can be successfully treated. Our mental health services are configured to provide community-based mental health care in line with the guidelines and standards set by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the national service frameworks.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08111875000017"></a>We do this primarily by supporting our GPs with specialist outpatient assessment and treatment at our military regional departments of community mental health centres sited in military bases. Care is provided by either military mental health care professionals or civilians employed by the MoD. This means that serving personnel usually remain with their units and receive outpatient care in a military environment.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08111875000018"></a>Inpatient care may be required in a small number of cases. Where this is necessary, it is provided regionally in specialised psychiatric units under a contractual arrangement. Since 2003 this contract has been with the Priory Group.  The contract with the Priory Group has worked very well and was extended for two years. In line with our usual commercial practice a competitive tendering exercise has now been conducted in order to place a new contract.  I am now in a position to announce the outcome of that competition.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08111875000019"></a>The evaluation process produced a clear winner&#151;we have awarded the contract to the South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust, which offered a powerful grouping of NHS providers to deliver a nationwide service.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08111875000020"></a>The South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust proposal offers a bespoke admission and treatment service based upon the needs of the MoD and of the individual patient.  They offer a single point of contact for admissions and access to a series of dedicated beds across the United Kingdom.  South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust describes its services as culturally sensitive and has proposed an inpatient care pathway that provides assessment and treatment in environments that would allow service patients to be accommodated in a separate area and to separate themselves from the civilian NHS population if they wished this and it was clinically appropriate. The South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust&#146;s philosophy and approach to inpatient care is consistent with that of the MoD and with generally accepted best practice: rapid assessment, stabilisation and return to care within the community as soon as possible.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS70"></a><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column WS70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08111875000021"></a>The South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust will provide locally based care through a network consisting of a group of five foundation trusts, one trust in the process of foundation trust application and one NHS Scotland trust.  These are: Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, NHS Grampian, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, Somerset Partnership NHS Trust, and Hampshire Partnership NHS Trust.  All of the trusts selected are rated good or excellent for their quality of care in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s recent annual health check.  The South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust will act as the network lead and, as such, will guarantee the quality and governance of the services provided.  The foundation trust status of the winning bidder offers MoD access to services that are subject to unprecedented levels of corporate governance and are monitored by an independent regulator.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08111875000022"></a>The MoD will work with the South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust to implement a transition to the new contract that will cause minimal disruption to current and future patients.  The Priory Group has agreed to extend the existing contract until the end of February 2009 to allow for a transition period.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08111875000023"></a>When combined with care provided on operations by our deployed military mental health professionals, in military primary care and in military community mental health centres, I am confident that this contract represents a continuation of the combination of the best of external and internal providers to deliver mental health care to national standards of excellence.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08111875000025"></a>I set out in my Statements to Parliament on 8 October and 13 October the details of the Government's recapitalisation scheme. All UK incorporated banks&#151;including UK subsidiaries of foreign institutions&#151;with substantial business in the UK, and building societies are eligible to apply for the scheme. To date, RBS Group Plc and, subject to their merger proceeding, Lloyds TSB Plc and HBOS Group Plc have announced the terms on which they are participating. Those terms are set out in detail in the Placing and Open Offer agreements and in the preference share subscription agreements. I have today arranged for final, signed versions of the agreements to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08111875000026"></a>I now set out the detail of dealing with future applications to the scheme from those banks which are currently raising capital, either by an agreement with HM Treasury or otherwise, and which, for whatever reason, may seek to negotiate a substantively new proposal or new agreement with HM Treasury about the terms of any recapitalisation. Detailed terms of participation would remain a matter for discussion with the board of the institution concerned, taking

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08111875000027"></a>The objective of the recapitalisation scheme is to ensure that each eligible institution has sufficient capital to sustain confidence in the institution. Institutions should therefore have a sufficient buffer of capital above the minimum requirement both to absorb losses that might ensue from a downturn and to continue lending on normal commercial criteria. In assessing any proposals in relation to eligible institutions, HM Treasury will continue to focus on three key objectives:</p>
maintaining financial stability;safeguarding the interests of taxpayers; andprotecting depositors and consumers.
<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08111875000028"></a>In providing capital to any eligible institution, HM Treasury, on the advice of the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority, would need to be satisfied that these three objectives were met.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08111875000029"></a>There is no automatic right of access to the recapitalisation scheme. At a minimum, HM Treasury would expect the following high-level conditions to be met before capital could be offered to any eligible institution:</p>
the institution must have a plan to meet an appropriate level of capitalisation, as determined by the FSA. Information about the FSA approach is set out in its statement of 14 November 2008. It is a matter for the institutions concerned to disclose to the market their capital requirement; the institution must have a sustainable business model and delivery plan; the institution's funding profile, sources and mix must be clear, broad-based and sustainable; andthe senior management team must be credible, with demonstrable ability to deliver the business plan.
<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08111875000030"></a>If the Government are to provide capital, the issue will carry terms and conditions that appropriately reflect the financial commitment made by the taxpayer, including in relation to dividend policy, remuneration, lending policy and wider public policy issues.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08111875000031"></a>To the extent that HM Treasury is asked to subscribe for, or underwrite, an offering for ordinary equity shares, the price would be at a discount to either the market price prevailing at the time of the transaction or, if applicable, the placing price agreed on 13 October, whichever is lower. The percentage discount would not be less than the percentage discounts applied in transactions already announced.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08111875000032"></a>To the extent that HM Treasury is asked to subscribe for preference shares or other tier 1 instruments, the appropriate coupon will be based on prevailing market conditions, with due regard given to the rate at which eligible institutions have announced the issue of such instruments most recently.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08111875000033"></a>With respect to fees, HM Treasury would charge an appropriate level of fees for any underwriting commitments, again paying due regard to the fees paid in recent transactions involving eligible institutions.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08111875000034"></a>Any transaction would, of course, be subject to the necessary regulatory and legal clearances, and would need to comply with the European Commission's decision of 13 October 2008 authorising the recapitalisation scheme under EU state aid rules.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08111875000039"></a>The guidance also confirms the Government&#146;s intention to legislate to:</p>
extend the number of relevant partners under a duty to co-operate to include schools&#151;including academies&#151;sixth-form and FE colleges, and Jobcentre Plus; make the children&#146;s trust board a statutory body; andgive the board responsibility for producing the Children and Young People&#146;s Plan, which will then be owned by the full children&#146;s trust partnership.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08111875000042"></a>On 22 May 2008 the Minister for Pensions Reform announced that John Elbourne had been asked to examine the current arrangements for the engagement of older people and the ability of those arrangements to inform policy and actions of government at all levels. Specifically, this was to include examining better government for older people.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08111875000043"></a>John Elbourne will today publish his report at 3 pm on the Department for Work and Pensions website.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08111875000044"></a>The purpose of the review has been to examine whether there are any structural and/or organisational changes that can aid progress and enhance opportunities for older people to make themselves heard.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08111875000045"></a>The report makes a range of recommendations for improving older people&#146;s engagement with Government, which are: establishing a national advisory forum for older people; enhancing the role that regional government offices play in supporting and developing engagement with older people; setting up regional forums to support local authorities; and building on the support for older people's forums around the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08111875000048"></a>As I undertook to do in my Statement to the House on 16 October 2008, yesterday I again met the main energy supply companies to discuss my concerns about a number of issues in the retail energy markets.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08111875000049"></a>I reiterated my concerns about findings in the Ofgem report on the energy supply market, about the charges facing electricity-only customers and customers paying excessively high charges for their particular payment method. I made clear the importance the Government attach to progress on these and other issues.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08111875000050"></a>As part of the due process I referred to in my October Statement, the companies have until 1 December to provide a formal response to the Ofgem findings.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08111875000058"></a>On 8 May 2008 we introduced through the Standards Committee (England) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1085) the reformed conduct regime for local authority members, in which responsibility for standards of conduct and dealing with allegations of misconduct by members is largely devolved to each council&#146;s independently chaired standards committee. In this regime the Standards Board for England has the role of a strategic regulator, and only the most serious cases of misconduct by members are to be investigated by the standards board and determined by case tribunals of the Adjudication Panel for England, established under the Local Government Act 2000.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08111875000060"></a>In particular, these regulations ensure that from 12 December 2008 case tribunals will have the power to censure a member, require them to apologise, attend training, or enter into a process of conciliation. These sanctions are currently available only to councils&#146; standards committees. Making these sanctions available to case tribunals will allow them to deal proportionately with, for example, a case which, although referred to the tribunal on the grounds that it is very serious, the tribunal concludes is a less serious matter.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08111875000061"></a>The regulations also make provision about certain administrative procedures to be followed in relation to cases before the adjudication panel and its case tribunals.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08111875000065"></a>The Secretary of State for Health and I today welcome the publication of the final report of the independent review of child and adolescent mental health services.

<a name="81118-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08111875000066"></a>This has been a challenging review. Children&#146;s mental health is an area where there are strong views and perspectives.

<a name="81118-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08111875000068"></a>We welcome the fact that the review carried out its task in such a comprehensive manner, undertaking an intensive programme of investigation, including a national call for evidence and extensive consultation with children, young people and their families throughout the process. The fact that the review&#146;s recommendations respond to the concerns of users of these vital services gives its report added weight and importance.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="08111875000069"></a>We agree with the review&#146;s analysis that, whilst considerable improvements have been made to the support and services delivered in this area, a great deal of change still needs to take place at all levels of the system to support the delivery of integrated child- and family-focused mental health and psychological well-being services that are organised around children&#146;s and young people&#146;s needs.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="08111875000070"></a>The review&#146;s report identifies the important changes that are required if we are to see real improvements in children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being. The review sets out a clear and ambitious vision of what this change would look like for children, young people and their families accessing universal, targeted and specialist services, highlighting the importance of:</p>
everyone having a good understanding of what mental health and psychological well-being is, how they can promote resilience in children and young people and where children, young people and their families can go if they need more information and help;children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being services being viewed and working as a single service that is organised around children, young people and their families&#146; needs. With staff working within these services having a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities as well as those of others; staff within universal services being trained and supported to provide effective mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention work and where necessary having the knowledge and skills that are needed to refer children and young people swiftly through to specialist services; and staff within specialist services to have an appropriate range of skills and competences so that they can deliver support that is easy to access, readily available and based on the best evidence of what works. 
<a name="81118-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="08111875000071"></a>The review makes 20 challenging recommendations to government across all aspects of children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being services. The Secretary of State for Health and I are delighted to be able to demonstrate our commitment to the immediate implementation of a number of these recommendations.

we will set up a national advisory council for children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being. In line with the review&#146;s recommendations, the council will act as a champion for children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being issues, advise government on implementing the recommendations that have been set out in the review&#146;s report, and hold government to account on our successful delivery. We are delighted that Dame Jo Williams, former chief executive of Mencap, has agreed to chair the review and Dr Lesley Hewson, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and director of CAMHS, Bradford District Care Trust, is to act as vice-chair; and we will improve support for practitioners delivering services for children and young people and drive culture change and consistency at national, regional and local levels. We will develop a national support programme. This will build on the work of the national CAMHS support service and field forces working in this area. The national support programme will co-ordinate these organisations to give everyone working in this area the support they need to achieve the aims of the CAMHS review.

the roll-out of phase two of the targeted mental health support pathfinder programme (TaMHS) in an additional 55 local authority areas. This will enable a further 100 to 150 secondary schools and their feeder primary schools to deliver additional support in school to promote all children&#146;s psychological well-being and additional help in and through the school for children and their families at risk of problems. It will also provide additional funding for schools to forge closer working links with specialist CAMHS. Children will benefit from schools&#146; increased ability to identify risks to mental health at an early stage and ensure that they receive prompt access to the help and support they need;additional funding for local authorities already delivering the targeted mental health in schools pathfinder, so that they can build on their work in pupil referral units and special schools to meet the needs of this very vulnerable group of children and young people; and

Overall, we share the review&#146;s conclusions on the need to promote greater consistency in access, quality and impact of children&#146;s mental health services. In order to deliver these improvements, we identify four priority areas to be addressed by the national support programme and national advisory council. These are:</p>
awareness of and access to services, through the provision of local information in every area that clearly sets out the support that children, young people and their families can expect to receive in their local area; the diffuse leadership and responsibility for children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being that currently exists at a national, regional and local level, for example through the strengthening of children&#146;s trusts; waiting times, where we are aware of the significant negative impact that having to wait a long time to receive treatment can have on children and young people&#146;s recovery, so look to the national support programme to drive further improvements in this area; andtransitions to adult services, where we agree with the review that urgent work is required to identify, understand and overcome the barriers to smooth transitions between mental health services for young people and services for adults.
<a name="81118-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="08111875000076"></a>We will give further consideration to the remaining six recommendations from the review in conjunction with the National Advisory Council, in order to develop an appropriate response and effective solutions that reflect local and national priorities.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="08111875000086"></a>Recommendation 1: To improve leadership and accountability there needs to be a clearer articulation of roles and responsibilities for all relevant people working in children&#146;s services at local, regional and national level. To achieve this, the legislation on children&#146;s trusts should be strengthened so that each trust is required to set out in its children and young people's plan how it will ensure the delivery of the full range of children&#146;s services for mental health and psychological well-being across the full spectrum of need in its area. We would recommend that areas set up local multi-agency boards for children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being or other appropriate local arrangements to facilitate this.</p>

The proposals include placing the children&#146;s trust governance arrangements (the CT board) on a statutory footing and placing responsibility for the CYPP on the partnership board rather than on the local authority as now. Revised statutory guidance will emphasise that children&#146;s trusts should consider as part of their wider joint strategic needs assessment the psychological well-being and mental health needs of children and young people in their area, through effective joint-working between primary care trusts, local authorities and other strategic partners. </p>

Following the expiry of his previous term of appointment, I have reappointed Richard Mackenzie CB as a member of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland for a further term of appointment, to expire on 31 October 2012.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_9"></a>
<a name="08111875000154"></a><a name="81118-wms0004.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81118-wms0004.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08111875000174"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Kitty Ussher) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="08111875000155"></a>Following the judgment of the Law Lords in the case of Heffernan&#151;R (on the application of Heffernan) v the Rent Service&#151;on Wednesday 30 July 2008, the Government will lay amendments to the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) Order 1997 and the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) (Scotland) Order 1997 in order to clarify the rules that enable rent officers to define the local rental market areas which help determine entitlement to housing benefit.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="08111875000156"></a>The way in which the geographical areas, or localities, for assessing housing benefit are determined has a direct impact on the amount of benefit individual customers receive. If applied, the judgment would result in a dramatic increase in the number of localities nationally, as each would be based on a limited number of neighbourhoods. These new locality boundaries would not necessarily be the same as those that existed before the rent services carried out their most recent reviews of boundaries and could result in a large number of low-income tenants finding that housing benefit no longer covers their rent. Without amendment to the rent officers order, this would now happen automatically. This is not our policy intent, which is why amendments will be laid at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_133"></a><a name="08111875000157"></a>The routine locality reviews that were undertaken by the rent services in 2006-07 under the rent officers order resulted in fewer localities across the country as a whole. These reviews were undertaken in consultation with local authorities, which have access to a discretionary fund to compensate individual tenants in hardship cases. The vast majority of the new boundaries were agreed by local authorities. The amendments of the rent officers order will enable the rent services to review the boundaries in those localities where local consensus was not achieved. In any year, the rent services are committed to reviewing 25 per cent of all locality boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="08111875000158"></a><a name="81118-wms0004.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="81118-wms0004.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08111875000175"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Iain Wright) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="08111875000159"></a>The Government are today publishing a new rough sleeping strategy, <I>No One Left O</I><I>ut&#151;</I><I>C</I><I>ommunities ending rough sleeping.</I> Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="08111875000160"></a>Ten years ago, the Government set out an ambitious plan to cut rough sleeping by two-thirds. Thanks to the determination of our partners in local authorities, the voluntary sector and other agencies dealing with the homeless, we achieved that goal several years ago. There have been significant and sustained reductions in the number of people who sleep rough on the streets.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="08111875000161"></a>Our success in tackling rough sleeping so far is something in which we lead the world and of which this country can be proud, but we are not complacent. Ten years on from our first strategy, we are determined to make further progress. Our vision is to end rough sleeping once and for all. We know that many of our partners share this determination, and we will work across government to make progress.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_137"></a><a name="08111875000162"></a>This new strategy signals our intent to work with our partners to end rough sleeping once and for all by 2012. To make this happen we want to make sure that in every part of the country people get the help they need, so no one has to sleep rough. Services will act promptly to prevent rough sleeping from occurring in the first place, or to bring people in from the streets as quickly as possible. People who have slept rough will be supported to improve their health, consider employment options and rebuild their lives.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_138"></a><a name="08111875000163"></a>After a decade of progress we have learnt from our experiences, and are more confident and determined than ever that we can make progress towards this goal, building on the commitment, innovation and energy of our partners across government, in local authorities, the third sector and communities. The strategy sets out a 15-point action plan for the next four years. The tougher economic climate may bring new pressures and challenges, but I am confident that the strategy prepares us well for the future. The Government are investing &#163;200 million to prevent homelessness and tackle rough sleeping.</p>

<a name="81118-wms0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_139"></a><a name="08111875000164"></a>This new strategy will help us make the final push, ending rough sleeping once and for all.</p>

The Government's most recent announcements are set out below.</p>

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="08111878000051"></a>On 13 May 2008, the Chancellor announced further support for low- and middle-income families for 2008-09. For the current tax year, income tax personal allowances will be increased by &#163;600 for all taxpayers under 65. Around 22 million basic rate taxpayers will benefit from this change.</p>

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="08111878000052"></a>This year, adults aged 60 and over will benefit from an additional payment of &#163;50, and those aged over 80 from an additional payment of &#163;100 to be paid alongside the winter fuel payment. In addition, extra help for the vulnerable this winter will be provided by an increase in cold weather payments, which will triple from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25 for this winter.</p>

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="08111878000053"></a>On 17 July 2008, the Chancellor announced a postponement of the 2p per litre increase in fuel duty that was planned to take place on 1 October 2008 to support families and businesses in the face of sharp rises in world oil prices. This means that main road fuel duty rates will remain at 50.35p per litre after 1 October this year. The duty is 17 per cent lower in real terms than in 1999.</p>

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="08111878000054"></a>On 11 September, the Government announced a new &#163;1 billion package of energy efficiency measures, including at least 50 per cent off a range of energy saving measures for all households, with 11 million of the most vulnerable households qualifying for these free of charge.</p>

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="08111878000055"></a>On 2 September, the Government announced reforms to the support for mortgage interest (SMI) system&#151;SMI is paid to people on income support, pension credit and income-based jobseeker's allowance to help to meet the interest payments on their mortgage&#151;to more accurately reflect the value of people's property

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="08111878000056"></a>Disabled people have access to a range of benefits in recognition of their extra support needs. The employment and support allowance offers financial help and personal support to disabled people who are out of work, and disability living allowance provides a contribution towards the extra costs arising from disability. The disability premium in income-related benefits is also paid in recognition that the least well-off disabled people need additional help.</p>

As a result, we are making a number of changes in the forthcoming Equality Bill, including:</p>
allowing employment tribunals to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases, which will benefit the wider workforce and help to prevent similar types of discrimination occurring in the future;transferring disability discrimination school education cases in Scotland (including education cases relating to admissions and exclusions) to the Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland, and;making provision for the use of expert assessors to advise judges in court cases involving discrimination across all the protected grounds.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="08111878000059"></a>In addition, if practical, we want to allow discrimination claims to be brought on multiple grounds.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="08111878000060"></a>The new single public sector equality duty will, like the current race, disability and gender equality duties, be enforced by the Commission for Equality and Human Rights or by judicial review.</p>

<a name="81118w0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="08111878000061"></a>We recognise that strong and effective enforcement is necessary to make a reality of legal rights. The changes that we are making in the Equality Bill will help us to tackle discriminatory policies and practices in a more systematic way.</p>
