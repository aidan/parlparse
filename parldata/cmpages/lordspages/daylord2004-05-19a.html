<a name="40519-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Sixth Form and Further Education Funding</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What plans they have to ensure that funding for school sixth forms matches that for further education colleges.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My Lords, the Government have set out their investment plans for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, which should enable the Learning and Skills Council to increase funding for further education significantly. For the academic year 2003&#150;04, core funding rates per qualification increased by 3 per cent for school sixth forms and by 4.5 per cent for further education colleges, on a broadly comparable basis. Our expenditure plans to 2006 should see that trend continue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that for reasons of differences in accounting conventions, the seeming difference between the money going to school sixth forms and to colleges is not what it appears? The LSC itself confirms that the 10 per cent funding gap between the two remains and will continue. Given the expansion in numbers in further education colleges and sixth-form colleges expected as a result of the rolling out of educational maintenance allowances next year, can she assure us that colleges will have the resources that they need to fund the increased demand that will be made on them during that period?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is absolutely correct: the funding gap is approximately 10 per cent. We see that being closed; progress is being made; we anticipate that that will continue and the resources are available in the LSC budget.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  My Lords, next year, the Government will be spending &#163;5 billion on school buildings, but only &#163;400 million on college buildings. Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be adequate facilities and equipment to meet the needs of the extra students arriving in colleges? Will she confirm <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_766"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 766</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that such colleges are especially beneficial environments for many children in care and leaving care, because of their greater vocational bias?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I can confirm that &#163;400 million is indeed being provided&#151;an increase from &#163;231 million in 2002. Part of the building schools for the future programme is to enable us to work closely on the strategy for 14 to 19 year-olds between colleges and schools to enable us to develop appropriate resources. That includes developing the skills of looked-after young people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, given the recent report that showed that about 3,500 children or youngsters from schools were not getting places at our top universities because they were not applying for them, should not the Government be focusing their attention more on what is happening in sixth-form colleges and schools, rather than attacking the universities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, that is an interesting question, although, if I may say so politely, slightly tangential to the original Question. I can tell the noble Lord that, as we debated during discussion of the Higher Education Bill, it is not an &quot;either/or&quot; but a &quot;both/and&quot;. It is critical that we support our children and young people in whatever educational setting, allowing them to use their qualifications, skills and abilities to get as far as they possibly can and to have the best life that they possibly can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister reassure me that the funding gap&#151;especially in salaries&#151;between teachers in sixth-form colleges as opposed to further education colleges will be addressed sooner rather than later? I welcome the extra money that she said that the Learning and Skills Council will receive, but she will know that it is an increasing problem for FE colleges to keep the staff that they need for their A-level courses. I declare an interest as a governor at such a college.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness makes an important point. The figures for additional resources that I gave of 3 per cent and 4.5   per cent take account of money being made available to ensure pay and pension funding.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, what is the comparable per capita funding for sixth-form college students and further education students? I am bound to say that my impression is that sixth-form colleges do rather better on per capita terms.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I forgot to   say happy birthday to the noble Baroness, Lady   Maddock; I gather that it is her birthday today.
</p>

<a name="40519-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The figures that I have for the published base rate funding for AS/A2-level provision for 2002&#150;03 are &#163;663   per student in the FE college sector and &#163;734 per <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_767"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 767</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

student in schools, which, as I said, is approximately a 10   per cent gap. So the noble Lord is absolutely right about the gap.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that last year, the college sector increased enrolment by 7 per cent, compared to 2 per cent in the school sector, and that some 50 colleges that   increased their numbers partly in pursuit of government incentives&#151;there was a desire to do so&#151;are still waiting for the extra payments for the students they took on?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I was not aware of that; but I will of course ensure that my honourable friend the Minister responsible is made aware of that.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What their reasons are for not giving BAe Systems plc preferred contractor status for defence procurement projects.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, as was made clear in the Government&#039;s defence industrial policy published in October 2002, competition remains the bedrock of our procurement system as it is often the best means of securing best value. However, competition is a means to an end and not a dogma. Individual procurement strategies are always considered on a case-by-case basis. BAe Systems is well placed to continue to win work from the Ministry of Defence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. The quarrel conducted in the media between the MoD and BAe, our biggest defence contractor, is bad for the MoD, for BAe and, most importantly, for our Armed Forces. What are Ministers doing to restore that important working relationship? Will the Minister confirm that in accordance with the recommendations of the National Audit Office, the MoD will not be managing the contract for the new carriers?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the defence industrial policy is aimed at supporting the whole of the UK defence industry and not individual companies, however distinguished they are. Obviously, we very much value the work of BAe Systems and the equipment and economic benefits that it provides. Our relations with   the workforce of that company continue to be excellent. I pay tribute to their dedication and commitment.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_768"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 768</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>We agree with the company on many issues, but we have different responsibilities. We are government; it is a private company. We cannot always expect to agree on everything. Indeed, if there was no tension in a relationship between a government and any defence company from time to time, that would be a fault rather than a virtue. Of course, companies will always pursue their individual objectives as their shareholders see fit. Our priority remains to deliver capability to the Armed Forces when they need it and at value-for-money for the taxpayer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40519-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, in the Government&#039;s view, what effect would the speculated bid by BT Systems for the shipbuilding and submarine-building arm of BAe shipyards have on the carrier contract?
</p>

<a name="40519-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I know that this is slightly wide of the Question, but will the Government enter into the fray of whether the   joint strike fighters are too heavy to land on the carriers which are being built for them?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040519/text/40519-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is certainly right in one thing: that is certainly wide of the Question that I was asked. I think he knows that I cannot answer those questions today, even if they were absolutely on the ball, which, for once, they are not.
</p>

<a name="40519-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>As far as CVF is concerned, the noble Lord knows that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced on 30 January that we believe that the best means of delivery in the carrier programme is by an alliance approach involving BAe Systems, Thales UK and the Ministry of Defence. As regards shipyards, at this stage that is a matter for the private companies involved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the reasoning that he has given for the action that has been taken does not appear&#151;certainly to me&#151;to be wholly satisfactory? The preferred contractor is a safeguard for our Armed Forces and the security of the type of equipment that is put forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the whole CVF concept&#151;that is, the new aircraft carriers&#151;is an extremely complex and demanding programme in respect of time and cost. The alliance approach, in which we hope that BAe Systems will play a major part along with other companies, will allow us to draw on the strengths, resources and expertise of all parties involved and provide the most effective way of managing both risk and reward. I am sorry that the noble Lord is not yet persuaded, but I shall work on him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Craig of Radley: </b>   My Lords, does the concern of the Government, in not accepting BAe Systems as a preferred contractor, have anything to do with the possibility that that company might amalgamate with an American one?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I have to tell the noble and gallant Lord that negotiations on all of those issues, including the preferred contractor issue, are continuing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_769"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 769</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with the companies involved in order to determine the most effective contracting strategy for the aircraft carriers. It is not our intention to force out any company or supplier. It has nothing to do with what on the whole are fairly unfounded stories in the press this weekend about the short take-off vertical launch (Stovl) version of JSF.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that Her Majesty&#039;s governments&#151;in plural&#151;over a number of years have had a sorry record in safeguarding taxpayers&#039; money as regards MoD contracts with various suppliers? What are the Government doing to ensure that contractors meet times and costs as originally contracted?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, when going back over years in general terms, I do not think that there is a bad record as far as the taxpayer is concerned and certainly not as far as concerns the Armed Forces. They enjoy&#151;they are the first to say so&#151;some of the best equipment in the world, which is the envy of many other countries. So I do not agree with the proposition.

</p>

<a name="40519-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Of course, we can improve our procurement policy. I do not know how long the House has got: not very long, I suspect. We have brought in the principles of Smart Acquisition, which means in short that we work closer with industry. We ensure that we spend enough money and enough time at the assessment phase of each project, so that when we meet the manufacturing phase we do not find those delays and, thus, those cost increases that lead taxpayers and newspapers sometimes to complain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Haskel: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend will be aware that in the recent innovation White Paper there was an item that said that the Government would try to be a purchaser who encourages innovation. Can my noble friend confirm that the MoD is encouraging innovation by its purchasing policy?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, that is certainly what we intend to do. As I said, this is an extremely complex field. A great deal of taxpayers&#039; money is involved here. It is very important that what we do is responsible, but there are new flexible ways of procuring equipment. We have got to find the right way in each case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister seems to be prepared to go slightly wide of the original Question, will he tell the House whether Her Majesty&#039;s Government have paid damages to ETC, the American company that failed utterly to fulfil its contract for building the Royal Air Force centrifuge, which has now fallen into complete abeyance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I knew I had made a mistake in answering the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. I might have known that it would be the noble Lord who would take me up on it. I am about to reply to the noble Lord&#039;s Written Question. It is not the first Written Question on this legitimate subject. I am afraid that I do not have the answer in my head.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether the degree of access for patients to National Health Service dental services is satisfactory.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the Answer is no. That is why the Government are undertaking the most radical overhaul of NHS dentistry since 1948 through legislation in the Health and Social Care Act 2003, which transfers responsibility for commissioning NHS dental services to primary care trusts. In addition, we have targeted &#163;59 million to improve access to NHS dentistry across England: &#163;50   million to primary care trusts for specific local initiatives, and an additional &#163;9 million specifically targeted to the 16 most challenged areas for dental access, supported by the NHS dentistry support teams.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the   Minister for that reply. Is he aware that the British   Dental Association has carried out extensive consultations on the Government&#039;s proposals for the future and has come up with very unfortunate results? The profession as a whole believes that there is a failure to address chronic underfunding in the NHS and it has many other objections. However, all the results add up to serious misgivings and an overwhelmingly negative view of the Government&#039;s proposals. The consultation reveals that 57 per cent of dentists oppose the proposals and that only 15 per cent support them. Nine out of 10 dentists think that they will increase their private work and 60 per cent of them personally intend to reduce their provision of NHS services or to opt out of the NHS altogether. Is that not a very discouraging result of the consultation? What further consultations and changes do the Government propose to address these issues to reassure members of the dental profession?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is worth reflecting on the fact that pretty extensive consultation took place with the professionals&#039; negotiators before the legislation was put before the House in the Health and Social Care Bill. There has been extensive consultation on the   new base contract and the other transitional arrangements, all of which add up to strong protection for three years so that dentists lose no income. The Government are considering the results of that consultation. My honourable friend Rosie Winterton will be responding to it in the not-too-distant future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, with only three-fifths of adults and two-fifths of children in this country registered with an NHS dentist, there is clearly a crisis of confidence among the dental profession. That is why it is so difficult for adults and children to register with an NHS dentist. What the Minister has said does not really address that crisis of confidence, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_771"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 771</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

when the BDA survey shows a huge lack of confidence in the future in terms of contractual obligations. Dentists fear that a treadmill is being created and they have doubts about the PCTs&#039; capacity to cope in those circumstances. What are the Government going to about it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord mentioned treadmills but the treadmill problems of dentistry go back to the debacle of the 1990s contract and the shambles after that, which led to a fee cut and the flight of dentists from the NHS. That was not under this Government. We have been putting more money into dentistry. The fees paid to dentists are up. The numbers of NHS dentists are up by 4,000 since 1997. We have invested &#163;90 million in dentistry during the past year. Oral health in children is improving and the number of people who need an intervention after initial assessment is also up since 1997. We accept that there are problems, but it is not all doom and gloom.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40519-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, why is Scarborough in North Yorkshire having such a problem in recruiting dentists when it is such a pleasant place to live?

<a name="40519-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I must pass on the bad news to the noble Baroness that among the 16 hotspots are places such as the Isle of Wight and the New Forest. Pleasant places to live do not always attract NHS dentists.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hooper: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister reassure me? I understand that in spite of the Government&#039;s funding proposals, which sound quite generous, some primary care trusts may be deliberately delaying the processing of applications for numbers&#151;that is, numbers with a capital &quot;N&quot;&#151;to be added to the list of dentists because they are worried about the costs. Is that a general reaction or an isolated occurrence?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the new contract has not been agreed with the profession or introduced, so I am not sure that PCTs could be worried about the cost of the new contract. Certainly, more money has been put into PCTs during the past year and the allocations have now been agreed for the current year. It is down to PCTs to design as best they can the dental services fit for their particular area.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, it is all very well blaming the last Conservative government, but I rather thought that this Government had been in power for seven years.

</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>

When he applied here to have the right to practise as a dentist, he was told that he will have to wait for at least six weeks.

The three orders that implemented the Export Control Act 2002 came into force only this year, on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_773"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 773</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

3   March and 1 May. The Export Control Act 2002 was the most comprehensive review of strategic export controls for more than 60 years. It introduced significant controls into new areas such as the intangible transfer of technology and the trafficking and brokering of overseas military equipment. The Government are committed to review their operation after three years and will bring forward any necessary changes at that point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Salisbury:</b>  My Lords, while I thank the Minister for his reply, can he confirm that the pledge given at the last general election to control the activities of British arms dealers &quot;wherever they are located&quot; remains unmet because a broker will still be able to transact a deal that is illegal in the United Kingdom simply by crossing the Channel? Furthermore, in view of the fact that this country is the second biggest arms exporter, are Her Majesty&#039;s Government ready to take a lead in brokering the efforts to agree a more comprehensive global arms trade treaty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we believe that we have fulfilled the 2001 manifesto commitment. There is the question of how far we extend the control of trafficking and brokering. We took the decision that this   would apply where there is general international condemnation of particular action, because we think that extra-territorial jurisdiction in other circumstances is extremely difficult to administer. Obviously, trafficking and brokering controls are most effective when they are imposed on a multilateral basis. That is why the UK was the driving force behind the common position on arms brokering under the EU&#039;s common and foreign security policy, agreed in June 2003. That obliges all member states to introduce national controls on arms brokering. On that basis, it is very much more difficult for UK brokers to evade the controls by crossing a UK border.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the right reverend Prelate&#039;s Question refers to arms exports in general and not simply to those from the United Kingdom or by UK citizens. What steps have Her Majesty&#039;s Government taken to give teeth to the OSCE&#039;s code of conduct on arms exports, which was agreed as long ago as 1993 in Budapest, particularly to persuade countries in eastern Europe such as Ukraine and Belarus, which are serious violators of the code, to observe its terms? Could not the international community agree that where illicit weapons are recovered from theatres of conflict, they are examined for serial numbers to see if they can be identified back to the countries of origin?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the UK Government support the goal of an international instrument. That is why we believe that the proposals for an international arms trade treaty are to be welcomed as a contribution to this debate. Of course, we have to make certain that enough of the major arms exporting countries <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_774"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 774</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

support such proposals, because if it is to make sense it has to have that support. In principle, we very much support that initiative.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, is the defence establishment still blocking proposals for the DESC&#151;the Defence Exports Scrutiny Committee?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we have covered this matter at considerable length in previous debates. I have no reason to suppose that the situation has changed, although I am not certain that I would agree about who is blocking what.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us how the Government are exercising end-user control over approved military exports? In particular, will they insist that old weapons are destroyed when new ones are supplied?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, there is clearly an important question in terms of where arms are diverted to different destinations through particular countries for which a licence is given. Where there is any clear risk that a proposed export will be diverted to another end-user, then the licence will be stopped. A licence is now required under the new trade controls to transfer ownership of military goods between overseas countries, so there is a further block there.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40519-03_spnew18"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the arms industry contributes substantially to United Kingdom exports and jobs, and that it is subject to a far more stringent regime than that of competing countries, which are less assiduous in enforcing compliance with end-user certificate systems?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040519/text/40519-04.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the arms industry obviously provides a considerable number of jobs. It is subject to a stringent regime which I think is totally appropriate, given the nature of the industry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that while the Government should take credit for having pioneered the European code on arms exports, it is now essential to have the strictest possible approach to the application of our own criteria when decisions are being made about exports? Does he also   agree that following 9/11 and the reality of international instability that confronts us, we must change the culture from one in which it is okay to export arms unless there is a very good reason for not doing so to one where it is very dangerous to export arms unless there is a very good reason for doing so?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, it is of course government policy that there should be a strict application of the criteria for licences for the export of weapons. The important thing is to apply those criteria <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_775"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 775</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

very stringently. That is government policy, and I think we should act in line with that policy rather than introducing any other criteria.

<a name="40519-04_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>What information they have about the progress of negotiations on a lasting peace settlement in Somalia.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, having reached agreement on a transitional federal charter in February, the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference lost some of its momentum. However, we understand that Foreign Ministers from the region plan to meet Somali leaders in Nairobi tomorrow to discuss a way forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, is there any reason to suppose that if tomorrow in Nairobi the faction leaders agree to a parliament, as they are meant to, they will honour the agreement any better than they have done the ceasefire or the transitional charter? Does the noble Baroness agree that the peace process is fundamentally flawed because of its changing cast of warlords, the repeated violations of the ceasefire, the violations of the UN arms embargo and the general attitude of the players to the process itself? Would it not be an idea for Her Majesty&#039;s Government to suggest repatriating the peace process to Mogadishu, where large bills would not be run up at expensive hotels and the minds of the participants might be concentrated on the security problem?
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I respectfully disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. The Government do not believe that these talks are futile. This process, as the noble Lord has said, has been very long and difficult, and of course there is no guarantee that it will ultimately be successful. However, fear of failure is no reason not to try. We owe it to the Somali people to support all credible efforts to bring peace, stability and democracy to their troubled country. In those terms, I believe that we have a hopeful initiative from the regions&#039; leaders to try to restart these negotiations tomorrow.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, what support have Her Majesty&#039;s Government provided to help the estimated 35,000 internally displaced people resulting from the latest clashes? What support have Her Majesty&#039;s Government given to the UNICEF programme to help to eradicate female mutilation in Somalia?
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, DfID has given up to &#163;6 million of support for humanitarian assistance throughout Somalia, and that is just from last year&#039;s budget.

<a name="40519-04_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, has the monitoring group on the arms embargo reported recently? I am informed that it has not done so for over six months. The flood of arms into Somalia is a serious cause of its destabilisation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I have good news for the noble Lord: the group monitoring the UN arms embargo on Somalia is meeting this afternoon and publishing its latest six-month report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness seen the report of the international crisis group? It suggests that the process should be widened to allow traditional elders, representatives of civil society, religious organisations and private sector figures to participate and that Somali ownership of the talks should be encouraged. Does she not think that the reduction of the number of participants from 355 to 203, as is being done for the meeting tomorrow, is likely to limit Somali participation and reduce the chances that the outcome of that meeting will be accepted by the Somali people as a whole?
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, as the stakeholders have worked so hard to get to the point of restarting the talks, we will make as much effort as we can to support them and to facilitate the talks starting and not failing. However, I note what the noble Lord has said and if these talks fail again&#151;the noble Lord will know that a time limit has now been set for these talks and that they cannot go beyond the end of May&#151;then one of the areas that the international community will consider is the building blocks approach that he suggested. That is an approach in which we work with the diaspora, civil society, business representatives and women&#039;s groups in stable parts of the country to help   them to develop consultative and democratic structures at grassroots level.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, are we not trying to impose our type of democracy on to what is still essentially a clan society? Should we not be trying to get the heads of the clans to work together, especially the minority clans that have been very downtrodden? We have a lot of asylum seekers from those clans in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Countess. Our approach is not to impose our model of democracy. As she rightly says, Somalia is a country built on clans and decisions are made through the leadership of those clans. Therefore, we are looking for an assembly or legislature that will be the end-product <br>&nbsp;<br>

of the talks and that will be built through the clan system. We are doing everything that we can to support that.

<a name="40519-04_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I will get back to the noble Baroness on whether the African Union has played a part. Of course, the region&#039;s frontline countries have played a part, that is the west African and Horn of Africa countries.

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40519-04_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Monro of Langholm </b>   rose to call attention to the Government&#039;s policy on sport and the progress of the London 2012 Olympic Bid; and to move for Papers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, at the outset of this debate I declare an interest as a member of many sports clubs and as past president of three governing bodies. The timing of this debate is most appropriate. We are all extremely pleased that London is on the shortlist for 2012. Of course, that was expected but we must be concerned at the criticism by the IOC on two main counts: transport and public support. I find the latter poll surprising. With the leadership of the bid <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_778"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 778</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

team and with all-party support, I have confidence that we can improve that figure substantially. But we have a problem with transport. We all knew that it was likely to be a stumbling block but the IOC&#039;s criticism is more severe than expected.

</p>

<a name="40519-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>I note that the Prime Minister has given full support to the bid and has offered help with transport. It is an urgent matter because plans for the final bid have to be in place by November 2004, which is not that many months away. So there must be a great deal of action between transport, Treasury and planning if we are going to get the bid on the top line. I think that we should aim for 2011 rather than 2012 to give time for everything to bed in and for the snags to be removed. In this Chamber we are blessed with three   Olympic medallists&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Coe, Lord   Moynihan and Lord Glentoran&#151;who will make contributions from time to time.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>It is important that we begin by looking quickly at Athens in 2004. I am pleased that Simon Clegg of the British Olympic Association, the IOC and press reports confirm that all facilities will be ready. That is good news. We wish our team well and hope it will do even better than it did in Sydney. Of course, we are all worried about security and today&#039;s events show what can happen. However, I am relieved that the Greek Government are taking every possible precaution. I was the government Minister at Munich on the day of the assassination of the Israeli team in 1972 and I know how it affected the spectators and the participants. Two days later, it was wonderful to be cheered up by Mary Peters winning the gold medal.

</p>

<a name="40519-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>So I turn to the 2012 Olympics. Before the Secretary of State made her Statement a year ago, we were critical of the lack of progress and lack of decision. Major disappointments over the World Athletics Championship of 2005, Wembley, Picketts Lock, Sheffield and even the Dome put us on the back foot. But today we want to put all that behind us and look forward to 2012. However, I would ask the Minister to tell me in his reply what has happened to the &#163;21   million that were given to Wembley for the athletics track, which now does not seem to be going to happen.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Twelve months ago, we gave a warm welcome to the Secretary of State. We called for a supremo to head the bid team and we were delighted at the appointment of Barbara Cassani and Keith Mills. I think that the bid team has worked wonders in a year. It has used imagination, it has vision and knows exactly where it is going. It must keep it up until the final vote next year and keep it an all-party, one nation bid.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>We had a word of warning at the weekend. Those who watched the announcement about the football World Cup saw that votes were swung at the very last moment by a major personality. That could happen to us in July of next year. It may be that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will have to metamorphise into Nelson Mandela at that time.

</p>

<a name="40519-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I strongly support the Paralympics that follow on from the main Olympics. I went to see them in Rochester when they were called the &quot;Special Olympics&quot;. I know how much it means to the participants and to the friends and relatives who travel with them. In winding up, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_779"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 779</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

perhaps the Government will give us a rough estimate of the costs for 2012. In particular, can the Minister say how much extra London council tax payers will have to pay?
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>It is always said that sport and politics should not mix, and in some ways they do not. The late Lord Howell&#151;Denis Howell, whom your Lordships all remember so well&#151;and I were Minister of Sport and shadow Minister of Sport for about 11 years between us. We got on extremely well; we discussed appointments and policies together. I do not believe that we ever had a disagreement, which is as it should be.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>However, government involvement in every sport is now great. They fund the four councils&#151;give or take the Scottish and Welsh position&#151;and UK Sport and support the CCPR. That body is immensely important in welding together all the governing bodies of sport in this country. It does a tremendous job. I know that in the future we must deal with its major problem with minimum wages and volunteer coaches, which seems to have reached an impasse with the Treasury.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The Government should keep their distance with regard to major political decisions, which are a matter for the governing body. Therefore I say that they have been right in their handling of the problems of Zimbabwe and the cricket tour. It is inconceivable that England should play in that country in the foreseeable future. The team must not go, whatever the consequences. However, at long last it seems that over the past few days the ICC has accepted that there is a crisis in cricket that must be resolved as quickly as possible. I believe that principles are far more important than money, in which I am supported by the majority of the country.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I am impressed by Sport England&#039;s framework for sport, which was published recently. I congratulate Patrick Carter and Roger Draper on its production. Over the years, sport has been bedevilled with bureaucracy, delay, conferences, reports and so on. We want to see more action with the money available being spent quickly. We must support the countless volunteers who run the sport in this country and do so for nothing. They cannot spend their lives filling in forms in order to obtain grants from the Sports Council. The framework should fast track that process and set up a streamlined system. My suggestion to Sport England is that it should aim for an earlier year than 2020 for its completion&#151;more like 2012 or 2015.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Sir Andrew Foster has just produced an exceptional report on athletics, which should help us regain the momentum of Sydney and replicate the achievements of the four-minute mile. It needs early action from the   various associations within athletics. They should come together in a spirit of harmony, perhaps with David Moorcroft in charge. There is no time to waste when facing an Olympics and world championships thereafter.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Will the Minister say how much of the &#163;41 million legacy given to athletics after the Picketts Lock disaster is now being actively spent on athletics? Tennis is a similar issue. Wimbledon is a huge and successful national sporting event. Much of the profit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_780"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 780</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from the All England Club goes to the Lawn Tennis Association and helps with the new centre at Roehampton.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Let us hope that it will bring in an early result. We have only Tim Henman in the first 100 men or women. It is time, when there are thousands of club players in the country, that some come forward to set the standard we require internationally.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Will the Minister say a word or two about swimming pools? They seem a frightful headache for many local authorities. I know that the costs of running pools are high, but every child should have the chance to learn to swim and far too many do not.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I turn to playing fields, on which I have sparred with the Minister previously. In its 1997 manifesto, the Labour Party gave a commitment to stop the sale of playing fields, which it reaffirmed in 1998. It is difficult to obtain statistics on playing fields because the base is flexible and sometimes excludes playing fields made into sports halls. But in 1999 to 2003, applications increased from 590 to 1,297. Of those 1,297 applications in 2003, 807 were approved to remove the playing field and turn it into some other development. That is a long way from the manifesto promise.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>In the same period, the Government approved 174   out of 176 applications for areas of 0.2 hectares&#151;roughly the same size as a football field. It does not seem that we are doing much about retaining playing fields in schools. Indeed, the Government approved 36   applications against the specific advice of Sport England. Alison Moore-Gwyn and Elsa Davies of the National Playing Field Association are most active in keeping the playing fields of this country at the forefront of policy. They think we should have a proper independent audit of what is going on in the playing field world so that we can get some facts and not a whole lot of smudging as from Written and oral Questions that I have asked in the past.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>While we are on the subject of playing fields, I hope that the Government are giving all the help they can to school sports. I know that they announced a programme of &#163;578 million two years ago, but according to the last figure that I was able to obtain only &#163;4.6 million has been spent. Why is it taking so long to get money spent on schools where we want it to be spent?
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Team games are so important in schools. They bring out leadership and develop character. They teach people to understand what umpires and referees are about. They are also so good at developing activities in outward bound fields. It is amazing how children can achieve something that they never thought was possible when they are taken to an outward bound event such as climbing hills or mountains. The development of character in education is desperately important.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I want to close with a quick word on drugs, which is such an important issue and so difficult to quantify. I was concerned that Michelle Verroken, who was for 18   years head of the anti-doping unit, was recently dispensed with. She was interviewed by the Select Committee in another place, where she said that her <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_781"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 781</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

integrity was not for negotiation. Was she being asked to make some changes to the arrangements for drug testing? I want to know, because so many governing bodies find every conceivable excuse for trying to support their competitors against the drug efforts of that team.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Not all is doom and gloom, I am glad to say; far from it. We must be proud of what we have achieved in recent years and the leadership that we give to sport. Clive Woodward has done so much for rugby. Sweetenham has done so much for swimming. Rowing, sailing and equestrianship are going well. I am sure that all those sports and others such as cycling will be bringing back medals from Sydney.
</p>

<a name="40519-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>In golf we have three of the four great trophies: the Walker Cup, the Ryder Cup, the Solheim Cup and with luck next month we might also have the Curtis Cup. Many things are going well and I am not in any way criticising&#151;I am here to say &quot;well done&quot; to the governing bodies that run those sports. We must aim high at the stars, support our volunteers and coaches; but, above all, we must get on with things quickly and spend the money available wisely and as soon as possible. Action will bring results, and who knows what Great Britain can achieve? I beg to move for Papers.

<a name="40519-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Paul: </b>   My Lords, first, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Monro, on initiating such an important and timely debate. Just yesterday we heard from the International Olympic Committee that London is on the shortlist as a candidate city to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We now have an opportunity to go forward in this exciting competition.

</p>

<a name="40519-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will join me in congratulating all those involved in building a bid and getting us to this point in such a tough field of competition.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>At this point I would like to declare an interest as a board member of the London Development Agency, a key funder and partner in delivering the Games. I am also a member of the board of the bidding organisation, London 2012, and a member of its Ethics Advisory Group.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>We have heard today about the tremendous potential the Olympics have for not only delivering excellence in sport but creating the inspiration among young and old alike to participate in sport at every level.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Staging the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London would be a tremendous honour. It would provide a platform for us to get people active, thereby improving health, social cohesion, and even performance in schools and productivity at work.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The Olympics are, of course, the biggest sporting event in the world. However, perhaps one of the greatest strengths of London&#039;s 2012 Olympic bid is that it is about so much more than sport. It is also the greatest cultural festival. It gives us a unique chance to celebrate Britain&#039;s rich cultural diversity and promote London as the creative capital of the world. I know, for <br>&nbsp;<br>

example, that the Asian community is very proud and most enthusiastic about this opportunity, as are all Britain&#039;s other communities.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The London Development Agency, together with London&#039;s government and central government, is committed to a large-scale regeneration project in the lower Lea Valley&#151;part of east London that has some of the most deprived wards in the United Kingdom. This area has been neglected for too long. Levels of ill health in the lower Lea Valley are very high. Residents in Newham can expect to live five years less than their not so far away neighbours in Kensington and Chelsea. This is unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The Olympics would give us a chance vastly to improve the physical environment by doubling the amount of green space in the area. They would help to create thousands of new jobs, new homes and business opportunities. It is not just east London that would benefit. The whole of London and the rest of the UK will reap huge rewards if we are fortunate enough to host the 2012 Games. I hope that noble Lords will allow me to congratulate my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Culture and the Mayor for London on their great support, enthusiasm and encouragement and on having made it possible to get so far.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Business sectors such as tourism and hospitality, food and creative industries and, of course, the construction sector, would receive a major boost along with thousands of other potential business benefits. What is also so crucial to London&#039;s bid is its legacy. London&#039;s bid provides a sustainable legacy for communities after the Games, not just in the world-class sports facilities they would leave behind, but also the jobs, homes, improved environment and lasting public health benefits.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I would also like to make a special mention of the Paralympic Games. This country&#039;s commitment to disability sport over many years has helped to establish the Paralympic Games in the global consciousness. It will be an honour to welcome the whole Olympic family when they come to visit. The country has taken on a great challenge in bidding for the Olympic and Paralympic Games&#151;one that many thought we were not up to.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>After yesterday&#039;s announcement it is clear that huge efforts have been made to get us this far, and that there is the commitment to see the job through to the end, hopefully with a successful conclusion in Singapore in July 2005.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>For those who question our ability to succeed this is a unique opportunity for us to prove that we can deliver the best Games ever. I call on noble Lords to play their full leadership role in getting behind this bid.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I apologise for the fact that I shall leave the Chamber for about half an hour to attend the Finance Bill sub-committee meeting to hear evidence. However, I shall return shortly.

<a name="40519-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the optimistic speech of the noble Lord, Lord Paul. I hope that I can follow in the same spirit.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Today&#039;s is a debate on sport with special reference to the Olympic bid. I congratulate my noble friend Lord   Monro of Langholm not only on securing the debate on a subject that he has made very much his own and on the manner in which he opened the debate, but also on his impeccable timing. He sat on the Conservative Front Bench in the Commons both in government and opposition for more than half his 33   years in the other place, and he served most of that time either as sports Minister or as the opposition spokesman on sport for a whole Parliament. His interests in particular sports are manifold, as he has demonstrated today. He has done your Lordships&#039; House and, indeed, sport a very notable service today.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Around the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, Arthur Quiller-Couch wrote a notable parody of Browning&#039;s poem, &quot;How We Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix&quot; in the form of an account of how the horse, Wooden Spoon, John Jones up, won the Jubilee Cup. Like Browning&#039;s it is a narrative poem with John Jones as the narrator, but it is a marvellous farrago and gallimaufry of sporting reference. I quote a verse at random:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>      &quot;The Lascar made the running but he didn&#039;t amount too much,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>      For Old Oom Paul was quick on the ball, and headed it back to touch;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>      And the whole first flight led off with the right as The Saint took up the pace</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>      And drove it clean to the putting green, and trumped it there with an ace&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>It serves as a paradigm for today&#039;s debate both because, like today, it embraces all sport but also because the steeplechase it recounts is not dissimilar to the exhilarating, oscillating ride the Government have in mounting the London Olympic bid.

</p>

<a name="40519-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Like many in your Lordships&#039; House, I am old enough to remember the 1948 Olympics, the year of Fanny Blankers-Koen and Emil Zatopek. Our own team had   roots in the multifariousness of sports which Quiller-Couch celebrated and which we debate today. Our entry in the 100 metres final, Alastair McCorquodale, had opened the bowling for Harrow against Eton at Lord&#039;s. C B Holmes, who I watched play wing three-quarter to dramatic effect for England v Scotland in the first Calcutta Cup Match at Twickenham after the war in the snow was, as I recall, certainly in our sprint relay team and may have been in the 200 metres relay final as well.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I had myself urged once in Cabinet Committee that we should go for the 2008 Games not only because of its being the centenary of our first Games but also because of the remarkable conclusion to the Olympic Marathon that year. No doubt dithering about Crossrail would have been as much a problem then as now&#151;and I acknowledge, of course, the part played by the anti-Crossrail lobbying group from Tower <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_784"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 784</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Hamlets in the Private Bill Committee upstairs in the other place. But even with the extra four years we have not so far got our act together.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I dare say that the Minister in reply will reasonably play the card of yoking the Government&#039;s predecessors in the dock with the present Government; but this administration has now been in office for seven years and no one could possibly say that the past seven years   have been used to the best possible advantage on the Underground, either for the good of Londoners or for the good of this bid. If the Minister exculpates the Government and transfers the blame to the Mayor, the latter is not only the creature of this Government in legislative terms, but has been invited back into the bosom of the Labour Party on the strength of his performance of his first four years in office.

</p>

<a name="40519-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>All of that, however, is in the past. We are now in the present and what we need to know now is how the Government are going to put on a catch-up act, not only to eliminate the margin behind Paris and Madrid, but then to surpass them. I remark neutrally that I am glad that the hotels of my former constituency and of neighbouring ones are level-pegging already with those of Madrid and Paris. It is critical that the Government should put out of their minds any idea that the tombstone to our bid should bear the word &quot;IRAQ&quot;, even though of course preoccupation with Iraq held up Cabinet consideration of the bid in early 2003. If we set out with a sour grapes scenario, we shall fail; and that failure will be more serious because it will weaken our resolve in Iraq as well. If we believe in the Iraq policy, a measure of that belief will be the conviction behind this bid. We await the Minister&#039;s reply with interest.

</p>

<a name="40519-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Because the debate is wider than just the bid, I want to raise three other matters. The first is the Government&#039;s recent revisiting of our overall national failure to achieve five half-hour periods of physical activity each week. That was a recommendation derived from the Government&#039;s 1998 Acheson report on health inequality, which found that 75 per cent of women and 63 per cent of men failed   those minimum guidelines. Two weeks ago the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, teased by my noble friend Lady   Hanham in a Labour debate on central government help for local communities by drawing attention to the absence of Conservative speakers in the debate, apart from herself. That was the only Wednesday in the past four weeks in which I did not speak in both debates; so let me make amends now with a quotation from the King&#039;s Fund&#039;s Five Year Health Check of April 2002:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;In summary, Labour has stimulated a substantial volume of local and neighbourhood based activities aimed at strengthening communities, improving public services and enhancing the quality of life&#151;all of which may help to narrow the &#039;health gap&#039;. Much of the time, however, its efforts have suffered from a lack of definition and top-level leadership. It has allowed the media to set the health policy and has become trapped by its own rhetoric&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40519-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Given the reiteration over the last month of the targets, it does not sound as though much has changed since 2002.

</p>

<a name="40519-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>My second concern, analogous to the first, is regarding matching funding to local sporting bodies. The Minister and I had the pleasure of attending the anniversary celebrations of Arts and Business at the Barbican, in which he had a starring role. The matching funding <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_785"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 785</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

success of arts and business since the 1970s stimulated the creation of Sportsmatch in the 1990s. My favourite fact about the parallel Foundation for Sport and the Arts was that, at the celebration of its first &#163;100 million of donations, it announced that its smallest donation had been of &#163;25   to a village cricket club to fill in the rabbit holes on the boundary. Sportsmatch could clearly do even more than it is doing at the moment. My interest, even if the Minister tells me that Sportsmatch is funded through an interim funder with ring-fenced money, is in how the amount that it receives is determined.
</p>

<a name="40519-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>My third concern is that what Ofsted regards as important in youth work can deny voluntary youth clubs funding for their recreational activities from local authorities as being outside Ofsted&#039;s purview. I declare an interest as the president of the oldest youth club in the world, which is within half a mile of this palace and which runs a series of teams in a series of sports. An unintended consequence of that non-funding by local authorities of that sort of activity is that the relationship developed between youth workers and their teams, whether football, cricket or basketball, which is often crucial in youth workers imparting lessons about adulthood to their members, is at risk if all funding has to be raised voluntarily.

</p>

<a name="40519-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>In conclusion, I come back to Quiller-Couch&#039;s poem. Wooden Spoon has won the Jubilee Cup, as we hope the country will win the Olympic bid; and John Jones&#039; final two verses are:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>      &quot;I&#039;m going out with the tide, lad&#151;you&#039;ll dig me humble grave</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>      And whiles you will bring your bride, lad, and your sons if sons you have,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>      And there when the dews are weeping, and the echoes murmur PEACE</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>      And the salt, salt tide comes creeping and covers the popping crease; </p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>      In the hours when the ducks deposit their eggs with a boasted force,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>      They&#039;ll look and whisper &#039;How was it?&#039; and you&#039;ll take them over the course,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>      And your voice will break as you try to speak of the glorious 1st of June,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>      When the Jubilee Cup, with John Jones up, was won upon Wooden Spoon&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Gender suggests that John Jones is either the Minister or the Sports Minister, Mr Caborn. In either case we hope that Quiller-Couch&#039;s version has the same happy end to the Olympic story.

<a name="40519-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Pendry: </b>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Monro, on securing this debate. Although I did not agree with some of his comments, I welcome any debate on sport in this House and, indeed, in the other place. The matter is not debated enough, as we all know. I recognise the noble Lord as a keen sportsman, an excellent former Minister for Sport and a first class rugby player in his day, so I respect his views enormously.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I am very pleased that the Opposition have woken up to the fact that we on these Benches have been more dominant in debating sporting issues. It is good to see   that there are more Opposition Members in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_786"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 786</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Chamber today than hitherto has been the case&#151;no doubt due in part to the active whipping of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, the Shadow Minister for Sport, who was also an excellent Minister for Sport.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>This debate, of course, is timely, as has been said, as we in this House can congratulate the London 2012 committee on attaining a place for London in the final five of the IOC&#039;s candidate cities list. We all recognise that its efforts to date on behalf of those who support London&#039;s bid for this most historic and prestigious of games has to be commended.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>It is to the Government&#039;s credit that they have taken this bid seriously and are pulling out all the stops to bring about a successful conclusion; not only the Government, because it is heartening to hear that British business is supporting our bid and that is vital to its success. Business has made a good start and I am sure that with yesterday&#039;s news there will be an even greater effort from business to assist with funding to secure a successful London bid. Is it not ironic, however, that &#163;1 million from a French-based company, EDF Energy, has been given to the British Olympic Committee? Perhaps that is a good omen.

</p>

<a name="40519-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Although we can celebrate the successes achieved to date, we have a long way to go before we jump the final hurdle and on to the finishing line. But let me reflect for a moment on what we have going for us. We have many world class venues to accommodate the games, including Wembley&#151;when it is finished&#151;Wimbledon, Lord&#039;s, the Dome, the ExCel Centre and many more. Additional venues have also been proposed to the IOC, such as the Olympic park stadium and an Olympic aquatic stadium. Such venues would not only help regenerate east London, but would leave a legacy of quality facilities for our future athletes in years to come.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>So, a solid basis already exists for a number of Olympic competitions. I would like to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Monro, that we should not be playing party games with this bid because all of us should now be backing it to the hilt.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>To that extent I draw the noble Lord&#039;s attention to the actions of a Tory council&#151;Westminster Council&#151;and its positive sporting programme, Champion 2012, which allows children to sample coaching in several of the minor Olympic sports, such as judo and table tennis&#151;an opportunity they might otherwise not have had. The approach of investing in our young people is to be commended, and that scheme represents the true spirit of the Olympic movement.

</p>

<a name="40519-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The talented athletic scholarship scheme, officially launched this month by Secretary of State Tessa Jowell, will go a long way towards creating the real opportunities necessary if we are to keep some of our most promising young talent involved in athletics. The recently launched apprenticeship in sporting excellence&#151;which is currently being rolled out by SkillsActive across football, rugby and golf, ultimately extending to other sports&#151;will also make a great contribution to the nation&#039;s sporting skill base. The introduction of the new national coaching qualification by Sport England promises to bring further cohesion and credibility to coaches of all disciplines across 31 sports, building a solid foundation for the delivery of the nation&#039;s future sporting excellence.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_787"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 787</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>It is with all this in mind, as one who been to every Olympic Games since 1972, that I feel very positive about our chances of hosting the 2012 Olympics, and equally positive about our chances of delivering a successful games, should we win that bid.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Having discussed aspects of the progress of the bid, I turn your Lordships&#039; attention to the part of the Motion that draws attention to the Government&#039;s policy on sport in general. Since 1997, admittedly with the assistance of lottery funding&#151;which was, of course, available under the previous government&#151;this Government have invested over &#163;3 billion in the funding of sport. In 2002&#150;03, this worked out at something like &#163;9.30 per head of the UK population. We are ahead of our European neighbours. Germany spent &#163;8 per head, and France only &#163;5.60 per head for the same period.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>If we take local authority spend into account, the UK contribution is estimated to be &#163;23 per head. The Government clearly care deeply about sport, as they invest heavily in it. But that is not just sport for sport&#039;s sake. Public funding for sport takes the Government&#039;s wider policy aims in health, education and the communities forward. We all know that, in the area of health, inactivity levels are reaching crisis point. In the UK, levels of obesity have trebled over the last two decades. Even modest increases in physical activity, however, have recently been shown to have wide-ranging health benefits. The money being pumped into   school sport is showing great improvements in young people&#039;s self-esteem, as well as in academic achievement. Game Plan, commissioned by the Prime Minister in December 2002, sets out the future strategic direction of the Government&#039;s sports policy. Its recently published delivery report recommends developing the UK&#039;s sport and physical activity culture, enhancing international successes, improving our approach to mega-events and major sporting facilities.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Government are now using lottery and Exchequer funding to achieve clear and measurable outcomes in key areas. They are raising levels of community participation by investing in high quality local sport and activity resources, available to all. Sport England and the New Opportunities Fund are now putting millions of pounds into local sports facilities to ensure a legacy of activity and engagement in sport.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>At this point, I must declare my interest as president of the Football Foundation. The Government are helping to contribute to the future success of British sport in imaginative ways. The Football Foundation is a true partnership between the Government, the FA and the Premier League, as the House knows, to ensure that football continues its sterling work in sport at grass roots level. The foundation creates the opportunity for all young people to get involved, and stay involved, in football.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Only last Saturday, I attended the presentation of a cheque for over &#163;500,000 to the Longhill Playing Fields in Hull with the Deputy Prime Minister. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_788"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 788</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

money will provide playing pitches and changing facilities for the next generation of young footballers in the area. Some of you will no doubt have watched television on Monday morning and seen the Deputy Prime Minister showing his dribbling skills to the nation, with kids from his own constituency. I can assure this House that he will not be joining Beckham at Real Madrid, as much as people on the other side of the House may wish that to happen.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>In conclusion, I hope that this debate demonstrates the Government&#039;s commitment to sport, in particular within the context of the Motion before us, and their determination to win the bid for the 2012 Olympics for our nation.

<a name="40519-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, since we both have a great love of sport. I rise to speak with enormous gratitude, since my noble friend Lord Monro suggested that I add my name to the list of speakers, despite the fact that I notice a great deal of emphasis on 2012 and the Olympic bid. I look down the list and find the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who I remember 51 years ago on another playing field, playing under the name of Mr   Dixon. His team did not win, but they left a lasting impression on me. I used to see him in the boxing ring, too. I should tell you that he is the same man today, with the same competitive nature. Yet in 1964, he gave me and, I believe, millions of other non-participants, the pleasure of watching a somewhat exotic sport, two-man bobsleigh. It required the same qualities that I knew to exist in him then, and exist today, of participation and sport. I hope he would permit making friends.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I will leave the Olympic aspect to my noble friend Lord Moynihan and the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. Sadly, I do not know where the noble Lord, Lord Coe, is. Perhaps he is doing something about 2012. I wish him well, and hope that he will be able to have lasting success there.

</p>

<a name="40519-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>My noble friend Lord Monro spoke about the problems of cricket, the International Cricket Council and touring Zimbabwe. I am sure that my noble friend, and the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, will tread quietly, watching their toes, when mentioning sport in the arena   of politics. Indeed, I think it was probably my noble friend Lord Monro&#151;not the noble Lord, Lord   Moynihan, although he was involved in this&#151;who was Minister for Sport when the then Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, thought that solidarity should be shown over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I hear murmuring dissent from my noble friend Lord Monro. He probably was the Minister for Sport. What he perhaps does not quite appreciate is that there was considerable difficulty reconciling the views of the Prime Minister with watching our television as a team of college amateurs thrashed the pants&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;off a professional ice hockey team at the 1980 Olympics in Squaw Valley. It was difficult reconciling President Carter&#039;s receiving of the American team, and the Olympics, with the disgraceful things that had happened in Afghanistan. I am sure that both my noble friends <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_789"></a>

Lord Moynihan and Lord Monro will reconcile their views. Indeed, I think my noble friend Lord Moynihan has a medal from the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>What concerns me far more today, however, is the Government&#039;s plans for sport. We always love hearing the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, recall the day in April   2000 when he gave some news&#151;alas, as <i>Time</i> Magazine said, he was &quot;nearly right&quot;. He gave the score but the wrong team. That was, I think, when Real Madrid actually beat Manchester. It caused considerable panic in your Lordships&#039; House, and the rending of garments by Black Rod who had been listening to that debate.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>My noble friend Lord Monro raised an important point, when he referred to &quot;volunteers&quot;, and what I call &quot;people to supervise&quot;. In the late 1970s, the noble Lord, Lord Monro, and I visited the Sobell Sports Centre in Islington, where we met that wonderful gold   medallist David Hemery, who was more or less running it. Within 10 years&#151;even within five years&#151;the centre had difficulties. They resulted not from the investment and arrangements made but because not enough men and women gave their time to assist all the participants.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Sport&#151;even the Olympic Games&#151;is not necessarily about age. Indeed, we can think of elderly people who take part in sport. Your Lordships, even the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, may know that the late Lord Orr-Ewing participated in a complicated skiing slalom at the age of 80. And at the age of 62, Lord   Digby was the best British skier two years running. So even at that restricted level, age is no bar to participation.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>My noble friend Lord Monro spoke of achieving the impossible. I thought that, too. Although in 1959 I broke my leg in three places and spent two years in plaster, even I manage to participate in sport. Indeed, in January this year I broke my shoulder for the second time and it is still on the mend. That shows that participation can be dangerous.

</p>

<a name="40519-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Having put my name down to speak in the debate, I went to my rack and found a note from the Minister&#039;s colleague, Mr Caborn. It was an invitation to join the Westminster Mile on 16 June 2004. There are paragraphs inviting us to take part in &quot;movement&quot; through St   James&#039;s Park. The third paragraph expresses the hope that Roger Bannister will be there to start it off, together with persons such as Steve   Cram, Tessa Sanderson, and a gentleman called Gordon Ramsay&#151;I thought that he put weight on you rather than took it off&#151;who will be there to cheer people on. I have a message for the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey: &quot;You, too, Minister&quot;. I am looking forward to hearing him say that he will be skipping on 16 June.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Sport exists not only for participation&#151;not just at Olympic standard&#151;but also for watching. It is of great importance. For my noble friends Lord Moynihan and Lord Glentoran, for all sportsmen, and for me, it is for making friends. Nothing has done more for me than sport. I was lucky when crossing Abingdon Green and I heard a television cameraman speaking French. I replied to him in French. I have since struck up a fairly <br>&nbsp;<br>

effective working relationship with the French television channel, Antenne 2. In 1996, as a reward for various things I had done, they took me in their car from Dover to Brighton to watch the Tour de France. I read <i>L&#039;Equipe</i>, the daily sporting paper, which does an enormous amount for my French. Your Lordships will know that in the Salisbury Room there are various other foreign newspapers. In them, one can read about Swiss skiing, for instance. There is <i>Gazzetta dello Sport </i>on cycling<i>, </i>which I can understand. And M. Oliver, who used to feed us so well, will be taking no calls as he watches the Giro d&#039;Italia cycle race every day in May.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Sport can build great relationships. It has done it for me and it does it for countless other young men and women. It is an enormous benefit to us all. You can make lasting friends, whatever standard you are. Indeed, you have only to see the conclusion of the Olympic or Commonwealth Games, or others, to see athletes from all countries mixing together. There is no problem. Occasionally, as in 1972 in Munich, a hideous shadow passes over the games, but I believe those Olympic Games were an enormous success.
</p>

<a name="40519-06_para23"></a>

Every weekend, my noble friend and his wife are at places like Firs Park, East Stirling football ground, Peterhead and Dumbarton. It is not glamorous. And rightly, my noble friend and his company sponsor the Ryder Cup. Enormous support is given not just by those who participate or speak in support in your Lordships&#039; House.

</p>

<a name="40519-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Monro of Langholm, for introducing this topical debate the day after we thankfully have been shortlisted with the last five to stage the Olympic Games in 2012.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_791"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 791</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Let me say at the outset that I wholeheartedly support the bid. The 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney raised the stakes and showed the huge benefits of hosting such an event, both financially and in terms of providing improved facilities and infrastructure to promote sport.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The nature of the challenge is simple: to stage a viable and successful Olympics as opposed to an extravagant and unsuccessful Olympics. I have studied the plans and feel certain that the London team has a good chance and is on the right track. We have a bid strong on technical quality, strong on glamour and strong on proven event experience.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>In bidding for an event of this magnitude, we are investing in Britain&#039;s sporting future. The dividends may or may not be paid out in gold medals at future Olympics, but, more importantly, they will be paid out in youngsters who get off the sofa and into exercise and who get out of drugs and crime and into sport. I am pleased that several noble Lords have mentioned not just the importance of sport, but what an important role sport can play in reducing youth crime.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The Olympics will enhance our status as a top sporting nation and all the available evidence suggests that sporting nations tend to be happier and healthier. Provided that this concerted Olympic bid forms part of   a well-funded government sports strategy which ensures that physical education forms part of the national curriculum, encourages more and more adults to take exercise and protects playing fields&#151;mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke&#151;from development, Britain will prosper from the grass roots right up to &#233;lite level.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Of course, London needs to win what is unfolding as an extremely competitive race. At present, sources within the IOC suggest that London is running a close second behind Paris, with Madrid and New York also strongly in contention.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>An interim IOC report identified two main challenges to face the London Olympic bid team. The first, which was eloquently outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, was transport. The bid team must counter any doubts surrounding the city&#039;s capacity to transport competitors, officials and spectators between the Olympic village, the venues and the hotel hubs around the city. In practice, that may prove an easier task than moving commuters around on a normal working day because, effectively, the Olympics will last for only two weeks. Dedicated lanes for accredited Olympic traffic will mean two weeks of disruption for Londoners, but the city will survive the nuisance; and a planned east-west rail link will move people from the main Olympic precinct into the West End in just seven minutes. In short, the transport problems can be solved&#151;if not for posterity, then certainly for a fortnight.

</p>

<a name="40519-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The second challenge is to deal with the single greatest threat to the British bid&#151;that is, public apathy. Too many people appear detached, disinterested or plainly opposed. In letters columns, on radio phone-in shows and in polls to date, too many Londoners talk about the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_792"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 792</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cost of the Games and not the opportunity. The IOC has noticed this point. In its report, each of the five short-listed cities is given a mark out of 10 to reflect levels of public support. London, sadly, is ranked fifth out of five&#151;stone last, with a score of 5.4. Such shortcomings are potentially fatal to London&#039;s chances of winning the vote in July 2005. The IOC wants nothing more than to award the Games to a city whose citizens genuinely want them. Any sign of indifference or opposition is regarded as a major weakness.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>So this is the challenge: before they can start winning the votes of the IOC members, the London bid officials must start to win the hearts of their own people. That will not be easy. London&#039;s 2012 bid needs to discover a mission, a convincing reason for being and even a rallying cry. The Seoul Olympics of 1988 was cast as the platform for the modernisation of South Korea. Barcelona in 1992 became a vehicle to transform a grim city into one of the most glamorous destinations in Europe. Atlanta in 1996 was portrayed as the model of capitalist enterprise. Sydney in 2000 became the athletes&#039; Games, characterised by Australian cheer and fantastic hospitality. Athens in 2004 offers the prospect of bringing the Games home, back to its purest ancient roots. And Beijing in 2008 won appeal as a great leap forward for China, offering access to a vast, untapped market.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>So what is the reason for London 2012? What is written on the banner under which people will be asked to come together in favour of our bid? Perhaps it is this: London is surely the most cosmopolitan city in the world&#151;a melting pot where all languages are spoken, all cultures nurtured and all creeds followed. Perhaps in an increasingly divided era, London 2012 can become a demonstration of global unity&#151;a true world Games in what is a true world city.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>If we combine that with cast-iron evidence that the Olympics will leave the city with a greatly improved, modernised transport system, the polls may move. Londoners may start to rally behind their city&#039;s bid. At any rate, the stakes are high and the prize is great. If London can show that it really wants the Olympic Games, I believe that London can win the bid to host the Olympic Games in 2012.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40519-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Monro for introducing this debate. I suppose that I should also thank my noble friend Lord Lyell for his comments about me earlier as perhaps they excuse me from declaring any interests.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I want to start by talking about the bid. We should congratulate the bid team on having got us over the first hurdle. When Barbara Cassani was appointed, I was not 100 per cent satisfied that she was, indeed, the right person for the post. However, she has clearly done a superb job in getting the bid team up and running with some momentum.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>At lunchtime today&#151;this has not been mentioned by other noble Lords&#151;I was interested to see on the one o&#039;clock news that Mrs Cassani has resigned as chairman of the bid team, although I understand that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_793"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 793</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

she will stay on as a vice-chairman, and that my noble friend Lord Coe has taken on the chair. Although I have not had very much time to think about it, that sounds to me a clever move. The business of getting a serious project under way, up and running and sorted out requires a tough and experienced business person. Barbara Cassani is certainly that and she has certainly achieved in that respect.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I believe that the name of the game has now changed somewhat. There is momentum and we are starting to move into the final part of the race. Diplomacy, how well known one is and all that goes with being an Olympic personality, as my noble friend is, must be a bonus. I hope that it will prove to be a clever move which is supported by everyone. My noble friend has influence and knows all the people and all the ins and outs of Olympic politics. And, my goodness, there are politics with a small &quot;p&quot; and a big &quot;P&quot; in and behind many scenes in this type of game, as I suspect most of your Lordships will be aware. Seb Coe, if I may refer to him as that, has been there, he has seen it all, he knows the people concerned and he should be able to provide us with an excellent opportunity. However, it is vitally important that the environment out of which he operates works smoothly and well and that his support is seen to be firmly in place.

</p>

<a name="40519-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>We have got over the first hurdle as a serious competitor, but I would not say that we have done so very satisfactorily. We just about came second, or perhaps third according to some scoring. However, I understand from information that I obtained from the Internet that the latest odds for 2012 are: Paris, 11/10; London, 5/4; Madrid, 7/1; New York, 8/1; and Moscow, 20/1. Therefore, the competition is tight and we are in there.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We must also be aware&#151;the Government have a role to play in this&#151;that every major sporting event that takes place in this country over the next nine months will be under the spotlight. That includes the behaviour of crowds at football matches, political demonstrations, the risk of terrorism and how we manage those situations. It includes how we manage our security, how we manage our behaviours and how we manage any major events that we may have, including enormous football matches and perhaps cricket matches and other events over the course of the next few months.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I turn&#151;this has already been mentioned by noble Lords&#151;to the transport situation. I suggest that it has been spelt out to us in words of one syllable. Something must be done and plans must be put in place&#151;and very quickly because they have to be announced soon. I believe that we have only 363 days in which to convince the IOC that everything is in place and that we can make it all happen.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>One area about which I feel particularly strongly and about which the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, talked very eloquently&#151;it is certainly one of my bullet points&#151;is the attitude of Londoners. Like most noble Lords I spend most of my week here and I feel that at the moment London is not turned on by the bid; it is not behind the bid. If we are to have a hope on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_794"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 794</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

earth of winning the bid, London has to be motivated behind it. I do not know how we do that. There was a time when the Government had a very good spinning and PR machine. Let us rediscover it, turn it on and link it to Mr Livingstone, London&#039;s Mayor. Let us make it work. If we are not turned on, and we do not get the people of London hyped up about it, we shall not have the Olympics here in 2012.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>We also need to make the point that this is a national event. I know that the Olympic Games are awarded to a city, but in a country the size of the United Kingdom the games will take place all over the kingdom. Preliminary matches and knock-out matches will take place in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff; lakes, mountains, roads, tracks and stadiums will be used all over our nation; and teams will come here a year before to train.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>We should not lose sight of the fact that it will be a very big national event, so I see no reason why Londoners should have to pay for it all. That would not make sense. I would have thought that the quickest way to turn Londoners off would be to tell them how much it will cost them. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, has already made that point very strongly. One can be absolutely certain that Londoners will not be turned on by the rates being loaded for the next 10 years.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>However, in order to get the matter right from now on, a balance has to be struck. I believe that the team has a balance of international diplomacy, politics and good project management. There is every chance that, if London can be turned on and if the funding is put in place in a sensible way so that it does not offend people and does not turn off the nation, we shall win the bid. I am not telling the Government how to do it, but they   do not have many options. From the way I am speaking, I hope that noble Lords sense that I am right behind it.

</p>

<a name="40519-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The debate is also about other areas of sport. Every time I speak on sport I mention my pet subjects, one of which is still in the headlines&#151;nothing seems to have changed&#151;that is, obesity. Little appears to be happening about obesity from the recreational sport end. That links directly into PE in schools. I believe that only 50 per cent of schools include more than two hours a week of exercise. In my day, certainly most schools in the countryside&#151;I do not know about inner-city schools&#151;had some form of exercise every day. In Northern Ireland children had far more than that because they walked to school, often up to eight miles. Many of us walked or ran a long way. In my house at Eton if you did not exercise every day you had your backside beaten and you could not sit on it for the next day or two. I strongly believe that the Government need to get the education curriculum changed. More organised and compulsory recreation and PE is needed in the system.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, who has been a good friend of mine for a long time, particularly where sport is concerned. He spoke about all the good things that the Government have done for sport recently and the fact that they have put much money into sport. I am not sure that they have always <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_795"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 795</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

put it in the right places. Sport is still ground down by too much bureaucracy, too much regulation, too many levels of local government and goodness knows what else. Small sports clubs and organisations have to spend ages filling in forms to access the money. Too many wages are being paid out of it and, in my opinion, not enough money goes to the right places.
</p>

<a name="40519-07_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Lastly, I mention the funding of elite sport. As has already been mentioned, before the last Olympic Games a large sum of money from the Lottery went into elite sport. The Lottery is not doing as well as it has done and elite sport still urgently needs money, as it always has done. I remember in 1968 meeting Menzies Campbell, MP, when he and I sat down to try to spread &#163;1 million among many worthy young athletes who had to walk to training and needed bus fares and so on. Even in those days that paid off and we saw people whom we had helped hit the highlights and start to win medals at international level. Elite sport is a must at all times for any nation, but if we are to be Olympic bidders, if we are to have an Olympic Games here, which I sincerely hope we will, we must not allow the funding for our elite athletes to drop.

<a name="40519-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Jopling: </b>   My Lords, I add my voice to those who have congratulated my noble friend Lord Monro of Langholm on instigating the debate. It gives me an opportunity to say what I have wanted to say for quite a long time. Almost 40 years ago, my noble friend came to work in this building on the same day as I did. He and I have worked in both Houses under various governments and I know of no one who has done more to promote sport in this country than him.

</p>

<a name="40519-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>It is important that we do not confuse sport as an activity with the professional carnival which is the Olympics. I must be frank: I am not particularly enthusiastic about having the Olympic Games in London in 2012. I am one of those who, in the speeches by the noble Lords, Lord St John of Bletso and Lord   Glentoran, has been referred to as somewhat indifferent. A few months ago when the first announcement of the London bid was made in this Chamber, I believe I was the only one who expressed any reservations when I said that I would not shed a tear if the Olympic Games bid did not succeed.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Early in his speech my noble friend Lord Monro said that the bid was something that we all welcome. I have to confess that in a low voice I said, &quot;Oh no we don&#039;t&quot;, to which one of my noble friends next to me said, &quot;You&#039;re quite right&quot;. Over the months when I have expressed any reservations about the Olympic Games coming to London in 2012 I have been astonished by the number of people who have said, &quot;I am glad that someone is saying that&quot;.

It amounts to that. But if it is what everyone wants, so be it.

<a name="40519-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Reading today&#039;s newspapers I see that it is true that the IOC is not especially enthusiastic about London. It demonstrated that from its own survey: only 62 per cent of London&#039;s citizens expressed themselves in favour of London being the venue in 2012. My guess is that that figure will be dramatically reduced when the penny drops and the citizens of London realise that they will have to find &#163;652 million of the projected budget of &#163;2.375 billion of which the London Development Agency will find another &#163;250 million with the balance made up by &#163;1.5   billion from the National Lottery, a good deal of which will be raised by the poor old citizens of London once more.


</p>

<a name="40519-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I have asked a raft of questions over the past few weeks on this topic. The Government tell us that there are no special plans for Londoners to have preferential rights to tickets, having paid the bulk of the money to have the events in London. That seems a little unreasonable. The situation for Londoners is all pay and no gain. Many people have suggested that the budget of &#163;2.375 billion is very likely to be doubled. I am interested to know what would happen if that budget were doubled and another &#163;2.375 billion had to be found. In a Written Answer to me on 5 April, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;the Government, as stated in the memorandum of understanding and reiterated in a departmental minute presented to Parliament on 2 December 2003, have given a commitment to be the ultimate guarantor for the Games. On current contingency plans, the Government would expect to discharge this responsibility, should it arise, in a sharing arrangement to be agreed as appropriate with   the Mayor of London and for their part seeking additional National Lottery funding&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/4/04; col. <i>WA 215</i>.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40519-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>So if the budget doubles, which a good many people have been saying, and the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, suggested in Committee on the Lottery Bill, as I recall, then the poor old citizens of London will again have to put their hands in their pockets in order to honour what amounts to a blank cheque.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The Government are supporting the bid for 2012, but they are not proposing to put their hand in their own pocket in order to finance it. I do not believe that that is fair to London ratepayers. It is hardly surprising that there is little enthusiasm, or a good deal of apathy, referred to by noble Lords of whom I spoke earlier, among the people of London. For many years the citizens of London will be charged an extra &#163;13 to &#163;40   per year on their council tax. If there is a 100 per cent overrun those figures will increase to &#163;26 to &#163;80   per year for many years for Londoners.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The truth of the matter is that only a few of the citizens of London will see the events. If they bother to go, some will be able to see something like the marathon, but it will be a fairly expensive outing for those people who merely go to watch that and do not buy tickets to attend the various events. For the huge majority of Londoners who will watch most, parts of, or none of the events on television, it will not much matter whether the Games are in London, Paris, Madrid, New York or Moscow.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>It is quite right for noble Lords to ask what is wanted if one does not like the present arrangements. I believe that the funding for the bid should be raised nationally on all ratepayers throughout the country. I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_797"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 797</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

believe that the existing arrangements are wholly unfair. It would be much fairer and more equitable if that happened. Surely it is not too late to change the funding of the bid and to make it fairer to the people of London.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40519-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, we owe the noble Lord, Lord Monro, a considerable vote of thanks not only for raising the subject, but also for doing so at a very apposite time. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that we have got over the first hurdle. We could have done so in a slightly neater fashion, but we are over the other side and that is the important part. The expressions of relief by Barbara Cassani are getting through and they are appropriate. We should have done it. London, one of the world&#039;s greatest and most historic of cities, should be capable of getting through.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, has kindly spoken from behind me as opposed to slightly further along the Bench. He has done us a service in pointing out that it is not just a question of us having done well and that it is going to be a great event. There is a definite note of, &quot;We don&#039;t want it here if it&#039;s going to cost us any money&quot;. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, said that unless that is countered fast we will effectively strangle the whole business with the rope of apathy. We must guard against that very strongly. Without enthusiasm the project is ultimately doomed even if we win the bid. Everything will go off half-cock. We must make sure that support is there.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, pointed out, there is the perception that one is paying and not getting a lot back. I believe that that is wrong. There is the redevelopment of the East End which is surely worth having. There is the spectacle and romance of the Olympic Games, which is the greatest gathering together on earth of nations in one city. That has to be worth something.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>In practical terms not only London will be involved; it cannot be so. London dominates England, and particularly the south-east, in a way which very few other cities do to the country around them. The financial benefit will go further. As regards the sporting structure, the preparation camps and training facilities will benefit from having the improved infrastructure here in London. There are business opportunities as well as social infrastructure benefits in having the games here. That is not being shouted about very clearly.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>If we are going to pick holes in the Government, from what we have heard today we should have a transport Minister here. We know that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, wears many hats with a degree of comfort. I took forward to the Minister telling us exactly what the Government propose to ensure that transport is in place, or at the very least that the perception is going to be good enough for a successful bid. This opportunity will not occur again for some time and many of us in this Chamber will not see it. We must get it right now.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_798"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 798</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>We should think about spreading the financial burden somewhat. If the Government require extra transport infrastructure, the Treasury pocket is the only one deep enough to do anything about it quickly. We must look at the options.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>To move slightly further away from the Olympic bid for London and to the general tone about sport in this debate, the Government need to give more information about the infrastructure.

</p>

<a name="40519-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monro, spoke about the problem of playing fields&#151;every fox that I had was shot in the course of the debate. Last time there was a Question about playing fields in this House, it was a wonderful plant given to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, which was fertilised and watered by his own Benches. The general thrust of it was that the money was being used for other sporting activities. That is possibly the case; perhaps the Government had got their act together at last.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>It turned out that it was 90 per cent of the money from, if I remember correctly, school playing fields, and the other 10 per cent was going on something else. OK, 90 per cent going back in is better than it was; we can argue about the other 10 per cent later, but that does not answer a series of questions. If we want greater participation rates and are to invent targets for participation, do the Government have a strategy that says what that means in terms of playing fields for participation and sport?
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>To put it bluntly, if 34 teams in a Sunday League want to play football on a weekend, we will need exactly half that number of pitches available on a Sunday morning. The fact that there is a wonderful training facility is of no use to them on that Sunday morning. It does not make a blind bit of difference. There may be a wonderful sports hall around there, but they cannot get the time off or bring themselves together. Five-a-side tournaments will thrive, but those playing in the 11-a-side game, around which the game is built, will not get their match. They need those 17 pitches. That was lacking from that Answer.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Do the Government have an idea of how many usable sports pitches they need&#151;what amount of usable turf; that rare commodity around our urban areas, well drained solid bits of turf, which can be used for dozens of different sports? I have had it explained to me that hockey players like to play hockey on new, artificial pitches. That is great if they can all get there. They cannot all get there after work. If they have only the one pitch, with the best will in the world, they cannot get everyone playing on it at once. People are available to take part in sport only at certain times. Have the Government seriously addressed what they want and need in that department? Participation rates require opportunity.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>We have covered up the need to have that organised infrastructure in British sport by the great use of small clubs that buy their own grounds. That has covered up what we can do. The Government have made moves&#151;they have been nudged towards them. It is a pity that my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury is not here to bask in a little of his well won glory. We have made life <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_799"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 799</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a little easier for them. But the fact is that if we are to increase participation rates, we need a lot of facilities available when people need to use them.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>It does not help if we have only a few shining examples, of, say, modern gym culture. The reason that gyms exist is because everyone joins them and no one uses them. That is why they make money; that is why they grow. If everyone turned up to take part, they would not be able to get through the door. We pay a few hundred pounds for our guilt. We say, &quot;I can go at some point&quot;, but no one does. If we build institutions within local authorities that fulfil the same function, we will not address the problem of obesity.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The idea of getting into competitive sport is that people have an incentive to be there every week. Presumably, that means that they will do some training. That means that a greater amount of activity will probably be involved. There are all the other benefits that come through sport, such as learning to have a sense of self-discipline, commitment to others in team games&#151;indeed, even in a solo sport, one has commitment to the people against whom one is playing. That is an important factor.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The Government must tell us whether they have addressed that. What is their strategy? The domesday book of sport is apparently to be published in the next few weeks, when we will have a better idea exactly what our sporting facilities are. That means that when I ask my next embarrassing question about how many national health playing fields we have lost, for instance, we can get an answer, rather than simply talking about school playing fields. If we can get an answer, things will start to make sense. At least the answers will all be coming from the same reference books.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The Government&#039;s target is for 70 per cent of people to engage in physical activity five times a week. How does the Minister think that sport will help to achieve that more efficiently? I have heard that ironing counts towards that. Do your Lordships know that extreme ironing is a sport? People go down waterfalls ironing. Next we will have a competition to see who can have the sharpest crease in his shirt in a future Olympics. That will not encourage regular activity. Repackaging vigorous hoovering will not address the fact that we want people to enjoy their exercise, which is the benefit of sport.
</p>

<a name="40519-08_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Where is the Government&#039;s central thrust? Gimmicks such as that, or the proposition that we are all to do manual jobs again to reduce our waistline, will not help. The Government must get away from such gimmicks and address the sporting part of this whole public health debate more coherently. I must say that all those involved in government have been a little slow about this, although it is not totally down to the Government; it concerns the culture that we have inherited&#151;although the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will reply. Unless we can address that problem we will miss many opportunities both at elite level and in participation and public health benefits from sport.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40519-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on his characteristically excellent speech opening our debate. I intend to concentrate my remarks on the bid, for one simple reason. Olympic glory represents the pinnacle of sporting achievement. Its attainment requires a partnership between the highly talented athletes who compete and a national sporting infrastructure that allows those athletes to rise to the top because of it, rather than in spite of it. Olympic success requires a dynamic, vibrant, positive and inclusive approach that reaches up from the grass roots of primary schools and after-school clubs to the pinnacle of &#233;lite performance. Thus, the Government&#039;s strategy for the Olympic bid should represent the whole of their sports policy, from schoolchildren right up to world-class athletes. Today, we are a far cry from that goal.

</p>

<a name="40519-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>This debate is especially timely. As we have already heard, yesterday the IOC formally announced the shortlist of bidding cities for the 2012 Olympic Games. I echo many previous speakers in congratulating the London bid team. In particular, I point out the excellent work that Keith Mills has undertaken in assembling a first-rate, committed, professional and enthusiastic team. As a city, nation, Opposition and Government, we will need to pull out all the stops and work together if London is to win the bid to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is essential that all-party support for the London 2012 bid remains strong.

</p>

<a name="40519-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Let us be clear about one thing. There are no prizes for second place in this competition. The British Government must now begin the process of demonstrating to the world   their wholehearted support for London to stage the Olympic and Paralympic Games. From the Prime Minister down, the Government must join us to take every opportunity to showcase Britain as the host nation and London as the host city. On the national level, their work in that direction has been weak, uncertain and lacking in demonstrable commitment. This is the ideal opportunity for the Prime Minister to stand by his famous words and prove that he has no reverse gear. Now it is absolutely the time to step up a gear.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>To use a sporting metaphor, while the bid team has been busting a gut to produce a gold medal bid, the Government, through their lengthy initial delays and subsequent performance, have at best been lukewarm and lacklustre in their support. No one can skip the hours, days and weeks of winter training and expect gold. That is especially true in the case of a government whose international popularity is low and who are up against the total commitment of the Spanish and French political leaders.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>To continue the metaphor, if I were the chairman of the London bid and my team of Ministers had walked into the changing rooms trailing all the bidding cities 8&#150;1 at half-time, as was stated by the IOC yesterday, I fear that my team talk would be unprintable. For on the criterion of government support&#151;public opinion comprises only 15 per cent of that score; that is how political a bid is&#151;we lay eighth out of nine, behind Madrid and Paris and even behind Leipzig, Moscow <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_801"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 801</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and Havana. On infrastructure and transport, we lie third and fourth. We lead on only one issue, on which it has been pointed out that the Government have no involvement; namely, accommodation and hotels.

</p>

<a name="40519-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>However, after a few well-chosen words, I would be upbeat. Why? Like my noble friend Lord Coe, whose unstinting work for the bid remains laudable&#151;whom we wish well now that he has taken over from Barbara Cassani as chairman of the bid&#151;I passionately believe in our case for winning this prize. I shall do all in my power to motivate the Government to raise their game. I genuinely believe that they can if they want to. But we need a sea change in attitude from the Chancellor, the Treasury team and everyone involved in international relations, transport and infrastructure.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The Prime Minister has often displayed passionate and messianic verve when he believes in something. Now is the time for him to lead from the front, shoulder to shoulder with Ken Livingstone and, indeed, Steve Norris after next month, and to demand a far higher level of active and unremitting support from his ministerial team.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Security will be a major factor in the decision on who hosts the 2012 Olympic Games. The UK leads in that area. Perhaps I may give an example. Security is an issue that the Greek Government have actively sought to address. Under their auspices an Olympic advisory group on security planning has been set up, which is made up of representatives from seven countries. That group is chaired by none other than the assistant police commissioner and head of special operations at Scotland Yard, David Veness. This UK-led group draws on the expertise of its membership from Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Australia and Spain.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>On a fact-finding visit to Athens last week, I learnt from Ministers that the security budget for the 2004 Olympic Games currently stands at &#163;675 million, which is triple the amount that was spent in Sydney. The IOC is known for its caution, and rightly so. It is satisfied that everything possible is being done in Athens to ensure adequate and appropriate security. That confidence speaks volumes. The IOC cannot afford to be implicated in any kind of security lapse at these or any other Olympic Games.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>British involvement is at the very heart of the Athenian security operation. A safe and smoothly-run games will significantly increase our chances of securing the 2012 Olympic Games for London. If the Greek Government maintain their current level of security awareness and if international support is forthcoming, I have no doubt that in August a trouble-free Olympic Games will be delivered. Its legacy will benefit us all for years to come, not least in terms of the London bid.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Transport is an area where we desperately need to improve our standing, as was made self evident by the IOC. The IOC ranked London fourth on transport. We must deliver the promised East London Line extension, upgrade the Jubilee Line and, with all-party support, give fresh impetus to Crossrail before we can be confident that the criticism levelled by the IOC at our transport policy yesterday can be overcome.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_802"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 802</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Critically, the Government, by the actions that I have outlined, must ensure that London and Londoners have ownership of that bid, particularly after the IOC found only 67 per cent support for the bid among London residents. It is essential that all Londoners feel the benefit of hosting the Games.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>To date, the Government and the 2012 Committee have focused on touring the regions to outline the benefits to those regions. Indeed, such benefits are manifold. But it is Londoners who are being asked by Government to foot the bill, not only for the sites in London, but also for the rowing and flat-water canoeing events at Dorney Lake in Eton; for the shooting events at Bisley; for mountain biking at Swinley Forest; for sailing in Weymouth; and for the use of football venues from Glasgow to Cardiff to Newcastle to Belfast, for which the local residents will pay nothing.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>If Londoners are to be asked to pay for all of that at an annual cost of up to &#163;40 a head for the foreseeable future, the Government must demonstrate tangible benefits for them. That is all the more important when, as has been pointed out, the Treasury has designed a formula that demands additional precepts on Londoners for every pound overspend. There has never been an Olympic Games in the modern era which has not been overspent.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>When that was discussed in detail at a meeting with the Minister for Sport on 5 May, he told us that the rate precept formula for Londoners was a &quot;discipline&quot; on Londoners. The idea that the Government need to discipline Londoners is unacceptable. Together&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, stated&#151;we need to win the hearts and minds of Londoners, not to discipline them through open-ended precepts when the Treasury is paying nothing towards the cost of staging the Games.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I appreciate that the current Minister for Sport is from Sheffield. Surely he has learnt from the experience of the Sheffield student games in 1991, which is still costing the local taxpayers more than &#163;20   million a year. When asked about this aspect of the Olympic bid, the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;To describe Gordon Brown as a little half hearted is possibly a compliment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The current position of the Government is clear. In the event of any overrun in costs, the extra money will be raised through a split between the lottery, the GLA and the London council tax payer. As my noble friend Lord Jopling said, there will not be just one hit on the lottery and Londoners, but a potentially unlimited number of hits. The funding formula for the bid must be reviewed. We stand ready to sit down with the Government to find an equitable solution.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>For our part, the Conservative Party has already made a number of commitments to reduce the likelihood of a Government raid on the lottery or on the pockets of London council tax payers. By diverting the tax take on the sale of the hypothecated Olympic lottery tickets, we would raise an extra &#163;340 million, which would be paid directly from the Treasury to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_803"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 803</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Games. Such is our commitment to bring the Games to   London. I call on the Minister to match our commitment to ensure that the tax revenue generated for the Exchequer from the new Olympic lottery game is diverted to the London Olympics where it belongs.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>We should never forget that the Games are for the athletes, as Athens is demonstrating so ably in preparation for August. For the UK, it is essential that our Olympic bid is backed by a radical new sports policy. There is little point in seeking to host the Olympic Games in 2012 if our Olympic and Paralympic athletes are ill-prepared to deliver medals. We consistently need an eight-year plan, which would cover the cycles of two Olympic Games. School sport, playing fields and community clubs across the country must not be allowed to wither on the vine.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The National Lottery, which was introduced by John Major in 1995, revolutionised funding for sport in this country. The record lottery investment in &#233;lite athletes produced one of our best ever Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sydney in 2000. Yet the Government still have a key role to play in establishing expectations and defining priority given to sport.

</p>

<a name="40519-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>It is a telling statistic that some two-thirds of our Olympic medal winners in Sydney in 2000 came from the 8 per cent of our schools that are private. In September 2000, we had the very welcome announcement by the Prime Minister that &#163;750 million of lottery money was to be spent improving state school sporting facilities. Yet, after three-and-a-half years, just &#163;10 million of that &#163;750   million has been spent.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>All that time, child obesity is increasing to a record level and the amount of time that is spent on PE and school sport in primary schools has long been, and continues to be, a cause for grave concern. Even in the Government&#039;s flagship school-sport partnerships, just 51 per cent of pupils get the minimum two hours a week: only part of that is spent on physical exercise, the rest is in the classroom. That is a very serious issue, which does our Olympic aspirations no favours. However, the Government have the time to act and to raise their game. We stand ready to support them when they do.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Even when the Government spend money, it is not all plain sailing. The Minister for Sport admitted that in another place when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;We have spent just over &#163;1.5 billion during the period of the lottery&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I repeat, &#163;1.5 billion during the period of the lottery&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;and have increased participation by just 0.3 per cent. One has to start looking at where things have gone wrong&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 13/4/04; col. 247WH.]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>He is absolutely right.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>As we have heard already, the case for restructuring the delivery mechanism to our governing bodies and to the sportsmen and women that they represent is urgent. A national system is needed to identify the sporting talent in all our children and a support structure to nurture and develop that talent. We strive for that goal in academia. We have a duty to strive for that goal in sport too.

<a name="40519-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>In conclusion, there remains much work to be done in bringing the Olympic and Paralympic Games to London in 2012. The fundamentals are in place. The bid team is doing a great job. The House continues to encourage and support the bid. However, it is right that today we take notice&#151;not of Conservative Party views or politicians&#039; views inside or outside this House&#151;of the IOC report. To come eighth out of nine in the criteria of government support, legal issues and public opinion is unacceptable. Now is the time for each and every Minister, from the Minister for Sport up to the Prime Minister, to face up to that half-time rap over the knuckles and to go back out and win the bid for London.
</p>

<a name="40519-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>This is the moment for the Government to demonstrate that they have the stamina, the staying power and the determination to win the race ahead, and to bring the world&#039;s greatest sporting event back to this country. When we last held them, we topped the world rankings for government support, as the one country committed to hosting the post-war games. If we think in those terms, I firmly believe that we have the team, the talent, the enthusiasm and the ability to bring the games to London once again.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40519-10_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, I join with all other noble Lords who have expressed their gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Monro, for finding this opportunity to debate sporting issues. I congratulate him, as others have, on his excellent timing, in that he added the London Olympic bid to the subject for debate precisely a day after the announcement that we had been successful in what has been described as the &quot;first hurdle&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>I am grateful for the expressions of support from everybody&#151;except of course the noble Lord, Lord   Jopling&#151; for our bid for the Olympic Games. I am grateful for a very large amount of what has been said in this debate, because there has been a degree of unanimity and common purpose, which is immensely encouraging. The only issue&#151;other than the views of the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, of course&#151;about which I am a little nervous is the challenge set for me by the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, to turn up on 16 June and &quot;skip&quot; a mile from No. 10 Downing Street. Since he will know that I am already under pressure from Richard Caborn, I shall have to think of some very good excuses to be somewhere else on 16 June if I am going to maintain my reputation in this House as a sporting atheist.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>However, that does not mean that there are not serious issues of public policy to be debated. Those issues have been debated with an excellent degree of knowledge, understanding and good humour. When the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, disparaged the Government&#039;s commitment to sport and to the Olympic Games in his closing remarks, he should have recognised that although Londoners are indeed significantly sceptical, as they are on a large number of issues, the Olympic committee concluded that all of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_805"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 805</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

five candidate cities are either 0.8 or 0.9 in government support. There is no significant difference between us. There is indeed a difference in public support in London. The noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord   St John, among others, were right to say that one of the objectives of the 2012 committee in the coming months and years&#151;particularly in the coming months&#151;will be to enthuse Londoners and to rouse them from what I would call their scepticism rather than apathy. Even so, it is fair to remark that Londoners&#039; support for the Olympic Games is 67 to 13. That is a five-to-one ratio in favour. There are not many public policy objectives that enjoy that degree of support in this country at this time.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I shall of course say something about the more general sporting issues that have been debated, but I sense that the House really wants to speak more about the Olympic Games than about the other sporting issues, which have been debated before and can be debated again. At the heart of our Olympic bid is the   Government&#039;s belief that sport is good for communities, good for individuals and good for the country. It is a good health policy; it is a good education policy; and it is a good anti-crime policy. The Government have invested more than &#163;3 billion of government and lottery money in sport since 1997. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, doubted whether there was a vision or strategy. We have a clear strategy for achieving a fitter nation and world-class success. I could send him a pile of documents in evidence, but I can do better than that. I can indicate the effect that those documents have had.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40519-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, that is just it; there are piles of documents but there is not one pr&#233;cis.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40519-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, the more I stand at this Dispatch Box and the more I sit in government, the more I am sceptical about the ability of White Papers to achieve anything. I worry about documents being an end product rather than an indication of what we actually do. Instead of sending him documents, I shall send the noble Lord, Lord   Addington, some of the statistical analyses.

</p>

<a name="40519-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Of course, participation in physical activity is incredibly difficult to achieve. That really would be turning the proverbial tanker. With almost all of our population engaged in non-manual work nowadays, with individual transport in the form of the motor car being more widely available than it has been before and even with public transport improving rather rapidly, certainly in London, participation in physical activity in this country is far too low. Yes, we know that, and we know that levels of obesity are rising. Even so, physical activity is not all about organised sport. The Department of Health recommends five sessions of 30 minutes&#039; activity a week. The percentage of people who meet that ideal falls from a very low base as people grow older: 41 per cent of those aged 16 to 34; 34 per cent of those aged 35 to 59; and 13 per cent of those over 60. A very high proportion of people achieves only one session of physical activity a week. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, teased me about ironing and hoovering, but he should have a little respect for his elders and realise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_806"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 806</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that active sport is not necessarily appropriate as one reaches 60 or above, even for those who have been very active in sports in younger years. The department&#039;s recommendation is very difficult to achieve, but there can be no doubt about the Government&#039;s commitment, in terms of both health and sporting objectives, to work towards it.

</p>

<a name="40519-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>There has been unprecedented investment in facilities. Nearly &#163;700 million has been poured into school and community sports through the New Opportunities Fund and Sport England, and 62 per cent of pupils now spend at least two hours a week on PE. I listened with a slight shudder to the reminiscences of the noble Lord, Lord   Glentoran, about his schooldays, but 96 per cent of schools held at least one sports day last year&#151;which perhaps makes one wonder what the other 4 per cent were doing.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>In general, I therefore resist the view that there is government inactivity or any failure of investment in sport by the Government during our period in office. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, asked for evidence of those achievements. There is of course the sport domesday book project. Sport England&#039;s &quot;Active Cases&quot; website will be live this summer, as the noble Lord said. That will enable citizens to know what facilities are available in their area. That will make a rather important contribution.

</p>

<a name="40519-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>There were conflicting views about government support for &#233;lite sport. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, thought that the lottery was doing less than it should. He also thought&#151;wrongly, I am happy to say&#151;that the returns to the lottery were decreasing. It looks as if the   lottery has turned a corner this year, and receipts are rising again.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, for his tribute to what has been done in support of &#233;lite sport, and we look forward to achievement in Athens from that activity.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I am sorry that we have to go through the same argument about playing fields again with the noble Lord, Lord Monro. There were 800 approvals for playing field applications in 2002&#150;03, but there are huge gains for sport within those approvals, with the planned development of 489 new facilities leading to a proposed investment of &#163;286 million. I do not think that there have been any fudges, as the noble Lord said, in answers that I have given to Written or oral Questions. The record on retaining playing fields is excellent, and I shall not weary the House by contrasting it with that of the previous administration.

</p>

<a name="40519-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, for what he said about private sector contributions to sport, particularly to grass-roots sport. The concentration by Sport England on grass-roots sport and the work of, for example, Sportsmatch, which has had &#163;3.675 million from DCMS&#151;all of which has been matched from the private sector&#151;is very valuable.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I have spent far too long before getting on to the Olympic Games. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me&#151;I will now move straight on to that issue. There has been virtual unanimity on the London Olympic bid, which is enormously gratifying. The bidding <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_807"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 807</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company has recruited a high quality team; we have met the deadlines and have come through the first hurdle. There must be another way of saying that&#151;we have come over the first hurdle. I shall always be caught out even worse than Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch if I attempt sporting metaphors. They will always be mixed metaphors when they come from me.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>There is still some misunderstanding about the difference between the UK-wide benefits of hosting the Olympics and the benefits for London. Of course there are very significant UK-wide benefits. As has been said, many of the events in the London Olympics will be in other parts of the country, and people in other parts of the country will benefit from those directly and from coming to London. However, the regeneration benefits&#151;the long-term legacy&#151;will be particularly enduring for London because many of the new facilities will be provided in London.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>We think that there is a very proper balance between what London is contributing through the council tax&#151;a figure of &#163;625 million over 10 years&#151;what is to be contributed by the London Development Agency and what is to be contributed from nationwide lottery funds. I hasten to say that the &#163;2,375 million we are talking about is not a budget. People talk as if it were, but it is the sum of the public subsidy which is proposed. Of course, as for all previous Olympics, we anticipate very considerable private support, and we are grateful for that which has already been promised. Of course there will be the income from the activities to be considered. We should look at the issue in that wider sense. When we do, the amount coming from the London council tax seems entirely appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I noticed the very wise words of my noble friend Lord Pendry and the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, about who has been contributing private funding. I am grateful to them for that.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has left the debate about the early Olympic lottery until another, more appropriate, occasion, which will no doubt be the Report stage of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Bill. I will be happy to debate that and the Olympic lottery tax with him then.

</p>

<a name="40519-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>It is appropriate that I conclude by saying something about the events of the last 28 hours, because they have been considerable. It is a tremendous honour that we have been chosen as a candidate city. Reference has been made to the evaluation report which puts London in third place, behind Paris and Madrid, and just ahead of New York. The strength of the London bid, shown in the IOC&#039;s evaluation, are a well planned sports concept with the use of 20 existing venues; the Olympic village, with a very good competition environment for the majority of athletes; and the environmental quality of the bid&#151;the Olympic Park area is the largest ever environmental reclamation and transformation project. The evaluation also refers to the availability of accommodation in London. I know that that is not directly to the credit of Government, it is to the credit of London as a vibrant city, but that is, after all, what we are all about, as the noble Lord, Lord St John, rightly said. There is also the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_808"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 808</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

financial package in place for the games. I recommend that bit of the IOC&#039;s conclusions in particular to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>We are confident that we will have the capacity to continue to reflect those strengths which are shown by the IOC bid, but also to tackle the weaknesses which are undoubtedly there. I have talked about the scepticism of Londoners. I think that it is within the capability of the bid team and particularly of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, as its new chair, to build on the excellent work of Barbara Cassani and to enthuse Londoners and the people of this country more widely, as we get closer to the final bid period, about the virtues of the Olympic Games for this country.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that London is not behind the bid. I find that unhelpful and I do not think it is true. It is just that we Londoners have a lot of things on our minds at the moment, and I think that the Olympics will come to the fore in people&#039;s views. Certainly there is, as the noble Lords, Lord St John, Lord Glentoran and Lord Addington, said, much to be done on the transport side. But we are confident that London will have the capacity to deliver the transport requirements for the Olympics.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>We already have one of the world&#039;s most extensive rail and underground systems. There will be significant improvements to the infrastructure by 2012, not least, as the noble Lord, Lord St John, said, the new link between King&#039;s Cross and Stratford that will take passengers into the heart of the Olympic zone from central London in less than seven minutes. We have already planned significant levels of investment in both the Underground and rail transport network to improve safety and capacity.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>I have referred already to the work of Barbara   Cassani and to the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Coe, is taking over from her. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, for his tribute to Barbara Cassani and his very perceptive analysis of the role that she has played in the early stages; he also discussed the difference between that and the role which the noble Lord, Lord Coe, will be playing as we come closer to the bid deadline.
</p>

<a name="40519-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>We have a serious bid and we are in the running. We have the complete commitment of the Government to that bid; we have the commitment of the Mayor of London to that bid and we will have the commitment of the people of London. The best we can do, I think, is to send off those working on the bid with the rousing support of the House of Lords. I repeat my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Monro.

<a name="40519-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Monro of Langholm: </b>   My Lords, we have had an excellent debate and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, for his good-humoured reply to a good-humoured debate. We have learnt a great deal from it. Speakers from all sides of the House were informed and, with one exception, all wished the bid full steam ahead for 2012.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>What did come out of the debate&#151;I think it originated from the noble Lord, Lord St John&#151;was the concern about apathy. I mentioned that that was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_809"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 809</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

part of the concern of the IOC. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will take the message to his colleagues that we must raise the standard of information and the level of enthusiasm and must consider how we are going to get the result. The sooner that is done, the better. It has to be done by November, when our bid goes in. After that, the door shuts. We must do a great deal in seven months.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I was disappointed on the issue of playing fields; our statistics differ dramatically. But whatever happens, the Government are agreeing to the change of use of far too many playing fields, which is far removed from their manifesto commitment.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Lastly, we did not say enough about the lottery. It is incredible how the income of sport has changed since it was introduced.

<a name="40519-11_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="40519-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Fowler </b>   rose to call attention to the worldwide spread of HIV/AIDS; and to move for Papers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, some people ask why we spend time debating HIV/AIDS when there are so many other medical conditions that demand our attention. I suggest that the answer is threefold. The first reason is the sheer scale of the human tragedy that HIV/AIDS has caused. So far, the total throughout the world is 25 million dead, which is four times the Holocaust and vastly more than the results of terrorism.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>UNAIDS estimates that last year alone there were 3 million deaths, which is the highest-ever total. That figure includes 500,000 children under 15, many of whom had been born with HIV, although we now have the medical means to prevent such mother-to-baby transmission. The year 2003 saw new additions to the vast number of orphans living around the world who have lost both mother and father to this disease.

</p>

<a name="40519-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The second reason is that the epidemic&#151;the pandemic&#151;is predominantly wiping out young men and young women. They are the men and women nations rely on for their development and are the men and women who should become leaders in business, trade, education, medicine and politics. For example, the pandemic is killing Zambian schoolteachers at twice the rate at which they are being trained. This is not a disease striking at the old and infirm but is an epidemic wiping out the young and the economically active.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The third reason, and perhaps most ominous one, is that the position throughout the world is not improving but is all too often deteriorating. We may <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_810"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 810</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

deplore what has happened in the past but, unless we take all the action open to us, there is worse to come. The tragedy is that we have the ability to prevent much of the spread of HIV/AIDS, and to offer hope to those who are already infected, but too often we do not have the will or the determination to act. The best estimate is that today there are 40 million people living with HIV throughout the world. Last year 5 million new men, women and children were infected and 700,000 of those infected were children under 15.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>This is not an epidemic that has been halted; it is an epidemic that is spreading. It now threatens new countries and new generations of young people. The destruction continues. Today the epicentre remains sub-Saharan Africa where last year alone there were 2   million deaths. One prediction that we can make with absolute certainty is that this death toll will continue to rise. There are somewhere between 25 million and 30 million people living with HIV in that area and it is estimated that 3 million to 4 million of them urgently need treatment today. We know that the vast majority of them, about 98 per cent, will not receive such treatment. Anti-retroviral drugs may have reduced deaths in the West&#151;although it should be emphasised that they have not provided a cure&#151;but in Africa such treatment is for a tiny minority.

</p>

<a name="40519-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>However, there is a profound danger in believing that Africa is alone in facing this crisis. No government anywhere in the world can say that it will never happen in their country. At this moment, HIV is taking hold in a range of countries where a few years ago ministers were assuring us that they had no problem. In India, although the official estimate is that today 4.5 million people are living with HIV, the real number is likely to be 6 million to 7 million. Experts in the field say that the Indian epidemic could be devastating unless massive efforts are launched now. In China we know that blood transfusion errors and the use of contaminated equipment by drug-users has helped to lead to a total of at least 1 million living with HIV. Nearer to home, an estimated 1 million people in the Russian Federation are living with HIV. At first, transmission was by the contaminated equipment of drug users but it is now by mainstream heterosexual sex. Drug use is also the entry point elsewhere, as in some countries of central Europe, where it is reported that heroin can sometimes be as cheap as alcohol.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Let us not believe that the West is in some way immune. There are around 1 million people living with HIV in the United States and some 600,000 in western Europe, including at least 50,000 in the United Kingdom. The latest figures for the United Kingdom were the worst on record. The number of new diagnoses has doubled since only 1998 and, in my view, the Government have done too little to counter this rise and far too little to combat the startling increase in sexual disease generally.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>This takes me to an absolutely fundamental point about combating HIV/AIDS. What is so deeply frustrating and tragic about the figures of death and infection is that so often we know the action that needs to be taken, action which could prevent the disease and action to treat those who are infected. But we also know that first and foremost it is necessary for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_811"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 811</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

governments to take the lead. Where governments have done this, as in Uganda, Thailand and Senegal, the harm has been reduced. Where governments have failed to take a lead, their national position has deteriorated and the epidemic has spread. No government can evade its responsibility here.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>We know that sexual behaviour can be influenced. I would claim that our campaign in the United Kingdom in 1986&#150;87 succeeded in reducing HIV and also succeeded in reducing sexually transmitted disease generally. I pay tribute to the support that we received from television companies, radio and newspapers, most of which supported our campaign then and would do so again. I single out the BBC World Service for the extremely good work that it is currently doing in several overseas countries.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>We certainly know from our experience in the UK that clean needles can dramatically improve the position as far as drug users are concerned. To those who say that free needle exchange is too radical, too liberal a step, I reply that it was introduced here not by some way out administration of the left but by the government of Margaret Thatcher. I concede that there were one or two constructive debates along the way.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Of course I accept that there are questions of what message of prevention should be given. I was in receipt of much advice on this point. Our message was concerned with being faithful to one partner and the use of condoms. In Uganda they added abstinence to this message&#151;abstinence, being faithful and condom use. Some preach abstinence only.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>I am strongly in favour of trying to persuade children scarcely into their teens to postpone their first sexual encounter but I rather doubt the impact of that message further up the age scale. It has not worked in the past&#151;it was certainly tried and failed in the First World War to counter venereal disease&#151;and I remain convinced that promotion of the use of condoms must be a central message.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I deplore the entirely false statements of some&#151;including, I regret, one or two senior figures in the Roman Catholic Church&#151;that cast doubt upon the safety of condoms.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I have concentrated on prevention, for that is crucial if we are to check the spread of HIV. But treatment is of course the other essential part of any global policy. There is no point in advocating more testing for HIV if there is no treatment to follow it up. People will ask what is the point.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Here we come to the question of increased resources. We have much of the mechanism to deploy such resources in place, like the excellent Global Fund, which I visited a few months ago in Geneva. What we so clearly need is a greater commitment from the West&#151;from the high-income countries&#151;to this fight.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>And here, perhaps against the trend, I praise the United States. When I went to the United States when President Reagan was in power HIV was scarcely on the national agenda. There was an atmosphere of embarrassment about the whole position. Earlier this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_812"></a>

year when I returned, I found a President committed to spending overseas 15 billion dollars over the next five   years and a new co-ordinating office based at the State Department to bring together that effort.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Indeed, I would say that we in Europe spend rather too much time asking what more the United States can do and too little time asking what more Europe can do.   We spend too little time examining our own priorities&#151;priorities that meant that last year the European Union spent &#163;32.5 billion on the common agricultural policy while millions die unnecessarily in countries which do not share our standard of living. Just think what more we could achieve with just one tenth of that budget.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I believe we should follow the American example and have a European co-ordinator for HIV/AIDS who would not only bring the European effort together but also work to raise the resources so that at least we matched the American effort.

</p>

<a name="40519-11_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I see now that the Government here intend to re-develop their policy and take the lead in Europe. I certainly welcome that intention. But if the Government are to do that, then it must be more than another declaration of intent&#151;another initiative which grabs the headlines today but is forgotten tomorrow. It must be action that makes a real difference.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>And I also say this to the Government. They must have the authority to lead. They cannot lecture others abroad while doing all too little themselves at home. Their record on HIV/AIDS at home is not remotely impressive. Their record on sexual disease generally is lamentable.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The number of attendances at sexual disease clinics has more than doubled since the early 1990s to over 1.2   million a year. Since 1996 chlamydia is up by 140   per cent, gonorrhoea by 106 per cent and syphilis by 910 per cent.

</p>

<a name="40519-11_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Everyone in the field&#151;apart from the Government&#151; talks of a crisis, and a crisis there is. So yes, let the Government make a new effort abroad&#151;and I support that entirely&#151;but let them also show at home the kind of leadership that they urge governments overseas to take.
</p>

<a name="40519-11_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>On the face of it, there is all too little for our comfort around the world. But there are also opportunities. There are countries like India which stand at a crossroads. We can reduce the harm and the deaths. We can provide hope. We can check some of the destruction that HIV/AIDS will otherwise cause. We will need determination and we will need resources. But history will not forgive us if we fail to take the action which is open to us. I beg to move for Papers.

<a name="40519-12_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Salisbury:</b>  My Lords, last week I visited the offices of Hope and Homes for Children, a charity based in Salisbury, which is a testament to the brave vision of its founders Mark and Caroline Cook. It works in 14 different countries across the world and, in the words of its mission statement it seeks,

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Its most recent fundraising video is subtitled,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;When the cameras move on, we stay&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>It is a slogan that speaks to the changing and changeable nature of public concern, easily drawn to new and vivid calamity and perpetually on the move.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>It is against that background that I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on securing this debate. The cameras do so often move on; many subjects clamour   for public concern; yet the worldwide spread of HIV/AIDS demands our urgent and constant attention.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>As the Archbishop of Cape Town has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;No one should care alone. No one should die alone. For we are all living with AIDS&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The diocese of Salisbury is linked to the Episcopal Church in Sudan. The House will know that war has disfigured Sudan for more than 30 years, leaving the south of the country bereft of any organised economic activity or civic administration.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Ironically the near impossibility of travel and the isolation of many communities mean that the AIDS pandemic has had little impact yet. Because the bridges are down and most roads are impassable to lorries and trucks, that particular source of infection has been halted in its tracks. It is a war that has cut a swathe through Sudanese life and torn apart the fabric of society. But, none the less, in that society there is one small glimmer of hope. People are not able to move as easily in that southern part of the country as they would in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. That has curiously given us an advantage.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The consequences of HIV/AIDS for other African communities are no less devastating than these decades of brutal war have been for Sudan. Individuals suffer, and their families with them, but the spread of infection is so great that the precious threads that bind societies together are stretched to breaking point and beyond. When breadwinners die, when parents die, when carers die, the impact is felt far beyond the walls   of the family home. Each death is a blow to the commonweal&#151;the whole human family&#151;a fresh assault on the possibility of people living peacefully and creatively together, because AIDS erodes trust and breeds fear. As one 15 year-old says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Although my friends support me and I can talk to my grandparents I feel very sorry for myself. I have lost all the happiness in life and I won&#039;t be able to achieve my ambition to be a nurse. I don&#039;t want to get married because I&#039;m afraid of getting HIV&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Last week was Christian Aid Week and all over the country volunteers have taken part in the largest house-to-house collection of its kind in the annual programme. They have done so because of their commitment to Christian Aid&#039;s determined slogan, &quot;We believe in life before death&quot;. It is because of that belief and that commitment to life, and to life lived together purposefully and creatively, that the Anglican Communion has pledged itself to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;the promise that future generations will be born and live in a world free from AIDS&quot;,</p>

<a name="40519-12_para8"></a>

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>It is not a wholly unrealistic aspiration. When the Secretary of State for International Development addressed the General Synod of the Church of England in February, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;This is not a hopeless battle. We have the means to defeat HIV/AIDS&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>As a result of the Secretary of State&#039;s address to the Synod and the motion passed there, the Mission and Public Affairs Council has published a report telling the story, being positive about HIV/AIDS. Perhaps I may read the House two paragraphs from it, the story of a young man. It is as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Vitalis . . .  is 29 and lives in Njombe in Tanzania. He is HIV-positive but doesn&#039;t know how he became infected. He thinks it may have been when he and his elder sister (who is also positive) visited a traditional healer. The doctor&#039;s &#039;cure&#039; for his sister involved cutting both their hands with the same instrument he had used on other patients . . . </p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Although Vitalis has a girlfriend he hasn&#039;t told her his status; he has simply said that he has decided he doesn&#039;t want children just yet so they must use a condom. He is trained in building construction and still works when he is well and there is work available, but that is not enough to support him&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>It is stories such as those that indicate the extraordinarily porous boundaries of the disease and the way in which the slightest accident or negligence can easily infect someone. A nurse from Salisbury who went out to work in a hospital in sub-Saharan Africa caught the infection, probably from a discarded needle on a surgery floor, and died a long and painful death in Salisbury some years ago now.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>But this battle, as battle it is, needs resources. Her   Majesty&#039;s Government have given generously to HIV work and are, I believe, the second largest donor in the world. It has been estimated that, by 2007, 15   billion dollars per year will be needed to secure a minimal global level of prevention, care and treatment. I believe that our Government must continue to show leadership by doing what many donors to Christian Aid will have done this last week, and giving again, giving recklessly and giving more than their share.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>For their part, the Churches and their partners will continue their work of caring for those most directly affected by AIDS and fighting against the stigma that still shamefully attaches to it. But if these greater resources are to be found and the promises to be realised, then&#151;at the risk of sounding a familiar note&#151;above all else it needs attention, attention, attention. It cannot be allowed to slip from the public agenda and the Churches will do their best to ensure that it does not.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>We are told that we are engaged in fighting a war against terrorism. We need also to be engaged in fighting a war against poverty and disease. Were we all to be convinced of that then slender budgets would cease to be a constraint.

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>What can we do? First, HIV is about people in relationships. The sick need to be cared for in their own homes and orphaned children need care in their own communities. Prevention is best done through the informal networks of community, peer group and family. That is why the Churches, which in Africa are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_815"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 815</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

frequently the most vibrant and far-reaching community networks, are so well placed to help. And the community focus is key if people with HIV/AIDS are not to be stigmatised and therefore shunned. When people are afraid to talk, afraid to declare what they fear may be happening to them, the hidden fears eat away at the bonds of community. Who trusts who? Who will support who? Support for the carers and treatment for the sufferers will not be forthcoming unless there can be an international climate of concern and openness which brings HIV/AIDS to the top of governmental agendas in sub-Saharan Africa.

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The people of Sudan hope that peace will soon be theirs. Peace will mean the building of roads and the rebuilding of bridges and the advent of the huge trucks, the harbingers perhaps of economic reconstruction and   inward investment. How tragic if that new communication brings with it the deadly threat of HIV/AIDS. As Mark and Caroline Cook know, the children of Africa deserve homes and families. Above all, they deserve hope and a future.

<a name="40519-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Colwyn: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord   Fowler initiated a similar debate on 20 February 2003 and was congratulated on his commitment as Secretary of State when the AIDS epidemic first appeared and on his continued interest in the current situation. I should like to offer similar congratulations today, but warn him that my views do not and have not always conformed to popular opinion. I think that it is unlikely that any of your Lordships will agree with any of what I have to say.

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I have always been concerned that there are many   scientific facts that can show that the human   immunodeficiency virus does not fulfil the   epidemiological and biological requirements, nor the common sense requirements, to be the cause of the human immunodeficiency syndrome. We do not understand AIDS. Virtually all of the scientific community has taken a germ-theory view that HIV is capable of causing a syndrome of ever-advancing immune suppression that will eventually cause death.

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The lack of understanding means insufficient knowledge to be able to intervene in or control the disease process. Epidemiologists must be able to predict accurately when outbreaks will occur and who is at highest risk. Microbiologists must be able to prove the underlying causes of the disease. Immunologists must be able to explain how the immune system fails and what   may be done to protect it. Anthropologists and sociologists must be able to identify behavioural patterns and cultural environments that put people at risk. And public health officials and physicians must be able to implement effective preventative measures and cures. By these criteria, we do not understand AIDS.

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>It is imperative to rethink and research AIDS. There are a few lone heretics such as the University of California professor of molecular biology, Peter Duesberg, and Australian biophysicist Eleni Papadopulos Eleopulos, who have offered exhaustively referenced argument that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_816"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 816</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

HIV infection does not lead to AIDS and that the test is so inaccurate that it should not be used. Both have been vilified for their troubles, but even if they are only pointing to an alternative pathway, the implications are of great concern.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>By rallying round the HIV theory we may be erroneously lumping together under the umbrella term AIDS some 25 disparate, previously identified diseases acquired by a number of non-contagious means. With the inaccuracy of the tests, this means that we could be misdiagnosing as HIV-positive many thousands of basically healthy people and subjecting them to highly toxic, potentially lethal drugs, the side effects of which are now indistinguishable from what we consider AIDS-related illness. Certainly that was true of AZT, which was originally marketed as an anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent and found to be too toxic for use.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Having HIV does not mean having AIDS. My noble friend Lord Fowler and the right reverend Prelate referred to HIV/AIDS as a single entity. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus is not proven beyond doubt to be the sole cause of AIDS, nor does the presence of HIV lead inevitably to AIDS.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The HIV virus is not a particularly aggressive or fast-replicating virus. It affects different people in different ways, which is why some people can contract the virus and die rapidly and others are alive and healthy 15 to 20 years later. Investigators who defend HIV as the cause of the syndrome have proposed a vast variety of agents as helpers or cofactors of HIV in the genesis of AIDS. However, those cofactors are in themselves causal agents of immunodeficiency and may generate AIDS with or without the diagnosis of HIV. Dr Roberto Giraldo calls such cofactors &quot;immunological stressor agents&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The real circumstances that surround all the groups of people who develop AIDS with the greatest frequency is the exaggerated exposure to a variety of stressor agents against the immune system that can have a chemical, physical, biological, mental or nutritional origin. AIDS has appeared at a time when the immune system of human beings is saturated and is deteriorating due to exposure, both involuntary and voluntary, to immunological stresses. The capabilities and functions of the immune system are neither infallible nor infinite.

</p>

<a name="40519-12_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The incremental stressors in our ecosystem are endangering the preservation of our species. AIDS is an alarm call. The distribution of those stressors varies within groups of people who develop the syndrome and   explains the different clinical forms of AIDS that occur in different people. Progressive and continuous deterioration of the immune system causes a deficit of the defence, surveillance and homeostasis immunological functions with the subsequent development of infections, neoplasias and metabolic alterations.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Although I am not an expert, I am concerned that drug treatments for AIDS, the protease inhibitors and other antiretrovirals can add to the total of immune system stressors. That toxic hypothesis of AIDS provides a rational explanation that the infectious <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_817"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 817</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hypothesis has not solved, not to mention the millions of pounds invested in research, prevention and patient care within the infectious concept of the syndrome. The AIDS test is neither sensible nor specific for detecting past or present infection with HIV.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The medical and research communities are the greatest asset in the fight against AIDS and potentially also the greatest threat to its success. There can be no breakthroughs without research, but breakthrough research is not possible when conformity is rewarded and sceptical inquiry punished. AIDS may continue to plague modern society, just as other preventable infections plagued our forebears, because of the closed-mindedness of the very physicians whose job it is to diagnose, treat and prevent those diseases.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>A century ago, they let patients die by denying that germs had anything to do with disease. Today they may be letting them die by insisting that the germ is everything. Without doubt the virus is detrimental to the immune system and speeds up the process of disease, but it is not solely responsible for the ill health associated with AIDS.
</p>

<a name="40519-12_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>More relevant is long-term abuse of the body through poor nutrition, environmental toxins in the air and food chain, the chemicals produced by stress, drugs and frequent exposure to infections and the antibiotics with which they are treated. A happy medium must exist somewhere in between, but it will be reached only when informed scepticism and razor-sharp reasoning skills become as valuable assets to scientists and physicians as are advanced degrees, an infallible memory or respect for authority.

<a name="40519-13_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for his energetic pursuit of the subject, which we all know to be one of the most urgent in the world, even though, as we have just heard, we may not altogether understand it.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I welcome the new government strategy set out in the consultation document and I salute DfID&#039;s leadership alongside UNAIDS. I join the debate as one who advocates a greater role for civil society in the AIDS campaign. That was a key point in the declaration of commitment adopted by the UN in June   2001, which called for the active participation of civil society, the private sector and faith-based organisations.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I have seen for myself the effectiveness of those organisations in tackling HIV/AIDS, especially in Uganda where a few years ago I visited projects supported by Christian Aid, of which I am a trustee, and by UWESO, the Ugandan charity for orphans, which I greatly admire and support.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord McColl, in his place, because we were both present at the opening of the Mildmay Centre&#151;a new international hostel for AIDS patients near Kampala&#151;and at the AIDS conference opened by President Museveni. The poverty focus of the DfID approach is welcome, not least because of the millennium development goals, of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_818"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 818</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which AIDS is an important part. They could easily be in jeopardy since such a pandemic cruelly eats into every aspect of development.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>But there are risks that earmarked support or a short-term emergency response will bypass normal health services and create a parallel culture, as has happened with some vertical UN programmes in the past. It is a paradox of aid that sudden epidemics or new sources of funding produce new vehicles, clinics and personnel that may demonstrate visible action but do not necessarily serve the poorest communities.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Connected with that is the problem of centralised budgets. Will the Minister confirm that DfID policy within the poverty reduction strategy process is to provide direct budgetary support for health services? How will that policy conflict with the need to target AIDS programmes in the voluntary sector without going through national budgets? I know that many NGOs here are concerned about that issue and how even the &quot;Three by Five&quot; initiative and the &quot;Three Ones&quot; programme may work against them.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>One way round the problem is for DfID to identify and directly support civil society organisations that are part of a network and known to be in close harmony with existing HIV/AIDS and other health services. That is particularly true in countries such as Uganda and Senegal where there is an active network. It is much more difficult in countries or regions where, perhaps because of internal conflict, there is much less national co-ordination.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Section three on page 12 of the strategy highlights effective national responses and endorses the need for a pluralist approach, which is important. On the one hand, it is essential to strengthen and improve access to general health services, because acute needs arising from poverty, ill health and other causes of child mortality are linked with vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, responses to HIV/AIDS prevention must be highly targeted and inevitably selective, because of the differences of approach and capacity in different communities.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The consultation paper therefore says that a multi-sectoral approach is required, but I wonder whether the strategy places enough emphasis on the current effectiveness of civil society partners and the need to involve them more in decision making. One area of AIDS prevention where civil society may be paramount is in health education. Of course the use of radio and public advertising is helpful, but as the right reverend Prelate said it is through word of mouth through the churches, mosques and village-level organisations that the message is best channelled.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I have attended, as I am sure have many noble Lords, an evangelical church service that devoted large parts of the liturgy to teaching and story-telling about the risks of AIDS. In villages I have attended singing and drama sessions involving all sections of the community, ensuring that information is shared among young and old and that the basic needs of patients and families are being met.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_819"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 819</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Civil society, in the official language of development, is now a key partner in poverty reduction strategies. That sounds good. But integrating NGOs into a national strategy is not easy and it obviously raises much deeper   questions about accountability and political representation. Yet more advocacy by prominent civil society groups could be especially crucial in bringing HIV up the political agenda in those newly affected countries&#151;some of which the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, mentioned&#151;at an early stage of an epidemic where the impact of HIV is not yet apparent. DfID should, and perhaps does, prioritise support for such work, which could bring about the high-level political commitment which we have seen to be so effective in Uganda.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Another area where such an approach is important is in the reduction of stigma. Christian Aid in its submission to DfID&#039;s consultation offers the example of a group of four NGOs in Karnataka, south India, known as the MILAN coalition. They are also supported by the Elton John Foundation.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>According to this group, stigma is fuelled by six   factors: ignorance of HIV/AIDS, fear, taboos concerning sex, too little sex education for young people, lack of sensitisation in the medical profession, and lack of anti-retroviral therapy. The project aims to address some of these factors through information provision and discussion at community level. The MILAN group identifies sex workers as particularly stigmatised and vulnerable&#151;and in its first phase the project is focusing attention on them.

</p>

<a name="40519-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Then there is advocacy. Besides pooling their knowledge of training and counselling, the four organisations select what they call, &quot;positive speakers&quot;&#151;we know of similar examples in South Africa&#151;who can openly talk about their status in public as part of prevention as well as for the media. This is a very powerful means of reducing stigma and motivating people to undergo testing. It is difficult to find enough people willing to be so open about themselves, but combining four organisations is more likely to result in the critical mass needed for effective impact on the public.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The consultation paper says comparatively little about ARV, perhaps because research is moving so fast, but I hope that the Minister when he covers the question of ARV treatment will explain why that is so.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I have one further question for the Minister in respect of tuberculosis. One in three people worldwide living with HIV is co-infected with TB, and nine out of 10 die of TB within a few months of contracting HIV unless treatment is available for TB. But HIV causes TB to spread so fast that the health service cannot possibly catch up, even though it is expanding. What is DfID doing to help UNAIDS and WHO to combine AIDS and TB services as a matter of urgency? I am sure that the Minister recognises that AIDS programmes could learn much from the experience of other programmes of primary healthcare, for example, and reproductive health, including in the training of paramedics and local workers&#151;programmes which already use this integrated approach could be applied to HIV/AIDS.

<a name="40519-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, it is a privilege to follow the deeply impressive speech of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich&#151;he often makes such speeches in international debates in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;just as it is a rich pleasure to join others in your Lordships&#039; House in congratulating my noble friend Lord Fowler on having secured this debate and on the comprehensively magisterial way in which he opened it.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>A quarter of an hour is a smidgen in which to lay out a global problem: imagine what Mr Gladstone would have made of it. As the poet once said, the Ancient of Days is an hour or two old. My noble friend moreover played a distinguished part in orchestrating Her   Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s response to the AIDS challenge in this country two decades ago. No one can read the mind of another but it would not surprise me if my noble friend felt within himself that it was the finest thing he did in more than a decade at Cabinet level, and he has enhanced that record by the way that he has kept the faith of this issue in the near decade and a half since he left office.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>As a parishioner in the diocese of Salisbury I express pride and pleasure that our eponymous bishop should have taken part in this debate. I admire the courageous heterodoxy of my noble friend Lord Colwyn&#151;heterodoxy which is the touchstone of your Lordships&#039; House&#151;though I shall not follow him precisely in the line that he took. My own qualifications for speaking are much more modest but I passionately hope that the moment has come when global society has begun fully   to gird its loins&#151;if I may be allowed to use the phrase&#151;to cope with this challenge, as my noble friend did 20 years ago.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Colin Powell said last month that HIV/AIDS is the greatest threat to mankind today&#151;the greatest weapon of mass destruction on the Earth. It has been likened to the Black Death. I had never thought of the consequentials of that before today, but our hearts must go out down the centuries to the despair of those of our ancestors in the same positions of influence as ourselves then wrestling with that challenge armed with the knowledge and the instruments of 14th century experience. That comparison alone should put us on our mettle.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>We come together, too, in this particular capital at an appropriate crux of timing. Last month the <i>Economist</i> published a thorough and well informed special report on AIDS in India. Yesterday, inspired perhaps by the Government&#039;s commission on Africa&#151;and parenthetically Parliament&#039;s renewed interest in the Dark Continent is a profoundly encouraging development&#151;the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Africa was due to publish its report on AIDS in Africa, developed after evidential hearings. That is now delayed until after the Recess, but the final coda in the draft version runs to nearly 150 footnotes, which itself is a potential index of thoroughness. Its original publication date prompted the colloquium which is due to take place at Marlborough House tomorrow&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>

a location that underlies the salient role this country can relevantly play on the international stage in this regard.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Then we have, too, the Government&#039;s draft consultation document on the new strategy of HIV/AIDS in the developing world, to which a couple of references have been made. At the vortex of this pouring out of printers&#039; ink, after 20 years in which disaster has been tempered by comparative and often unpredicted recovery in different continents&#151;I add to my noble friend&#039;s listing of Thailand and Uganda, Brazil, which is in yet another continent still&#151;one is driven back ineluctably to the ancient human truth that, if a human group is to change its behaviour, the critical essential is that the leader of the group has with genuine resolution to want that to happen.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>To illustrate that in the unfolding story&#151;I go away from Brazil, Thailand and Uganda&#151;the leadership example of Chandrababu Naidu, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, where the HIV prevalence rate is over 1 per cent of the population, is a classic instance. April&#039;s <i>Economist</i> report is eloquent on what that commitment has involved. If his insistence that all his Ministers should include a reference to AIDS in every speech they make, whatever the topic, challenged their speech writers, it was a nobler cause than that similar instance in Belfast in the late 1980s when an editor insisted that every musical criticism in his paper should contain a disparaging reference to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>In this context the prose of the Government&#039;s draft consultation document, perhaps inevitably, has, at least to my ear, all the charm of a &quot;speak your weight&quot; machine. I do not necessarily regard that as a disparagement for it may be responsive to the nature of the subject, though I suspect that Mr Gladstone would have been more Homeric or perhaps Aeschylean. What matters is that the policy strategy should optimise the deployment of our own resources. It is one of those cases where the Prime Minister&#039;s rhetoric could more usefully follow the plan than precede it. Most important of all will be the role of Mr   Hilary Benn, whose pedigree as a communicator is matched by a most engaging matter of fact modesty. What matters is that he should recognise and then make clear the centrality of this issue in this decade to his department&#039;s <i>raison</i> <i>d&#039;&#234;tre</i>. I am obviously referring to DfID.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>There is one sentence in the draft document which is an encouraging harbinger of this possibility, and I quote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;The UK response at global level in providing support to these key agencies (e.g. UNHCR, WHO through its Health Action in Crises, UNICEF, UNDP and others) to enable them to tackle HIV in difficult environments is essential&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>That remark has a flavour of our centrality. As an American historian once wrote,

</ul>

</p>

<a name="40519-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>In peacekeeping the UN has a perennial specification that British troops should if possible always be involved. HIV/AIDS may confer on us the same necessary ubiquity.

<a name="40519-13_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>If local leadership is critical, and British leadership a potential catalyst, how do we play our role where denial is in operation and neo-imperialism classically counter-productive, and there seems to be a job for all of us?
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>The last time that I was in Pretoria, I had a long conversation at a High Commission party with an Afrikaner girl, who said she found HIV/AIDS hard to grapple with because she had, within her social milieu, absolutely no experience of it at all. The places where denial rules are, I suppose, the equivalent of the despair that policy makers felt towards the Black Death six and a half centuries ago. Wiser men than I will know how one should respond. At my simplistic level I feel relief that there is so much else to do on a worldwide scale that one can concentrate on the feasible, even if one reluctantly put the temporarily intractable on the back burner.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I want to deal with Africa before I conclude, but, first, to say an ominous word about India&#151;to which my noble friend Lord Fowler referred. When I was at school, my school number was 666, which the Bishops&#039; Bench will recognise as the number of the beast in the Book of Revelation. In the <i>Economist</i> report on India I could not help noticing the awful symmetry that 4.58   million are infected with HIV&#151;and my noble friend qualified that figure upwards&#151;and that almost 450,000 Indians die of tuberculosis each year. There, I echo the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. That figure is most commonly among HIV positive people, but 4.56   million dollars will be spent each year for the next three years by Star television on airtime for public service advertisements about AIDS.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Fowler I was at the beginning of the Government&#039;s response here, for it was the Medical Research Council which persuaded the late, great Sir Keith Joseph that a database of incidence was crucial to an effective strategy and I would be interested to hear in the Minister&#039;s reply how far our experience of that early step in the process is transmitted to countries such as India, if they genuinely want to learn, and whether it is part of the practical help that we offer.
</p>

<a name="40519-13_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>In what is still the draft African report from the All-Party Group, what runs through chapter after chapter, haunting and spectral, yet golden in its examples of heroism, are the orphans. They are their countries&#039; future, but they are also a cause to which all mankind can reach out. In the mean time, as Dr Alex de Waal said memorably at the Africa All-Party Group meeting that sparked off the report, Africa is in some ways like a university where the student union leaders have disproportionate authority because many of the dons who would have lent them balance and guidance are dead.
</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="40519-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Stern: </b>   My Lords, I would like to echo the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, about the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and thank him for initiating this important debate.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The United Kingdom response in the mid-1980s to   the HIV/AIDS problem is seen as a model in international circles. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, was in the driving seat at that time and must take the credit for the enlightened and far-sighted approach that was taken. I remember receiving the leaflet he sent me and the rest of the population and thinking, &quot;This is an unusually sensible document to come from the Government&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I wish to limit my contribution to one aspect only of this problem, but I hope to show a very central aspect&#151;the prevalence, transmission and prevention of HIV in the prison systems of the world. In that context I declare an interest as a board member of Penal Reform International. Rates of HIV infection are very high in prisons in many parts of the world. Prisons have always been places where sickness is concentrated and from where epidemics have spread; and the HIV epidemic is no different.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>According to the World Health Organisation, one can multiply the official HIV statistics of a country at a given moment by a factor of between five and 10 to get an actual estimate of the rate of infection in a country&#039;s prisons. HIV in prisons is particularly acute in eastern Europe and central Asia, where the rates of HIV infection are now increasing rapidly. In some of the new European Union states, HIV infections are also on a rapid rise in prisons. In Estonia, the first HIV-infected prisoner was diagnosed in 2000. Since then the number has increased by four or five every week. In Latvia, the number of HIV-positive prisoners increased by 58 per cent between 2000 and 2001.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>There was a well publicised case of an increase at one prison in Lithuania. In 2002, 229 infected prisoners were being held there. Between May and July of that year 44 more infections were added because, it is said, they all used the same needles to inject drugs. Recorded cases of infections in prisons in Russia have risen from seven in 1995 to 30,000 in 2003. I strongly endorse the point made by my noble friend Lord Sandwich regarding the co-morbidity with TB. In some of the countries that I have mentioned, active TB affects 10 per cent of all prisoners.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The reasons for those high infection rates will be obvious to noble Lords. One reason is the nature of the population that prisons receive. People in prison come from the most disadvantaged sections of any society. They come to prison with ill health, with many untreated conditions and they engage in risky behaviour such as drug taking. Prisons are full of people who use illegal drugs. In Russia and Ukraine more than 90 per cent of HIV-infected prisoners are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_824"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 824</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

intravenous drug users. Secondly, the environment itself in prison is disease-producing, because of unprotected sex&#151;consensual and forced&#151;tattooing with unclean needles and injecting drugs with shared needles. It is not just those who enter prison as drug users who engage in that behaviour. Research shows that in west European prisons the percentage of prisoners who first start to inject drugs while in prison ranges from 7 per cent in some countries to 24 per cent in others. Research also shows that a quarter of Russian prisoners were tattooed in prison&#151;two thirds with needles already used on someone else.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>This is a crisis for many prisons and, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, said, we know exactly what to do about it. Therefore, it is vital that prisons are included in all national HIV prevention policies. It is also vital that harm reduction measures are accepted and that public health priorities are clearly asserted. But this is a real challenge that causes dilemmas and grave difficulties in prison systems all over the world.

</p>

<a name="40519-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Prisons need to take action to stop the spread of HIV. They need to stop prisoners taking such risks as unprotected sex or injecting with the same needle. However, we will all be aware of how easy it is to say that and how difficult it is to implement. To do those things, prison officials have to accept some harsh realities that they would often rather deny. However good their security measures are, however many sniffer dogs and body searches take place, drugs get into prison. In some countries with poorly paid prison guards corruption ensures a regular supply. Sex takes place in prisons the world over, so condoms should be available to prisoners easily and without embarrassment. I will not recite the long saga of getting prisoners access to condoms in the Prison Service of England and Wales. I understand that prisoners now have access, but that the method of giving them access is likely to be a deterrent to many.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Substitution, maybe a methadone maintenance programme, needs to be available so that those who inject drugs may move to a safer method. The provision of bleach and other disinfectants in prisons is basic and absolutely essential, so that shared needles may be cleaned.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Finally, there is the provision of needle exchange facilities. The Government are greatly to be congratulated on the move they took to bring prison health services in England and Wales into the Department of Health, and under the National Health Service. I know this has meant significant progress in taking forward measures that should have been in place since those early days when the noble Lord, Lord   Fowler, was at the Department of Health.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I would like the Minister to reassure me that the rollout of the programme to provide disinfectants will   continue energetically, the provision of condoms will be improved, and the possibility of needle exchange programmes, where the need can be proven, will at the very least be kept on the agenda. I would also like the Government to ensure that the question of HIV in prisons is part of their international development and human rights agendas.

</p>

<a name="40519-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Those noble Lords who visit prisons abroad may well have seen the compulsory testing of prisoners that leads to a diagnosis but no treatment. This results in the segregation of HIV-positive prisoners in the worst and darkest accommodation, where prison staff do not go, and medical staff give treatment through a grille in the cell door without touching the prisoner. Compulsory testing and segregation of HIV-infected prisoners are condemned both by the WHO and the Council of Europe. It is heartening to see that many countries new to this problem are taking action to improve their treatment of such prisoners. Kazakhstan has taken the lead in central Asia by eliminating compulsory testing and segregation. Noble Lords may be interested to hear that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, who cannot be here today, has played a key role in educating medical workers in Kazakhstan about HIV prevention and treatment. Kyrgystan has initiated needle exchange programmes in its prisons, as has Moldova. There is much to do, and much good work to encourage.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I draw the attention of the House to the Moscow declaration of the World Health Organisation in Europe, entitled <i>Prison Health as Part of Public Health</i>, which calls for prison and public health services to work together,

<a name="40519-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Stern for what she said about prisons. I agree with all of it.

</p>

<a name="40519-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on his   choice of debate, because the increasing spread of HIV/AIDS needs addressing. It is devastating communities and mutilating families, especially in some African countries. I thank the noble Lord, who understands the many problems relating to HIV/AIDS. He was Secretary of State for Health at the start of the AIDS catastrophe, and I am sure the campaign warning people of the dangers of HIV/AIDS had an effect on prevention.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>I am also sure, with the current increase of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, that there should be continued campaigns on prevention. We have a very dangerous situation at the moment, where many young women and men just do not care and have unprotected sex with many different partners. As sexually transmitted infections facilitate the transmission of HIV, it is possible that the rise in these may have played a significant part in the increase in HIV among gay men. All sexually <br>&nbsp;<br>

transmitted infections have increased in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is why I asked the Government a few months ago whether there should be a national service framework&#151;for this growing problem.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Something has to be done. People across the world did not take the advice that one partner was the safest   option. The recent case of the man from Middlesbrough who had come from Africa and knowingly infected three women, and has now been given a 10-year prison sentence, might make a few people think. Should there not be clear legal guidelines, stating that it is a criminal offence to knowingly infect people with the HIV virus?
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>There is concern that the removal of dedicated funding for treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS in recent years will place the investment in services over the past 20 years at risk. There should be a commitment to ongoing funding, not one-offs, to ensure the availability of appropriate treatment and care for those eligible.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>Many people and organisations from Britain are helping and giving support to developing countries, and that is good. But we must not neglect our own people, living in our own communities. HIV/AIDS is a horrible condition. It complicates lives. The difficulties over confidentiality can make communication difficult. There are many problems which can arise for people whose health deteriorates, such as housing needs, social care, arranging meals, visits to hospitals, and companionship if people live alone.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>A very unfortunate situation has arisen at the Mildmay Hospital in Hackney. This is a dedicated hospital for people with HIV/AIDS, giving respite, rehabilitation and hospice care. It founded a family centre for children and parents living with HIV/AIDS who needed support. The children had good play facilities and lunch, while the mothers had rest and treatment. The family care centre ceased to operate in 2002. Health authorities are no longer prepared to fund family admissions, arguing that this is not something they do with other illnesses. Health authorities withdrew funding for children infected or affected by HIV, on the basis that this is not a health issue. The Mildmay is concerned about the withdrawal of HIV-specific funding. It is being increasingly financially squeezed, as PCTs no longer give HIV priority.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>As the Mildmay Mission Hospital does missionary work, it has two thriving AIDS centres in Africa: one in Uganda and one in Zimbabwe. Should we not be looking after our own people at home, as well as helping others? When I think of the smiling little faces of these children enjoying their play facilities and lunch, it makes me sad to think that some of them will now be isolated at home while their mothers lie resting, without the support that was so needed, which the Mildmay was able to give them.
</p>

<a name="40519-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House what progress the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria is achieving. This has been a priority for the UK and I wonder whether the Minister can say which countries have supported the Global Fund and which have not.

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>Last year, a parliamentary delegation from the HIV/AIDS group from India visited us in Parliament. It was good to meet them and to hear that, like us, they had a parliamentary group.

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>HIV/AIDS is the biggest threat to global development and stability in our time&#151;not only in Africa but also across the world. It is no longer simply a health issue; it is a human rights issue that cuts across all aspects of social, political and economic life.

They may be forced to drop out of school or required to care for chronically ill adults or younger siblings. They may face discrimination, abuse or exploitation. Deprived of parental guidance and protection, they may themselves become vulnerable to HIV infection.

<a name="40519-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for giving us this opportunity to focus on HIV/AIDS, which is typically a sexually transmitted disease. It disproportionately affects the poorest people, with devastating results, in developing countries. I intend to focus on the integration of existing health services to help in particular children in developing countries&#151;the 700,000 who were infected last year resulting in 500,000 deaths.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Globally, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, told us, between 40 million and 46 million individuals live with HIV, 95 per cent of them in developing countries. Africa is now the most affected continent, with 30   million in sub-Saharan countries where six in 10   sufferers are women.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Twenty-nine million people have died of AIDS so far, with 3 million dying last year. As most of the deaths occur in young adults, some 14 million children have lost at least one parent to HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that by 2010, 20 million children will have lost a parent from AIDS. That orphaning in highly affected countries may cause children to enter the labour market before they have completed school education and exacerbate problems of child labour. Financial help needs to be given to families where one or both parents have died of HIV/AIDS.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The low status of girls and women in many traditional societies in Africa and especially in Asia, has led to them being sold into prostitution, which in turn spreads HIV/AIDS faster and further in those countries. In India, where young women join the sex industry in metropolitan cities from poor rural communities, including from Nepal, HIV spreads to their home when they return with the disease. India <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_828"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 828</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

now has between 4.58 million to 6 million living with HIV, a number that is second only to South Africa, as most of us are aware.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>However, when I was working in India in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a denial that HIV and certainly AIDS were important. It was said that only a few thousand people were infected. Well, the figure has now grown to millions. Therefore, if all girls were educated in schools, they would be economically active without being exploited in the sex industry. Is that something in which we can encourage the international community to invest?
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Some services which reduce the risk of HIV infection exist, but they are mainly for reproductive health and are not integrated with initiatives in HIV/AIDS. Because poor developing countries cannot afford to establish a separate service for sexually transmitted infections, particularly because of the stigma, integration of reproductive health services with HIV would seem to be logical and economically sound. Services such as maternal and child health clinics that incorporate family planning information and supplies of condoms could also identify mothers with HIV and provide them and their babies with anti-retroviral drugs to prevent the new-born babies from becoming infected. Improving reproductive health services is essential to combating HIV/AIDS through HIV counselling, increased condom availability for use by men and also condoms for women through the management of sexually transmitted infections.

</p>

<a name="40519-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Teams that treat malaria in endemic areas are becoming another avenue of tackling HIV and associated infections such as tuberculosis. These teams give anti-malarial medicines after testing the patient&#039;s blood for malarial parasites. Blood can also be collected to screen for HIV and implement treatment. When providing advice on how to prevent children from being bitten by malaria-carrying mosquitoes, information on how to avoid sexually transmitted infections can also be given to the community. As chairman of a charity, the Malaria Consortium, I am encouraged by these positive developments to integrate the management of malaria and HIV in our African field areas in Uganda and in Ghana by local health teams. In addition, treatment for TB is given where required. We are monitoring the implementation of these programmes and collecting data.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The All-Party Parliamentary Group on AIDS, of which I am a member, is particularly concerned about the rapidly emerging epidemics in eastern Europe and central Asia that have been identified by other noble   Lords. The enormous growth of HIV in these countries cannot possibly be due only to better detection and is clearly a result of the rapid spread of HIV infection. This rapid infection rate will reduce economic growth by 1 per cent as spending on health in these countries on HIV/AIDS increases from 1 to 3   per cent of gross domestic product.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>When the HIV infection rate has increased beyond 1 per cent among adults, no country has been able to contain the epidemic. Russia is now approaching that 1 per cent threshold.

<a name="40519-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The Chinese Government estimate that there are 840,000 HIV-positive people in their country and that 80,000 have AIDS. The UN estimates that there are at least 1 million people with HIV in China and that this number could grow to 20 million by 2010. That is probably a more realistic estimate than that of the Chinese Government because only 10 per cent of individuals in China know that they are infected with HIV.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>About 7.2 million people in Asia are HIV positive, with 5 million living in India and China. An estimated 500,000 people died of AIDS-related complications in Asia in 2002. The growing epidemic in Asia accounts for approximately 25 per cent of the world&#039;s new cases of HIV/AIDS.


</p>

<a name="40519-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I know that the Department for International Development is consulting on its future programme for HIV/AIDS in developing countries. DfID has done, and continues to do, effective work to combat HIV/AIDS&#151;something of which we can all be proud. Perhaps the Minister would consider international plans to control the spread of HIV/AIDS in Asia through education, capacity building and support for the treatment and prevention of this serious disease.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>In partnership with local mass media, information can be given to all communities about the dangers of HIV/AIDS and about how to avoid infection. In 2002, the BBC World Service assisted All India Radio and Doordarshan TV in disseminating information on HIV/AIDS. It was aimed at young people in northern India and information was given on how they could protect themselves and end discrimination against those living with AIDS. Is the Minister aware of any other partnerships along those lines in other parts of Asia?
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Finally, some developing countries in Africa and south-east Asia have begun to assess the effect of their local and national programmes for reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Uganda and Thailand, which have already been mentioned, have made progress in combating HIV/AIDS. Will Her Majesty&#039;s Government encourage and assist developing countries in learning good practice from other countries in their region or continent? Such learning would be more appropriate than using models that work in industrialised countries.

<a name="40519-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend Lord Chan with his distinguished international medical career. I join in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for introducing this debate on the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>We are all acutely conscious of the gravity of the situation in many parts of the world but, among the cacophony of statistics and projections, I was particularly moved by a recent report by Stephen Lewis, the United Nations Secretary-General&#039;s special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa. He was visiting a paediatric ward in Lusaka last year where doctors told him that, in that hospital alone, a child dies of HIV/<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_830"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 830</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

AIDS-related causes every 15 minutes. I fear that such situations are duplicated in many other hospitals, particularly in southern Africa. This is not about sterile statistics; this crisis is about human suffering on an almost unimaginable scale. Therefore, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for once again bringing this issue to your Lordships&#039; attention.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>Much is being done, and many new initiatives and projects are being launched month on month. The noble Baroness, Lady Jay, and the noble Lord, Lord   Holme, will be co-chairing an important workshop on HIV/AIDS in southern Africa at Marlborough House tomorrow. As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, mentioned in his powerful speech, this pandemic is a global problem. However, I should like to focus my remarks today on the serious situation in South Africa&#151;a country in which I have spent most of my life.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>In South Africa, where the Minister of Health has long been extolling the medicinal qualities of olive oil, lemon, garlic and the African potato, the Government last November eventually&#151;I stress, eventually&#151;agreed to start the distribution of anti-retroviral drugs to patients with a CD count below 200. Almost 15,000 patients are now receiving this form of treatment, which will save some lives and certainly extend many others. This is a welcome start.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I had lunch yesterday with the governor of the Reserve Bank of South Africa, Tito Mboweni, who confirmed that the South African Government have committed themselves to spending 12 billion rand on the struggle against HIV/AIDS over the next five years. This massively increased health budget, combined with the billions of dollars in aid from other countries&#151;most notably, the United States and Britain&#151;should maintain the delivery of anti-retroviral drugs nationwide.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>Incidentally, while this debate focuses on HIV/AIDS, we should be mindful that it is not the only killer disease in Africa.      I was pleased that my noble friend Lord Chan mentioned the scourge of malaria. More than 350 million Africans&#151;nearly half the population&#151;contract malaria every year, and yet malaria medication is not proclaimed a basic human right. As my noble friend Lord Sandwich quoted, one   in three people living with HIV worldwide are co-infected with tuberculosis, and nine out of 10 die of TB within a few months unless treatment is available. Spending on HIV/AIDS research currently exceeds spending on TB by a factor of 90 to one.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Aside from caring for the suffering of HIV/AIDS patients, it is also important to focus funds on the whole issue of prevention. In this regard, it is encouraging to see the South African Government and private enterprise there combining to warn and inform the population. That prevailing resolve was reflected by Mbhazima Shilowa, the Premier of Gauteng, the former Transvaal, when he said last month:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;Forty million South Africans are HIV-negative, and we want to keep them that way&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>The &quot;Love Life&quot; campaign has been spread across roadside billboards, candidly advocating safe sex and urging self-preservation. The Kaiser Foundation has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_831"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 831</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

put 500 million rand into a youth prevention campaign, and various British NGOs are making an invaluable contribution to this cause. Recent findings of the Reproductive Health Research Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand suggest that such measures are starting to produce positive results. The survey of 12,000 young people aged between 15 and 25   found that 32 per cent regularly use condoms&#151;up from 8 per cent in 1998. It also suggests that the infection rate among 15 to 19 year-olds is slowing.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>There are positive indicators in what otherwise remains an extremely bleak situation. HIV/AIDS awareness remains almost non-existent in urban squatter camps and rural areas, and the alarming rate of infection among South African youth remains the highest in the world. More campaigns and more programmes are required to address persistent behavioural trends, such as multiple sexual partners and alcohol and drug abuse. I entirely agree with the call of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury that the threat of the pandemic should be preached in churches, mosques and other religious forums.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Of course, there remains a great deal to be done but, 12 months ago, South Africa appeared to be sleepwalking to disaster. That is thankfully not the case today. At long last, the tide has started to turn. I would, however, like to sound a note of caution on the accuracy of the available statistics. Many of your Lordships will be aware of the recent report by UNAIDS, which estimated that 5.4 million South Africans have been infected by HIV&#151;that is, one in every nine of the 45 million. It has also been reported that the HIV/AIDS virus is carried not only by 100,000 of the country&#039;s 1 million civil servants but also by a   quarter of mineworkers employed by Anglo American.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I challenge how these noticeably round numbers are calculated. Like anything else, they should be subject to scrutiny. Estimates of infection and death rates are based not on the results of actual testing, which are costly and clearly impractical, but on sparse information fed into computer models. Such systems are patently imperfect.
</p>

<a name="40519-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>The World Health Organisation initially used Epimodel to calculate that 250,000 South Africans had died of HIV/AIDS related causes in 1999. This system was subsequently upgraded to ASSA 600, which concluded that only 143,000 South Africans had died because of the virus in 1999. Towards the end of 2001, the agency then introduced another model, ASSA 2000, which further reduced the total to 92,000.

</p>

<a name="40519-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Of course, we must take the statistics seriously, but they are estimates, not facts. Last year, it was widely reported that the population of Botswana had fallen from 1.4   million to below 1 million because of HIV/AIDS related deaths. However, a recent census put the population at 1.7 million.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 832</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The HIV/AIDS pandemic remains an immense problem in southern Africa. However, the campaign to control the virus in South Africa and Botswana is, thankfully, starting to make headway. I hope that the focus remains as firmly on prevention as on cure.

<a name="40519-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, perhaps he could answer one question. He has given us very encouraging news of the change of heart in South Africa. Does that imply that that is real political leadership from the top?
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40519-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso: </b>   My Lords, the situation is that for some time President Thabo Mbeke has swept the issue of HIV/AIDS under the carpet. Fortunately, through pressure from his colleagues in cabinet and from international organisations, the president has agreed that this is indeed a major problem for which he has to take responsibility. Therefore, I say that the tide has turned.
<a name="time_22"></a>
<a name="40519-16_time0"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40519-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, I am very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has put down this Motion for debate. When he was Secretary of State for Health in the 1980s his efforts in this area were brave and widely admired. I remember that he was also much vilified. Such national leadership is now desperately needed around the world. As most noble Lords seem to feel, the AIDS epidemic is surely one of the greatest challenges of our time. Although the plague of the Middle Ages, to which the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, referred, wiped out whole communities and generated great social unrest, it was not on this scale. It should, however, serve as a warning of what such epidemics can do to the social fabric.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, with some interest. When he extracts a tooth from an apparently HIV/AIDS patient, I wonder whether he feels it necessary to take special precautions. I am glad to say that my husband, if operating on an HIV/AIDS patient, does so. But diverse views encourage research which is badly needed, especially if a vaccine is to be developed.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>In my view, AIDS threatens not only to devastate the lives of those infected, but also to destroy societies. As we have heard&#151;I understand the question about the figures&#151;there are perhaps some 40 million to 46   million people living with HIV globally, 30 million of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. As we have heard, there are at least 14 million AIDS orphans. AIDS is   spreading rapidly around the world. There are probably at least 1 million people living with HIV in China and the UN estimates that that may reach 20   million within six years. The fastest growing incidence of the disease is now in eastern Europe, right on our borders.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>So why have we failed to recognise the significance of this catastrophe? Can we see evidence, as the noble Lord, Lord St John, said, of the huge tanker of international concern gradually turning around? We are deluged with news of conferences, communiqu&#233;s and commitments, but to what extent is money <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_833"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 833</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

following the pledges? Clearly this disaster is on such a catastrophic scale that even massive efforts do not yet meet what is required.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Profound changes in behaviour are also required. As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has said, prevention is clearly the key to containing the disease. But like him, I am glad that we are now also talking about treatment. Until recently, treatment had seemed an almost impossible dream in much of Africa at least. It was said that there was not the health infrastructure or the drugs required. That has now been recognised as a counsel of despair. Instead we see that prolonging lives is good in itself, but also helps to hold societies together. At the very least it postpones the time when children are abandoned to care for themselves.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The agreement to provide generic anti-retroviral drugs has been a huge step forward, and is a credit to international institutions. This weekend we heard the excellent news that the US Government will also apparently speed the approval there of cheap ARVs. That is desperately needed. Only 3 per cent of those who need ARV drugs in Africa have access to them. The &quot;3 by 5&quot; initiative of WHO and UNAIDS is ambitious, but not ambitious enough.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>A blueprint for what can be done is surely the ACHAP scheme in Botswana to which the noble Lord, Lord St John, referred. The incidence of AIDS in Botswana is generally around 38 per cent, but as high as 65 per cent among certain groups. A partnership of Merck & Co and the Gates Foundation with the Government of Botswana has committed 100 million dollars to addressing almost every aspect of the AIDS epidemic in Botswana. Almost half of the population of 1.7 million live on only one dollar a day. ACHAP is investing in prevention, education, strengthening capacity and providing care so that all potentially have access to treatment.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>As yet those who are well are not coming forward for testing or for treatment, although information about the disease is being disseminated. Fewer than 10   per cent yet know their status. So it is the very ill who are coming to the clinics. But here the scheme has already made a huge difference, reducing what might have been a 100 per cent death rate among this particular group to 8 per cent.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>However, they are finding that they have enormous problems with capacity&#151;too few doctors and nurses&#151;and they are drawing them in from other countries around. That is clearly something that the international community will have to address. Can the Minister comment on whether there might be schemes for training doctors, nurses and teachers more rapidly, given that they are especially needed and yet they are particularly badly hit by the epidemic?
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Sixty-four per cent of those who are being treated in Botswana are women. The impact of this epidemic is far greater on women than on men. Women and adolescent girls are socially, culturally, biologically and economically more vulnerable. Women are not only at greater risk of contracting the disease, but they also carry the greatest social burden, as caring falls to them, whether as elderly carers or as children.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_834"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 834</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Fundamental changes in attitudes towards women are necessary, but I cannot imagine that they will be anything but slow to come. If I can see any bright spot in this epidemic it will be if indeed it causes a shift in the position of women. There are short-term measures that can certainly be taken. Educating girls, supporting carers, developing microbicides with which women may help to protect themselves and changing legal systems so that women can inherit land and property on their husband&#039;s death can all be moved forward while pushing for more profound changes in attitudes towards women.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The worst and the saddest aspect of the AIDS story is surely the plight of the children. I cannot believe that we have taken so little action to help AIDS orphans up to now. As Save the Children has put it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;Children are the most affected and the most marginalised in the fight against this epidemic&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>There are the children with HIV. In South Africa there is now a prevalence of over 6 per cent in children between the ages of two and 15. UNAIDS estimates that over half of new infections are occurring in young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>But in addition children are being orphaned every minute. Fourteen million children under the age of 15 have already been orphaned and this number is projected to double by the end of this decade. In the hardest hit countries in southern Africa, up to one quarter of all children, one in eight of the entire population, is an orphan.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>We clearly have to do what we can to try to support extended families who have taken in orphan children. For a start, the care-giver should never need to have to worry about how to feed those in their care. Free schooling is needed so that children can continue their education and make it less likely that they themselves will fall victim to the disease. Clearly, trying to support   children in large extended families or within communities is likely to be far preferable to establishing huge orphanages. But there is already evidence of extended families breaking down under the strain. Society itself is at breaking point. It is better therefore that they receive some care than end up as street children, prostitutes and child soldiers.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>In the Government&#039;s last policy statement on AIDS, orphans were mentioned as an effect of AIDS without their needs being addressed. The Government surely must be at the forefront of developing comprehensive plans for these children and not see them simply as some by-product of the disease. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says on this matter.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Spending by the international community has dramatically increased, but the UN reckons that spending needs at least to double again. Can the Minister tell me how much the Government will be contributing to the Global Fund and when he anticipates the Government will reach 0.7 per cent of GNP donated to aid? I welcome the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, that there should be an EU co-ordinator for AIDS. That is a very positive and useful proposal.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_835"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 835</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>We have to recognise that we are still only at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic and its impact. First, the incidence of HIV rises exponentially. Then the number of AIDS cases rises. Only after that do we see the exponential rise in the impact of the disease. In many areas we are still at the stage of seeing the rise in HIV infection. We therefore know that even if we keep in check the increase in the number of infections, we are still yet to see its huge impact. It is like watching a tidal wave roll in.
</p>

<a name="40519-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>We therefore have to recognise that we are in this for the long term, and that we have to act with a far greater sense of urgency. There is surely no higher priority for DfID. AIDS is already reversing development, so that instead of moving towards the MDGs by 2015, we will simply move away from them. That is why I welcome this debate and all those communications I receive which tell me that there is an ever increasing number of people who realise quite how important this pandemic is for all our futures.

It was his characteristic modesty which precluded his mentioning that he was the Secretary of State responsible for this very successful campaign in the 1980s.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>I should declare an interest. I have been president and chairman of the Mildmay centre in Hackney, which was set up in 1986 with the help and encouragement of Lord Shaw. He was of enormous help and encouragement to us. It was the first hospice for people dying of AIDS in Europe. Then at the invitation of president Museveni of Uganda we later set up a similar organisation in Kampala, with the invaluable support of my noble friend Lady Chalker, as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich.

</p>

<a name="40519-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>When the World Health Organisation predicted in 1999 that there would be 27 million people with HIV/AIDS by now, it was thought by many to be scaremongering. The estimate was wrong. The figures today are 50 per cent higher than predicted. The numbers are set to grow even more as infection rates continue to rise especially in countries where poverty, poor health systems and limited resources for prevention and care accelerate the spread of the virus.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>A young Zulu lady from Durban has been working in many districts in this country during the past six months and she has been alarmed by the attitude that she has encountered. Everywhere she goes people give her the impression that they think that AIDS is a problem of the sub-Sahara, but the danger in Europe is very grave indeed.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>A WHO study released this month showed that HIV/AIDS is spreading throughout Europe faster than anywhere else in the world. Almost 2.5 million people on the Continent are affected. In developed countries HIV/AIDS claimed approximately 18,000 lives in the past year. There is increasing evidence that prevention strategies in several high income countries <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_836"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 836</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are not keeping pace with the changes occurring in the spread of the disease. These shortcomings are most evident among the marginalised group of populations such as immigrants and refugees.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The spread is fastest in Eastern Europe where one third of 1 million new cases were identified last year. That is up from 27,000 in 1995. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia the worst affected areas are the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the Baltic states, but the disease continues to spread in other eastern countries such as Belarus, Moldova and Kazakhstan, and more recently in Uzbekistan. It is estimated that 1 million people aged 15 to 49 are living with HIV/AIDS in the Russian Federation.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Over 1 million people in Asia and the Pacific acquired HIV/AIDS in 2003, bringing the total number to an estimated 7.4 million. This region saw 500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2003 alone.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>The prevalence of the disease is hard to estimate in these regions due to the vast size and population of the countries. That has the effect of focusing attention towards the prevalence in major urban areas, often obscuring the epidemics in smaller provinces.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>There is also the notion that North Africa and the Middle East have side-stepped the global epidemic, but the latest figures prove that that is not so. It is estimated that 600,000 people now have HIV/AIDS in this region, which killed 45,000 people in 2003 alone. Over 2 million people are now living with HIV/AIDS in Latin America and the Caribbean including 200,000 who contracted the disease in 2003. At least 100,000 people died of AIDS in the same period, which is the highest regional death toll after the sub-Sahara and Asia. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in the UK, of whom about one-third are thought to be undiagnosed.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>Until 1998, infections acquired in homosexual men were the main exposure category for new infections in the UK. However, by 1999, heterosexually-acquired HIV/AIDS had become the main exposure category for new cases in the UK. That situation has continued. The proportion of infections acquired through injecting drugs has been much smaller in the UK than in many other European countries. That is largely due to the well implemented harm reduction methods&#151;for example, needle replacement programmes.

</p>

<a name="40519-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in delaying associated deaths and the onset of AIDS. However, the decline in the number of cases and deaths in the surveillance data will not necessarily be maintained. Some of the progressions to AIDS or death, which continue to occur in the era of widely-available HAART, may be attributed to patient non-compliance, failure to tolerate a demanding drug regime or the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains.

</p>

<a name="40519-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>In the past 15 years, there has been a great increase in the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection among heterosexuals in the UK. By 2003, the total number infected was nearly 20,000. Infection rates are particularly high in African <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_837"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 837</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

communities in the UK where, often, one or both of the partners has contracted the infection in Africa before arrival.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>I was very glad that the noble Baroness, Lady   Masham, mentioned the withdrawal of support from the children services at the Mildmay centre in Hackney. PCTs will not fund them. I suspect that that is because there are no government targets for the management of those children. Naturally and understandably, PCTs feel obliged to try to concentrate on reaching the targets that have been set by the Government in other areas. Perhaps the Minister would look into that rather sad state of affairs.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>This morning, I was speaking to Mrs Ruth Sims in Uganda, who is the director and founder of the Mildmay centre in Uganda. For many years, she has done wonderful work in Uganda and many other parts of Africa. She said that one of the problems in Uganda is that it has now become clear that many children were infected at birth unbeknown at the time. HIV/AIDS is now becoming manifest in teenagers as old as 18, who picked up the infection at birth. In retrospect, many of them have been ill off and on for most of their lives but they were not diagnosed.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, mentioned, the number of orphans is putting an intolerable burden on the already extended families, especially in Uganda. For instance, a granny may look after 10 orphans. Then, one of the children becomes sick. That could be the last straw because the granny already goes out to work all day to earn enough money to support the orphans. She does not have time to look after the sick child.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Of course, making available ARVs (anti-retroviral drugs) is a great help. The problem now is that there are far too few people able to administer those drugs to the children. What is desperately needed is not only ARVs but also palliative care and people on the ground who can look after those unfortunate children and give support at grass-roots level for the elderly grandmothers on whom most of the burden of care falls.

</p>

<a name="40519-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>Another problem that has arisen in Uganda is that the supply of drugs which are necessary to treat the complications of HIV/AIDS has been reduced. In a clinic   in the Mildmay centre in Uganda, I saw about 80   HIV/AIDS infected children being treated. Most of them had treatable complications, such as opportunistic infections, toxoplasmosis, PCT, pneumonia and fungal infections, which respond well to relatively cheap drugs. Incidentally, 80 per cent of those children had open TB. Noble Lords have mentioned an incidence of one in three, but in those unfortunate children 80 per cent had open TB.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>One commercial firm is continuing to supply some of the drugs for free, but it is essential that we have enough drugs to treat all those infections. They improve the lives of children so that they then can be treated with ARVs. Will the Minister kindly consider making funds available for those drugs and for palliative care?

</p>

<a name="40519-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>In some countries in Africa the stigma of AIDS is appalling. For instance, as has been mentioned, it is widespread in South Africa. When someone in a family is diagnosed with AIDS, instead of his or her family rallying around, they tend to isolate and ignore the person. In some of the general hospitals in South Africa, as many as 50 per cent of children under the age of 5 attending hospital are HIV positive.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>It has been shown that rates of HIV transmission vary by social standing, especially in the southern United States. The WHO proposes that prevention activities need to be designed with the local epidemiology and the spread and management of the disease in mind. For example, in settings in which HIV/AIDS is largely sexually transmitted, information and education campaigns can save lives. A prime example is Thailand, which has already been mentioned.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>In the fight against HIV/AIDS, the role of heads of state has been crucial. Those presidents who have denied the problem have presided over disasters, as has been mentioned in South Africa. Those who have been honest and have given real leadership are well worth studying.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>From Africa, perhaps we have most to learn from President Museveni&#151;mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich&#151;whose campaign has led to a really significant reduction in the incidence of HIV from 31   per cent to 7 per cent among pregnant women. We are not sure whether we can extrapolate that figure to the rest of the population, but, certainly, his leadership and close liaison with schools, Churches and non-government organisations has been inspiring. As has been mentioned already, at the centre of his campaign has been the well known ABC programme; that is abstinence, be faithful in marriage and condoms.
</p>

<a name="40519-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>Some emphasis has been put on the need for education, but that is only part of the answer. A young British lady doctor went to Africa to work for six months. She had an affair and returned with AIDS in spite of being highly educated. The tragedy of the disease is that many people could avoid it by changing their behaviour. Sadly, even if behaviour in many developing countries changed overnight, those countries would still lose one-third of their populations.

<a name="40519-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I join everyone in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on securing the debate. His knowledge, compassion and commitment are well known and applauded on all sides of the House. There is no one with a better right to pose the critical questions&#151;a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and others, in which I join.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>This is a subject of global importance with massive ramifications. We have had what must certainly be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges of views that I can recall. I shall try to reflect on those views here, but I promise noble Lords that I shall be reflecting on them long after today&#039;s debate is over. Some parts of the discussion have been harrowing. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_839"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 839</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury and the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, also raised issues that have probably moved us all.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>There have been a great many significant recent developments at home and overseas which have signalled an increased, almost unprecedented, focus on the epidemic. I am bound to say, not at great length, to the noble Lord, Lord, Lord Colwyn, that there are always outlying theories in any branch of medicine, but it is inconceivable that we could stand aside from the overwhelming weight of epidemiological research studies across the world and across cultures. There has been a diversity of research and yet a commonality of conclusions. People do not die of AIDS unless they have HIV. It is probably true that other factors such as poverty and malnutrition accelerate the onset of AIDS, but not without HIV. The AIDS pandemic is not just old illnesses. The rapid increase in sickness and death among populations principally made up of groups that are sexually active demonstrates that that is a new phenomenon. Noble Lords who have a great deal more medical experience than I made that point   during the debate. As the noble Baroness, Lady   Northover, said, there is of course a need for greater research, but we hope that as that research takes place, the AIDS dissidents&#151;if I may describe them in that way&#151;will be receptive to its outcomes.

</p>

<a name="40519-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>World AIDS Day 2003 marked a stepping-up of the UK&#039;s political attention to HIV/AIDS, with the launch of our Call for Action. I shall return to the developments around the Government&#039;s new HIV/AIDS strategy. We have focused on a number of questions. Those questions relate to our domestic arrangements, but also to the international position; for example, how best can the UK work with its partners? What is the best balance between UK-led action and our support for international action? What is the best balance between multilateral and bilateral research activity? We shall have to discuss in the ways that have been raised in the debate the balance of work between governments, civil society and the private sector. What is the balance between prevention, treatment and care, and impact mitigation? Those are all vital questions. As the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said, they are big questions and they need some pretty big answers.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler&#151;I hope that I am quoting his words accurately; I do not mean to distort them&#151;described the issues as issues of sheer scale, as matters where the sheer scale of the question should be absolutely fundamental to us. The noble Lord, Lord   McColl, also placed the right emphasis on these figures. They are truly staggering statistics: 60 million people have been infected with HIV since the late 1970s; 20 million deaths so far; 40 million people living with the virus; 5 million new infections in 2003. I shall try to break those figures down to smaller time capsules: 14,000 people die from AIDS every day; 570   people die an hour; nine people die every minute. One can almost do the sum while we have been holding this debate. Three million people died of AIDS in 2003; five people died every minute; 342 every hour and so on. As noble Lords have pointed out, more than half of new infections occur in young people between <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_840"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 840</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

15   and 24 years old. As the noble Baroness, Lady   Northover, also said, women and girls are at much heightened risk. That is a fundamental issue in itself.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McColl, was quite right to draw our attention to the 2.5 million people with AIDS on the Continent. Eastern Europe is close enough to us and it has grave difficulties. We need to comment on that before we comment on people who are further afield.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>Perhaps I may take up the point about Mildmay. I was not aware until this evening&#039;s discussion of all the issues, but I undertake to look into the matter.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>I think that we would all accept that the greatest impact of AIDS so far has been in sub-Saharan Africa. Southern Africa has 30 per cent of infections and only 2 per cent of the world&#039;s population, even allowing for the risk of the statistics being not all that we would want them to be. As noble Lords have said, there are fast-growing epidemics in the Russian Federation. Potentially the highest increase is in China and India, in both cases, as has been pointed out, with people not knowing.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, made a very powerful point when he said that our own early experience needs to be conveyed to others, not in any patronising way, but in order to make sure that early lessons can be learnt. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said that our experience was and is a model and I agree with her.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>The issues are important and are recognised as such. I shall underline that with a brief quotation from Khadija Moalla, the project manager who has been dealing with many of those issues in the Arab states. He said that it has to be accepted almost like a mathematical axiom that there has been a failure in dealing with HIV/AIDS so far, which implies that we need many new ways of working on those fundamental problems. That is the stark reality that we face.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Perhaps I may deal briefly with a couple of domestic issues. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, asked about prisons and about the scope of the law here. I offer her a couple of assurances. A good deal of discussion has taken place about the problems of sharing needles in prison and the issues surrounding the provision of injecting equipment. That is prohibited in prisons at the moment and a fundamental change in policy would be needed.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>As a proportionate response to the issue of sharing needles, the Prison Service is reintroducing disinfecting tablets to prisoners. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has been contracted to design and implement a strategy for their introduction in all prison establishments in England and Wales. The programme should have rolled out from April 2004 and I believe that it is doing so. The reintroduction of disinfecting tablets on a trial basis just a couple of years ago has now been evaluated. That project has led to the conclusion that I have just announced to the House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_841"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 841</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>The Prison Service also recognises that sex in prisons is a reality and carries a public health dimension. Prison doctors have therefore been advised that they should prescribe condoms to individual prisoners on application if, in their clinical judgment, there is any kind of known risk of HIV infection. Policy probably varies across the prison estate, but it would obviously be better if it were raised to a much better standard in general. There are no plans to introduce needle exchange at present, but that matter is reviewed regularly.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, for drawing the attention of the House to the declaration on prison health which I understand was adopted by the annual conference of the World Health Organisation in Moscow in October 2003. Officials working in the prison health team, which is a joint Home Office and Department of Health unit, are taking forward the reforms to improve prison health care. That unit is also acting as a collaborating centre for the WHO project. It will ensure that officials representing the UK at the next conference in October 2004 are fully briefed on the details of the declaration and will be in a position to look at progress.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>On the legal status of people wilfully or knowingly transmitting HIV, it is not possible at present to confirm that there will be new legislation. My understanding is that prosecution is achieved under existing categories of law, particularly GBH. We would be concerned about the excessive use of legal instruments to protect public health, because the burden of proof in intimate relations is not always an easy matter in tests of law. The carrot-and-stick approach is usually most effective in health promotion HIV projects.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>More broadly, the impact of AIDS, as we have all agreed, is devastating. It is killing development in the developing world. Life expectancy in many African countries is falling to around 30 years of age. Botswana is the worst affected. An upper-middle income country, it faces a decline in life expectancy from 65 in 1990&#150;95 to 40 today and it is projected that it may be 27 by 2010. The country may drop to low income status. Death among young people is undermining the workforce and potential carers. It has also been pointed out in debate that to cope with the crisis, households may be forced to sell off assets, children to go out to work, and there may be a switch to growing lower-value crops.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>There are acute problems in public services. Africa is having to deal with significantly depleted resource capacity. Education and health services are the hardest hit. Teacher absenteeism, let alone the rate of death among young teachers, is dramatically cutting the number of teaching hours across southern Africa. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, made the dramatic point that the number of teachers dying is outstripping those who are entering the profession.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>Other problems include depleted work forces, lower productivity, economic growth rates decimated, with the private sector equally hard hit. There is a sharp decline in productivity, less resource and what has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_842"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 842</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been described in the course of our debate, if I can put it in slightly different words, as the 1 per cent tipping point, where this becomes catastrophic.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>The social impact is enormous. The fabric of our societies, as the right reverend Prelate said&#151;and he must be right&#151;is an intricate network that binds us together in very subtle ways, and fear finally begins to usurp the binding.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, both made points about this. I do not think I can respond in a reasonable amount of time to all those points, but I shall write to noble Lords who have raised the point about the difference between budget support for local initiatives and the way in which we might get a more co-ordinated support where we are trying to assist in single government settings. In some countries, such as Uganda, one model is more appropriate than it would be in Tanzania, where it would not necessarily work as well. There is a degree of subtlety which needs considerable thought, and I shall write to noble Lords on that. I will say in that response why there is relatively little reference to ARVs in the HMG consultation document, although it is covered in other consultation documents. I draw noble Lords&#039; attention to those. HIV and TB are strongly linked, and treatment with ARVs is one of the most fundamental issues.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>Noble Lords raised the question of orphans. There are 14 million AIDS orphans in the world; the figure will rise to 25 million by 2010. Families are being dislocated as children are sent off to live with elderly relatives. Orphans are less likely to attend school. They are more likely to suffer from poor health and malnutrition and are more vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse. The impact is felt long before their parents die, when children, especially girls, have to drop out of school to become carers and take responsibility for farms, household chores and income-generation. We must pay great attention to the rights of orphans&#151;that is one of the central parts of the Government&#039;s programme.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The social consequences could be enormous, with children who have suffered profound distress, with   little adult guidance or support, facing very uncertain futures, often in the face of widespread stigma and discrimination. Social breakdown can itself fuel conflict.

</p>

<a name="40519-18_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Women shoulder the burden of caring and are less   likely to be cared for. They suffer the greater discrimination; they face the greater poverty&#151;unequal inheritance and land rights laws fuel poverty and HIV risk. Women and girls are biologically, socially and economically at the greatest risk of HIV infection. The sexual education of girls is at the heart of DfID&#039;s approach. That approach is not always easy because it sometimes has to be taken in countries where there is a great deal of conflict. Getting any kind of help through is not easy, creating a lack of access to information and a breakdown of services. We must address those questions.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chan, talked about some of the information which is available in some of the areas where malaria is important. The Malaria Consortium <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_843"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 843</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

plays a vital role; the data that it is generating is important for much broader epidemiological and clinical research as well. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, provided valuable insights into what is happening in South Africa in relation to antiretroviral drugs.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>DfID is giving the highest priority to tackling the HIV/AIDS issue. We have increased our funding to developing countries; we are working with non-governmental, private and multilateral partners to improve prevention, treatment and care programmes. UNAIDS describes DfID as the world&#039;s second biggest bilateral donor of HIV/AIDS finance. Bilateral funding on HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health has increased sevenfold over the past six years from &#163;38 million to more than &#163;270 million in 2002&#150;03.
</p>

<a name="40519-18_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>We were the first bilateral donor government to contribute to the World Health Organisation/UNAIDS 3x5 initiative&#151;to get 3 million people on life-saving anti-retroviral treatment by 2005. Our contribution of &#163;3 million has led to others and we welcome the significant contribution from Canada, announced only last week.

</p>

<a name="40519-18_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>We are guided by the 3 Ones programme to which I believe a fourth One is about to be added. In each nation, we need a single strategy, so that everyone knows where they are going. We need one national AIDS authority, although I understand that we do not want to kill off initiative and the things done by many of the voluntary bodies. But there needs to be some co-ordination. We want to see one monitoring framework, not least to get   the better statistics to which the noble Lord, Lord   St   John, referred. The fourth One, if it comes along, will be that we want to see donors working through a financial mechanism which will reduce transactional costs.
</p>

I am pleased to announce that there are 58 other nations now making contributions, and contributions are being made through the EC. We are heading towards the 0.7 per cent target.

EU member states and the EC have provided more than 50 per cent of the total funding of the global fund. This is in line with the call from the Prime Minister and President Chirac for Europe to play a full part. A good deal of this money needs to be spent on drugs and palliative care. I will ponder hard the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord McColl, that the amount should be increased.

In all of this, working together will involve working with strong leadership&#151;points made by the noble Lords, Lord Fowler, Lord Brooke and Lord McColl. President Museveni, quite rightly, deserves honourable mention. We will be supporting the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development. We need better funding, and we will be working hard for that. We need better donor co-ordination, and we will be working hard for that.

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>We need better HIV/AIDS programmes. This is the purpose of the major areas with which we are concerned. We want to work to eliminate global poverty, which underpins our commitment to addressing HIV/AIDS.

We want to work on marginalised groups, defined by poverty, gender, ethnicity, age, sexuality and disability. We want to make sure that research in our own country moves ahead because this is a great centre of research&#151;and research is one of the most helpful elements that can be contributed to this debate.

<a name="40519-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Fowler: </b>   My Lords, this has been an outstanding debate.

I would like to thank all noble Lords for their contributions. I agreed with almost all those <br>&nbsp;<br>

who spoke. I very much agreed with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury when, in his very important speech, he said that HIV/AIDS cannot be allowed to slip from the public agenda and that it must go to the top of governments&#039; agendas. I think he is entirely right to say that.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>My noble friend Lord Colwyn said, in the most genial way, that he did not think that I would agree with much of what he would say. He was right on that. He said that there is so much that we do not understand about HIV/AIDS. It is true that we still have no cure and no vaccine. But we know what can be done to prevent it and we know what can be done to treat it. My noble friend Lord McColl and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, both pointed to the experience in Uganda where the incidence of HIV has been brought down. My noble friend Lord Brooke, in his elegant speech, also pointed to Brazil.

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>It would be wrong of me to try to summarise what all   noble Lords have said. There were important contributions from each of them; for example, from the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, with her vast experience on the position in prisons; from the noble Baroness, Lady   Masham, on the need to have a more outward going campaign in the UK; and from the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, on orphans. I was fascinated by the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord St John of Bletso and Lord Chan, about South Africa.

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>Lastly, I would like to thank the Minister for his thoughtful reply. I agreed with much of the diagnosis. If I may gently say so, I was a little less convinced on the new action that the Government intend to take. We will have to study the figures that came out in a shower at the end of the speech. I am always suspicious about figures that talk about spending over seven years and what that means year by year. However, I thank him. We still have a long way to go&#151;I think that we agree on that&#151;both in policy at home and overseas. We will support all the Government&#039;s genuine efforts but we will also not hesitate to point out when the Government are not doing enough. That is my position. In other words, I think we will debate this matter again. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40519-19_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Howe </b>   rose to move, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations, laid before the House on 1 April, be annulled (S.I. 2004/1031) [<i>4th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the regulations to which this Prayer relates are primarily aimed at transposing into UK law the provisions of the EC Clinical Trials Directive 2001. I first became aware of the directive in the middle of last year when the Government were consulting on its implementation. At that time the concerns we were hearing were mainly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_846"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 846</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those of the medical research charities and academics who were fearful that a combination of bureaucracy, excessive costs and procedural inflexibility would finish off a great deal of collaboratively funded non-commercial clinical research in the UK. It is fair to say that, thanks to the work of Ministers and officials, to which I pay tribute, those worries have diminished somewhat.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>There is still a concern, reflected in the recent report of the Merits Committee, about what effect a commission directive on good clinical practice might have on the UK when it is eventually issued. There is also a strong feeling that the aims and content of the directive should be reviewed by the Commission at the earliest opportunity, particularly in relation to non-commercial clinical trials. The Minister may care to comment on those matters. However, some of the other earlier points of contention are no longer so salient and I do not intend to spend time on them now.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>The concerns that I want to raise this evening fall under two main headings: the rules for clinical trials as they affect mentally incapacitated adults and the future independence and functions of research ethics committees. The way that these two issues have been treated in the regulations has, in my view, profound implications for the future of clinical trials in this country. I hope that the Minister can provide some sturdy reassurances on these matters. He needs to know that there is real dismay and alarm out there, to a degree that I am not certain I can reflect adequately in the space of a few minutes.

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Let me start with mental incapacity. Paragraph 2 in Part 1 of Schedule 1 introduces into UK law for the first time the concept of a legal representative who may give consent for an adult lacking capacity to be entered into a clinical trial. It is the physician with responsibility for the adult&#039;s healthcare who is given the power to choose who should act as the person&#039;s legal representative in cases where this is not already clear. In the absence of anyone able to assume the role of personal legal representative, the physician may himself act in that role or alternatively may nominate anyone he chooses from the hospital or healthcare provider concerned.

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>It seems extraordinary that this element of the regulations should have been brought forward in advance of the introduction of the Mental Incapacity Bill. The whole area of medical research and mentally incapacitated patients is surely one to which only primary legislation can do full justice. The safeguards that should govern medical research in these circumstances need to be examined with the greatest care by both Houses of Parliament. Changing the law to enable one adult to decide what happens to another adult is a major matter. It is not a change appropriate to regulations.

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>Equally, it is a change that is fraught with danger. One cannot just appoint anyone to take a decision about whether a person should take part in a clinical trial. Clinical trials carry risks as well as potential benefits. The person taking the decision must be capable of weighing the risks and benefits dispassionately to determine whether participating in the trial is in the patient&#039;s best interest. Publicly available clinical trial data is not always a reliable indicator of risk.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_847"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 847</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>The decision maker needs to make an informed judgment as well as to be independent of the process. Is the patient&#039;s doctor independent of the process? If he is a hospital doctor and the researchers are friends and colleagues working alongside him, he may well not be independent in the truest sense. What about a nominee of the NHS trust? I am very worried that the regulations before us leave it completely open as to who exactly may find himself taking what could be momentous decisions on behalf of a mentally incapacitated individual. Technically, the regulations would allow the receptionist on an A&E ward to act as the decision-taker.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>If there are worries about mentally incapacitated adults in clinical trials, greater still are the worries relating to trials done on children where parental consent is not sought. As someone recently put it to me, if the researchers are in a hurry to find people to take part in a trial, they surely will not go to the family for consent. They will go straight to the doctor who is looking after the patient. What if the family find out too late what has happened and the trial had turned out badly? Mark my words, the moment a decision of this sort goes wrong, the balloon will go up. Negative publicity about a clinical trial could set back medical research for as long a time&#151;and as badly&#151;as the events at Alder Hey.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Why have the Government rushed into this and why have they not waited for the Mental Incapacity Bill for a full debate? The EU Clinical Trials Directive was designed as a harmonising measure, but the emphasis within it is very much on the protection of those who act as research subjects. It is therefore ironic in the extreme that Ministers should have allowed the protection of children and mentally incapacitated adults to be left so wide open.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>Let me move to the issue of research ethics committees. These regulations are supposed to embody the content of the EU directive, but they are stuffed full of measures that are completely absent from the EU legislation. A prime example is the creation of the United Kingdom Ethics Committee Authority.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Who comprises this new authority? It consists of the Secretary of State for Health, the National Assembly for Wales, Scottish Ministers and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for Northern Ireland. With a make-up like that, I defy anyone to say that this is not a political body. It clearly is.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>What powers does it have? It has the power to set up an ethics committee, abolish an ethics committee, recognise an existing committee, decline to recognise one or revoke a recognition of a committee if it is necessary or expedient to do so. In other words, the authority can abolish any ethics committee for any reason at all and set up another one whenever it chooses.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>It also appoints the chairman, vice-chairman, alternative vice-chairman and all the members of NHS ethics committees. One of the key characteristics of ethics committees is their independence from politics, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_848"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 848</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whether national, local or commercial. Indeed, independence of our ECs is an express requirement of the directive. We are looking here at the politicisation of ethics committees and hence the removal of their independence. I know that the Minister disputes that interpretation, but what other conclusion can we reach when the UKECA is being given such sweeping powers?

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>The creation of UKECA has enormous implications for medical research. Already over recent months we have witnessed the migration of large amounts of clinical trial work from the UK to other countries in Europe. The moment that foreign regulatory authorities start to regard UK ethics committees as lacking in independence there will only be one consequence. We shall see the flight of clinical trials from this country accelerate.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>Setting up UKECA in this form is not only unnecessary but also potentially very damaging to our national interests. Of all countries in the world with a reputable medical research sector, the UK is alone in its decision to exercise political control over its ethics committees. It is a mistake.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>There is a further respect in which the regulations unnecessarily restrict the freedom of ethics committees. The Helsinki Declaration contains a set of ethical principles to which all clinical trials must adhere. That declaration is referred to in Schedule 1, but it is defined in the terms of an out-of-date version.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Why does that matter? The Helsinki Declaration was radically rewritten in 2000. The importance of that rewrite is demonstrated sufficiently by one example, that of research subjects who lack capacity. On this issue, the 2000 version says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>That restriction does not appear in the earlier version of the Helsinki Declaration; nor does it appear in Schedule 1 of these regulations.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The regulations are broadly enough written that if, for example, someone was trying out a new antibiotic for chest infections and had access to a captive population of demented patients on a geriatric ward, it would be permissible to use them. An ethics committee that looked to the 2000 version of the Helsinki Declaration and decided not to permit such a trial to go ahead would be open to legal challenge.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Why are committees being forced into this position? Even ethics committees in Scotland are having their hands tied in this fashion, despite the fact that Scottish law&#151;the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000&#151;runs expressly contrary to the regulations on this important issue.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>We have already seen the way that the wind is blowing for ethics committees. COREC&#151;the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees&#151;has taken upon itself to decide that most research ethics committees will not in future be allowed to review clinical trials, even though they may have done so up <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_849"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 849</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to now without a problem. Only those RECs that are recognised under the regulations will be allowed to do so. The basis of recognition is still unclear.

</p>

<a name="40519-19_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I have received representations from a number of RECs around the country who are appalled and bewildered at COREC&#039;s approach, which they strongly believe puts at risk the future of phase one drugs trials in the UK.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>It is perhaps not appreciated that up until now the system of ethical approval for clinical trials has effectively amounted to a dual safeguard on patient safety. In the past, when a proposal came forward for a clinical trial to be carried out in a number of centres, a multi-centre REC would initially review that research proposal and the local REC would then review it as suitable for local application. While this second review had an obvious time cost attached to it, its benefits for patients were repeatedly proven.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>I have been given numerous examples of errors and avoidable disasters identified by a local REC in research proposals that had previously been vetted and passed. If the new rules had been in operation, these avoidable errors would not have been identified. Only a few committees&#151;but 30 out of some 200&#151;are being allowed to look at research proposals, with the result that local RECs can only act as rubber stamps. If a research proposal has been agreed by a more remote committee elsewhere, there is no opportunity for a local committee to make a site-specific assessment of that proposal.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>Why are so many RECs being denied recognition? As far as I am aware, nobody has assessed them to be incompetent to do the job that they have been doing hitherto. We are looking at centralisation for its own sake. Nothing in the directive obliges us to adopt this kind of approach.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>It is an approach that has the potential not only to curtail and destabilise clinical trial work in this country, but on top of that to place patients at unnecessary risk. But when RECs have tried to put this point of view to COREC, their letters have either not been answered or been dismissed out of hand. That cannot be the way to carry on.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>I view these regulations with deep misgivings. In the words of one ethics committee that has written to me, they represent hasty, poorly consulted and poorly drafted legislation. By and large this is not the fault of the European directive. The fault lies at home.
</p>

<a name="40519-19_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>If they act quickly, Ministers can still put things right. But time is now of the essence. I beg to move.

<a name="40519-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I rise also to support the humble Address that the noble Earl, Lord   Howe, has put forward.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>We are all agreed that this is a deeply unsatisfactory means of incorporating an EU directive into UK law. We are having to pray against a set of regulations, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_850"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 850</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rather than having primary legislation with a Bill that we can amend as we go along and probe the Government&#039;s gold-plating of an EU directive in this way. We either have to swallow it whole or we have to spit it out whole.

</p>

<a name="40519-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>Unfortunately, I share the opinion of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that these regulations are extremely defective&#151;perhaps not on the original grounds put forward by many research institutions and even the pharmaceutical industry itself, but for many of the   reasons set out by the noble Earl. Some of the directive&#039;s defects result from the very little consultation done by the European Commission. Some of the saving grace of the situation is that the regulations may be amended in due course, as the Government themselves have admitted.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>In passing, I would commend some of the words used by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, when it invited the Government to explain to what extent and how the many concerns raised about the directive and these regulations have been met and whether any remain outstanding. But, of course, the initiative had to remain with the Opposition in ensuring that a Prayer was laid to have the debate. Again, that is deeply unsatisfactory.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>I thank the Minister for his very close personal interest in the discussion on these regulations, and for his updating correspondence as the regulations have been changed in response to many of the concerns. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, there have been concerns that the regulations could impinge on current practices and that, rather than achieve the goal of harmonising and simplifying the conduct of clinical trials in Europe, it would make them increasingly difficult to conduct and create a more risk-averse culture, in the words of Cancer Research UK.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>As is well known, we have a very high proportion of the worldwide spending on pharmaceutical research&#151;indeed, some 9 per cent&#151;and we have a higher proportion of publicly funded collaborative clinical trials than other European countries. So if these regulations are defective, the effects on the UK will undoubtedly be greater. We are a world leader and therefore our position could be at risk.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>We also have a situation where many clinical trials in the UK are undertaken by independent, non-commercial and non-profit institutions on the basis of educational or unrestricted research grants. Again, that position must be safeguarded in these regulations.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>It is very interesting to note that the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer has raised a number of issues concerning the way in which research is carried out as part of clinical trials which may be part of the ordinary course of treatment. It is very difficult to judge on the face of it whether its concerns are met by the amendments made to the regulations, but it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;In some instances . . .  the pharmaceutical industry may provide the drug(s) and help academic research usually because the drug(s) has a recent marketing authorisation. The industry may not be willing to do so in the future if this is perceived by competent authorities as some sort of sponsorship of the trial. So <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_851"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 851</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>in the worse case scenario (industry cannot provide the drug and marketed drugs cannot be used but in their registered indication/schedule) 61 per cent of all EORTC trials won&#039;t take place anymore&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>I know that there have been discussions, and the note put together by the Department of Health and the MRHA seems to negative that, I think at paragraph 6. However, it is precisely those detailed but extremely important areas that need to be teased out in the course of discussion today. There are a number of other aspects as well.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>There has been considerable discussion about the aspect of single sponsorship. There was concern that the EU directive required a single sponsor for research and that that was incompatible with the UK tradition of collaborative, multi-centre, publicly funded clinical trials where pharmaceutical companies may sponsor academic institutions through research grants or where academics may jointly administer a clinical trial within the NHS. It appears on the face of it that the regulations have been amended to ensure that that is not as rigid as it appears at first sight. It would be helpful if the Minister would give us assurances us that that situation has been cured.

</p>

<a name="40519-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Then again, a lot of concerns have been raised about the increased cost of running clinical trials and the fact that the regulations will increase those. If there are additional costs, they will not increase patient protection. That was certainly the assessment of Cancer Research UK of the MRHA partial regulatory impact assessment. Higher costs in turn will lead to fewer trials and fewer opportunities for research across the board. Generally, there is a belief that the new processes for monitoring, authorising and administering trials may well discourage researchers from undertaking clinical trails, simply as a result of the additional paperwork and the administration required. I believe that many of those concerns have been allayed but I would like to hear from the Minister in what respect he believes that that is the case.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised a number of points that seemed to me not to have been addressed adequately, which revolve around a number of very important areas. He made a powerful case in respect of the three areas he mentioned. On the question of the independence of research ethics committees, I shall not go through the entire argument that he made; it would be fruitless to do so when he has made it so well. However, the fact is that UKECA has the power effectively to control the RECs. UKECA has the power to set them up, as the noble Earl said, to abolish them, to make restrictions on their work and to appoint all their members. As has been pointed out, that does not seem to square with the EU clinical trials directive itself. If that is not gold-plating and if that is not the Government taking an opportunity to control RECs, I do not know what is.

</p>

<a name="40519-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>I believe that the Minister has given assurances that appointments to RECs will be made locally, but he has not explained quite how that is going to happen. As the Minister knows, I have raised a number of questions about the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees and its operation, particularly about its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_852"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 852</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

seeming inability to consult adequately over a very wide range of extremely important areas, particularly in terms   of standing operating procedures, training and accreditation. There is considerable concern about COREC&#039;s role. If COREC is effectively to supervise that local appointment, that will be of some considerable concern to research ethics committees. That relationship is not good; I hope the Minister is fully aware of that.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>There is a potential conflict of interest between COREC&#039;s role as an appointer or at least an approver of appointments and the fact that the head of COREC reports to the person with responsibility for oversight of research and development in the NHS. That does not seem a particularly apposite place for the head of COREC to report to. Those are considerable points.

</p>

<a name="40519-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned the important point about the out-of-date ethical guidelines. I hope that the flexibility indicated in the Minister&#039;s correspondence that there may be amendments to the regulations in due course will cure that problem. But the 1996 version of the Helsinki declaration is far less adequate than the 2000 version. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, gave a clear example.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>At the moment it would be possible for a pharmaceutical company to sponsor trials of a new drug in this country which it had no intention of marketing here. There would be no ability for the research ethics committee to turn down such a proposal for research in those circumstances because it would be permissible under the 1996 declaration, so there are considerable flaws in that situation. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made a strong case on the legal representatives for adults who lack capacity and children for whom no one has parental responsibility.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I recognise that the Government have made welcome changes to the regulations and that to some extent we are in an interim situation. I also recognise that in EU terms, in the words of the saying, we would not have started from here. But the Government must bear responsibility for the additions, changes and inconsistencies that they are responsible for drafting into the regulations. That is the fundamental area on which these Benches object to the regulations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40519-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I shall say a few words on the regulations as a result of my chairmanship of the Joint Select Committee on the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill. In our deliberations we gave a great deal of thought to the problem of research on people who lack the capacity to give consent to that research as a result of physical or mental impairment. I would like to say a few words about the relationship of those regulations to our considerations on the draft Mental Incapacity Bill.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>The main reference to the role of ethics committees seems to be in Regulation 15(5) and 15(7) on page 17. Regulation 15(5)(h) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;if the subjects are to include persons incapable of giving informed consent, whether the research is justified having regard to the conditions and principles specified in Part 5 of Schedule 1&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>I shall come back to that because it is a crucial part of the regulation. It also requires the ethics committee, if it does not have a member with professional expertise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_853"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 853</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the treatment of conditions where there is research on people with impairment, to add someone with that ability to the committee.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>The most important provisions are in parts 1 and 5   of Schedule 1. As we heard, part 1 defines a legal representative. I shall not say any more about that&#151;I shall leave the Minister to reply to the cogent points made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The crucial part of the regulations regarding people who lack capacity is on page 44 in part 5 of Schedule 1, &quot;Conditions and principles which apply in relation to an incapacitated adult&quot;. It sets out clearly the 11 conditions and four principles.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>I wish to draw particular attention to condition 9, which applies to an incapacitated adult who is to take part in research. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;There are grounds for expecting that administering the medicinal product to be tested in the trial will produce a benefit to the subject outweighing the risks or produce no risk at all&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>I presume that the subject is the person with incapacity who is taking part in the trial.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>That answers the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about the group with dementia having a flu drug or an antibiotic tested on them, because under condition 9 it has to produce a benefit for the person taking part in the trial. If that is the case, does that mean that clinical trials of medicines cannot be conducted to give benefit to a class of people with a clinical condition, for example, Alzheimer&#039;s? Must they be conducted only on people who lack capacity if   the clinical trial is of benefit to the individual incapacitated person who is taking part in the trial? As the measure is worded, presumably it will not be possible to give a placebo to an incapacitated person who is participating in a trial.
</p>

<a name="40519-20_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>I turn briefly to the Joint Select Committee report on the draft Mental Incapacity Bill. The committee flagged up the possible effects of European directives on medical research. Paragraph 285 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;Our attention has also been drawn to the European Clinical Trials Directive 2001 . . .  While this Directive is limited to trials of pharmaceutical products&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>which is what we are talking about&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;it is possible that future European Directives may extend to other forms of medical research and trials of innovative treatment. There is therefore an argument to include in the draft Bill&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>or the full Bill when it finally comes forward&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;requirements for the authorisation and supervision of research involving people without capacity to consent, in order to comply with the Clinical Trials Directive and any relevant future European Directives&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>That was the point that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, was making about primary legislation. I shall leave the Minister to deal with that.

</p>

<a name="40519-20_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>We in the committee were concerned about forbidding research on people without capacity where that research would not benefit them directly but would benefit others. I used the example of Alzheimer&#039;s disease in that regard. We were thinking here not of trials involving drugs but research on the results of blood samples, DNA samples and other comparatively harmless aspects of research that might be required to be carried out on someone with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_854"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 854</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a condition such as Alzheimer&#039;s disease. That research might not benefit the people who were giving the blood sample or whatever, but would perhaps be of benefit to the class of people as a whole. We said in paragraph 283:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;When a person lacks the capacity to give consent, they should only be involved with medical research, if it is either in their best interests&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-20_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>which I think is in the regulations where reference is made to it being of benefit to them directly&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;or if it is the only method of conducting research into their particular condition and everyone involved with the person is satisfied that this is a non-exploitative proposal which will not harm or distress the individual involved&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40519-21_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. That is a rather different point from the requirement in the Helsinki Declaration. That says that mentally incapacitated patients should not be included in research at all unless the research is necessary to promote their own health, and you cannot do the research on any mentally competent adult. So there is, as it were, a double condition on it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="40519-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I was just about to come to that point. I shall deal with that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>So far as I can see the regulations seem to move away from the approach I have just described by requiring that the clinical trial of a medicine can be of benefit to the individual with incapacity only if he or she is included in the trial. That tightens up the controls as compared to what we were saying in our report. I can understand that where trials of medicines are concerned but I am not sure that it is applicable in the case of blood or DNA samples.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>To conclude, we on the Select Committee were concerned to set out the key principles that should be observed when considering research on those lacking the capacity to consent to the research. That is the point that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has just made. We set out at paragraph 289 what we thought were the key principles enshrined by the World Medical Association. They should include the following:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;research involving people who may be incapacitated must be reviewed by a properly established and independent ethics committee and can only proceed if ethical permission is granted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>That is in the regulations. The paragraph continues,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;where a person has the capacity to consent then his decision whether or not to partake in research must be respected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>That is in the regulations.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>Paragraph 289 continues,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;considerable care should be taken to ensure that under these circumstances consent to participate was freely given and not a consequence of coercion. The inclusion of people in research, who lacked the capacity to consent, must only occur when such research has the potential for direct benefit to those with that particular problem and could not have been done through the involvement of those with capacity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>I think that answers the point that the noble Earl, Lord   Howe, has just made.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;those undertaking research involving people lacking the capacity to consent must respect any indications that a person did not wish to participate (i.e. was dissenting)&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>I believe that is in the regulations&#151;


</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>We then go on to state in some detail what should be in the codes of practice to accompany the Mental Incapacity Bill.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>As far as I can see, the regulations are in line with the recommendations that we made, with the exception, as I have said, of the provision that research has to be for the direct benefit of the person without capacity who was taking part in the clinical trial of drugs, as a result of decisions that are taken by others on his behalf. I think that I can understand the reasoning regarding drug trials, but in the wider area of research it would have to be considered for the benefit of a whole class of people, not just for individuals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40519-21_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, I have read carefully the wordy statutory instrument right through, and it gives me cause for severe concern about the principle that it establishes.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>However disappointing this may be to scientists whose primary, and certainly not ignoble, aim is to discover cures for sick people, it can never be right in any circumstances to use mentally handicapped people as experimental material without their consent. Most cannot give it anyway, but that is no excuse. Hitler did that and the world rightly condemned him. It appals me that we now propose to emulate him.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>There are pages and pages of S.I. 1031 devoted to the   ethical committees, the strict regulations, the investigators, the licensing authorities and the official guidelines, but the bottom line is that mentally handicapped people are to be used for research and experimentation without their agreement. Nothing in the so-called &quot;safeguards&quot; alters that.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>Yet, the statutory instrument acknowledges that the experiments that it permits might well be sufficiently dangerous to the human guinea pig as to cause death. The document actually says that. On page 27, it specifies what should happen,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;when death of the subject results&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>which brings me to another point. On page 4 the statutory instrument calls the person undergoing such research a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;human subject&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>Well, that rather gives the game away. Once one starts referring to human beings as &quot;human subjects&quot;, it is clear that one regards them as sub-standard objects. We really cannot agree to that.

</p>

<a name="40519-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Some people are concerned that the regulations for legal interpretation are flawed because they are so wide and institute a major change in the law. My noble friend Lord Howe dealt brilliantly with that point, which I know is causing considerable concern outside this House. Other people are prepared to agree with the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_856"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 856</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proposals as long as such research can only be allowed if it will benefit the person who is actually enduring the experiment. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, drew our attention to Part 5, paragraph 9, on page 44, and said that the point may be covered by that part of the statutory instrument. That is disputed outside and we must be clear that, so far, it has not managed to ease the   concern that has been expressed.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>I have to admit that, even if there was action both on that point and the legal point, I would still have objections to the statutory instrument, because I have much bitter personal experience of how promises in this place are broken to achieve objectives. When we were debating the Abortion Bill in 1967&#151;and I remember it vividly, because it was the first major Bill in which I was involved&#151;it got through Parliament because certain firm promises were made.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>&quot;There will never be abortion on demand if we pass this Bill,&quot; they said. &quot;Never. What an extraordinary suggestion!&quot; And yet everybody knows we certainly have abortion on demand today. &quot;The number of abortions will not rise at all,&quot; they said. &quot;They will just happen in nice, clean hospitals instead of on nasty, dirty kitchen tables. It will be perfectly alright and the numbers will not rise.&quot; Will not rise? I understand now that we have so far got rid of 6 million babies. Nobody suggests we ever did that prior to the Abortion Bill.

</p>

<a name="40519-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>There was another argument, and I put forward a particular amendment about this point. &quot;Using aborted babies for experimentation,&quot; they said, &quot;will never be allowed. Never.&quot; Well, everybody knows that it happens all the time today, in spite of that promise.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>I remember, too, that they said &quot;Why do you worry the House in this way? Of course abortion will not be carried out for minor medical deficiencies in the child.&quot; Remember the case of the child recently aborted because he had a cleft palate? That is not the first case. Members opposite may frown, but I am only telling the truth. These things were told to us when we were debating that Bill and, because of the promises made, the Bill was passed. Every single promise has been broken. This experience teaches me that, however well intentioned, such promises, I am afraid, are made to be broken.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>We should not be muddled about what we mean by &quot;research&quot;. If an Alzheimer&#039;s sufferer has been given all available medicines for that condition and is still no better, and then another medicine comes on to the market, it cannot be called research to offer that medicine to him or her, suggesting that the new tablet might help. That is not research. That is trying a new tablet, and maybe it will help. But it was research when a group went to Porton Down, having volunteered to be tested in an endeavour to find a cure for the common cold, and were subsequently given sarin.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>It is incorrect to claim that scientists will be able to do research only if we permit these changes. Only last week, doctors at the Brain Research Institute at the University of California announced that they had made a significant breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer&#039;s, achieved without any of the changes now   before us. It was an extremely important and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_857"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 857</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interesting development of the knowledge of what happens to the brain in Alzheimer&#039;s, so it is not the case that only these researches are going to help.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>I invite the Minister to alter slightly the reply he gave to me on 5 May. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;Those conducting trials must obtain informed consent from all participants&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/5/04; col. 1097]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>Would that it were so. If this were the case, your Lordships would be blessed by my silence. It is the crux of my case that the statutory instrument says exactly the opposite.
</p>

<a name="40519-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>Finally, I found it rather sneaky to introduce this statutory instrument&#151;initially, as my noble friend Earl Howe has said, clearly part of the draft Mental Incapacity Bill&#151;on the very day the House rose for the Easter Recess. If the Government hoped that that subterfuge would mean it would not be noticed in the plethora of bonnets, eggs and 10 days off, they were wrong. But it so easily could have slipped through because of the way it was introduced. I was informed in an Answer to a Written Question that this happened because there was a directive from our masters, the EU. Well, in my eyes, that does not improve it.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40519-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Turnberg: </b>   My Lords, I want to speak briefly in favour of the regulations as they stand. First, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised some important questions about mentally incapacitated patients and ethics committees. I do not want to enter too far into the debate about mentally incapacitated patients. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, dealt with them at least in part and I shall read his comments with interest. I shall also be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>However, I must point out that if research on mentally incapacitated patients were not done, we would never develop new treatments for Alzheimer&#039;s disease or other mental illnesses. It is therefore essential that we undertake research on them in one form or another. If they cannot give consent, we have a catch-22 situation; they cannot give consent, yet research is essential if we are to treat them. For reasons other than wanting to find a treatment for mentally incapacitated patients, no one in his right mind would want to undertake research on patients who could not give their consent. It is done on patients who are able to give consent. Indeed, giving a cancer therapy or nasty treatment to mentally incapacitated patients without their consent would never get past first base with any ethics committee. Therefore, one would want to undertake only research for those particular patients and I am not sure that the background to the points raised by the noble Earl is correct.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>With regard to the ethics committees, we have a problem with multi-centre trials, which is why there has been an attempt at rationalising the situation. It is that research or a set of researches goes to a multi-centre research ethics committee and then to a whole series&#151;perhaps 20, 30 or 40&#151;of research ethics committees at the local level. That means that it can take, and has taken, up to two years before a trial can begin. That delay is of course unconscionable and it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_858"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 858</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the reason why there has been an attempt to rationalise the process so that there is a limited number of ethics committees. How many ethics committees do we really need to undertake ethical review? I am not therefore entirely in tune with what the noble Earl has suggested.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>I believe that the regulations do a reasonable job of achieving the two major aims; maintaining the safety of patients engaged in clinical trials, which is paramount, while ensuring that good, valid clinical research can be pursued without unnecessary&#151;unnecessary&#151;hindrance.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>These regulations are infinitely better than what was once threatened in the draft directive which emanated from the European Commission. I want to place on record my unbound gratitude to my noble friend the Minister and his officials for the enormous amount of work he did in heading off the Commission. He did so by drawing its attention to the potential damage to its proposals for research.

</p>

<a name="40519-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>There are several links in the chain which binds researchers and which ensure that clinical trials are conducted safely and ethically. First, those who fund non-commercial research, largely the Medical Research Council and the medical research charities&#151;here I must   express and interest as scientific adviser to the Association of Medical Research Charities&#151;put proposals for grants through a rigorous appraisal using independent referees. That involves an assessment of whether the research is reasonable and can be expected to produce reasonable results that are favourable to patients, and so on. Then, of course, all proposals must be subjected to close examination by research ethics committees. That is not a trivial process, especially for   multi-centred trials. Then a sponsor must take responsibility for monitoring the research to ensure that it is being done safely and responsibly. Of course, the employers&#151;the universities and the NHS&#151;have a legal responsibility for the behaviour of their employees. They, too, have codes of good practice for this purpose.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>All those safeguards already exist in one form or another. The regulations now bring them together in a legal framework with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#151;the MHRA. It will obviously be important that the MHRA consults widely with the research and other communities and that it does not wield a heavy axe. I am reasonably confident that it will behave appropriately.

</p>

<a name="40519-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>I believe that the regulations are a reasonable and rational set of proposals. It seems that, within the research community at large&#151;although not everyone is ecstatic about everything; they never are&#151;the vast majority are heaving a collective sigh of relief that what we now have is acceptable and infinitely preferable to what we might have had in the Commission&#039;s original proposals. That, too, is the view of the medical research charities, which have the patient&#039;s view right at their heart. They are, after all, set up by, and are entirely dependent on the support of, the patients, and they, too, are keen to see these regulations in place.

<a name="40519-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am glad to have this opportunity to explain the Government&#039;s position on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_859"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 859</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

these regulations, which transpose the Clinical Trials Directive into UK law. The regulations came into force on 1 May 2004. I have to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, that I do not believe we were trying to slip anything through by subterfuge. The material in these regulations has been around for an extremely long time and has been much debated. I shall try briefly to take people through some of the history.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>The Government support the aims of the directive. They are: to protect the safety, rights and integrity of trial participants; to ensure that the results of trials are reliable; and to facilitate the development of new medicines within the European Community. Listening to some parts of the debate, it would be easy to forget those objectives.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>We successfully negotiated a model for regulation similar to that already in place in the UK, and we resisted attempts in Brussels to introduce unnecessary bureaucracy and an overly prescriptive approach to regulation. I am particularly grateful to my noble friend Lord Turnberg for his kind remarks about the work that the Department of Health carried out in this area.

</p>

<a name="40519-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I believe that the regulations achieve a proper balance. They safeguard the rights of clinical trial participants and minimise the regulatory impact on those who carry them out. We have asked the Pharmaceutical Industry Competitiveness Task Force, the Biosciences Leadership Council, the Department of Health and the MRC to monitor the impact of the directive on different sectors. We have a good Department of Health and MRC joint working party, which involves a wide range of research interests, and we shall look to that to continue to help us in this area.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>We shall continue to work with all the sectors to keep issues under review. I can assure noble Lords that my door is always open if people want to bring to our attention their concerns. However, we must give the regulations a chance to work. We need to let them bed down and not become too excited about all the terrible things which people think may happen. We must see them working in practice, and we believe that they will be a good set of regulations.

</p>

<a name="40519-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>Clinical trials make an important contribution to public health. They are the scientific basis for the use of new medicines and for new ways of administering existing medicines. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred&#151;I thought, slightly excitedly&#151;to the number of clinical trials that are fleeing from this country. The evidence suggests that the number of clinical trials conducted in the UK has not decreased. It is true that the number of clinical trials worldwide has increased and to some extent it is inevitable that the UK percentage in that larger volume of clinical trials may have reduced. The Pharmaceutical Industry Competitiveness Task Force (PICTF), which I mentioned earlier, is monitoring the number of trials and the reasons why companies may use other countries as well as the UK. The reasons are multi-faceted.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_860"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 860</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>The clinical trials also contribute considerably to our economic wealth. The UK pharmaceutical industry produced a positive trade balance of &#163;2.6 billion in 2002 and the industry spent &#163;3 billion on clinical trials in the UK in 2001 alone. So there are some very substantial economic factors involved in this as well as benefits to patients.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>The regulations mainly reinforce current clinical trial practice in the UK. The major changes are that studies in healthy volunteers require an authorisation from the MHRA; investigational medicinal products must be manufactured to good manufacturing practice standards and the manufacturer must have a manufacturing licence; and each trial must have a sponsor who takes responsibility for it. The regulations allow a group to share those responsibilities. The regulations place our ethics committee system&#151;I shall refer to ethics committees again later&#151;on a statutory basis for the first time. It is easy to overlook that in view of some of the remarks made this evening.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>By clarifying the law we expect to create confidence in the public mind about the value of clinical trials and the safety of participating in them. This is essential if we are to see more and more patients in this country benefiting from clinical trials. The regulations provide a framework within which ethics committees can make independent decisions. They help to ensure that all UK trials of medicines provide reliable results and minimise risks by requiring that the principles of good clinical practice are followed. They protect participants from poor quality or badly prepared medicines by requiring the manufacture of investigational medicinal products to international standards of good manufacturing practice. They provide   for inspections by the MHRA to ensure that the   principles of good clinical practice and good manufacturing practice are being followed, which will improve the overall quality of UK clinical trials and help to identify misconduct. If misconduct persists or there is fraudulent conduct, the regulations provide powers of enforcement on a proper statutory basis.
</p>

<a name="40519-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>Turning to the protection of incapacitated adults, I thought that the noble Earl was unnecessarily pessimistic and I certainly side more with my noble friend Lord Turnberg on his interpretation of what the regulations do to protect incapacitated adults. In my view, they protect adults incapable of giving informed consent effectively; for example, those with severe Alzheimer&#039;s disease should be able to benefit from the research but in a protected way. The regulations do not permit experiments on incapacitated people without proper consent. I object to the comparison of the regulations to the activities of Hitler. I thought that was a little excitable. The noble Baroness alluded to the arrangements in the regulations being on a par with, and not far distant from, those activities. If she would like to clarify her position, I shall be glad to hear her.

<a name="40519-23_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. I said&#151;I stress this time and again&#151;that I was worried about the principle. The principle is that mentally handicapped people can be used for experimentation without their consent. That <br>&nbsp;<br>

was the line that I was following. That was exactly what was done in Nazi Germany. That is the point I was making.
<a name="time_30"></a>
<a name="40519-23_time0"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40519-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, if that is not linking the regulations to what was done in Nazi Germany, I do not know what is.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>The regulations restrict clinical trials on incapacitated adults to life-threatening or debilitating conditions from which the subject suffers. That is referred to in Schedule 1, Part 5, paragraph 11. I believe that that means that the kind of chest condition that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned would not be covered in these circumstances. The decision whether to consent to, or refuse, participation in a trial will be taken by a &quot;legal representative&quot; who is independent of the research team and can represent that person&#039;s presumed wishes. But they do not prevent incapacitated people participating in trials with the proviso that they can benefit or suffer no harm. I believe that my noble friend Lord Turnberg made the point very well about Catch-22 situations. I do not believe that we want to prevent incapacitated people securing the benefits from participating in clinical trials.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>These regulations provide a cascade system for seeking informed consent, first from a person whose relationship to the person makes them suitable to act as their legal representative; then from the doctor primarily responsible for the person&#039;s treatment and finally from a person nominated by the relevant healthcare provider. In the last situation a health service body can be expected to have a list of suitable nominated persons. In Scotland, except in cases of emergency treatment, the legal representative will be the person who is able to consent to treatment under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of why we proceeded in advance of the Mental Incapacity Bill. We had no option but to include arrangements for incapacitated adults because the directive specifically required the implementation by member states by 1 May 2004. I know that the wording of the directive is being considered very carefully with the draft Mental Incapacity Bill.

</p>

<a name="40519-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>To respond to other points, the directive makes clear that incapacitated adults can participate in trials. There must be grounds for expecting that administering the product will benefit the patient, as my noble friend Lord   Carter suggested. There may be grounds for so expecting if there are good reasons for expecting that the treatment may benefit the class of patients to which he or she belongs. That enables patients to participate on that basis.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>A number of noble Lords raised the subject of the Helsinki Declaration 2000. There were wide-ranging discussions during the development of the directive on the reference to the declaration. The member states agreed that the directive should not be included in the articles of the direction, but only in the recitals. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_862"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 862</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was because the declaration would prevent placebo control trials, which would be disadvantageous to patients in our view.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>A number of noble Lords raised the subject of minors. The regulations also provide additional protection for a minor where that person is under 16   years of age. We expect more children to be asked to participate in clinical trials as part of an international initiative to provide medicines suitable for children that are fully licensed. We do need clear rules in this area.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>A number of noble Lords raised concerns about the implications of the regulations for the work of ethics committees. I say to some noble Lords that it is simply fantasy that UK Ministers are going to control appointments to research ethics committees. We do not have that system now. We have had to put UKECA in place because under the directive there has to be a UK body to oversee the establishment, recognition and monitoring of ethics committees. There is no statutory body at the moment in that area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40519-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, does not the directive specify an independent body? On what basis does UKECA qualify as such?
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="40519-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Well, my Lords, UKECA is there to ensure that an activity is now being conducted, as in the past, through COREC to ensure that that work takes place. But COREC is not a statutory body; it operates under a contract between it and the Department of Health and the NHS research and development department. That is a long-established arrangement and involves a non-statutory body. Therefore, to provide proper accountability, we have established UKECA to ensure that there is a process to appoint a body to undertake that task. I would say that COREC is independent and that UKECA is not involved in the appointment of ethics committees.

</p>

<a name="40519-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>Perhaps I may continue with my line of argument. We had to have a body established under the regulations. As I said, COREC has existed for some time and does pretty well the same job that it has been doing for some time. As my noble friend Lord Turnberg said, there has been a need to consider how some ethics committees were working. There has been a need to group some of those activities in a particular way.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>Of course, sometimes when there is change in such areas, not everyone who is affected by the change sees things the way that COREC sees them. So concerns have been expressed in some quarters about how COREC has been operating. But it operates under contract; we monitor its work closely; and we take account of concerns that are expressed. The arrangements are in place for recognising phase 1 ethics committees. COREC is in urgent discussion with those committees to ensure that they can continue to operate under the regulations. We will be examining the workings of COREC as it undertakes the new work following from the regulations. But if there are concerns, we will of course listen carefully to them, as we have been doing so far.

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="40519-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. Why cannot we have a statutory body that does not involve politicians? We have a number of such statutory bodies, such as the GMC. Why cannot we have something like that? Does the Minister not realise that people will be suspicious?
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="40519-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I recognise that people may be suspicious, but we need to have a UK-wide body, which is why we have brought together the health Ministers in UKECA. However, after the debate I will certainly consider what noble Lords have said. That issue has not caused concern so far and I do not believe that people think that UKECA will go round making appointments to local ethics committees. If there are concerns about perception, we will consider them, but we need a statutory body under the terms of the regulations that is UK-wide.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>Investigators and trial sponsors together must record and report serious unexpected adverse reactions to trial medicines under the regulations. MHRA assessors will look for signals indicating individuals who are at risk and consider whether the trial should be modified or stopped. Safety data from trials in each of the 25 member states will be entered into a European pharmacovigilance database that will track safety in clinical trials in its population of more than 400 million people. That provides a new, important safeguard for people in the UK. That is a powerful engine for picking up adverse reactions and concerns about drugs available in the European Union.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>I turn to some concerns that had been expressed here and by the statutory instruments merits committee about the good clinical practice directive. I thank the merits committee for drawing the House&#039;s attention to its concerns about that directive. In particular, it asks   when it is likely to be available and what will be the likely effect of such a directive concerning the regulations.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>We delayed transposition of the directive into UK law for two main reasons; namely, the European Commission&#039;s delay in finalising two Commission directives and our need to consider the impact on academic research, to which a number of noble Lords have alluded.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>While the Commission has published a directive on good manufacturing practice, which is acceptable to the UK, it has not yet adopted its directive on good clinical practice. There is no indication when it will circulate a revised draft. The draft directive would have put not just the principles of good clinical practice into operation, but would also have put detailed guidance into binding legislation. That approach was unacceptable to us, and we said so&#151;so did other countries, I am pleased to say. The delay has resulted therefore from the UK&#039;s and others&#039; expressions of concerns.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_864"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 864</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>In the absence of an agreed Commission directive, I had to decide that the most sensible approach was, as in other countries, to include in the UK regulations the principles of GCP adopted by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), which were agreed as the standard for Europe in July 1996.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>Currently, the pharmaceutical industry follows those ICH principles and academic researchers follow the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines based on the same principles. Effectively, we are changing nothing from the present arrangements in the UK.

</p>

<a name="40519-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>However, the Merits Committee recognised that there is a risk that the Commission will seek to issue a final GCP directive that does not include the principles of GCP as we have stated them. We shall just have to wait and see what happens, but we will continue to make our position clear on this issue to the Commission. I have nothing further to report on smoke signals coming out of Brussels on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>In February, I wrote to Members of this House and the other place to explain how I was taking the matter forward and my reasons for doing so. I have also had constructive meetings with Members of both Houses who have specific interests in clinical research, as well as with representatives from a large number of medical research charities, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and the BioIndustry Association. Each of those stakeholders has helped us in that area of activity.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>We also delayed introducing the regulations to be able to respond fully to the concerns of the academic research community. As part of that process, either I or my predecessor met senior representatives of the universities, the Royal Colleges, the medical charities, the MRC, the British Nursing Association and other groups with particular interests in clinical research. The MRC prepared a helpful report which identified the major areas of concern. I shall not go into detail, but that is when we set up the joint project between the Department of Health, the MRC and other interests in order to tackle some of those issues.

</p>

<a name="40519-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>I am also glad to say that along the way we have had discussions with Universities UK, which has just issued a joint statement with the Department of Health that is on the department&#039;s website. It recognises that the regulations do not change the underlying allocation of responsibilities in the partnership between universities and the NHS. That was an area about which there was some concern and misunderstanding.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>The MHRA has run a consultation and communications programme since the first draft of the   directive in 1997. It has hosted conferences and workshops to disseminate information; distributed the formal consultation on the draft implementing regulations to more than 3,000 organisations; and it is using its website and that of the DH/MRC project to ensure that stakeholders learn of the different developments. We have put a great deal of effort in trying to explain these changes and to take people on board and understand what the new regulations are about. Given this range of consultation, it is inevitable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_865"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 865</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that we have not made everyone content. I suspect that one or two of the people who have been less satisfied may have come to the attention of some noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>In conclusion, I believe that we have made every effort to respond to the concerns of stakeholders. The approach that we have taken demonstrates the commitment of the Government to clinical research, which was demonstrated again today with the opening of the UK cell bank in Hertfordshire. We want a robust regulatory framework that will strengthen the UK&#039;s reputation for clinical trials. I am grateful for the help and support that we have had from a wide range of stakeholders. Perhaps I may be permitted to draw Members&#039; attention to the supportive press notice put out by Cancer Research UK when the regulations were published.
</p>

<a name="40519-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>Ultimately, protection of individuals in clinical trials must be our priority. I recognise the concerns in this area that were expressed by a number of noble Lords, but I consider that the regulations strike the right balance between protecting public health and enabling high-quality trials in the UK. We shall look carefully at the points made by noble Lords and if there is any further reassurance I can give after reading <i>Hansard</i>, I shall do so, but the Government beg to oppose the Motion.

<a name="40519-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene before the noble Lord sits down. To my certain knowledge, he has never been impolite in any way and I know that he would never wish to mislead the House. Can I not ask him again to reconsider his Answer to me on 5 May? He said:


</p>
<ul>

I am sure that the noble Lord would wish to make that clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40519-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I shall certainly go away and look at that Answer. As the noble Baroness says, it is never my intention&#151;quite the reverse&#151;to mislead Members of this House, or anybody else for that matter. My recollection of my Answer is that it interpreted the regulations in the form in which the legal representatives were operating them, whereby consent would be given where an incapacitated person is involved. However, I shall look carefully again at the Question of the noble Baroness and my Answer. If I have misled the noble Baroness, I shall certainly correct the matter.

<a name="column_866"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column 866</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disappointing. I do not intend to call a Division on my   Prayer to annul, because there is a convention in the House that we do not do so and because the   consequences of overturning a measure that implements an EU directive would be extremely problematic. However, if those constraints did not exist, I would seriously have considered asking the House for its opinion on the two or three serious issues that I attempted to raise. As it is, we may have to follow up some of those outstanding issues in writing.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>I noted what the Minister said about UKECA and the appointment of members of ethics committees. Regulation 7, read in conjunction with Schedule 2, makes it quite clear that UKECA is the body that appoints the members of NHS ethics committees. The Minister said that that will not happen in practice. If the intention is to make all appointments locally, why vest the power of appointment in Ministers? There is absolutely no need to do that. Indeed, one can have a statutory body to supervise research ethics committees, but as my noble friend Lord McColl said, it does not have to consist of Ministers. The HFEA is a good example of such a body to add to the one given by my noble friend. It is at arm&#039;s length from Ministers, but it is nevertheless statutory.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>Apart from that, I repeat that UKECA has the power not to recognise any committee of which it does not approve for any reason and to set up a committee in its place. In practical terms, that is a strong power. Why give Ministers those powers when the directive does not require it?
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>Turning briefly to the issue of incapacitated adults, I listened carefully to what the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Turnberg, had to say, and I am grateful to both of them. The problem, from my perspective, lies with the concept of the legal representatives. In her very powerful way, my noble friend Lady Knight voiced some worries about how these regulations might, in practice, be implemented, and I hope that the Minister will take those concerns on board.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>What troubles me is that the regulations embody a major change in the law. To my mind, the key point is that anyone taking a decision on behalf of an incapacitated adult to enter that adult into a clinical trial should be both independent and capable of weighing up the risks and benefits for the patient in an informed and dispassionate way. The whole concept of &quot;legal representative&quot;, as set out in the regulations, seems to be fraught with difficulties. If you want to find the right sort of person to act as a legal representative&#151;someone capable of ensuring that taking part in a trial is or is not in a patient&#039;s best interests&#151;you need an independent third party. You should not look to a doctor or the staff of a hospital trust to act in that role. The responsibility should surely be in the hands of a lay person, possibly under the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection. Apart from anything else, I question whether doctors should be burdened with onerous decision-making of this kind. I say again that these are not matters that are appropriate to regulations.

</p>

<a name="40519-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Clause 21 [<i>Fire and Rescue National Framework</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40519-24_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   moved Amendment No. 69:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 11, line 2, leave out from &quot;manner&quot; to &quot;best&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 69 is short and simple: it seeks to make much more objective the obligation of the Secretary of State under subsection (4) to discharge his functions under subsection (1). It would require that the functions be discharged in the manner best calculated to promote public safety and the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the fire and rescue authorities&#151;a theme which is common throughout the Bill&#151;and matters in connection with which they have functions, rather than requiring that the functions be discharged,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;in the manner and to the extent that appear to him&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>the Secretary of State&#151;to be best calculated to promote these objectives. It is not unreasonable to seek to introduce a semi-objective test of how the functions of preparing and publishing the national framework are discharged.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>At the moment, the Secretary of State could reasonably argue that the wording is so loose that there is no objective hurdle for him to meet. We can see no reason not to introduce an objective test that would make the Secretary of State&#039;s draft of the Fire and Rescue National Framework subject to potential challenge if it did not focus on public safety and economy, efficiency and effectiveness. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40519-24_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </b>  As the noble Baroness said, it is quite a short amendment. I shall respond to it but, as we are coming to a group of amendments on the national framework, if I take a little longer to respond to it&#151;I can deal with the narrow amendment quite quickly&#151;and put some flesh on the national framework, I shall not have to repeat myself on other amendments. That may be helpful in enabling us to make progress.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Amendment No. 69 seeks to remove the provision for the Secretary of State to decide what is best calculated to promote public safety and the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the fire and rescue authorities. It may be that the amendment is designed to hold up the Secretary of State&#039;s decisions to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC336"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC336</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scrutiny, on the one hand, but, in reality, we think it will lead to confusion. There is a degree of subjectivity, for example, about what is the best way to promote the efficiency of the service.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The amendment does not specify who would decide what is best calculated to promote public safety and the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the fire and rescue authorities or, indeed, how it would be decided. Therefore we think it would be an unhelpful and unnecessary ambiguity and lead to the possibility of challenge. None of this will do anything to improve the service delivered to the public, which is the ultimate aim of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Perhaps I may say a few words in passing about the legal status of the national framework and tie that issue in with this and other amendments. The legal status of the national framework is as guidance to which the fire and rescue authorities should have regard in carrying out their functions. As such it does not impose mandatory requirements such as may be imposed by primary or secondary legislation. In order to provide strategic direction for the fire and rescue service, the national framework sets out priorities and objectives for the authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>We have said that the authorities should consider the majority of these in carrying out their functions. However, how these priorities and objectives are delivered locally will be a matter for the authorities themselves to decide. It is critical that we should strike the right balance between providing strategic central government direction and local decision making by authorities. We think that we have the balance right. For example, we have said that fire and rescue authorities should have in place and maintain an integrated risk management programme, but also that it should be based on local need and effectively address existing and potential risks to communities.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>We have said that&#151;working with partners where appropriate&#151;fire and rescue authorities should develop a planned programme of community fire safety work, but also that they should respond to the needs and risks identified in their communities as part of the integrated risk management programme approach. At a regional level we have said that authorities, through regional management boards, should draw up a regional human resources strategy but that the strategy should identify and implement the most efficient and effective means for that region to deliver these services.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Some parts of the framework set out certain specific measures that are central to the delivery of an efficient and effective service. They indicate the importance we attach to adopting a particular approach in order to achieve the desired outcome. That is indicated by the use of the word &quot;must&quot;. This will affect the weight that   authorities will have to give those parts of the framework, but does not alter the fact that the framework in itself is guidance. However, the use of the word &quot;must&quot; also indicates that if the fire and rescue authority does not act in accordance with that part of the framework, it may trigger use of the intervention powers under Clause 22 to ensure that it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC337"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC337</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

does so. I should like to remind noble Lords that any use of the intervention powers under Clause 22 will be in accordance with the agreed local government intervention protocol and will require an order which would be laid before Parliament.

</p>

<a name="40519-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>For example, the draft framework states that fire and rescue authorities must establish regional management boards to plan for six key areas at the regional level:   common and specialist services; resilience; human resource functions; training; control rooms; and procurement. For reasons of public safety it is critical that, for example, we move to regional control rooms and ensure the roll-out of an integrated fire link. All fire and rescue authorities must play their part in that.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>However, in other areas we have made it clear that while no individual authority can simply opt out, how the functions are delivered will be decided regionally. For example, fire and rescue authorities, through regional management boards, should ensure that efficient and effective regional procurement arrangements are in place.
</p>

<a name="40519-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I hope that that brief background that I have set out as an additional response to the amendment will reassure noble Lords that the national framework provides strategic leadership, not national prescription, and that local and regional decision making and accountability remain paramount. I hope too that these remarks will be   useful to our brief debates on the forthcoming amendments, and that the noble Baroness will not press Amendment No. 69.

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   On reading the draft framework, I realise that much of it deals with actions and decisions that will have to be taken by the Secretary of State. What is done by the fire and rescue authorities will be dependent on what is done by the Secretary of State. The Minister has been helpful, and we shall come in due course to the sanctions on local fire and rescue authorities if they fail to do what, given the framework, one might expect. However, what sanctions are there if the Secretary of State does not do his bit? It is difficult to distinguish between what are commitments and what are aspirations. Can the Minister say whether it will be for Parliament to scrutinise the actions of the Secretary of State? How does this fit together?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   With respect, I do not want to jump the gun here. It would be better to deal with those issues as we work through the amendments. I made my preliminary statement only to provide a bit of extra information.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I have a couple of paragraphs of briefing with which to respond to this amendment, but they would have been even briefer than the speech of the noble Baroness. However, we thought it would be useful to put the statement on the record. I shall be happy to respond to the noble Baroness as we work our way through the amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   What the Minister has said is helpful because it tells us how the Government see the <br>&nbsp;<br>

clause. However, I did not quite follow him when he said that he wanted to reject the amendment. I think that the amendment would merely clean up the English. If you take out the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;and to the extent that appear to him to be&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>so far as I am concerned it would mean exactly the same, but the phrase is shorter. Why are we straining at this gnat?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Precisely for the reasons that I gave in response. Accepting the amendment would lead to confusion. There is a degree of subjectivity about the best way to promote efficiency. The amendment does not specify who would decide what is best calculated to promote public safety, or how that would be decided. Therefore, that would be unhelpful and unnecessary and introduce ambiguity and the possibility of challenge. Those are the reasons that I gave on the narrow points of the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. The noble Lord has really picked up the point. The clause can be read as saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State must discharge his functions under subsection (1) . . .  in the manner . . .  best calculated to promote&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>&quot;Best calculated&quot; is the best bit, and that is still what the Secretary of State is required to do. The words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;in the manner and to the extent that appear to him&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>begin to be an objective test of whether he does or what he does. I was just trying to clarify that aspect to make it clearer that that is what is meant to be happening. I hear what the Minister has to say, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   moved Amendment No. 70:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>Page 11, line 4, at beginning insert &quot;firstly,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 70, I will speak to Amendments Nos. 71 and 72. These begin to attempt to alter Clause 21 (4) to create a clear hierarchy of objectives that the Secretary of State must follow in discharging his functions under subsection (1), which requires that he must prepare a Fire and Rescue National Framework. At the moment, subsection (4) lists three objectives that the Secretary of State must pursue in discharging that duty under subsection (1). Amendment No. 70 would make it explicit that public safety is the first consideration, and that economy, efficiency and effectiveness are the second considerations to be promoted to the extent that it is not at the expense of public safety.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>While I am sure that the Minister will agree that public safety must be the number one consideration, there will be occasions where there are conflicts between economy and efficiency, on the one hand, and optimising public safety, on the other. In order to avoid the problems inherent in such conflicts, it is important that there is a clear hierarchy of priorities with public safety as the most important. The amendments would resolve potential conflicts between <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC339"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC339</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

objectives and make it clear in the Bill which is the priority in the event of conflict. That is public safety. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40519-25_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I note what the noble Baroness said, and she is explicit about what she wants to do about paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in subsection (4). The amendments are unnecessary&#151;I will state the obvious now&#151;and they remove the flexibility for the Secretary of State to respond effectively to a wide range of circumstances when deciding, for example, on the priorities and objectives of the fire and rescue service. We have always said, and this should be put on the record again, that we would never do anything to prejudice public safety. I assure noble Lords that the national framework will reflect that.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Similarly, we have always stated that public safety will usually be our principal motivation in intervening with fire and rescue authorities. I give that assurance once again. The amendment therefore addresses a problem that does not exist, because it would undesirable, since a vital part of having an effective fire and rescue service includes being able to weigh up the efficiency of a variety of their functions, not simply those linked to public safety. This is integral to the purpose of providing strategic leadership for the service through the national framework.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The clause as drafted will give sufficient flexibility to the Secretary of State to allow him to decide how to discharge his functions under subsections (1) and (3) in a manner that will ensure that the fire and rescue authorities provide an economic, efficient and effective fire service that promotes public safety and saves lives. The amendments would be too restrictive and take too narrow a view of what is in the interests of the public, both in terms of safety and generally.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>For example, an authority might allocate a disproportionate amount of public money to cater for risks that are either inconsequential or are adequately covered by other arrangements. Taken in isolation, such steps could be seen as furthering public safety, but in practice, they would mean that other, more deserving areas of the authority&#039;s functions were neglected to the detriment of public safety, or that the local taxpayer was asked to foot an excessive bill. In other words, the amendment would not always allow the Secretary of State to take a balanced view of the public interest. Nothing in that explanation is intended to undermine the point that I made that public safety will usually be our principal motivation in intervening with fire and rescue authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I shall give an extreme example, but it is fairly specific. A fire and rescue authority could consider that, in the interests of public safety, it wished to place a fire station at the end of every road. That certainly could not be considered to be in the broader interests of the public, who would have to provide the money to finance the exercise. In providing strategic leadership for the fire and rescue service, we seek the best possible balance and require the flexibility to, for example, set priorities and objectives for the fire and rescue authorities that ensure that they perform adequately all their functions, all of which affect the public.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC340"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC340</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>It is obviously an extreme example, but one could argue that the only way to guarantee to get somewhere in a minute was to have a fire station or appliance at the end of every road. Clearly, that could be detrimental to economy and efficiency. That said, nothing undermines the point that I made that public safety will usually be our principal motivation for interfering&#151;intervening, rather than interfering.

<a name="40519-25_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   If the Minister had not said that, I would not have noticed it. I thank him for that reply. His example is very extreme. A more objective test might be where a fire and rescue authority wished to provide a particular vehicle or piece of equipment for public safety or to help it in a firefighting or rescue situation. The Secretary of State might decide, in the interests of economy and efficiency, that that was not the best use of money. There would be great tension in that case between the authority and the Secretary of State. My example is rather less extreme and more practical.
</p>

<a name="40519-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The matter will not delay us terribly long. We have heard what the Minister said and I am happy with his response. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_17"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall not dwell long on Amendments Nos. 73 and 74 either. They are designed to test the Government&#039;s thinking on the extent to which the Secretary of State should let other interested bodies decide who represents them. The amendments would introduce an objective test for the representatives of employers and employees who are to be consulted. Rather than a Secretary of State judging who, he thinks, represents each group, why not let the fire service employers, in particular, speak for themselves and decide who they consider properly to represent them?
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The amendments highlight the discrepancy between the Government&#039;s rhetoric on choice and the actual practice, whereby the Secretary of State decides to whom he will listen. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40519-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   The amendment seems very well worth considering, particularly in relation to employees. As the Bill now reads, it is as though the   Secretary of State decides who the employees&#039; representatives will be, whereas there will in fact be arrangements under the legislation for various groups to be recognised. Therefore, to substitute the wording suggested, particularly in Amendment No. 74, seems more in accord with what is likely to be the situation than leaving the legislation stand unamended. I would like the Minister to give serious consideration to what has been said; I am sure that he will.

</p>

<a name="40519-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I want to make it plain that this group of amendments would remove the provision for the Secretary of State to decide who represents the fire and   rescue authorities and their employees. The Government have every intention of consulting all relevant parties on the national framework and other matters. For example, in preparing the <i>Draft Fire and Rescue National Framework</i>, we followed carefully the Cabinet Office guidelines for consultation and sought the views of all key fire and rescue stakeholders, including those of all fire and rescue authorities, unions and associations, both directly and via the new consultative bodies such as the practitioners&#039; forum.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I assure noble Lords that we shall continue to consult widely and thoroughly before making any significant changes to the national framework, such as changing the Government&#039;s priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities. Our view is that the amendments, although well intentioned, are unnecessary and will cause delays both in consulting the fire and rescue community&#151;if one can describe it as that&#151;and in implementing fire and rescue policy.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Amendment No. 73, with its requirement on the Secretary of State to confirm who was representing fire and rescue authorities before any consultation was carried out, would cause delays to the consultation and to the timely implementation of fire and rescue policies.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Amendment No. 74 could lead to unnecessary confusion over which bodies were recognised as representing fire and rescue authority employees. Splinter groups claiming to represent the interests of fire and rescue authority employees could delay and confuse the process by challenging the Government on the grounds that they had not been consulted. For all those reasons, I respectfully suggest to the noble Baroness that she withdraw the amendments, as they do not help us to conduct consultation in a timely and proper fashion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40519-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   Will the Government think carefully about this matter? We have here something that looks very small but is in fact extremely important. We appear to be tampering with the fundamental principle that those who are represented choose those who represent them. It is an absolutely fundamental principle of democracy that one does not tell people who is going to represent them. Those who sit on the other side of the table, whether they are employers or workers, are the people who are chosen by the people whom they represent. A phrase that says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;considered by him to represent&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>in other words, the Minister, is not compatible with the simple democratic principle of representation. It is the people who are being represented who should choose the representatives.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>In these two amendments, the principle comes in a fairly modest form. However, when we come later to Amendment No. 108, we shall see it in relation to negotiation and the unions recognised for that <br>&nbsp;<br>

purpose. In the form that it is in the Bill, the Secretary of State once again appears to be absolutely free to decide whom he likes.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The principle is very important, and I ask the Government to consider whether they can move a little bit towards a sensible and reasonable position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40519-26_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I resent slightly the rather patronising tone in which we were told that the amendments were well meaning. They are not well meaning at all but utterly designed to ensure that the Secretary of State talks to the people to whom he is meant to be talking, if discussions have to take place. Should we allow this provision to go through on the framework, which is a very important aspect of the layout of the fire and rescue services? The proposal that the Secretary of State should decide willy-nilly whom he speaks to&#151;so that he decides who represents whom&#151;is astonishing. If we allow it to go through here it will go through in other parts of the Bill as well. There will be other aspects.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>As the former leader of a local authority, if I were faced with the Secretary of State deciding that the people who represented my local authority were the opposition, I would be cheesed off. That is inherent in the proposals. It is precisely what would happen. The Secretary of State, if he wished, could bypass any representative group that had been chosen by the fire and rescue authorities and by employees to represent them.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Our amendment says that the Secretary of State must, at least, have it confirmed to him that the people to whom he is talking are representative. It would be a modest amendment, which would ensure that the Secretary of State cannot just go off on a frolic of his own. It would mean that the employees must confirm that the people to whom the Secretary of State is talking are their representatives.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I am sure that the Minister will say that it will never happen, but we cannot go through the legislative process saying, &quot;That will never happen&quot;. It would cause enormous tension, if the Secretary of State were able to do what is suggested. Given a difficult and tendentious situation, it might seem to the Secretary of State that it would be an easy route out to talk to somebody who was not totally involved with the fire authority or with the employees.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 75, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 78. I shall not move Amendments Nos. 76 and 77. The main amendment in the group is Amendment No. 78. It is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC343"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC343</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

designed to address what appears to be the democratic deficit in the scrutiny of the framework document. I shall speak to Amendment No. 78 at some length.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I need speak only briefly to Amendment No. 75. It is consequential to Amendment No. 78 and would remove from Clause 21 the current provision for laying the framework before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 78 is to ensure that a document as important as the framework is brought before Parliament and receives the proper degree of scrutiny, before taking its final form. The framework tells fire and rescue authorities how to organise the discharge of the functions conferred on them by the Bill. It sets out what they are and are not allowed to do; when and how they are required to devolve their functions upward to higher bodies; and the guidance that they should accept from Secretaries of State. That will affect all fire authorities considerably.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The framework is too important a document for us to leave it to the administrative convenience of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to trump Parliament&#039;s role in holding the executive&#039;s policy to account. I am equally unpersuaded by two other arguments. One is that the framework is a working document and that therefore it is inappropriate for it to come before Parliament for its approval. The other is that because the Government have done with the National Policing Plan what they propose to do with the framework, such a procedure is therefore acceptable. Two wrongs do not make a right. Those are unsatisfactory arguments because they do not address the principal concern of Amendment No. 78.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The Government must find a way to allow for more scrutiny of the national framework. I hope that the Minister will be able to accede to our proposal for a simple measure of parliamentary scrutiny of what will   be an extremely important document. If the framework will not amount to a micromanagement plan for every nominally independent fire and rescue authority, the Minister has nothing to fear from allowing parliamentarians an opportunity to consider the framework in its final form.
</p>

<a name="40519-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I appreciate that I have probably pushed the Minister into a problem by not moving Amendment No. 77. It was an alternative to Amendment No. 78 and is a lesser test. I may wish to return to it, but today Amendment No. 78 is the substantive amendment. I apologise for not giving the Minister earlier warning. I beg to move.

<a name="40519-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   It is all right; the noble Baroness need not apologise. I used to learn those little tricks of the trade in the other place. I shall concentrate on Amendment No. 78, as that is clearly desired. Of course the noble Baroness is at liberty to return to the other issues at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Amendment No. 78 would introduce a requirement for a statutory instrument before the national framework can take effect. That requirement would not alter the status of the framework. As I said in my original statement, its legal status is guidance. By its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC344"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC344</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

nature, a national framework should provide strategic leadership, hence the inclusion of subsection (2)(a) in Clause 21, which provides that the Fire and Rescue National Framework must set out clear service priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>As I have said, not only Sir George Bain&#151;I do not want to wind people up, but he and his team did a very good job&#151;but also the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Committee in the other place recommended that the Government should provide strategic leadership for the service. The first recommendation of the Select Committee was quoted in the other place, but it makes the point so well that it is worth repeating, at least in part:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;The Service needs strong political leadership [from the government] to ensure successful implementation and management of change during a potentially very turbulent period&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The framework is designed to provide that leadership, but that is not its only purpose. To be effective as a manual the framework should also include guidance on all aspects of government fire and rescue policy and reference to good practice as it develops. It should also   include the capacity support measures that the Government will provide to fire and rescue authorities, and other useful information; for example, the independent performance assessment measures that the Audit Commission is implementing.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Ultimately, the Fire and Rescue National Framework would be a significant tool in driving forward the modernisation agenda, which is required to ensure that we have an effective fire and rescue service that saves more lives&#151;that is what we are about. It is imperative that there are no unnecessary obstacles to delivering that agenda. But the requirement for a statutory instrument before the national framework can take effect would mean unnecessary delay and uncertainty.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>On the framework itself, the Government must support the business requirements of the fire and rescue authorities, particularly through a period of such great change&#151;nobody denies that this is great change. For that reason, we intend to publish the framework in time for the start of authorities&#039; budget-setting and business-planning rounds. Unnecessary delay and uncertainty before the framework has effect would be entirely unhelpful.

</p>

<a name="40519-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Furthermore, any guidance that updated policy would be issued as a revision to the framework, so that authorities and the Audit Commission were clear about our expectations. For example, we will provide guidance to ensure that medical criteria for appointment and retention comply with forthcoming changes to the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Under new Clause 1, all guidance issued on that basis would require a statutory instrument before having effect. The delay and uncertainty that would result from the requirement for a statutory instrument for each new piece of guidance would again be to the detriment of the smooth and efficient running of the service.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>But&#151;it is a crucial &quot;but&quot;&#151;we accept that Parliament has a role in scrutinising decisions relating to fire and rescue policy. It is not Parliament&#039;s job to run the fire <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC345"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC345</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

service; let us get that absolutely clear. Acting as the eyes of the nation and watching the taxpayer&#039;s pound and the conduct of policy is a crucial role for Parliament. The Government must be, as they want to be, accountable to Parliament in the normal ways. We have ensured in the legislation that, if the Secretary of State proposes to enforce a measure in the framework by exercising the intervention powers in Clause 22, the order-making process will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In other words, the Government&#039;s action in that sense should certainly be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>There is already a good example of how that would work with the National Policing Plan. The Police Act 1996, as amended by the Police Reform Act 2002, requires the Secretary of State to prepare a National Policing Plan, but there is no requirement of a statutory instrument for the plan to take effect. The Secretary of State must lay the plan before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I assure Members of the Committee that we have included in the legislation a requirement to consult in preparing the framework or if making significant revisions to it. Our intention is to consult widely, as we have done with the draft national framework, and Members of both Houses would have the opportunity to comment during that process. I remind the Committee that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not make any comments about the level of scrutiny attached to the powers conferred by either Clauses 21 or 22. I realise that I am jumping the gun, but I wish to draw noble Lords&#039; attention to Clause 24, which requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament from time to time.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>If necessary, I shall go through the details of a delay that a statutory instrument would cause, but, given the expertise in this Room at present, I do not think that I need to. If anybody wants me to delineate how the 40   days would work, I will be happy to do so. Where the Government have taken action and the Secretary of State is making a move to use his powers, he will have to get an order through both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, at that point, we get the absolutely vital parliamentary scrutiny. Scrutiny should take place at that point, not in an order bringing in what is in effect the national framework&#151;it is guidance. I understand what will flow from the guidance. If it emerges that the Secretary of State needs to take action, he will necessarily come back to Parliament.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40519-27_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. We have before us the draft <i>Fire and Rescue National Framework. </i>I understand that it may be altered as a result of recently completed consultation; however, by and large, it is the draft national framework. It would be impossible during the passage of the Bill to discuss the entire contents of the framework, but before the next stage we may have to look at its contents so that we can have a proper debate on it.

</p>

<a name="40519-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The framework will be the blueprint for how the fire and rescue service is to be run. Even the draft framework is quite prescriptive; there are quite a lot of provisions that the fire and rescue authorities will not be able to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC346"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC346</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wriggle out of. They will have to do all sorts of things. Although, I am sure, a good deal of effort has gone into the draft and there has been a lot of consultation, it sets up virtually a new service, as we are constantly told, with different parameters and responsibilities than were apparent under the 1947 Act.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I see no reason why the framework should not, certainly in its first stages, come before Parliament so that we could debate it properly, once the consultation is finished and before the framework is issued. That would be possible if we arranged for a debate on the framework, but it would not be quite the same as the sort of scrutiny that we envisage: an order before Parliament. The process could not delay progress much. Consultation has taken several months, and it will probably take another couple of months to consider the results and put them together, so it is not an absolutely galloping process. It seems strange that at the end of the process an order could not be laid on a time scale that would enable Parliament to look at what was finally proposed.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>If amendments will be made to the framework later on, they will presumably be of significance, as that will mean that something in the framework is not working, or needs to be added or taken away. Again, that would be relevant to the Bill. I am not happy with the reply&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40519-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I clearly want to come back on the matter, although I think that the noble Baroness is at the point where she says that she is not happy so will withdraw the amendments and come back to them. I was shaking my head when she was speaking.

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40519-27_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I noticed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40519-27_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I shall explain why. I did not disagree with everything that the noble Baroness said, but the framework will and must reflect the partnership working between the Government and the fire and rescue community. We see the framework as a contract embodying the partnership approach to reforming the service. It has to be a document that will evolve over time; that is why I was shaking my head, because she was being too prescriptive by saying that we had missed something out and wanting to add something. It will evolve from the work of the fire and rescue community. There will be full consultation before we publish any framework or any significant changes made to it. As I said, Members of both Houses and the relevant Select Committees will be able to comment on the framework at that stage.
</p>

<a name="40519-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The framework and any significant changes made to it will be laid before Parliament and, as I indicated on Clause 24, the Secretary of State will report to Parliament on the extent to which the fire and rescue authorities act in accordance with the framework, and on any steps that he takes to ensure that they do. One has to ask what the role of Parliament is. It is not to write and manage the detail of the public service; we are not qualified to do that. Parliament&#039;s role is to make sure that the overall conduct of policy is right and that the Government have been absolutely scrutinised. That is what I humbly submit that we are offering in the way in which we have drafted the Bill.

<a name="40519-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I would be happier with that reply if the Minister had accepted the previous amendment.

<p><a name="st_31"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 80A. Both amendments deal with the same line, and it is such a contentious clause that there are another two amendments to the same line in between mine. My amendments would apply the term &quot;significantly&quot; to a fire and rescue authority failing or likely to fail.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I am aware that the Local Government Act 1999 uses similar language. It does not refer to &quot;likely to fail&quot; but to &quot;complying with the requirements of the Act&quot;. In this case we are talking about the Secretary of State&#039;s powers to intervene if a fire and rescue authority fails or is likely to fail to act in accordance with what the Minister has just confirmed is guidance; it is not a document approved by Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I am sure the Minister will say that, as a matter of common sense, the Secretary of State will not leap in and make an order under Clause 22(2) unless there is a very good reason for doing so. I accept that observation, but I believe that there should be legislation to reflect it.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Clause 22(2) uses very blunt language&#151;&quot;do something&quot;; &quot;stop doing it&quot;; &quot;do not do it&quot;. The criteria that the Committee considered in the previous clause, which are also set out in Clause 22(3), are so wide that the Secretary of State can say &quot;do something&quot; or &quot;do not do something&quot; quite trivial. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC348"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC348</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

For example, he could say, &quot;You are not having the cheapest window cleaning done. That has an effect on how economically and efficiently you are carrying out the rest of the service&quot;. I take almost as extreme an example as having fire stations at the end of every road.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>While moving the amendment&#151;this is relevant&#151; perhaps I can ask the Minister to list all the intervention powers that the Secretary of State has. As I understand it, as well as this legislation, the 1999 Act applies to fire and rescue authorities as &quot;best value&quot; authorities. So there is a parallel set of activities that the Secretary of State can undertake. It would be helpful to know what they are and to have them listed in compendium form.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The amendment is designed to ensure that the Secretary of State can say &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;do&quot; only if the failure is significant. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40519-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   It is fairly obvious that Clause 22 is, by and large, one that we do not want to operate: it is a back up; a long stop. It is legitimately there, but it is not for day-to-day or month-to-month management by the Secretary of State. He does not want to get involved because he does not want authorities to fail. These are basically last-resort powers. &quot;Last resort&quot; means that you almost have a crisis on your hands because others tried to sort it out in the first place. We intend to use the powers in Clause 22 only as a last resort.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>In those circumstances, their use must be proportionate and based on some evidence&#151;otherwise people could run to the courts and ask for a judicial review, claiming that the Secretary of State is acting in an unreasonable fashion. That is why I reject the example given by the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The different kinds of evidence that may be used to justify intervention in a failing authority is set out&#151;I made this point on an earlier amendment&#151;in the local government intervention protocol, which we have stated we will adhere to. So there is no secret about the factors that will be taken into account. These include audit of local performance plans, Audit Commission inspections of fundamental reviews, inspection reports, public interest reports, reports of inquiries, ombudsman investigations or judicial findings and concerns raised about serious danger or harm to the public. All those, or one or more of them, would be a means of providing evidence that might give sufficient reassurance that there are grounds for intervention without adding the word &quot;significantly&quot; to the Bill. That is the point here.
</p>

<a name="40519-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The amendments could be seen to be vague because someone must decide what constitutes a significant failure. That in itself could be the cause of people running to court, which is not a useful use of anyone&#039;s time or of taxpayers&#039; money. Independent evidence contained in the local government intervention protocol&#151;which is already agreed, it is not something that has just been dreamed up&#151;is a more concrete basis for that decision.

<a name="40519-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>As I have said, these are long-stop powers. I agree with the noble Baroness that in terms of using plain English, the parliamentary draftsman has really surpassed him or herself&#151;I think it is a &quot;himself&quot; in this case&#151;in Clause 22(2)(a) to (c). I want to be complimentary. It is made clear: &quot;to do something&quot;, &quot;to stop doing something&quot;, &quot;not to do something&quot;. He has surpassed himself in the use of plain English; no one could argue with that. In order to operate it and for the Secretary of State to issue those orders, which may not be the result of any ambiguity, he would have to have evidence; evidence that could stand the test of judicial review, if anyone was so minded to pursue it. Therefore he would require information and evidence based on the operation of the local government intervention protocol. We do not wake up every day, month, or year thinking, &quot;How can we interfere with local government?&quot;. That is absolutely true. These are &quot;last resort&quot; powers that would be used in what would be considered to be the most extreme circumstances. Therefore I cannot accept the amendment to insert the word &quot;significantly&quot;.

I accept that the Secretary of State would have a mind to whether any decision taken under this clause might be open to challenge. Similarly, any fire and rescue authority seeking to challenge whether a failure was significant, if the term was included, similarly would think carefully about whether it wanted to do something as extreme as going to court to say, &quot;Stop the Secretary of State telling us to stop doing something&quot;. Putting it bluntly, I would rather my money were on the fire and rescue authority. I am not surprised by the response, but I thank the Minister for spelling out the position so clearly.

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>As the Bill stands, there is a substantial element of uncertainty. The Secretary of State may intervene if he considers that the authority is failing to act in accordance with the framework. That is perfectly understandable. Why, then, include &quot;or is likely to fail&quot;? How is that to be interpreted? How does the Secretary of State know that the authority is likely to fail?

I wish that we had a crystal ball or tea leaves in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, given some of the things that cross our desks from time to time. We could do with it. We might be better off using a crystal ball or tea leaves&#151;but I shall not go down that road.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Clause 22, as I say, is drafted in precise language. It allows the Secretary of State to intervene in two sets of circumstances. My noble friend has picked the second set; namely, where an authority is &quot;likely to fail&quot; to adhere to the framework. The power to intervene if an authority is likely to fail is important. The powers are necessary to safeguard the public interest. For example, there may be circumstances in which it is immediately apparent that a fire and rescue authority does not have sufficient capacity and the resources to deal with a large-scale incident in its area. In those circumstances, it is vital that the Secretary of State has the power to intervene to rectify the situation at the earliest opportunity.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I hope that the point I am about to make will be the safeguard sought by my noble friend. Occasions for the use of the powers will be rare, and any intervention using them will be based on evidence and will comply with the principles of the local government intervention protocol. I did not go into the detail of this before. The protocol requires authorities to agree a recovery plan with central government in the first instance. The powers of compulsion will be used only as a last resort. In other words, if an authority is thought likely to fail and the Secretary of State wants to use his powers, the fire authority will, we hope, take cognisance of the fact that the Secretary of State has good reason for doing so.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The idea is to get a recovery plan to bring the authority up to scratch, so that the powers of compulsion will not be needed. There is no question of the Secretary of State waking up one morning, picking on a fire authority because he has heard dodgy rumours about it being unready to do something and going straight in with an iron fist. It will not work that way. It will be pointed out to the authority that something is amiss, and in the first instance it will be asked to agree a recovery plan with central government. The powers of compulsion will be used only as a last resort.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>If there is an urgent need for intervention, the protocol we will work with allows the Government to issue directions to authorities before they have had the opportunity to rectify the situation themselves. I have no example of that. It could be a threat to the safety of the public or to firefighters, but I have no examples and I do not want to dream them up, as I do not want to put ideas into people&#039;s heads. People are not seeking to do that. However, the intervention would take place <br>&nbsp;<br>

only in the most extreme circumstances. The first call under the protocol is to get a recovery plan to bring the situation up to scratch, so that the powers are not needed.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I hope that that is a sufficient safeguard for my noble friend, who has probed us on why the words are in the clause in the first place.

</p>

</p>

<a name="40519-29_para5"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>The noble Lord said: The noble Baroness, Lady   Hamwee, spoke to my amendments in the debate on the previous amendment, and the first part of this amendment is particularly relevant to the one moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. However, I shall still speak to my amendments because we must continue to explore this very important area during this stage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>These amendments seek to address the Secretary of State&#039;s power to act where an authority is failing. Amendment No. 80 seeks to remove from subsection (1) the reference to an authority that &quot;is likely to fail&quot;,   as did the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady   Turner. It is not unreasonable that the intervention should take place after the offence has occurred, but not when the Secretary of State thinks that it might occur.

</p>

<a name="40519-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Together, these amendments would remove references to acting,

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee&#151;and substitute them with references to authorities discharging their functions under Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9. If an authority is properly discharging its core functions it would be wholly inappropriate for the Secretary of State to intervene because it was not complying with all the requirements of the framework in relation to human resource issues or employment <br>&nbsp;<br>

practices. If we do not limit the Secretary of State&#039;s powers to intervene to cases where there has been a clear failure to discharge statutory functions, the concept of local accountability and autonomy will become meaningless.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Amendment No. 81 would amend Clause 23 by again replacing the reference to compliance with Clause 21 with a reference to the authority discharging its functions under Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9. Amendment No. 90 would require the Secretary of State, before he takes any interventionist action, to consult the bodies representing fire authorities in regard to any code of conduct relating to such action.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>We are attempting to limit the possibility of intervention to a &quot;last resort&quot;, the term used several times by the Minister. I am aware that both the Local Government Association and the Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government have done significant work in this area and it seems strange not to involve them as a first point of call when a fire authority was considered to have failed rather than sending in storm troopers from the ODPM with all guns blazing. We hope that the amendment will encourage discussion as a first step rather than the more antiquated measures that I suspect the Minister would like to see.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The amendments are necessary to preserve the autonomy of fire and rescue authorities and to ensure that the draconian powers granted to the Secretary of State under the clause, which will be exercised under the best value audit system, will not be imposed on authorities merely for failing to comply with the national framework, but according to the much more important question of whether they are discharging their statutory functions in relation to fire, road traffic accidents, fire safety or any other duties that the Secretary of State might prescribe under Clause 9. That should be the test of whether intervention is required. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40519-29_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I apologise to the noble Lord for trespassing on his amendment; it was not neatly pigeon-holed. The clause allows the Secretary of State to intervene&#151;albeit subject to the code and so on&#151;if an authority fails, or is likely to fail, to act in accordance with the framework. But in the previous clause fire and rescue authorities are not required to act in accordance with the framework, they are required to have regard to it. They may quite properly consider a part of the framework and say &quot;No, we do not agree&quot; for very good reasons. It seems to me that those two issues do not lie entirely comfortably together.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40519-29_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I have to say, it takes a lawyer to say that. As I said earlier, the framework is guidance. I gave three or four examples of the national guidance being clear and unambiguous but the application of it being subject to the local circumstances. Authorities are required to have regard to the guidance. It may be   that one fire authority will have regard to the framework and arrive, because its circumstances are different, at a different conclusion to a neighbouring authority.

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The noble Lord referred to the &quot;storm troopers of the ODPM&quot;, which was the first time I had heard that   phrase. We do not have any storm troopers in the ODPM. He put forward the idea that such storm troopers would go in there simply because one authority decided to do something differently at its level, because its risk management in its area was different. The fact is that those two neighbouring authorities would have had regard to the framework after doing the initial work, and that is fine.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The amendment gives me the opportunity to reinforce what I have already said. Genuine points have been made, but there is no desire for us to intervene. We would rather fire authorities fought fires and prevented them and gave us a quiet life. It is not the ODPM&#039;s desire to be involved in that way.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made the point about removing the powers of the Secretary of State to intervene. The amendments propose that the Secretary of State takes powers to intervene only when fire and rescue authorities are failing to fulfil their core duties under Part 2 of the Bill. That is an unnecessary and misconceived approach. Fire and rescue authorities will be under a legal obligation to make arrangements for the discharge of their statutory functions under Clauses 6 to 9. They are answerable in public law if they are found to be in breach of their statutory obligations and could be subject to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Fire and rescue authorities are best value authorities and therefore subject to the provisions of the Local Government Act 1999, which empowers the Secretary of State to issue guidance and set standards, to make directions and make provision to provide for the performance of functions. It is precisely because the national framework goes wider than the local delivery of core functions and sets out national and regional performance expectations of critical functions, such as regional control rooms, that the intervention powers provided in Clause 22 are necessary to supplement those available under the existing best value regime. That is the sequence of events: they are best value authorities but the framework itself goes wider than the core function. That is why it is necessary to have the provision.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>We want to ensure that the national framework retains the flexibility to evolve as the process of modernisation within the fire and rescue service changes and progresses. If intervention powers are tied to functions written into the legislation, we will lose the scope for change and development within the service as the measures within the framework take effect.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The framework also gives practical and current guidance on how authorities should exercise their core functions. It therefore deals with the detail of what the service needs to do to promote public safety and economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It will therefore be essential that the Secretary of State can, if need be, ensure that the practical measures outlined in the framework will be implemented. We therefore need the reserve powers&#151;I emphasise that they are reserve powers.

<a name="40519-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Amendment No. 90 would, for example, require the Secretary of State to have regard to the local government intervention protocol or other agreed protocols or codes of conduct when exercising his powers under Clause 22 to intervene to enforce the national framework. I have already stated that we have every intention of adhering to the spirit of the local government intervention protocol that was agreed with the LGA in exercising the new powers of intervention. I am advised that the protocol has worked well and has wide support within local government, but we do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to place a specific process on the face of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I assure Members of the Committee&#151;and this is a theme of this Bill as it was with others&#151;that in all but the most urgent cases, the Government will discuss fully and agree a plan of action with an authority that they consider is failing, in the first instance. The Government or Secretary of State cannot operate on a hunch or a prejudice. Government cannot work that way in this country. Intervention powers will be used as a last resort. Any intervention will be based on evidence, and authorities will have ample opportunity to make representations before any powers are exercised.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Here are some examples of where we could use Clause 22 powers not covered in Clauses 6 to 9: in regional control rooms, which is a crucial component of the resilience programme; regional training facilities, to ensure that training was delivered as efficiently as possible; and provision of specialist services at regional level, such as fire investigation functions. Those may evolve over time. They are examples of something not covered by Clauses 6 to 9. It also seems unlikely that the Secretary of State would not have regard to an agreement that he is party to. There is a partnership arrangement between the Government and the fire authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-29_para22"></a>

<a name="40519-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   The Minister ruined his case by bringing in regional stuff at the end. Regional training would be a retrograde step. I have never heard anything so daft in all my life as the suggestion that regional training would benefit the fire service. Perhaps there might be a benefit to regional control rooms, if they were set up wisely with other services, but it is much better to have sub-regional than regional training.

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>One thing that the Minister did not mention at all in this discussion, although we mentioned it at an earlier stage, is the case of a failing authority and the CPA process. We all accept that if an authority is failing, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC355"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC355</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

something must be done about it. However, we have a CPA process whereby local authorities are judged and   by which fire authorities will be judged and categorised. There is a system within the CPA whereby, if fire authorities are categorised in the same way as local authorities, they will be &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; if they are towards the lower end. With the Audit Commission and the LGA there is a self-help system.
</p>

<a name="40519-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Where we have problems, and where other Members of the Committee may have problems, is with the &quot;likely to fail&quot; categorisation. It could mean anything. No one would dispute that the Secretary of State should intervene if there were a totally failing authority, but what is &quot;likely to fail&quot;? The Minister did not refer at all to the CPA process. Whatever we think of that process, it identifies weaknesses in authorities and gives them an opportunity to rectify them. This part of the Bill seems to have been written two or three years ago, before we had what we have now.
</p>

<a name="40519-30_para2"></a>

<a name="40519-30_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Because we need a last resort power. The point is that things might go wrong, and we do not want to be in a position where we are told, &quot;You saw this coming and you did nothing about it&quot;, because there were no back-up powers, notwithstanding the CPA. In other words, these are remote last resort powers, but we still believe that it is in the public interest to have them. They are not for the first or second resort but for the last resort.

We are talking about safety and the prevention of some terrible things happening. However, the functions are to be carried out by democratic organisations. There are very good reasons for their structure and why they should be local organisations.

<a name="40519-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Amendment No. 81A would require the Secretary of State, if he makes an order under Clause 22, to publish his reasons. Clause 22(4) requires the Secretary of State to give an authority the opportunity to make representations before the order is made. A moment ago the Minister said that this would be &quot;in all but the most urgent cases&quot;. I might regret saying this if it leads to &quot;in all but the most urgent cases&quot; being added to the clause but, as the clause stands at the moment, in every case the Secretary of State has to give an opportunity for representations to be made. There may be clauses elsewhere under which he can take urgent action and then talk about it afterwards.
</p>

<a name="40519-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The authority may make representations; then the Secretary of State may issue an order. I am sure that in any normal circumstances the authority would be told the reasons why an order should be made. In the planning Bill, the Minister was persuaded in one or two places that the Secretary of State should give reasons; in this case, the authority should be told the reasons. It is a matter of public interest if the Secretary of State intervenes, and his reasons for doing so should be on the record. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40519-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>However, Clause 24 in itself should be ample reassurance that the use of the intervention powers will be transparent&#151;as well as used sparingly&#151;and that Parliament will have ample opportunity to scrutinise the Secretary of State&#039;s actions in using them.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 82 to 85 go back over the ground covered by the amendments tabled to Clause 21. They would ensure that the Secretary of State&#039;s intervention is permitted only where it is in the interests of the promotion of public safety, or on another ground, but only to the extent that pursuing it is not detrimental to the primary objective of pursuing public safety. Without that provision there is no protection in the Bill against the Secretary of State deciding to intervene under Clause 22 on the basis of economic arguments rather than public safety arguments.

</p>

<a name="40519-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>That makes a mockery of the Government&#039;s repeated assurance that the modernisation programme is about saving lives not money. In that regard, Clause 22 seems even more important than Clause 21, as it applies if the Secretary of State is intervening because of a failure or potential failure of an authority. Our amendment would ensure that, in the first instance, the failure was measured in terms of people&#039;s safety before making the economic considerations. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40519-30_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   There is a very short explanation for why we think the amendment is unnecessary. It seeks to specify the order and weight of consideration that the Secretary of State must give to the criteria on which he will decide to exercise the intervention powers set out in Clause 22. Rather like the amendments to Clause 21, they are unnecessary and remove the Secretary of State&#039;s flexibility to respond effectively to a wide range of circumstances. The Government have made clear that public safety will usually be their principal concern in intervening in fire and rescue authorities. Obviously, we give that reassurance again. For that reason, we do not think that it is necessary to specify that in the legislation. We cannot see the benefit of that, as it is clear why we think there should be a power to intervene, and the terms on which an intervention will be made.

<a name="40519-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton </b>  : I am happy to respond to Amendments Nos. 83A and 84A, if the noble Baroness wishes. I agree that it would be a more intelligent way of grouping the amendments, as they deal with the same issues. I have a rather longer explanation, so the noble Baroness shall have to bear with me.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Amendments Nos. 83A and 84A would limit the power of the Secretary of State to intervene under Clause 22. In any event, the Secretary of State may intervene only to enforce the main national framework on public safety, not if he considers that it would promote efficiency, effectiveness and economy&#151;that is the reason for the amendment. We have made clear that public safety is the paramount concern. However, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC358"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC358</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

part of having a fire and rescue authority that serves the public well is ensuring that a wide variety of its functions, not just those relating to public safety, are efficient and effective. Our overriding wish is to ensure that the public are assured that fire and rescue services are equipped to serve their safety needs and that they represent value for money.

</p>

<a name="40519-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>For that reason, we cannot understand why noble Lords would not wish to provide both those safeguards for the public. We have already said that we expect the use of the intervention powers to be rare, and it is to be governed by the local government intervention protocol. As the noble Lord, Lord   Rooker, explained at length, that is how we see things working. The protocol sets out very detailed procedure to be followed when considering intervening in an authority.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>It is perhaps worth reminding the Committee what the protocol says. It provides that a sufficient evidence base must be accumulated before any action is taken; that the form and extent of intervention will reflect the type and seriousness of failure and the need for effective improvement; and, other than in cases of urgency, that there will be a process of agreement with the authority on how it will address any service failure in the first instance. It further provides that intervention powers will be used   only if the process fails to deliver the required improvement, and that there will be consultation with the authority concerned on any proposed directions. So there are already lots of safety mechanisms in the intervention process. It must conform to those requirements. That is understood and agreed in local government; I am sure that it is understood and agreed by fire and rescue authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>These amendments take us on to rather narrow territory. In the end, improvements in efficiency and effectiveness will contribute generally towards public safety by ensuring that resources that are appropriate and right are available for those safety priorities. The amendment would not add anything beyond what we have already established and how we see intervention working. Intervention will work only if we conform to that. The history of intervention in locally run public services suggests that that is the right approach. There is probably a common understanding on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40519-31_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I should apologise to the noble Baroness for intervening, but my amendments seem to cover similar territory. I suspect that she will say that we will have to return to some issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40519-31_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I do not like anybody intervening in my amendments; it is very diverting if nothing else.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I do not understand why the Government object to the amendments. They are far more than drafting amendments; they would set the standard of promoting public safety without reducing flexibility. They set public safety as a priority that must be considered first, operating within the framework on that basis. It seems that that is very important in Clause 22, as it deals with the Secretary of State&#039;s intervention, in that wonderful plain English.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40519-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>In the context of Clause 22 it is more serious that the first priority should be public safety, and that it should be the first thing that the Secretary of State considers. For today, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40519-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy </b>   moved Amendment No. 86:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>Page 11, line 38, after &quot;authority&quot; insert &quot;and representatives of recognised unions&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a very modest amendment. The Government have failed to provide what we want them to provide, and we are now on the critical clause, where the Secretary of State, whether in the last instance or at some other stage, has legal power to intervene. We are not told how he will intervene, except that he can require an authority by order to do something, to stop doing something or not to do something.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Quite properly, the Bill says, and the Government accept, that before telling an authority to do something, to stop doing something or not to do anything, the Secretary of State should give an authority an opportunity to make representations. All we are saying is that, at line 38 on page 11, we should have,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;after &#039;authority&#039; insert &#039;and representatives of recognised unions&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>If the Secretary of State tells the employer either to do or to stop doing something, I do not think anyone would argue that this is unlikely to have an impact on the workers. Of course it will. Something is either failing or likely to fail and there will be evidence of that. Something will have to change, and it is likely that there will have to be changes in employment practices, such as in work locations. Perhaps what should be done is being resisted and the Secretary of State wants things to move faster.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We argue that the first reason why the amendment should be put on the face of the Bill is because, in most cases, when the Secretary of State reaches the point of issuing an order, it will have consequences for the workers as well as for the authorities. Surely, then, workers&#039; representatives should be consulted. But if it is something difficult&#151;and it probably will be, because the Secretary of State would not have moved to the final stage by taking this reluctant power on himself unless it was&#151;he will need co-operation. As the Minister has said, he will want the co-operation of the authorities, but surely he will also need the co-operation of the workers and their representative unions to see whether, at that late stage, a solution can be found.

</p>

<a name="40519-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The second reason for the amendment is that we would expect the employers to tell the employees, who would want to know, what is going on. They would then be able to co-operate in whatever the Government decide. Strangely enough, if the Government were the employer&#151;they are not in the fire service&#151;it would be contrary to the EU consultation directive not to inform the workers. There is a long list of things that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC360"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC360</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

employer has to tell the workers. However, this is a power taken by the Government in an order that they are introducing.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>If the employers are to be consulted and their representations taken into account, surely it is only common sense to do the same for the representatives of the workers. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40519-31_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   This amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult both the fire and rescue authority and representatives of recognised unions before any order using these powers is made. My noble friend Lord McCarthy has described this as a critical clause. In some senses it is because, as he says, the key to changing performance lies in encouraging and working with the employees. After all, they are the service deliverers.

</p>

<a name="40519-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>We do not see the need for this amendment. The national framework sets out the Government&#039;s objectives and priorities for fire and rescue authorities. It is a strategic document which deals with the functions of fire and rescue authorities. So we think it is more appropriate, where intervention is necessary because a fire authority fails to adhere to the framework, for that authority to be consulted on the action taken. It should then be the responsibility of the fire and rescue authority itself to consult its employees and their associated unions under those circumstances, and present its views to the Government through the procedure for negotiation set out in the local government intervention protocol.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Clause 21 specifies that in preparing or making significant changes to the framework, the Secretary of State must consult the employees of fire and rescue authorities. It is at this point that broad consultation is appropriate. However, where an authority is struggling to implement the framework, for whatever reason, any ameliorating action necessary should be decided between the authority concerned and the Government.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>To safeguard the interests of the public it is important that, where a fire and rescue authority is failing, the swiftest possible action is taken to rectify the situation. To consult a range of organisations at that stage is unlikely to be a practical option and there   is no similar requirement to consult union representatives in the local government intervention protocol which applies to the existing powers to intervene in fire and rescue authorities contained in the Local Government Act.
</p>

<a name="40519-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>We think that we have taken the best approach here. It is relevant and important for the fire and rescue authority itself to consult its employees directly and for it to reflect back to the Government the views of its employees. We think that that is a better way of dealing with this matter rather than having in operation what one might think of as a parallel process of consultation.

situation where the Secretary of State, because an emergency has arisen or there is an exceptional set of circumstances, may need to take action, it is even more important and necessary for the people on whose work the success or otherwise of the venture will depend to be involved. I am rather surprised that the Minister has   not taken a more accepting approach to this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40519-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I am sure that my noble friend heard me say that we do see the importance of consultation. It is more a question of who should conduct that consultation at particular stages of the process. I used to run a local authority. In terms of organising the management of that authority, it struck me that it was much more important for those close to delivering a service to be able to consult and work with the people providing that service from day to day. It is that closeness of consultation in an arena where management and staff understand each other which is most important, and it is for management to work out, explain and reflect back what changes need to be made. That is how we see this working.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40519-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   The Government seem to have a theory about the finite sum of consultation. There is only so much consultation and it has to be done by one group or another. If the authority is doing it, then the Government do not need to do it as well. But there is no finite sum of consultation. You should consult and   take representations wherever you can. If the Government ask the authority what the workers think about a proposal, they will not get the same answer that they would be given by the workers. The authority will say what it wants to say. If you want to find out what the workers think about something, you ask their representatives.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>It is no good saying that the unions are consulted when general policies are formulated because here we are talking about something very specific. There have been specific failures in specific authorities. It is for the purpose of ensuring that the fire authority acts in accordance with the national framework that the Secretary of State may, by order, tell the authority to do specific things, or not to do them. Therefore the more people who are consulted in each case, the better.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>If what the Minister told us earlier is true, these will almost certainly be very difficult circumstances. If that were not so, the Government would not be using the law here and introducing orders that will be imposed on the workers just as much as on the authorities. Therefore the more consultation and representation, the better. But the Government seem to believe that there is a finite sum of consultation, and I wish I could say that I am surprised. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>The noble Lord said: This is about our old friend, independent assessment. We went into this matter during our debates on the previous Fire Services Bill. My noble friends and I are making again the point that we made at that stage.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>What could happen is very similar to what may happen during the next few weeks or months as a result of the first Fire Services Bill; that is, there will be failure to agree on the changes the Government want to introduce and, eventually, a decision will be taken by the Secretary of State to issue an order which will affect the terms and conditions of employment of the people concerned.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>We argue that before the Government issue an order of this kind, some form of objective assessment of whether what is being suggested is reasonable should be made from a body external to the process. We do not say that such external assessment should be binding. We asked for that on the previous occasion, but we do not say that this time. We say only that the Government are about to introduce a form of legal compulsion and the public should be able to judge whether that compulsion is necessary and whether the terms being introduced by the Government are necessary. In order to achieve that, some kind of independent assessment is needed.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>We leave it to the Government to decide what form the assessment should take. They can say whether it will be conciliation or mediation; there are many different kinds of assessment. But in this difficult area acceptance is much more likely if what the Government are forcing the industry to do is supported by such an assessment than if there is no independent assessment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40519-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My noble friend has moved an amendment that he has repeatedly made clear would require independent assessment before the orders under this clause could become effective. I do not think he has made a case for the desirability of this form of intervention. On numerous occasions we have explained that the primary reason for giving the Secretary of State these powers is to ensure that where fire and rescue authorities are failing, swift and decisive action is taken to protect public safety. I am not sure how that would be possible if, in the event of a crisis or failure, we had to wait for an independent assessment of our proposed action to be written or published before anything could be done. That is just not practical.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The intervention protocol is crucial because it is not as though there is no system for the Secretary of State to intervene; there is a system. The protocol is agreed   between local and central government to ensure that there is an agreed procedure for exercising intervention powers before there is the need to exercise those powers. That of course would reduce any unnecessary delay or concern.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40519-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Would the Minister allow me to interrupt for a moment? When I inquired about the CPA processes at some length, and stressed the fact that because we have them these powers are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC363"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC363</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unnecessary, the Minister did not respond about the intervention protocol. That protocol is based on the CPA process. As the noble Lord has just pointed out, the intervention protocol is an agreement between local authorities, the Local Government Association and the Government on how to use the CPA process. The noble Lord has just referred to the intervention protocol, which, as I suggested earlier, we already have in place. Therefore we do not need the draconian powers proposed in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40519-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The noble Lord has completely misunderstood my point. Given his stature and importance in local government, he ought to know better. The comprehensive performance assessment will be a very important source of evidence. There is no question about that. But the CPA will take place only from time to time. We shall not need a comprehensive performance assessment to tell us that an authority does not have an adequate control room. We would need to act. Similarly, we must act if it is clear that an authority will not have an adequate control room three months hence, for reasons of public safety.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The CPA part of the process is not the be-all and end-all. We have a protocol agreed with local government. Parliament should be quite pleased that central and local government have come to a settlement to have an agreed protocol about when intervention takes place. It is very important that one does not start to agree a protocol at the time when one needs to intervene. It needs to be written down and agreed beforehand so that it does not itself become the source of difficulty.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>In any case, the decision to use the intervention powers contained in Clause 22, which we are debating, will be based on the evidence set out in the intervention protocol. I gave an example of where the evidence could come from; it could come from any one of half a dozen sources of independent assessment, so the performance of the fire and rescue authorities is measured, whether through the CPA or other independent studies or audits. We do not see the need for another assessment of the order itself, as the evidence of the necessity for intervention will be already and well and truly in the public domain.
</p>

<a name="40519-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The intervention protocol is not linked to using the CPA results as evidence for intervention. There are half a dozen other types of possible sources, as I read out earlier under another amendment. The CPA happens only from time to time and is not the be-all and end-all, although it is an important source. I hope that my noble friend will take on board the fact that in order to use the powers in this clause for the purposes in this clause, the Secretary of State will have had evidence from independent sources. One case I mentioned was that of the Audit Commission.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;(5)   No order made under this section shall relate to an act done or to be done or not to be done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_74"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment takes us back to the arguments that we had under the previous Fire Services Bill. We are getting into a situation under this   Bill which we believed we would not have after the sunset clause had appeared and disappeared and the provisions in the last Bill ran out. We argued last time that the power that the Secretary of State was taking to impose orders affecting terms and conditions of employment could modify protected industrial action. We argued that at very considerable length, and I shall not go into it again this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>No concessions were made, and the Government did not agree with our interpretation of the law. They said that the right to strike would remain whether or not, under the terms of the 2003 Act, Section 1 produced an order whereby the Secretary of State could modify or fix conditions of service by changing the terms of the contract. They said that that would not affect the protection of the 1992 Act. However, a concession was given in the sense that they said that we were dealing with a short-term emergency. The sunset clause was supposed to die out in November 2005.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The people involved at the time&#151;the parliamentary Labour Party in the other place&#151;thought that it was a temporary measure that would end when the powers in that Act ended. If the Government disagree with me, I hope that they will say so, but it seems to me that there is a sense in which this Bill creates the same liabilities, dangers and interventions. Therefore our argument is that the Government should take into consideration whether there is a liability as a result of this Bill which is in many ways similar to the liability as a result of the previous Act. One way in which that could be done is via this amendment. This is one of the ways in which the Government could ensure that what they said was the case takes place&#151;that no order made under the clause would,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;relate to an act done or to be done or not to be done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>That would be another formula. On the previous occasion we put forward a dozen different formulae whereby orders that changed conditions of employment did not give rise to liabilities outside the protection of the 1992 Act.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>But there is yet another way for the Government to honour the pledge and belief that they have which is   independent of the previous Act and even the consequences of this Bill. If an order is made under the Bill that instructs an authority to do something and it is not obeyed, or not obeyed to the extent that the Government feel is required, the Government may proceed against the authority. If they proceed against the authority and if the employees decide to take <br>&nbsp;<br>

industrial action, everything that the Government have told us suggests that they do not believe that the authority should take it upon themselves to dismiss those who are concerned in that industrial action. They tell us that the protection should remain.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>In an attempt to find out whether the Government would do something to make that clear, at least to the   authority, I asked the Minister in a Written Question&#151;HL 386&#151;whether the Government,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;intend to instruct all fire authorities that, when use is made of the powers granted to the Secretary of State under section 1 of the Fire Services Act 2003&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>and, one could say, under Clause 22 of this Bill&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;actions by employees or their union intended to frustrate such powers should be regarded as lawful, so long as they remain within the provisions governing protected industrial action&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>If the Government had said that, they would have stated publicly what they say they believe to be the case. They could do that now in respect of this Bill. On that occasion, in a Written Answer to a Written Question, <i>Hansard</i> tells us that the noble Lord, Lord   Rooker, Minister of State in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;Ministers have no powers to instruct fire authorities as to what constitutes lawful action on the part of employees or their unions&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/1/04; col. WA 15.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>That is not quite right. In a situation such as could develop, nobody could say that it was unlawful for a Minister to let it be known that in the Government&#039;s opinion that was the law. If local authorities feel that they are being frustrated and wish to carry out an order under an instruction given by the Secretary of State but are being resisted by their workforce, one obvious way for them to act is to dismiss those concerned. They would use their power of dismissal and say, &quot;We don&#039;t think what you&#039;ve done is protected by the 1992 legislation&quot;.

<a name="40519-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Let me make a couple of preliminary points before I respond to my noble friend. For the avoidance of doubt, I must make it abundantly clear that there are no powers in the Bill to impose terms and conditions. I do not want to make a rod for my own back by saying that, but I challenge anyone to tell me where they are. There are no powers in the Bill to impose terms and conditions.

<a name="40519-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I challenge my noble friend as to whether he would have said what he has just said in Committee were there to be a Tory government. He has asked Ministers to give a legal view on the law in a trade dispute. Frankly, that is preposterous; it is a recipe for disaster. We are not qualified; the courts are there for that. The legal framework was secured years ago and we cannot go down that route. That is why he received the considered Written Answer that he did. This is not a fruitful area.

</p>

<a name="40519-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>As to the amendment itself, my noble friend wants to make it clear that the Secretary of State could not make an order that in any way interferes with actions in any future trade disputes. We do not believe there is a need for such a &quot;safeguard&quot;, as my noble friend would call it. The powers granted in Clause 22 allow the Secretary of State to intervene where the authority fails to adhere to the national framework. This national framework sets out the objectives and priorities for the fire and rescue authorities; it does not dictate procedures that an authority should follow during a trade dispute or industrial action. Hence the powers could not be used to intervene in the way in which a trade dispute is conducted, unless the process is specified in the framework.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Should any of the key modernisation measures set out in the framework become the reason for an industrial dispute, the fire and rescue authority concerned will be wholly responsible for reaching an agreement with its employees. I have already said that if the fire and rescue authority fails, or is likely to fail, to implement a change that is key to providing an efficient and effective fire and rescue service, the Secretary of State must have the right to intervene whatever the reason for such failure.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The amendment would create a danger&#151;I use the word with caution&#151;that a trade union could prevent the Secretary of State from exercising his powers to intervene on a particular issue simply by registering it as a point for dispute. That cannot be right, and I cannot see how my noble friend would argue that that would be right. The Secretary of State has been democratically elected, is answerable to the elected House of Commons and it is his duty to safeguard the interests of the public. In a way, the amendment that way round would give a trade union the power to interfere on an arbitrary basis with the exercising of the Secretary of State&#039;s power.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I should make it clear that the Bill does not affect the position of individual firefighters to take industrial action nor any protection from dismissal that that may attract. This is not the previous Bill.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>There are other issues on other clauses to which we will come later. We are only on Clause 22 but, for example, Clause 29 ensures that public safety can be protected during strike action. So we do not need these powers in that respect. However, while Clause 29 ensures that public safety can be protected during specific periods of strike action, ensuring that a fire and rescue authority is efficient and effective at all times enhances the service that the public receive and protects public safety in the long term, and these powers are important in that respect.
</p>

<a name="40519-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I want to make it abundantly clear, again, that the Bill does not affect the position of individual firefighters in taking industrial action, nor any of the protections from dismissal that taking industrial action may attract.

<a name="40519-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I should like to ask the Minister a question. I noted that he stressed that there are no powers in this Bill to impose terms and conditions. If that is so, why is it not possible to accept an amendment, although perhaps not the one before noble Lords, which states that on the face of the Bill? My noble friend knows full well that there has been a great deal of suspicion among fire service employees about the intentions of the Government. If something were put in the Bill stating that there are no powers under this clause to impose terms and conditions, that would be helpful.
<a name="time_7"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40519-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   That would be a disaster. If those who are suspicious are saying to their members that there are powers in this Bill that allow such action to be taken, it is up to them to point out where they are set out. I am saying that there is nothing of that kind in the Bill. By putting into the Bill words to say that there are no such powers would just cause confusion and add to the festering sore that is out there now.

</p>

<a name="40519-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>There are no grounds for suspicion. No one in any position&#151;rank and file, paid official or parliamentarian&#151;can point to anything in this Bill which states that pay and conditions are affected or could be imposed. That cannot happen because it is not in the Bill. To start talking about it simply confuses the issue. It is the kind of obfuscation on which poor quality leadership thrives in these circumstances. People become confused. There are no grounds for confusion. We want precision and clarity here. I repeat: there are no powers in this Bill to impose terms and conditions about pay and working conditions for firefighters and that is it, period.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40519-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I am afraid that it is not. Earlier the Minister praised Clause 22 for its clarity. But that clarity lies in not saying things. Clause 22(2) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;For the purpose of securing that the authority acts in accordance with the Framework the Secretary of State may by order require&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>It does not say that when the Secretary of State requires that something is or is not done that it will have no impact at all on existing conditions or contracts of employment. It is silent on that. The Secretary of State may make an order. We do not have the slightest idea what effect that will have on existing conditions of employment and on contracts of employment.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>If, in order to come into line with such an order, an authority decides that it must change the conditions of employment, and if the workers involved say that they will not take any notice of the change and use industrial action and the employer then dismisses them, he would be doing so because he had not read what the Minister has said in Parliament today. But the boys and the girls would then be out on the stones. They would go to a tribunal. The tribunal would decide whether the protected action under the 1992 <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC368"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC368</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Act works or does not work. I agree with my noble friend. No one can predict what the tribunal would say in those circumstances, and it certainly is not specified on the face of the Bill. That is my response to the first set of arguments made against my amendment.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The second response is this. The Minister said that it could not conceivably be the case, because he has been said so many times that the current protections in the 1992 Act are not affected. The right to strike in respect of the previous Bill and this one remains inviolate. My noble friend has said so. If that is not pronouncing what the law is, I do not know what it is. The Minister is telling us what the law is here.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>During the previous Bill we said over and over again that the problem was that there is no way of telling what the law says. You can read the statute, but you do not know what the judges would make of it; no one could. Now my noble friend says that it will be perfectly all right on the night. But when I ask him whether he will write to the authorities, if a situation arises under Clause 22, telling them what he has told Members of this Committee, he says that he cannot do that. It is ridiculous: my noble friend can tell us, but he cannot tell them.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I suggest that we have not had a complete answer to this point. We shall return to it at a later stage. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a final attempt on the issue of consultation, which we have already discussed. As I said, it is surprising that there is not much wider reference to consultation in this part of the Bill. I note what the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said in reply to the previous amendments. However, with respect, the situation here is not the same as that which applies in local government. We are talking about extreme circumstances where it may be necessary in a crisis to have the full co-operation of everybody available, particularly at the surface. The amendment would provide that the powers specified in subsection (2) are for use only after consultation with the persons specified in Clause 21(5). I beg to move.

We shall have plenty of opportunity to return to the issue later in the Bill or at other stages. As she said, her amendment relates to Amendment No. 86, to which my noble friend Lord   Bassam responded. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult fire and rescue authorities and their representatives, those who represent employees of fire and rescue authorities and other persons he considers appropriate.

</p>

<a name="40519-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>It is worth repeating on the record that we intend to exercise our intervention powers in line with the Local government intervention protocol, which has already been agreed between the Government and the Local <br>&nbsp;<br>

Government Association. The protocol sets out a procedure for consulting the authority and the Local Government Association prior to direct intervention by central government&#151;it is important to note that it is prior to direct intervention. The process allows the authority ample time to make representations and to hold discussions with central government. It is the authority&#039;s responsibility to represent the views of its employees within the process. We see no need to set up   a separate system for consulting employee representatives, as my noble friend asked, when there is no precedent for doing so in local government and when the fire and rescue authority should be amply equipped to represent and reflect the views of its employees.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Extensive consultation with those outside the fire and rescue authorities concerned could delay the resolution of the problems experienced by that authority. Since the fire and rescue authorities are responsible for delivering a vital emergency service to the public, any delay in resolving problems affecting that service must be avoided. The local government intervention protocol sets out a clear procedure, which has already been agreed, that must be followed should it be necessary to intervene. We would rather rely on that process, which has been agreed, discussed and thought through, rather than set up a new process for one part of local government, albeit a very important part: the fire and rescue authorities.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>The noble Lord said: As the Minister said, we have not come to the end of the debate. The amendment provides a solution to the problems raised in the debate that we have had over the past half-an-hour or so. I shall read from my notes but, of course, they were written before we had that discussion. I should say from the very start&#151;and repeat&#151; that I think this is a solution because, although it does not go as far perhaps as the legislation wants to go, it goes further than the protocols of intervention to which a great deal of reference has been made. The Minister referred to them many times, but now wants to go a lot further.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Amendment No. 91 is designed to qualify the Secretary of State&#039;s power to intervene in the operation of a fire and rescue authority under the powers granted to him under Clause 22, which we have just discussed. Under that clause the Secretary of State may direct a fire and rescue authority precisely how to act or not to act if he believes that it is failing, or likely to fail, to comply with the Fire and Rescue National Framework.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>These are intervention powers that are over and above the sanctions under the best-value regime enshrined in the Local Government Act 1999, which also apply to fire and rescue authorities by virtue of Clause 23. As drafted, they are wide-ranging powers of intervention. In our view, the ability to intervene gives the Secretary of State far too much power <i>vis-&#224;-vis </i>what are supposed to be local, community-based organisations delivering services to, and accountable to, the local community.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>The proposed new clause simply requires the Secretary of State to provide some codification of the   circumstances and the manner in which he will make orders under Clause 22, and the circumstances and the manner in which he will issue directions under any of the many provisions allowing him to do so in a Bill that places huge powers in his hands.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Subsection (2) of the proposed new clause requires the Secretary of State to specify who he will consult, an issue that was discussed several times during the debates on earlier amendments. It does not require him to provide an exhaustive list of individuals or organisations. The subsection requires the Secretary of State instead to define the classes of persons and, critically, to specify any other codes or agreements to which he will have regard before intervening.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Finally, new subsection (3) specifies the authorities and recognised organisations representing employees which must be consulted on the code before it is issued by the Secretary of State. Again, this issue was referred to recently.
</p>

<a name="40519-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The new clause proposes a modest limitation on a wide power of intervention and seeks to ensure that it is used as expected by fire and rescue authorities, is not arbitrary and does not become an alternative or loophole for avoiding established intervention procedures.

I repeat, what is on the face of the Bill seems to go further than the agreed code of intervention. I am suggesting, if you like, an improvement on the Government&#039;s side of the current code of intervention. It does not give the Secretary of State as much power as it seems he would like in the legislation, but gives him more than is in the current code of intervention, which is mainly related to CPAs. It is related to other matters, such as audits of accounts and so on, but it is mainly related to CPA processes. As the Minister said, every fire and rescue authority will have a CPA in 2005, so we will know how good or bad they are after the CPA processes next year.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>We have been looking at the code of intervention again as we have been discussing the Bill. It is very much based on the CPA processes. We are trying to provide an alternative which is stronger than the current code of intervention.

<a name="40519-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I shall look with interest at what happens if and when the Local Government Association comes forward with a proposal. I want to make it clear again, because it is important on each amendment, that the Government will exercise the intervention powers in the clause in line with the local government intervention protocol. I am happy to repeat that commitment.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The intervention protocol covers the use of existing intervention powers across all local authority services, as agreed with stakeholders and published. The protocol was developed through the framework for partnership signed in November 1997 by the Deputy Prime Minister on behalf of the Government, and the chairman of the Local Government Association on behalf of the local authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The protocol provides: for a sufficient evidence base before any action is taken; that the form and extent of intervention reflects the type and seriousness of failure and the need for effective improvement; for, other than in cases of urgency, a process of agreement with the authority on how it will address any service failure in the first instance; for the use of intervention powers only if the process fails to deliver the required improvement; and for consultation with the authority concerned on any proposed directions.

</p>

<a name="40519-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>In exercising the powers in Clause 22 and elsewhere&#151;reserve powers and last-resort powers&#151;we are committed to following the protocol, which already covers the existing powers to intervene in fire and rescue authorities contained in the Local Government Act. I take what the noble Lord said in response to my earlier comment, but frankly we do not think it sensible to produce a separate protocol for the powers in the Bill, which would mirror the existing provisions agreed with local government. The protocol is out there; it is all <br>&nbsp;<br>

agreed&#151;signed, sealed and delivered&#151;and can be used in the circumstances. We do not see the need to put another version of it, however it is dressed up, in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40519-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I should declare an interest in the code, because I was Jeremy Beecham&#039;s vice-chairman of the LGA when it was signed. I was obviously well aware of the code on intervention. Of course, I am no longer directly associated with the LGA; I am far too busy doing other things.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>We honestly believe that the Bill goes further than what was agreed in the LGA code, and that the Secretary of State is taking interventionist powers beyond what are generally agreed in the local government world. That is why we tabled an alternative to give the Secretary of State some of the powers that he wants, and a spelling-out of his consulting and so on. We have spent a lot of time on that. I do not think that we are going to get much further today. We will have to come back to the issue at a later stage, as everyone has some disquiet about this part of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 92 would amend Clause 23, replacing the reference to compliance in Clause 21(7) with a reference to the authority discharging its functions under Clauses 6 to 9. We have discussed that issue several times; Members of the Committee will recognise that it falls in with some of our earlier amendments to Clause 22. The amendment is necessary to ensure that the best-value audit system does not become subservient to the draconian and unhappy powers granted to the Secretary of State under the previous two clauses.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The amendment would mean that authorities would be subject to the best-value regime, not in terms of compliance with whatever the Secretary of State dreams up for the framework, which may be inappropriate for the needs of the local community, but according to the much more important question of whether they are discharging their statutory functions in relation to fire, road traffic accidents, fire safety or any other duties that the Secretary of State might prescribe under Clause 9.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>This should not be a controversial amendment. Surely the best-value regime should audit the core services that fire and rescue authorities actually provide, rather than the centralist vision and priorities of the Secretary of State. Without this amendment, the credibility of the best-value regime will be seriously undermined. The concepts of local accountability and value for money for the services that matter will become meaningless.

He seeks to remove the provision that the Audit   Commission can consider the extent to which authorities have regard to the national framework as part of the best-value process. He would replace that by a duty to monitor the discharge of the core functions of the fire and rescue authorities. The amendment would, in effect, render Clause 23(1) redundant.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The comprehensive performance assessment for fire and rescue authorities, currently being piloted by the Audit Commission, will deliver an independent assessment of the effectiveness of all the functions of fire and rescue authorities. The outcome of that process will be a matter of public record. I am not saying this in a nitpicking way&#151;it is not a substantive argument&#151;but the amendment could even have the effect of limiting the Audit Commission&#039;s current powers to inspect, as at the moment it can inspect in relation to all functions of a fire and rescue authority, not merely the core functions as set out in Clauses 6 to 9.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The amendment could also mean that the best-value inspections would not necessarily cover the extent to which authorities had regard to the national framework. As I have already said, the framework will play a crucial role in driving modernisation and therefore improving the service. It is important that that be reflected in the inspection process and the comprehensive performance assessment, otherwise the effect of the framework will be somewhat diluted.
</p>

<a name="40519-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>It is probably the amendment&#039;s purpose to reduce the availability of relevant evidence to support the use of the powers in Clause 22. We were not born yesterday; that was already written down. I suspect that those comments are not assurances, but the amendment undermines what we have just spent two hours debating. Clause 22 is a last-resort clause, not a first-resort or second-resort clause. I read out a set of areas from which evidence would come; the amendment would dilute that. I hope that the noble Lord will not pursue his amendment at this stage.

<a name="40519-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I also asked about the ODPM Committee and the performance indicators in relation to risk management. I realise that he might not have that answer now.

<a name="40519-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I apologise. I have the answer here; as the noble Lord asked, I put out my left hand. We are reviewing the best-value performance indicators in partnership with the practitioners. We are looking at what contribution the performance indicators can make to understanding performance in all aspects of the fire and rescue authority&#039;s work, including the integrated risk management plans that it is required to make. I am happy to come back to that at a later stage.

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC375</b><br>&nbsp;<br>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 24 is critical. In it, we get the periodic report of the Secretary of State to Parliament. The clause states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State must from time to time report to Parliament on&#151;</p>

</p>

<a name="40519-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>We would like to add to that, at line 9 on page 12,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;the extent to which the costs and savings of modernisation are likely to balance over the Spending Review period 2003&#150;06&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Members of the Committee might wonder where the amendment comes from. Why should we think that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;the costs and savings of modernisation are likely to balance over the Spending Review period 2003&#150;06&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>It is because that is what the Government say. If we go back to the Bain report, Sir George was quite unreserved, specific and precise in saying on several occasions that the new system of fire management&#151;the new modernisation proposals&#151;would be self-financing. During the 1960s and 1970s, some of us spent a very great deal of time looking for, working out and studying self-financing productivity deals, and of course we never found one. We found productivity deals that were extremely good, fine and first-class, but they were never quite self-financing, and they certainly were not like that in the public sector. It is very difficult to see how they could be, but we will come to that.
</p>

<a name="40519-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>No one actually said that the new system of modernisation was to be virtually costless, but as it became more fashionable to say something of that sort I asked a number of Written Questions. That is where I got the extent to which,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;costs and savings of modernisation are likely to balance over the Spending Review period 2003&#150;06&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40519-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>On 5 January 2004, at cols. <i>WA15 </i>and <i>WA16 </i>of <i>Hansard</i>, in answer to several questions, I was told a number of things about the cost and savings involved in this new system of fire management. I asked, for example, whether it would be necessary to raise the annual rate of increase in core funding beyond the usual 3 per cent in real terms. The answer was &quot;no&quot;, they did not expect that there would be any need to raise the rate of increase in core funding over the immediate future. Of course, there would have to be some one-off payments, mostly concerned with the new responsibilities, for example, for terrorism. Sums of something like &#163;218 million would have to be put in, and there would be other payments made for the productivity deal. But they were merely one-off, lead-in payments.
<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="40519-36_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40519-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Then came the statement that the Government were convinced that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;Costs and savings of modernisation should balance out over the spending review 2002 period (2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06.)&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/1/04; col. <i>WA 16</i>].</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Of course, it is not clear what that means. Will the Minister tell me what it means? I take it that at the end of the day we have not lost any money. There could still be a deficit, but the balance and the changes in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC376"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC376</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

practices would in fact generate savings, although there would be costs, and in 2006 we should be just about in balance. That would be a miracle. It really would be a wonderful thing, if you think of what has been done in self-financing productivity deals, or just in public ordinances for new schools, universities, the prison service, the police, let alone the railways. No one has ever said that you could have a self-financing reform of this scope and size in the public sector.
</p>

<a name="40519-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>A self-financing deal, in so far as there is such a thing, comes about in the private sector if you can sell more of whatever it is you are selling at a profit. You could probably sell more because you reduced unit costs, and that pays for the whole thing. In the public sector, you cannot do that. You cannot raise money in that way by selling the product. If you do not sell the bulk of the product to the public, you must put money up front; you must expect that the core services funding will rise; and you must hope that the whole thing will not bankrupt you. That is what improving the quality of public services means.
</p>

<a name="40519-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Therefore, I tabled this amendment. I am not trying to be difficult, because it is important that we get into the Bill that this is what the Government&#151;to the best of their ability&#151;think will happen, as a target. The Government like targets. What if it does not balance? What if the same sort of thing happens as seems to happen quite a bit in other forms of the PFI? What happens if it costs rather more money? Will the Government increase the funding? Will the Government introduce cuts? Will the Government say, &quot;we cannot get there by 2006&quot;? The Government may well say that my test is much too crude&#151;never mind, they can improve it. If a provision of this kind was put in the Bill, we would have a kind of target to see how we went, to see if in fact the estimates and expectations of the Government are carried out in practice. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="40519-36_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My noble friend has made it clear that he thinks that Clause 24 should go a bit further than it does. Fire authorities, through the Local Government Association, have said that the pay deal will balance over the spending review 2002 period. The Government&#039;s position has always been that any pay increase above existing provision must be funded from efficiency savings. We do not think that a report on efficiency savings in the Bill is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40519-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The national framework will give details of the efficiency savings arising from the modernisation process and the framework will be available to Parliament. There is no need for another, additional, reporting process over those specifically set out in Clause 24. Also, as I am sure noble Lords are aware, the Audit Commission is conducting a verification exercise in two phases which is intended to confirm that the intended benefits from modernisation, including efficiency savings, are being delivered locally. This study was requested by the employers as part of the national pay settlement.
</p>

<a name="40519-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Phase one of the Audit Commission&#039;s verification work has already been published. The second phase is due to report in the summer. I suggest that these <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC377"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC377</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reporting procedures already provide an appropriate mechanism through which these issues should be measured and made public. The Local Government Association said that efficiency savings were available, as did the Bain report. At paragraph 12.22 it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;We are confident that within the foreseeable future, benefits will more than exceed additional costs, including those of the pay increases we have proposed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>In effect, my noble friend will get what he seeks. I do not argue that it is not legitimate to seek it. Having heard what has been said by Sir George Bain and the Local Government Association, he will get it via the work of the Audit Commission. Indeed, he will get it faster this way than if it were provided for on the face of this Bill.

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="40519-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I am glad about that and I look forward to seeing the work of the Audit Commission. However, the problem is that a number of key terms tend not to be defined. As the Minister said, it is perfectly true that when the Government talk in this way they frequently assert that the pay deal will balance, as will labour costs. We have been told that the reason why it will balance is because there is a turnover rate among firemen of 4 per cent a year. If it can be reduced to 2 per cent, it will balance. But we have not quite been told how services are going to be extended while reducing the total labour force. But at least, it is said, the pay deal will balance over the period, although I still think that that is ambitious.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>But I did not read the answer to my Written Question as being just about pay. It concerned the costs and savings of modernisation, which is not just pay and work arrangements; it covered everything. The Government have said that certain sums of money will be allocated to deal with the problems of terrorism. Will all that balance? I do not know. New   buildings and new equipment will be needed, and sums are to be put aside for those. But, when the Government say that the extent to which the costs and savings of modernisation are likely to balance, it is very unclear how far they are moving out from pay deal balancing to all the other things that will be balancing because they will generate income. I should have thought that a formula rather more sophisticated than the simple one I introduced would have been useful in enabling Parliament to concentrate its mind on how the reform process is going. But we are not to have it, so we await the publications which may inform us in other ways. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>Page 12, line 13, after &quot;returns&quot; insert &quot;reasonably&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 25 deals with the information that the fire and rescue authority might be required to supply to the Secretary of State. Clauses 25 to 27 fall under the heading &quot;Supervision&quot;. Clause 25 obliges the fire and rescue service to submit various <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC378"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC378</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reports and returns to the Secretary of State. I accept that some information must be available centrally, but I hope that only data that are absolutely required will be collected under the clause.

</p>

<a name="40519-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The Explanatory Notes give examples of sensible, unexceptional and acceptable information that the Secretary of State can collect, such as numbers of deaths and casualties as a result of fire, which would be useful information. However, the Bill gives the Secretary of State a wide power, so Amendment No.   95 would require a fire and rescue authority to submit only those reports and returns that he reasonably requires. In effect, the point of the amendment is to try to establish what reports the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to require.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>That is important, because in all sorts of areas of   government there are increasing demands for information and returns. On reading them it seems that the only people who could benefit from them are the bureaucrats; nobody else could make any sense of them. It seems important that when a report is requested, only the most relevant information should be required.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Amendment No. 96, which is included in the same group, would delete paragraph (b), which appears entirely redundant. Any information that the Secretary of State requires could be obtained through the requirement to make a report or return to him. Therefore, paragraph (b) could be used to seek lots of new information on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from individual authorities, placing additional burdens of form-filling on fire authorities and distracting them from their real job.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Perhaps the Minister could shed light on what will be required, particularly on the basis of ensuring that this is the minimum information required to keep some centralised supervision. I beg to move.

<a name="40519-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I was listening to the noble Baroness, but I was also going through my notes to clarify several questions. Believe it or not, I could almost describe Clause 25 as a Tory clause; yet the noble Baroness has just sought to rip it apart.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Clause 25 is a restatement of Section 230 of the Local Government Act 1972, which covers local authority reports, returns and information. It restates the section virtually verbatim&#151;the 1972 Act refers to &quot;reports to Parliament&quot;. The purpose of the clause is to extend the requirement to all fire and rescue authorities&#151;combined fire and rescue authorities are not covered by the 1972 Act. That is the point at issue. In other words, we are not legislating twice over, as that would be bad practice.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Reports and returns are required from fire and rescue authorities to enable us to evaluate fire and rescue service performance and monitor progress against national and local targets. The importance of such information has been recognised in the Select Committee&#039;s recent report into the fire and rescue service. We always work closely with the authorities when designing reports and returns to be completed by them. There is no intention to create work for bureaucrats, as the noble Baroness suggested. We have established a new institutional framework where the concerns of the service can be resolved.

</p>

<a name="40519-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The clause follows the wording in Section 230 of the Local Government Act 1972. To introduce the concept of reasonableness would be to put the collection of information about fire and rescue on a different basis   from the collection of other information by government. I will repeat this, as it is important: it is implicit that the Secretary of State must act reasonably and that his requests must be reasonable. We have no evidence that the wording of the Local Government Act 1972 has not worked satisfactorily to date and, therefore, we have no reason to change it. With apologies for my little tease to the noble Baroness, I hope that she will not pursue her attempt to emasculate this Tory clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40519-37_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   Before the noble Baroness responds, I wish to ensure that my noble friend and I have followed the Minister&#039;s response correctly. Is he saying that combined fire and rescue authorities must submit reports and returns to the Secretary of State but that non-combined, old-style authorities are subject to the 1972 Act, under which they must submit reports and returns to Parliament? There is a substantial difference between Parliament and the Secretary of State.

</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40519-37_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The answer is yes and no. That is a terrible thing for a Minister to say, is it not? Although I do not have the precise wording, the difference is that the 1972 legislation referred to Parliament and the Secretary of State, not Parliament or the Secretary of State. The noble Baroness is quite right; the fire authorities are covered by the 1972 legislation. That is one of the reasons, when we started to debate the Bill, that we said that a lot of it was transposing legislation. Changing to fire and rescue authorities changed the status, which is why we need the clause. We are not in any way diminishing reports to Parliament. The wording has been lifted from the Local Government Act 1972, save for the point about Parliament.

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>That information is absolutely fascinating. I cannot say that I delved into the 1972 Act and that this sprung out as something that was missing from the Fire Services Act 1947. However, I am bound to say that it makes me very nervous. I do not think that in 1972 the Tory government would have been seeking anything like the amount of information that is now required by   the Government, with all their targets and performance regimes. It would be interesting to compare what reports came through in 1972 with what is now required under the Government&#039;s performance regime.

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 26 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40519-37_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   In speaking to Clause 26 stand part, I shall speak also to Clause 27 stand part. We have covered a great deal of this ground before, but I would like to see if we can mop up questions about the different inspection regimes, interventions and so on that the Bill covers.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I have already said, but it is worth repeating, that we do not at all suggest that authorities&#039; performance is a matter of no consequence. We all depend on the fire and rescue services, and we understand the need for the Secretary of State to have the power to hold an inquiry into a major incident or the response to an incident, which is part of Clause 26. I know that these two clauses replace Sections 33 and 24 of the 1947 Act, but they come at a time when we have as a background, as we have been saying all afternoon, a different regime. We have the best value regime. In 1947 not only was best value not even a gleam in the eye of the Secretary of State, nor was the concept of achieving value for money. I do not even know whether the Secretary of State who was responsible for introducing best value was even born then. Things have changed very much.
</p>

<a name="40519-37_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>In the Commons, when the clauses were debated, the Minister gave assurances that the inspectorate would not duplicate the work of the Audit Commission. That still left me a bit unclear as to how those two bits fit in with Section 22. I understand from the debate in the Commons that the inspectors report to the Secretary of State; that must be the case. Certainly, it was explained that they are independent, but will be based in the ODPM. I cannot resist saying that I noted too that the Minister there said that he expected the inspectorate to operate with greater efficiency and effectiveness. I am sure that he really wants economy too.

</p>

<a name="40519-37_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The inspectors&#039; reports, as I picked up from that debate, are apparently to contribute to the Government&#039;s formulation of policies and decision making, but I am not clear whether the reports are public. Does the Minister have anything to add to the explanations that he has given about the interrelationship of the different regimes? Perhaps he can flesh it out a bit more for me.

<a name="40519-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I will deal with Clauses 26 and 27 together, as they are grouped and they are complementary. As the noble Baroness said, Clause 26 replaces the existing provision for holding inquiries under Section 33 of the 1947 Act. It should also be read in conjunction with Clause 55, which provides powers in relation to inquiries. The Secretary of State may <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC381"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC381</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

establish an inquiry into the performance of a fire and rescue authority in respect of any of its functions or the circumstances leading to or handling of a particular incident for which it has functions under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>While the Secretary of State has never used his powers under the 1947 Act, they remain important. The powers under Clause 26(a) complement those available to the Secretary of State under best value, which is Section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999, to require a local inquiry into the exercise by a local authority of specified functions. Fire and rescue authorities are subject to best value, but as we previously discussed, their responsibilities go wider, for example, with regard to the objectives of the national framework. Clause 26(a) ensures that the Secretary of State has power to consider how a fire and rescue authority is discharging all of its functions.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness understands the case for the Secretary of State to inquire into the circumstances of a fire, road traffic accident or emergency or into how a fire and rescue authority dealt with an incident, to understand and learn about an event that may have had tragic consequences for firefighters or the wider public. Clause 27 re-enacts Section 24 of the Fire Services Act 1947, and gives power to appoint inspectors and assistant inspectors, in order to obtain information about the way in which authorities are discharging their fire and rescue functions and about technical matters relating to the service. It provides that those appointed under the 1947 Act continue to be inspectors. The inspector provides a valued source of technical and professional advice to the Government, which it is vital to maintain as we modernise the fire and rescue service.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The White Paper, <i>Our Fire and Rescue Service</i>, made clear that the work of the inspectorate would be refocused and redirected to support the process of quality assurance and service improvement. It would be intended, first, to provide professional advice to government on good practice, operational and technical issues and on developing leaders of the future; and, secondly, to provide operational and technical advice to the Audit Commission in its new inspection function. As such, the two clauses are justified. As I have said, the powers have been there since 1947 and have never been used, but it is important that they remain in the modern framework of the new fire and rescue authorities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40519-38_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I wonder whether the Minister could say something about the relative costs of the inspections. This was discussed when these clauses were debated in another place. At that time, the Under-Secretary, Phil Hope, said that he did not have any figures. He could write with figures as to what the inspections cost now, but he was unable to talk very much about future costs, because they were having discussions in the coming months. I wonder whether the Minister could give us some indication of the relative costs, because the new inspectorate with a different focus will be working quite closely with the <br>&nbsp;<br>

Audit Commission. When one reads it, one wonders whether this will actually cost more than it would have done originally.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40519-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I do not know about that comment. The work of the inspectorate is being redirected and refocused. As a result of the transfer to the Audit Commission, there will be a reduction in staffing levels&#151;there is no question about that. In future, the smaller team will be providing independent advice and   guidance on the issues that I have raised on professional, operational and technical matters. As I say, the change in focus will result in a smaller and, we hope, highly efficient inspectorate with a different set of skills as envisaged by the independent review. The change in tasks and focus makes it difficult to provide before-and-after financial figures.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I will certainly take advice on this for the next stage. I will write to colleagues in the mean time if I can. It is a legitimate point, but given the nature of the change and refocus of the inspectorate, and the changes that the Audit Commission is making, I will see if it is possible to put something on paper before the next stage. If I fail, I will certainly have a better answer at the next stage than I have today.

<a name="40519-38_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I wonder if I could just ask one question. It has arisen as a result of this discussion so I am only just seeking an answer. It relates to the 1947 Act.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>A lot of legislation on liability has come into being since 1947, both EU legislation and our own legislation. What happens if the Secretary of State sets up an inquiry under the Local Government Act into a major incident, and someone or some authority was found wanting under that inquiry, because someone was not performing their job properly or went off and did something else, and as a result liability fell on that person? In 1947, I dare say that that would not have come on to a personal liability basis. I wonder what the implication as a result of other legislation might be on any inquiry held under paragraph (b), and whether there is a comparable situation, under the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>In local government, normally if there are planning inquiries or major infrastructure inquiries under the local government legislation, they would not be delving into why something had gone seriously wrong in the management of a major fire, where someone was killed and someone had acted with less than the greatest diligence. I am sure that that may not be happening, but I would like to know, if I could, if there has been anything since 1947 that might change the tenor of paragraph (b).

<a name="40519-38_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   moved Amendment No. 97:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>Page 13, leave out lines 1 and 2 and insert &quot;necessary for the protection of public safety&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 28 allows the Secretary of State to provide equipment and services to fire authorities, to require their use and to require them to pay for their use. The question I wish to explore is the basis upon which the ODPM will charge for those services. Will it either be purely cost recovery or will there be a profit element? The provisions have the potential to erode the autonomy of the fire and rescue authorities.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Concern arises when we come to the provisions in the clause which allow the Secretary of State to charge for the use of the equipment that he provides. Further, the clause raises important questions as to whether the service is to be a local service, a national service or a regionally dictated service. We believe that entering into such a scheme should be because it promotes public safety, rather than only economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The power that the Secretary of State will have under the clause is a major intervention in the autonomy of authorities. It can be justified on the grounds of public safety but it is the authority&#039;s council tax payers, not the Secretary of State, who should be driving the agenda of efficiency and effectiveness. We believe that saving lives&#151;we can see, to some extent, where this is coming from&#151;is more important than saving cash.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Amendment No. 97 is designed to focus the Government&#039;s mind on the stated public safety agenda. The clause constrains the Secretary of State to central procurement and provision of equipment only when it is in the interest of promoting economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The amendment would substitute a reference to public safety. That would cover the circumstances in which the Secretary of State needs to provide equipment to deal with the threat of an unconventional terrorist attack, for example, because it would clearly be in the interests of public safety to have such equipment purchased and made available.

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>It is not obvious whether the provision of routine fire appliances, purchased by the Secretary of State and made available to authorities which are required to use them, is in the interests of public safety. The Secretary of State may think that it is in the interests of economy, efficiency and effectiveness for him to decide everything, but that is a matter of judgment.
</p>

<a name="40519-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Amendment No. 98 repeats the same intentions in relation to subsection (2) of the clause, substituting reference to public safety and giving symmetry with Clause 29, which specifically allows the exercise of powers only in the interests of public safety.

</p>

<a name="40519-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Amendment No. 103 adds another ground on which the Secretary of State can act&#151;the effective discharge of the functions conferred on an authority under Clause 9. The Secretary of State will confer functions under the clause in relation to dealing with the anti-terrorist response. It will give Ministers an opportunity to confirm that organisations will be established and forced upon fire and rescue authorities only where that is in the interests of public safety, or where they are related to the response to unconventional threats. I beg to move.

<a name="40519-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   These are interesting amendments. They get to the heart of procurement and the ways in which we can improve the quality of procurement. Looking at noble Lords opposite, I am thinking of examples of good procurement practice in the public sector, particularly in local authorities. When I was leader of Brighton council, we used to look at the nice, glossy Kent County Council brochures that offered to sell us everything at a reasonable price. I was an admirer of the service that they provided generally to local government. They provided sensible means of procurement and good value for money. It is an important issue.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>As the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 97 would allow the Secretary of State to provide only such equipment, facilities and services as were necessary for the protection of public safety, narrowing the range of the Secretary of State&#039;s discretion and ability to intervene. Amendment No. 98 would allow the Secretary of State to establish or maintain an organisation or contribute to the costs of an organisation for procurement only where necessary for the protection of public safety and the effective discharge of the new duties under Clause 9.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>It would be helpful if I clarified that Clause 28 is essentially concerned with ensuring that the fire and rescue service has the tools to do the job effectively. Unlike many of the other clauses that we have discussed, it is not about how the service discharges its functions. It is therefore not appropriate to specify public safety as a requirement. However, we must take into account the overall economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the fire and rescue service, particularly its impact on local council tax payers.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The Bain review concluded&#151;unsurprisingly&#151;that procurement was one area where significant improvements could be achieved, if authorities joined together to pool requirements and expertise. The others were the amalgamation of control rooms; outsourcing or collaboration arrangements for vehicle <br>&nbsp;<br>

maintenance; and the rationalisation of management and support costs. The review suggested that combined savings reaching &#163;42 million over three years could be achieved.

</p>

<a name="40519-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>The current procurement arrangements for the provision of equipment and services specific to the service are often inefficient, due to the small scale on which they are carried out. Fire and rescue authorities can collaborate to develop standard specifications, reduce specialist administration costs and place bulk orders. However, that potential has been significantly underexploited, despite efforts over the past decade to achieve improvements. That has led to important equipment, such as breathing apparatus, not being standardised throughout the service. As well as having cost implications, it creates problems of interoperability.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>It is not acceptable for that to continue. One option is to establish a single organisation to be responsible for providing fire and rescue service-specific equipment and services. The Government are working closely with the service and the Local Government Association to establish what that would involve and how it could best be done.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>We are well aware that the fire and rescue service has a great deal of expertise on the equipment necessary to carry out its job effectively. I reassure the Committee that the service will be involved at an early stage of any procurement exercise. That has been the case with the New Dimension programme and the Firelink radio project and will be the case with the control rooms project.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>It is not our intention to procure centrally every item of equipment needed by the fire and rescue service. Goods and services that are not specific to the service will be procured locally to ensure that the economies of scale that are available through bulk ordering and   reducing bureaucratic processes are on a regional basis. We are working with the LGA to establish regional centres of excellence in procurement to help deliver improved processes and practices.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I hope that I have allayed some of the noble Baroness&#039;s concerns about autonomy and central direction. We are trying to create some efficiencies, not undermine local accountability, which we greatly value. We recognise the role that the fire authorities will play in that exercise. Having some central provision for procurement is sensible and will be good use of the money that fire authorities have at their disposal for improving the quality of equipment and ensuring, in particular, that the New Dimension programme is successful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="40519-39_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I am quite often baffled by the legislation that comes before us, but I am bound to say that I am completely bewildered how we get centralist procurement provision out of Clause 28. Are the Government saying that there could be a requirement under it for authorities to join together and promote or buy, as the most economic way because that is how it is beneficial to procure? If so, I am completely bewildered about how they get that from the clause. It goes without saying that it makes sense to do proper <br>&nbsp;<br>

and efficient procurement and get the benefit of operating through one contractor for a whole lot of services. However, so far as I can see, the clause says that the Secretary of State can decide that he might provide a bit of the equipment, or might not, and will then charge everyone for it. How that comes into centralised procurement, I simply do not know.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>If the provision were a way of making economic efficiency in purchasing&#151;perhaps for equipment&#151;that would be required only on a rare occasion when there were a number of contractors and it was easier to get one involved for all the services, I would accept that. However, the subsection needs a bit of amendment if that is what it means. I cannot really respond any further, because the subsection clearly does not mean what we thought. I would like to take further advice before we return to it at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_125"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 99 to 101 are grouped together. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State will be able to require authorities to use equipment, facilities and services provided by him or by an organisation created and maintained by him. He will be able to require authorities to pay for the use of that equipment.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Amendment No. 99 is therefore a probing amendment designed to press the Minister to bring greater clarity on what so far is a rather vague area. Some of the information comes back to what we were talking about. How will charges be set? Will they be set on a cost-recovery basis, as fire and rescue authorities will be limited to doing when charging others for services under Clause 19? Indeed, perhaps the Minister will give some indication of what the Secretary of State actually intends to be able to charge for. At the moment it is simply not clear.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Amendment No. 100 is probing in nature. It would insert, at the end of subsection (3)(b), &quot;under subsection (2)&quot;. On first reading the Bill, I assumed that organisations established or maintained by the Secretary of State for which charges may be imposed on fire authorities under subsection (3)(b) would in every case be those established under subsection (2).
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Amendment No. 101 is simply designed to bring greater clarity and transparency to the process involved in Clause 28 by widening the scope of those individuals that the Secretary of State must consult before levying such a charge, were such a charge to impact directly on them. Perhaps the Minister will give us some assurance that the powers on charging that the clause would give to the Secretary of State would be used sensibly alongside any consultation process.

I hope that what I said before offered elucidation, and that what I say now will offer further elucidation. I understand the spirit in which the amendment was moved, and it is right to question the basis on which charging can be made.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Amendment No. 99 would require the Secretary of State to make an order if he wanted to charge for the use of equipment or services provided by him. Under Section 22 of the Fire Services Act, the Secretary of State can make equipment available to fire and rescue authorities to purchase, and there was never any suggestion that the price should be set by order. To do so would be unnecessarily bureaucratic. If it were agreed, the amendment would mean that every time the Secretary of State wanted to alter the charge it would require a new order. If we were ever to have something like that, it would be a strange instrument of central planning. That does not seem to be a particularly good use of parliamentary time.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Opposition Members of the Committee may say that the 1947 Act did not give the Secretary of State the power to require a fire and rescue authority to buy from him. However, if the Secretary of State is to require fire and rescue authorities to use equipment under the clause, he must do so by order, whether or not he is levying a charge for that use. Furthermore, he must consult widely before making any such order. The clause makes that clear. We think that that ensures the parliamentary scrutiny that Members of the Committee seek.

</p>

<a name="40519-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Amendment No. 100 specifies that charges may be imposed only for the use of equipment, facilities and services provided by an organisation established or maintained by the Secretary of State under Clause 28(2). I want to reassure the Committee that that is implicit in the clause as drafted, hence Amendment No. 100 is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Amendment No. 101 would specify with whom the Secretary of State should consult before making an order requiring one or more fire and rescue authorities to use and maintain equipment, facilities or services. The Secretary of State would already be required to consult with any persons whom he considers appropriate before making an order under Clause 28. We have been especially careful not to be too prescriptive in defining potential consultees, as it would run the risk of excluding any future persons or groups not mentioned in the Bill with whom a future Secretary of State might want to consult. For that reason, Amendment No. 101 is unnecessary as, in practice, the Secretary of State would seek to consult with all those affected by an order made under Clause   28. I hope that that clarifies the matter and provides reassurance.

Government are funding the procurement of the Firelink radio system and have no intention of charging the fire and rescue services for its provision. Similarly, we funded the purchase of New Dimension equipment to the tune of &#163;188   million, and authorities will not be expected to bear the cost of its use for the New Dimension purposes. However, the Secretary of State needs an option to charge for new services that he might provide in the future.
</p>

<a name="40519-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The other point to clarify is the basis of the charging regime, and I should answer the question about whether there would be full-cost recovery. Fire service circular 7/2002 makes it clear that the Government had committed to funding the Firelink radio system, but indicated that there would be a charge for its use. Any charging regime for Firelink would not be on a full-cost recovery basis, given ministerial commitments in the past on providing the replacement system. Any charging regime for Firelink, or any other centrally provided service, would be established in discussion with the fire and rescue service and the Local Government Association. I think that that covers the noble Baroness&#039;s point about charging; if it does not, I shall listen again to what she has to say on it.

I want now to read what has been said because these two large groups of amendments have begun to flush out exactly what the clauses mean. I want to consider further what the Minister has said and come back at a later stage. Embedded here is the whole question of costs to individual fire authorities and to regional authorities, including what is to be charged for and what the Secretary of State is likely to provide that individual or regional authorities will not provide. There is more to this than I had anticipated at the start. In any event, we shall return to the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_129"></a>The noble Lord said: We are continuing the same trend established in the previous amendments. It appears to us that Clause 29 would give the Secretary of State unprecedented powers to intervene in the running of fire authorities with regard to the disposal of property or facilities. Again, this clause raises serious questions about whether our fire services should be run from a national, Whitehall-based position, or should they be left to those on the ground to decide what is best suited to their own local circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para4"></a>

where there was a legitimate duty on the Government to ensure the continuation of fire and emergency services, we believe that this clause is arguably too powerful and all-encompassing.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Amendment No. 102 would limit use of the powers to the circumstances in which Ministers say that they are needed. It provides for the use by the Secretary of State of the powers in the clause when either a fire authority cannot, or he reasonably expects that it will not be able to, discharge its functions under Clauses 7 to 9 covering fire, road traffic accidents and other emergencies.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Members on this side of the Committee believe that fire and rescue authorities must have the primary responsibility for the discharge of their functions. We have said several times that it is right and proper that the Secretary of State should have the power to intervene when they fail to discharge those functions either because they are incompetent or because something such as a strike prevents them doing so. It is also proper that he should be constrained not to interfere in that way if they are discharging their functions fully and effectively. Without amendment, this clause gives too wide a power of intervention. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40519-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has made clear the intention behind this amendment. It would weaken the ability of the Secretary of State to take action critical to ensuring public safety. I do not say that the noble Lord would put public safety at risk; I do not want to put words in his mouth. But the ability of the Secretary of State to act would be weakened.

</p>

<a name="40519-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Before dealing with the narrow confines of the amendment, I should make clear the purpose of Clause 29. It has been specifically drafted to ensure that in the event of industrial action, the Secretary of State can act swiftly to secure the assets and facilities of fire and rescue authorities. Those are, for example, appliances, aerial platforms and other resources critical to those who may be providing emergency fire and rescue cover.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Noble Lords will recognise, I am sure, that it is the duty of the Government to have public safety at the forefront of their actions. That is why we are seeking the powers in Clause 29 and why we cannot accept Amendment No.   102. I shall explain why.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>As drafted, the amendment would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to demonstrate that a fire and rescue authority is or is likely to become unable to discharge its core operational functions under Clauses 7 to 9. As part of the fire and rescue authorities&#039; duty to make provision for firefighting purposes, they are required to secure the personnel necessary efficiently to meet all normal requirements. Fire and rescue authorities argue that this duty is discharged by the provision of adequate numbers of personnel for their areas and that industrial action by such personnel does not affect this.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>The Committee may recall that we considered the meaning of &quot;normal requirements&quot; when debating the   extent to which fire and rescue authorities must <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC390"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC390</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

make provision for core duties. In previous periods of industrial action, fire and rescue authorities have consistently taken the view that they have discharged their duty to make provision for fighting fires. That was the legal view they took in the most recent industrial dispute.

</p>

<a name="40519-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The purpose of Clause 29 is to remove any uncertainty as to the Secretary of State&#039;s ability to obtain important equipment in the event of possible industrial action. To place an additional obstacle as proposed by Amendment No. 102 would present a real risk that the Secretary of State&#039;s powers to secure crucial resources would be frustrated. The technical legal distinction about whether or not the requirement to make provision for core duties extends to industrial action was debated in another place, where I understand the amendment was withdrawn. Nevertheless, I will repeat the assurance given by the Minister for fire safety, Phil Hope MP, who made clear that the Secretary of State intends to use the powers under Clause 29 only where necessary to ensure public safety in the event of industrial action.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>We hope and expect that, in practice, most if not all fire and rescue authorities will co-operate if their properties or facilities are needed to provide emergency cover. Nevertheless, effective planning for such an eventuality is reliant on the confidence that particular kinds of equipment can be accessed at relatively short notice. This is important for the health and safety of those providing emergency cover and also to ensure the safety of the general public. Amendment No. 102 would remove that assurance and create delay and uncertainty in gaining access to vital equipment. That could result in a reduction in public safety, which we are not prepared to countenance.
</p>

<a name="40519-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>I have spelt out, in unambiguous terms, that Clause 29 is there for a clear and specific purpose; there are no ulterior motives at all. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will agree that many of the points he made are not relevant because of the way we intend to operate Clause 29. That is not a criticism of the noble Lord&#151;he would not have known what I was going to say&#151;but I want to be clear and unambiguous about the purpose of Clause 29 and why it has been drafted in the way in which it has been.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40519-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   As I said in my introduction to the amendment, we accept that the Secretary of State should have those powers in the event of major strike activity or a national emergency. As we see the situation, from the way in which the clause is written the Secretary of State could have the power to intervene locally to close a fire station that the local community wants to keep open. Can the Minister give an unambiguous assurance that that would never happen; that there would never be central intervention to close a local fire station that people wanted to keep open? We feel that this clause might allow that. It has got nothing to do with a national emergency or a strike. The Secretary of State could intervene, say, in Essex and close a fire station in Chelmsford that we felt <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC391"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC391</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as a local community should be there. We feel that the Secretary of State should not have that power. That is the power that we need to clarify.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="40519-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I should like to be able to say quite specifically that the Secretary of State would not do that. I am not saying that fire stations will never close&#151;it would be stupid to say that and I do not think that the noble Lord would expect me to do so&#151;but what I can say is that Clause 29 would not be used to close a fire station. That is a good, clear answer, is it not? Powers under the clause would not be used by the Secretary of State to close a fire station, in Essex or elsewhere.

<a name="40519-40_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I agree that there will be times when the population changes or moves around as towns grow and towns get smaller; in which case we would have to move fire stations. But that should not be imposed by the Secretary of State. Does the Minister agree that there must be local solutions and local discussion and that there should not be a power anywhere in the Bill under which the Secretary of State can impose a fire station closure on a local community that does not want it?

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="40519-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   As I recall, that was one of the issues that we dealt with when we discussed Section 19 of the 1947 Act under the Local Government Bill. Until the Local Government Act 2003, it was the case from 1947 that even if a local fire authority wanted to close a fire station it had to ask the Secretary of State for approval. It was ridiculous central government control and we got rid of it. I can recall the debate now. That is not our purpose and therefore I can give the noble Lord an unambiguous answer.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The Secretary of State is not in a position to do what the noble Lord is talking about under Clause 29. By that I do not mean that there is something buried away in an appendix that gives him the power to do it; as far as I know, there is not. Clause 29 has been created for a specific purpose&#151;this goes back to our earlier debates about the use and disposal of property or facilities&#151;and it cannot be used to close a fire station. The Secretary of State does not want such a power. Indeed, he got rid of the power to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the closure of fire stations. Such a decision should be made by the fire and rescue authority when it has completed the risk management plans for its locality. That is what this is all about. It must take heed of the guidance but make its disposition of resources meet local circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>I can be quite unambiguous in answering the noble Lord. What he suggests cannot be done under Clause   29. The Secretary of State does not want the powers; he released them last year, having had them since 1947, and he does not seek to resurrect them in this Bill.

</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>The noble Lord said: We now enter an important part of this piece of legislation, setting out as it does the machinery on which future pay and conditions will be negotiated and decided. One thing we learned from the   recent dispute was that the system in place was woefully inadequate, unwieldy and unable to cope with the demands of modern pay negotiations. Reform is needed if we are to avoid the tangle in which the Government and employers found themselves in the course of that dispute.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Indeed, so bad did things get that I am reliably informed that the Minister of State, Nick Raynsford, refused point blank to deal with the chairman of the employer&#039;s main fire body, preferring to deal instead with my good colleague and friend, the vice-chairman of the Local Government Association and leader of Kent County Council. There was also that rather unfortunate image of the Deputy Prime Minister being woken in his pyjamas in the early hours of the morning&#151;something that people would probably rather not do&#151;to sort out the mess. Some improvements need to be made in the system, therefore.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The amendments address a possible concern arising from the splitting of responsibilities for England, Wales and Scotland. Amendment No. 104 is a paving amendment for Amendment No. 107, which would require the Secretary of State to establish a negotiating body only when he has reached agreement with the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly to the effect that the negotiating body could negotiate pay and conditions for the fire and rescue service or Scottish fire service employees throughout the whole United Kingdom.

<a name="40519-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The purpose of tabling the amendments, as discussed in the other place, is to highlight a concern felt by fire and rescue authority employers. Previously, there has been a UK-wide approach to the matter, which included Scotland. Under the current negotiating arrangements, the Scottish fire authority employers are represented alongside their English and Welsh counterparts. We need to understand how the Secretary of State would use his powers to impose negotiating machinery if the current negotiations with the national joint council were to fail to agree a new structure.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>We on this side understand that the powers of the Secretary of State would extend only to England. Were the Bill to stand as it is now, the negotiating machinery would relate only to England, with Scotland and Wales having separate machinery. Therefore, we should like to know whether the Minister recognises that concern and intends that there should not be separate national negotiating forms for Wales, England and Scotland. It is a very important issue and one on which I hope the Minister will be able to shed some light. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40519-41_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I hope that I can satisfy the noble Lord. I have a brief response to give him, with a couple of specific answers, but in some respects I regret that I shall not be able to go any wider.

</p>

<a name="40519-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The noble Lord accepts that the negotiating machinery is crucial to the modernisation of the fire and rescue service. The existing negotiating arrangements are currently under review. We hope that the review leads to improved arrangements that meet the needs of the modern fire and rescue service. That is about as far as I can go down that road at this point.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Clause 31 would provide the Secretary of State with reserve powers to establish statutory negotiating bodies for England, should the review fail to deliver sufficient improvements. Amendments Nos. 104 and 107 would ensure that the negotiating body established under this clause would negotiate conditions of service for employees of fire and rescue authorities across Scotland and Wales as well as England.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I accept that the existing negotiation arrangements work on a UK-wide basis. The Government would prefer that to continue. However, if we decide to draw down the powers in the Bill and establish a statutory body, it makes sense for England and Scotland to legislate separately in our own areas of competence. Responsibility for the fire and rescue service is devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland and will be devolved to Wales as part of this Bill, so it is possible over time that our financial and policy positions would diverge. We would not then wish to be bound by statute to negotiate as one body&#151;that is the central point.
</p>

<a name="40519-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>We would prefer UK-wide arrangements to continue. That would be the preference, but it would not be the case over time, so it would not make sense <br>&nbsp;<br>

to be bound by statute to negotiate as one. We would have to return to the matter in primary legislation, which would be unnecessary. I hope that in the context of the noble Lord&#039;s comments on Scotland and England, that is a satisfactory answer at this stage.

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40519-41_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   The Minister said that the Government would prefer to keep Scotland, Wales and England together, and yet the provisions of the Bill set them apart. Most people, certainly in Wales, would prefer to be kept with England. I can see problems with the divergence of Wales, particularly in the borders, and the same with Scotland. That was not a terribly helpful answer. I am pleased that the Minister prefers to keep them together, because that is what most people want. So why can we not find ways to keep them together? I understand that this is devolved, particularly to the Scottish Parliament, but we should be able to find ways somehow to try to keep them together, if that is what people want.

It is the power that he has in Clause 31(1) to decide the persons representing the interests of some or all employees of the fire and rescue service. It says &quot;persons representing the interests&quot;. It does not tell you there who those persons shall be, because that is a matter for the Secretary of State.

</p>

<a name="40519-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>In other words, I go back to a point that I made much earlier today when I tried to emphasise that in several ways the Bill departs from the principle that representatives are chosen by those whom they represent, not imposed or selected by the government. This is the case where, in formal terms, the government could select a particular person, not Mr Gilchrist, but Joe Soap. This is the Joe Soap amendment. We want to get rid of Joe Soap. We want to make it clear that it continues to be the case that the representatives who represent the employees are chosen by them, and if there is a recognised union, they are chosen through the union procedure.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>To do anything else would be to depart from a long line of belief and doctrine. It would be against all ACAS guidance; it would be against the Community charter on social rights; it would be against many ILO conventions to which this country is subject; and I would argue that if you look at it properly, it would be against the directive on information and consultation, of which the Government are in favour. Workers should decide their own representatives, and when they are recognised, they should decide them in their union procedures.

</p>

<a name="40519-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I know that when we talked to the Government about this, they said that we do not understand what is involved. They would not want to say, &quot;Not Mr Andy Gilchrist, but Joe Soap&quot;, because they would not want to specify the individuals. That is not what they mean. Nevertheless, the Bill would allow this Government or a successor administration to do just that. It would enable them to change the very personnel in the negotiations, or to object to particular negotiations.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Again, as I understand it, they are not really concerned about changing the composition in terms of personalities. This is an exercise in representation. Its purpose is to change the single table bargaining that now exists in the service. They want a number of other organisations, ones that are not recognised, to be recognised. If that is what they want, they do not need the law. You do not need a law to recognise another union. Employers are perfectly free to recognise any body they like. They are also free to derecognise, although they should negotiate with those whom they   want to derecognise. If they want to change the bargaining structure by taking out part of the bargaining unit and allocating it to another union, that is a subject for negotiation. It is not a matter for law. There is no law governing that in this country, unless you obtain recognition through the provisions of the 1999 Act. If you do that and then if you want to be derecognised, you can be put back into the system which produced the recognition.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>These things should be decided in the normal way of collective bargaining. I should like the Government to assure me that when they say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;persons representing the interests of some or all employees of fire and rescue authorities&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>that does not mean that they may decide the personnel sitting on the other side. Those on the other side should be chosen by the workers they represent. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="40519-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Generally speaking, employees in the fire service belong to unions, and those unions are recognised by the employers as appropriate to represent their members and to bargain collectively on their behalf. Our amendment recognises the situation as it is and is likely to be for the foreseeable future. It is also the situation so far as other national joint councils are concerned. The employees are represented by nominees of the unions they have decided to join and which are recognised by the employers.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>I understand that the Government have no wish to change that arrangement; indeed, that has been more or less confirmed this evening by my noble friend at the Dispatch Box. Therefore it seems to me that this amendment should be acceptable to the Government because it sets out the current situation and is likely to be for the future. I support the proposal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="40519-42_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I can be brief and specific in response to my noble friends. I can give an assurance that we have no intention of using the power in this clause to specify which individuals would have seats at the negotiating table, but we do want to be able to specify which organisations should be represented. The second key point I need to make regarding Clause 31, which will be the subject of many debates, is that&#151;at the risk of repeating myself&#151;it establishes reserve powers. We would seek to use these powers only if the review of the existing arrangements fails to deliver appropriate improvements. That review is still continuing and we have not, for obvious reasons, decided to use the powers. I think that that answers the point made by my noble friend about Joe Soap. That would be completely out of bounds.

</p>

<a name="40519-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy also asked how a union can represent its members if it has no voice on the national negotiating body. Unions will be able to represent their members effectively whether or not they have a seat on a statutory negotiating body. They will certainly be able to lobby employers and negotiating bodies and, as now, they will be able to call or take industrial action. As was made clear in the reports and the White Paper, it is known that under the current arrangements the Fire Brigades Union is the only employee representative body that sits on the negotiating body for non-principal fire officers. The Bain review recommended that employee representation should be widened, and, as set out in the White Paper, we agreed to that. But that does not mean &quot;widened&quot; in the sense of named individuals&#151;far from it.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>We believe that more diverse representation and employee interest in negotiations is important. However, I do not want to go beyond that, because a voluntary review currently under way is considering how the existing negotiating machinery might be adapted to provide for wider employee representation.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I take the point&#151;I think my noble friend will agree with me&#151;that the voluntary route is best. That is the one we want to work with; that is the one that we want <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC397"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC397</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to succeed. These are reserve powers only if the voluntary route does not produce a settlement agreed by the various bodies concerned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="40519-42_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I am glad to hear the Minister say that. The difficulty is that that is not what is in the White Paper. That is why we have gone into this; that is why I am excited about the Bill. On page 52 of the White Paper, paragraph 7.13 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;We also agree with the Independent Review that a new negotiating body should involve representatives of the Retained Firefighters Union, the Fire Officers Association, and the Association of Principal Fire Officers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>It is true that that is what George Bain said. But he said that it should be negotiated; he did not say, to quote the Minister, if I have got his words right, that they should specify which organisation. It is wrong for the Secretary of State to say that he is going to specify which organisation.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>In support of what he stated at paragraph 52&#151;that he wanted to see, as Bain did, these people negotiating&#151;he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;We see no prospect of such changes being made by agreement. That is why we intend to specify who should be involved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>That is saying, in terms, that if you cannot get agreement, you will impose an agreement.
</p>

<a name="40519-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>I am grateful for what the Minister said. But he has not disavowed page 52 and I shall continue to worry. With those worries surfaced, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40519-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 108A:

</ul>
<p>

&quot;(   )   persons representing the interests of some or all employees of fire and rescue services, such persons being representative of organisations considered by the Secretary of State to be appropriate, and the number of representatives being as considered appropriate by the Secretary of State;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is rather contrary to the previous one because we stress in the amendment the importance of transparency and fairness in the future negotiating machinery process. I noted with interest the amendment tabled in another place by the honourable Member for Tyne Bridge. Indeed it would appear to have been one of those occasions when my honourable friends on our Benches agreed with the Liberal Democrats in the Commons. I hope that I can count on their support today.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The Bain inquiry, the White Paper and the ODPM Select Committee report all identified the problems posed to the retained service by lack of advocacy and the domination of the national joint council by the FBU. Section 7.13 of the White Paper said that it agreed with Bain and that there should be new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC398"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column GC398</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

negotiating bodies, with representatives drawn from the RFU, the Fire Officers Association and the Association of Principal Fire Officers. However, it stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;We see no prospect of such changes being made by agreement. That is why we intend to specify who should be involved . . .  The composition and chair of each body would be determined by the Deputy Prime Minister . . .  we intend to take powers to give guidance to any negotiating body&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40519-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>In short, the amendment would provide the Secretary of State with the opportunity to guarantee that the Retained Firefighters Union&#151;and we all commend the work of the retained firefighters&#151;will have a place at the table to negotiate terms and conditions. It would be strange if, despite working through the recent industrial dispute, it was frozen out of negotiations&#151;almost punished. In some counties, 40 to 50 per cent or more of firefighters are retained firefighters. Can the Minister give us an assurance that the Retained Firefighters Union will, regardless of its size or proportionality, have representation on the NJC? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="40519-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendment would require the Secretary of State to choose the organisations to represent employee interests on a statutory negotiating body from organisations that the Secretary of State considered appropriate. It would also require him to determine the number of employee representatives on the body.

</p>

<a name="40519-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>It is worth reminding the Committee that the Clause   31 powers to establish statutory negotiating machinery are reserve powers. We would use the powers only if the review, which is the thing to focus on, of the existing arrangements failed to deliver appropriate improvements. That review is still going on, and we have not decided whether we would seek to use the powers. The Government believe that, should we decide to use the powers, it would be more appropriate that detailed arrangements be addressed through regulations. The Bill makes it clear that, prior to making regulations, we would consult stakeholders. We hope that the issue that the noble Lord raises would come to fruition in a consultation process.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I must clarify our intention on the issue of employee representation on a statutory negotiating body. Under the current arrangements, the Fire Brigades Union is, as the noble Lord said, the only union that sits on the negotiating body for non-principal fire officers. As we all know, the Bain review, to which the noble Lord referred, recommended that union representation should be widened. We agree. We believe that more diverse representation of employee interests in negotiations is important. Clause 31 would allow us to ensure that the range of voices across the work force was heard at the negotiating table.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>As was made clear in another place, I can also confirm that the Government have no intention of naming the individuals who would represent either the employee or employer side on any new negotiating body. We simply seek powers to make regulations about the organisations that would be involved, not the individuals.

We hope that the process will get us there, and we hope that the current discussions and consultations through the employers will enable that to happen. Obviously, it would be desirable if we could get there through agreement, rather than by using a reserved power.

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="40519-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I must press the Minister a little more on the issue. I repeat what I said: large areas of the country are serviced totally by retained firefighters. It is unfair that they should not be involved.

</p>

<a name="40519-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I thought that I had made it clear that we wanted to get there. The noble Lord knows how sensitive the issues are.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40519-43_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  I would like to inform the House that Ms Penelope Barrett and Mr Alastair MacGregor have been appointed as members of the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Copies of the press release relating to these appointments are available in the House Library.

</p>

<a name="wms_subhd_1"></a>
<a name="40519-43_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Immigration Review</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40519-43_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   This is a report to the House on the Government&#039;s comprehensive review of legal migration schemes, including details on lifting the suspension of visa restrictions in Bulgaria and Romania.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>On 30 March, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced that, as part of this wider review, Ken Sutton had been asked to investigate allegations of abuse of the European Community Association Agreements (ECAA) scheme by nationals from Bulgaria and Romania. At the same time, consideration of all visa and after-entry applications from these countries was suspended.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>From 13 April, the suspension was lifted for the majority of visa applications in Bulgaria and Romania&#151;for business and family visits, and low-risk categories such as official staff. Visa applications remained suspended for the ECAA scheme, which relates to the self-employed, and for the employment schemes which were being investigated as part of the wider migration review. After-entry applications remained suspended.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>At the same time we were in contact with employers and operators who regularly employed Bulgarian and Romanian nationals under the temporary low-skill employment schemes. On 8 April we advised them that if they had pressing short-term labour needs, they should make alternative arrangements, since it could take several weeks before these schemes could be fully reviewed, and any necessary action taken, before they could be reopened.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>On 22 April my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced that a series of task forces had identified a number of measures which would be implemented to reduce abuse of migration schemes, across all countries. The first set of measures concerned people posing as students, people pretending to provide education or training, and people marrying for immigration purposes. He indicated also that he had ordered a review (again across all countries) of the temporary low-skill employment schemes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS32"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column WS32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Following that review, we are today announcing changes to the quotas that apply to two temporary low-skill employment schemes, the seasonal agricultural workers scheme (SAWS) and the sectors based scheme (SBS). We are also announcing measures which will ensure that these schemes are not open to abuse.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>These schemes serve a valuable role in helping UK employers to recruit workers in sectors (agriculture, food processing and hospitality) where there are difficulties in meeting labour needs from the resident workforce. At the same time, it is important that these schemes should now reflect the fact that workers from the countries which joined the EEA on 1 May are now free to seek work in these sectors. Most important of all, it is important that these schemes are protected from abuse.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>We are therefore announcing that:
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para15"></a>
<p>The quota for 2005 for the seasonal agricultural workers scheme will be 16,250, a 35 per cent reduction on the current quota; and
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para16"></a>
<p>From 1 June 2004, the existing overall quota for the sectors based scheme will be cut by 25 per cent. There will be a quota of 6,000 SBS permits for the food processing sector and 9,000 SBS permits for the hospitality sector. These quotas will be released in two half-yearly stages.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>These reductions are based on the level of take-up of these schemes by accession nationals, prior to accession on 1 May.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>We are also announcing that the Home Office will introduce measures intending to ensure that those participating in our temporary employment schemes leave the United Kingdom at the end of their stay. These measures will include applying country-specific quotas within the overall quotas. These country-specific quotas will be made available only where we are confident that the source country will accept their nationals back if they are found to be here illegally.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The Home Office will consult industry on the detail of how these quotas will be applied, and will have immediate discussions in particular with the SAWS operators about action to ensure that the students who come in under this scheme return home at the end of their assignment.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>We intend also to change the immigration rules so that those admitted under the SBS will no longer be able to switch into permanent migration schemes, such as work permit employment. Those admitted under SAWS are currently not allowed to switch into permanent migration schemes, and new guidance will be issued to ensure that these rules are being enforced consistently.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>We are also issuing new guidance to ensure that applicants for SBS and SAWS are subject to rigorous checks, and to ensure that we act swiftly on the basis of intelligence of abuse, including the use of fraudulent documents.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>With these additional controls in place on the temporary low-skill schemes, and in the light of our continuing review of abuse across all migration <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column WS33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

schemes, we are now in the position to take the next step in the progressive reopening of visa applications from Bulgaria and Romania. With effect from today, we are announcing the lifting of the suspension on applications from Bulgaria and Romania for the temporary low-skill (SAWS and SBS) schemes, for the high-skill schemes (work permits and HSMP), and for all after-entry cases. The one exception is applications from the self-employed under the ECAA scheme, which will remain suspended in the light of the ongoing investigation by Ken Sutton.
</p>

<a name="40519-43_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Further announcements will be made in due course relating to other aspects of the managed migration review.

<a name="40519-44_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Housing Bill: Empty Homes and Tenancy Deposits</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="40519-44_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The Housing Bill introduces measures to help to create a fairer and more effective housing market, and will protect those that are most vulnerable in that market.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The Government have listened carefully during Commons consideration of the Bill and to external stakeholders. We now plan to add two further measures to the Bill: provisions to tackle empty homes; and measures to protect tenancy deposits. These amendments will be tabled in due course.

</p>

<a name="40519-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Empty homes
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The Government are committed to finding ways of bringing empty homes back into use. We have already encouraged voluntary measures wherever possible, but recognise that more is needed to reduce significantly the number of privately owned homes that remain vacant for long periods of time.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The Government therefore intend to enable local authorities to make management orders in respect of long-term empty homes. The legislation will contain the evidence a local authority would need to provide in support of an application to make a management order on an empty home. We will ensure intervention is proportionate, appropriately targeted and compliant with the Human Rights Act. Voluntary arrangements will continue to be appropriate in many circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>Empty homes management orders would support measures to increase housing supply. We will set out the precise scope of intervention in legislation. Our intention is to apply this measure to genuine cases of housing vacancy. We do not consider it would be appropriate to apply it to property that is genuinely occupied, albeit not on a regular basis, or property subject to an action that will result in it coming back into use without the need for intervention.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS34"></a>

<b>19 May 2004 : Column WS34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40519-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>A management order would enable a local authority to put in place arrangements to enable a property to be let. In the case of a dilapidated property, this might entail renovation. The legal estate would be retained by the owner who would be entitled to any rental income generated by the local authority after deduction of its relevant costs. The owner would be entitled to sell the property or request revocation of the management order.

</p>

<a name="40519-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>Tenancy deposit protection
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>The Government also propose to add to the Housing Bill some provisions on tenancy deposits.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The Government remain of the view that providing a link between the safeguarding of tenancy deposits and a requirement for all tenants to have written agreements is a sensible objective. However it accepts that the Law Commission proposals on tenure reform will take time to put into effect and need careful consideration.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Our intention is to add provisions to the Housing Bill to require that tenancy deposits should be subject to safeguarding arrangements. The Government accept that we will need to sponsor a scheme to provide for the safeguarding of the deposits sought by the majority of landlords. But we also recognise that members of trade or professional bodies should be able to look to those bodies to provide their own schemes if these schemes provide sufficient protection and the Government are able to approve them.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>The provisions will need to define the term &quot;tenancy deposit&quot; and provide that where such deposits are required by landlords or their agents they should be safeguarded by a scheme approved by the Government. There will need to be civil sanctions for non-compliance. There will need to be provisions for the timely return of deposits and for their repayment following dispute resolution.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>These measures on empty homes and tenancy deposits follow extensive consultation with the key stakeholders, and there will be an opportunity for further debate when they are tabled for inclusion in the Housing Bill.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>The Government are continuing to work with the broadcasting industry and consumer representatives to facilitate the switch to digital television. Already over half of all households receive digital television services. In view of the progress to date, switchover between 2006 and 2010 remains attainable. However it is apparent that more concerted action by broadcasters, retailers and manufacturers, supported <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40519-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>Completing the switch to digital will bring significant benefits to consumers, to broadcasters and to the UK economy as a whole:
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para15"></a>
<p>It will bring digital terrestrial television signals to the 25 per cent of the population who live in areas that cannot currently receive them because of spectrum limitations;
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para16"></a>
<p>Increased quality and choice for viewers;
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para17"></a>
<p>Broadcasters will no longer have to incur the costs of transmitting signals in both formats, releasing resources for investment in programming and other services for consumers; and
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para18"></a>
<p>Spectrum will be released to allow the development of more television and other services for consumers.
</p>

<a name="40519-44_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>The BBC and the commercial public service broadcasters have a lead role in achieving switchover. They have an established relationship with virtually all Britain&#039;s households and are therefore uniquely placed to ensuring a smooth transition to digital broadcasting. They will also benefit from reduced costs and from the ability to offer consumers a wider range of services.

The outcome of these discussions will be reflected in the digital licences which Ofcom will grant to ITV companies, Channels 4 and 5, and in the BBC&#039;s Charter review.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Whether research has been carried out on the presence of heavy metals in organic crops, particularly potatoes.  [HL2694]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="40519w01_spnew0"></a><b> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Whitty):  </b>  No UK research of the type described on organic crops has been carried out.

<p><a name="wa_qn_1"></a>
<a name="40519w01_wqn1"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick  </b> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Whitty on 24 March (<i>WA 103&#150;04</i>), what was the estimated number of cormorants wintering on United Kingdom fisheries (a) five years ago; and (b) last year; and how many culling licences have been granted in the last calendar year.  [HL2691]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="40519w01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  The Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) is the scheme which monitors non-breeding waterbirds in the UK. The principal aims of WeBS are to identify population sizes, determine trends in numbers and distribution and to identify important sites for waterbirds. The scheme is run jointly by the British Trust for Ornithology, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
</p>

<a name="40519w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The most recent estimate of population size in Great Britain in the non-breeding season is 23,000 individuals (using data for the period 1994&#150;95&#151;1998&#150;99). The index of population trend indicates that numbers in winter 2000&#150;01 were slightly lower than in the mid 1990s. It is not possible to determine what proportion of the British wintering population of cormorants occurs on fisheries.
</p>

<a name="40519w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>The annual review of licensed shooting for cormorants for the winter period 2002&#150;03 can be viewed at www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/Reports.htm
</p>

<a name="40519w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>During this period Defra issued 119 licences to allow 603 cormorants to be shot as an aid to scaring. The number of cormorants actually reported to have been shot was 284.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>Whether they support the proposals by the European Union Trade Commissioner to end subsidies on food and agricultural exports.  [HL2774]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="40519w01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  The Government are committed to the Doha Development Agenda objective to secure substantial reductions in trade-distorting support, including negotiations with a view to phasing out all forms of export subsidy.
</p>

<a name="40519w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>We therefore warmly welcome the initiative of the European Union&#039;s Trade and Agriculture Commissioners in writing to their World Trade Organisation colleagues, including the offer to move on export subsidies in parallel with other WTO members, as part of a balanced framework for agriculture.

[HL2745]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_4"></a>

<p><a name="wa_st_5"></a>
<a name="40519w01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton:  </b>  The figure quoted on the Cabinet Office website relates only to those pieces of legislation with a major regulatory impact.

</p>

<p><a name="wa_st_9"></a>
<a name="40519w01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   The Government Actuary&#039;s Department&#039;s estimates the impact of civil partnership on public service pension schemes using as far as possible the normal actuarial assumptions on demographic and financial factors it considers appropriate for these schemes. But a key unknown factor is the level of civil partnership formation among members of these schemes. The regulatory impact assessment published on 31 March 2004 illustrates the impact of different levels of take-up and explains the underlying assumptions and uncertainties. The capitalised cost of the high take-up case in the RIA was estimated by GAD at &#163;300 million if civil partnership rights applied to all the past service of the relevant scheme members. However, the costs could be higher or lower than the ranges illustrated depending on take up. For example, if the propensity of same sex couples to register matched that of opposite-sex couples to marry, this cost would be around &#163;3 billion.

<p><a name="wa_st_11"></a>
<a name="40519w02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker):  </b> In 2003&#150;04, &#163;21.4 million was allocated through the Housing Corporation&#039;s Approved Development Programme to provide homes for rent and low cost home ownership in Manchester for people in housing need generally, rather than key workers in particular.
</p>

<a name="40519w02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>In addition, the &#163;69 million key worker living programme is helping key workers, including midwives, into home ownership and intermediate rented accommodation in London, the south-east and the eastern regions where the high cost of housing is contributing to difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled staff in key public services.

<p><a name="wa_st_12"></a>
<a name="40519w02_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  Direct subsidies for renewables have only occurred in the form of capital grants.

</p>

<a name="40519w02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>The other forms of support come from the renewables obligation, our main renewables support mechanism, and the climate change levy, a tax on commercial energy use from which renewable energy is exempt. However, these are not direct subsidies but effectively allow the supply companies to pass the costs of compliance on to consumers. Support is provided for each MWh of renewable energy that is generated and the costs to consumers are roughly &#163;30/MWh under the renewables obligation and &#163;4.3/MWh under the climate change levy. However, this is only an approximation, as supply companies do not necessarily pass all of these costs through to their customers.
</p>

<a name="40519w02_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>Due to this, it is difficult to quantify the total level of support for wind energy from these mechanisms. However, assuming all renewable energy generated from wind since the start of the renewables obligation (April 2002) up to December 2003 received support under both the renewables obligation and the climate change levy, the total level of support would be, very approximately, &#163;65 million for onshore wind and less than &#163;0.5 million for offshore wind.
