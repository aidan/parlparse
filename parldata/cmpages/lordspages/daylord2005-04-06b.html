<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Judd </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What action they are taking in response to the Make Poverty History campaign; and how they define poverty in that context.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, the Government welcome the Make Poverty History campaign. The Government want to make progress on more resources for aid, debt relief and fairer trade. We define poverty in terms of the millennium development goals, particularly halving the proportion of people living below a dollar a day by 2015. Africa is being left behind. During our G8 presidency we intend to agree a comprehensive action plan for Africa&#039;s development.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that there is a great deal of positive feeling about the way in which the Government have made development issues central to the political agenda? Does she agree that the Commission for Africa chaired by the Prime Minister made the point that poverty is not only to be assessed in terms of sickness, shelter and all the other indices but also in terms of exclusion from political influence in the world? Is there not a major task to be tackled in ensuring that at a time when we talk about democracy and its importance in the world we make the international institutions of the UN, and other international institutions, more accountable to the poor of the world and enable them to be fuller stakeholders in establishing the agendas of those institutions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. As regards the point about the international institutions, my noble friend will know that the Secretary-General of the UN has been looking at that matter and has recently published a report. Indeed, the United Kingdom Government have warmly welcomed that report and have published our own consultation document with respect to some of the proposals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, following the PNQ yesterday on Zimbabwe and the important Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, does the noble Baroness the Leader of the House not agree that the two linchpins in the war on poverty promoted by the   Africa commission are good governance and fighting corruption? What action are Her Majesty&#039;s Government taking against their chosen handpicked <br>&nbsp;<br>

members of the Africa commission who have publicly supported the rife corruption and dictatorship of Mugabe in his recent fixed elections?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, we have made it absolutely clear that we see the three elements at the heart of these initiatives as being human rights, security and development, although I agree with the noble Baroness that good governance and fighting corruption are important elements of that. My noble friend Lady Symons made it absolutely clear that we shall continue to work with our African partners with respect to Zimbabwe. We have a different view regarding the way that we think the international community should handle Zimbabwe. However, a number of African governments and leaders share our concern as regards their initial view on the damage that is being done to the continent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, over the years there have been many projects to relieve poverty in the world. We remember the water decade and how that was intended to bring fresh, pure drinking water to every home in the world. Those were dreams that faded and hopes that were never realised. What mechanism have the Government in place to ensure that the pledges and hopes of the Make Poverty History campaign are monitored, and that their successes&#151;I hope, more than their failures&#151;are reported to us?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the Government see it as our responsibility to report on the commitments and pledges that we have made rather than on the commitments and pledges made by the Make Poverty History campaign. Members of that campaign will themselves report on the progress that they make as a coalition in challenging governments globally to meet those concerns. The noble Lord will know that this Government have taken a different approach. We want to work in partnership with developing country governments. We want there to be a very clear recognition of rights and responsibilities on both sides. We monitor progress not only against the commitments that we have made but also against the commitments that developing countries have made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rea: </b>   My Lords, now that the United States appears to have turned down the chance to co-operate with us in creating the International Finance Facility which was proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer three months ago, will the Government try to work with other G8 countries, and other countries if they can, to match that fund of $50 billion? My noble friend will be aware that that $50 billion matches the amount that would be raised if all countries reached the figure of 0.7 per cent of GDP in development assistance&#151;a sum which is essential if we are to reach the millennium goals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the $50 billion is the sum that we think is required if the world community is to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. As <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_723"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 723</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regards the IFF and the G8, France, Germany and Italy have already signalled their support. My noble friend will know that Sweden has also signalled its support. This is about increasing aid volume in addition to countries moving towards the figure of 0.7   per cent of GDP in development assistance. We are still hoping that the United States Government will come on board. I am not sure where my noble friend heard that the proposals had been turned down by the   United States Government; that is not my understanding. We are still hoping that they will come on board.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the Government&#039;s general intent <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> poverty in Africa in particular. Will the noble Baroness expand on the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady   Rawlings, in respect of corruption? It is such a deep, fundamental problem in large parts of Africa that it aborts improvements in governments and development. What is the Government&#039;s response to the recent OECD report on corruption, which had some extremely critical things to say about this country and our complete failure to date to bring one prosecution under the extra-territoriality provisions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will know that in addition to the OECD report, the Commission for Africa report looked at the issue of corruption and the role of developed countries in terms of issues such as the return of stolen assets. We are working with developing country governments in putting anti-corruption mechanisms in place and on reform of the public service. We are also looking at what more we can do about corruption&#151;not just the UK Government but developed country governments more generally&#151;and we are looking at the business sector through the extractive industries initiative.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew10"></a><b> The Earl of Sandwich: </b>   My Lords, returning to the subject of the IFF and the answer given by the noble Baroness, does she agree that for the very poorest in the world the Chancellor of the Exchequer is some kind of conjuror waiting for something to come out of the hat; and that is the International Finance Facility? When will the Government recognise that for the poor there is nothing in the hat, and this is turning into a confidence trick?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Earl. A series of goals were agreed by the international community in 2000, including halving world poverty by 2015. We will not meet those goals, particularly on the continent of Africa, without more resources and aid going in or without dealing with issues such as trade and debt relief. The majority of countries have not reached 0.7 per cent of GNI; in fact only four countries have reached 0.7 per cent. To enable us to put in more resources we must find another way of doing that. That is precisely what the IFF is there to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister focus her attention on the question of poverty <br>&nbsp;<br>

in the Pacific rim countries? Is she now in a position, in the last days of this Government, to indicate whether the Prime Minister&#039;s promise to match the funding raised by the British people for the victims of the tsunami and those people who are suffering considerable poverty as a result will be met before this Parliament is finally dissolved?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="50406-01_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I have addressed this question before for the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. He is being rather hopeful in talking about the last days of this Government. I made it absolutely clear that we had made a commitment with respect to the immediate humanitarian needs caused by the tsunami that we would allocate additional funding for long-term development once the needs assessment from the World Bank came in. We looked at that, and we made our pledges in relation to that. There is no point making a pledge until we know what the money will be spent on.

<a name="50406-02_time0"></a><h5>2.46 p.m.</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spopq0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Southwell </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What assurances they can offer British sugar beet growers that they will not be unfairly discriminated against in the forthcoming reform of European Union sugar policy.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Whitty): </b>  My Lords, the European Commission is not now expected to put forward formal legislative proposals on reform of the sugar regime before June. That is following the outcome of the WTO appeal panel. In determining the UK negotiating position, we will be looking for measures that ensure fair treatment for all concerned, including UK beet producers and our traditional ACP sugar suppliers, as well as consumers and taxpayers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Southwell: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Given that the UK sugar beet growers are among the most efficient in the EU and make a valuable contribution to the rural economy, and bearing in mind the potential for ministerial discretion in the Commission&#039;s White Paper for implementing partial compensation for cuts in price, will the Government strive to ensure that any quota reductions are targeted at countries producing exportable surplus and take steps to guarantee that the growing of sugar beet in the UK continues to be viable?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, the Commission&#039;s White Paper is by no means necessarily the same as what the Commission&#039;s propositions will be, which will also have to take into account the findings of the WTO appeal panel by other sugar-producing nations against the current EU regime. It will not be an attainable negotiating target, with the majority of EU countries <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_725"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 725</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

producing sugar beet, to have only those countries that produce an exportable surplus subject to quota reduction. There will be some sophisticated negotiations about that, and we will seek to protect UK sugar beet producers as far as possible, but I do not think that some of the simplistic formulae that are being produced by the industry are negotiable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Palmer: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister ensure that there is a viable alternative for our sugar beet producers in such things as providing bioethanol for road transport fuels?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, the Government are very much in favour of developing biofuels of all sorts, including bioethanol, which among other feedstocks could use sugar beet. The House will know that we are already under discussion about whether we could introduce a road transport renewables obligation, which would help to kick-start a serious market in biofuels for transport. Sugar beet producers, among others, should benefit from that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sewel: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the sugar regime is perhaps one of the most iniquitous aspects of the common agricultural policy? Maintaining a totally artificial price for European producers works to the advantage of some European producers and to the disadvantage of developing world producers. In this case, the slogan ought to be, &quot;The more radical reform, the better&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, I agree. The sugar regime has been the least reformed of all the CAP regimes. The bulk of them have now been reformed as a result of the negotiations two years ago, and the reforms are about to be put into practice. Sugar has to become part of that, and it is no longer tenable for us to maintain a European sugar price that is three times the world level. That leads not only to countries being excluded from the European market, but to European surplus being dumped, again to the detriment of the third world.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew6"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   My Lords, in the negotiations on the reform of the sugar regime, will the Government follow up on the need for quota trading within Europe and, if so, on what timetable? When will it be established?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, all questions of timetable are clearly subject to negotiations. The UK Government would like to see tradability of quotas, if the quota regime exists at all. Even better, we would like to see the end of quotas, so that the most efficient producers&#151;those include many of the British producers&#151;would survive in Europe while giving greater access to the sugar industries of the third world.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the Minister will agree that we are talking about the survival of the sugar beet industry in the United Kingdom, as well as being fair to the ACP countries. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_726"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 726</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

What percentage drop in quota in the price of sugar do the Government believe could result in a sustainable sugar beet industry in the UK and remain fair for the ACP countries? Some commentators have said that a level at about half of that proposed by the Commission would achieve that objective. Are the Government working towards that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   No, my Lords, we are not working towards that figure. As I said, the European price is three times the world price. The Commission White Paper will propose a cut of 33 per cent, which would allow the most efficient parts of the European sugar beet industry to survive, as well as the most efficient suppliers from ACP and other least developed countries.
</p>

<a name="50406-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Given that we have slightly more time, I should say that I intended to point out that today is the birthday of the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. He is looking very sprightly, and I am glad to see him being part of the debate. I apologise for not reacting more quickly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that his commitment to the interests of the ACP producers will be particularly welcomed in the Caribbean? Can he give an assurance that his department will talk to governments such as that of Jamaica&#151;8 per cent of the population there is dependent directly or indirectly on sugar cane growing&#151;and assist them in their wishes to help with the transition of the growers into future activities? If the sugar cane industry collapses in such a country, the social unrest will be inconceivable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, colleagues in DfID and I have been talking for some time to Jamaica and other Caribbean and ACP producers. The Commission has proposed an outline action plan for helping adaptation in those parts of traditional suppliers where the viability of the industry needs to be upgraded substantially, or where they need to adapt to other crops. The kind of catastrophe to which my noble friend refers could occur in some of our most loyal and traditional suppliers otherwise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, would it not be better for farmers in this country, and farmers and consumers throughout the world, if we abolished the CAP and repatriated agriculture to the individual countries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, significantly, the recent deal on most of the regimes in the CAP repatriates policy to the UK or member states, by moving away from production-related subsidies that are determined in great detail and with great bureaucratic difficulties in Brussels and towards giving farmers a single-farm payment against which they decide which crop to grow or animals to rear. Regrettably, sugar is not yet part of that regime. It is part of the UK Government&#039;s objective to make it so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, from the Minister&#039;s earlier answer with regard to the ACP countries, am I <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 727</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to understand that they will be dealt with in a different way from countries such as Brazil? Unless they are, they will certainly be the losers compared with Brazil and other countries that are considered less developed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, there is an agreement for preferential access for ACP countries. There is also an agreement in everything but arms, covering sugar, which would extend that to other less developed countries but not to countries such as Brazil. Only if there were complete liberalisation would Brazil sweep the market. That would be subject to a negotiation within the WTO that has not occurred and is unlikely to occur as part of the reform of the sugar process. There will be changes in the supply system from third world countries, but we should maximise the degree to which we can support our traditional suppliers in that area and other less developed and sophisticated producers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   My Lords, the tenor of the Minister&#039;s answers has been that, in future, we will grow less sugar beet for sugar in this country. Is there not another reason why that should take place&#151;that sugar itself is not always a healthy part of diets? If a lot less sugar were consumed in this country, its population would be a great deal healthier.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew17"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50406-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that that view has universal consent in this House. There is something in what the noble Lord says. However, it depends what you use sugar for and what food you put sugar on and in. I am sure that he is well versed in those nutritional guidelines and I hope that other Members of the House follow his good example, but I do not think that we can achieve those nutritional objectives by fiddling with the sugar regime.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="50406-03_time0"></a><h5>2.56 p.m.</h5>
<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Marlesford </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Why in implementing the proposed European Union constitutional treaty they intend the treaty&#039;s provisions for parliamentary control of the passerelle procedure to be exercised by the House of Commons alone.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My Lords, Article IV-444 asks national parliaments for a single view on whether to support a particular change in the voting rules. Although it may often be the case that your Lordships&#039; House and the Commons agree, that will not invariably be true. In that event, the Government take the view that it is for the elected House to make the final judgment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Marlesford: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that that is good enough. The passerelle<i> </i>clause will enable, for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_728"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 728</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

example, British taxation policy to be moved from unanimity to qualified majority voting without any further treaty change, which would sweep away the Government&#039;s cherished red lines. That is one of the most controversial proposals in the new EU constitution, so is it not an important safeguard that that use of the passerelle clause be subject to the approval of all 25   national parliaments? Why, therefore, are the Government downgrading the British Parliament into a single Chamber? Do they recognise that, if they seek to disenfranchise the House of Lords, they need a specific constitutional Bill to do so rather than slipping it in in an underhand way in the European Union Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will be astonished to hear that I completely reject the idea that we have slipped it in in an underhand way in the European constitution Bill. He will know that that Bill will arrive in your Lordships&#039; House, and that there will be ample opportunity to debate the Government&#039;s proposal in Clause 2 to pursue the passerelle agreement in that way.
</p>

<a name="50406-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The noble Lord might also recognise that there has been a huge victory in the constitution in what Britain has been able to achieve by determining that the incredibly important issues of moving from unanimity to qualified majority or co-decision must be agreed by 25 parliaments&#151;parliaments of sovereign nations. Noble Lords have felt passionately about that; it is to be applauded. We have addressed the question put to us of how to give a single view. That is our proposal in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend reconsider her answer and, instead of using the passerelle<i> </i>clause, allow the whole of Parliament to decide rather than bothering with a referendum? After all, some Members of Parliament&#151;at least, there might be a few in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;might read the 511 pages of the treaty. That would save the public a lot of trouble in reading the document before they decided on how they would vote. If she disagrees with that, can we have an assurance that the document&#151;it costs &#163;47&#151;will be issued to every elector before any referendum, together with the 493 pages of Foreign and Commonwealth Office commentary? Perhaps that will make her appreciate how much better it would be not to bother with the referendum.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the Foreign Office document is exquisite&#151;all 493 pages of it.

We are fully committed to a referendum; we have made that clear.

</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="50406-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Grenfell: </b>   My Lords, perhaps we may return to the Question. I am not in the habit of leaking the   deliberations of the European Union Select Committee, but we looked closely yesterday at Clause 2 of the European Union Bill. We came to the unanimous conclusion that an initiative for a decision under Article IV-444 should have the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Will the Government take the time that is now available to them before the Bill comes to the House to reflect very carefully on that?

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>We have proposed in the Bill that your Lordships&#039; House would be asked for its opinion, but that the final decision would rest with the elected Chamber.

However, if, by some mischance, the noble Baroness&#039;s colleagues are still in office when the Bill comes forward again, would it not be reasonable to convey to her colleagues that we have a bicameral, not a unicameral, system and that your Lordships&#039; House should not be treated as a second-rate think tank to be consulted on these matters? Should not the Bill go through the proper processes of full approval by both Chambers of our Parliament?

My view is that the will of the people will be that we will, indeed, be the Government, come 5 May, and that we will be debating these important issues in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;due to the importance of our role within Europe and the importance of ratifying this treaty. I have made it clear in all of my answers that there will be an opportunity for your Lordships to debate the Government&#039;s proposal.
</p>

<a name="50406-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>I reiterate that we are a unique bicameral institution. Twelve member states have bicameral parliaments, but none has a wholly unelected Chamber, such as ours. We must ensure that we put forward a single view. Our proposal is in the Bill, it will come to your Lordships&#039; House, it will be debated and I am sure that your Lordships will make their views well known. We all look forward to those debates.

Twenty-five nation states are now involved in the European Union. It is important that if decisions are to be made on changing the voting system, 25 parliaments should make the decision, but not 25 parliaments plus 12 second Houses. One has to obtain 25 nation-state views. If, in your Lordships&#039; House and another place, an agreed view comes forward, these issues will not arise.

<br>
(a)   the services for the carriage of passengers by railway which the Passenger Transport Authority for the area in question considers it appropriate to secure to meet any public transport requirements within that area, so far as relating to the provision of services of the same description as those to be provided under the franchise agreement in question;

<br>
(1B)   Where a Passenger Transport Executive for an area in England submits a statement under subsection (1A) the Secretary of State shall ensure that the services, and any minimum levels of quality or requirements with respect to fares, specified in that statement are provided for in any franchise agreement into which he may enter in respect of the services in which the Executive have an interest.

<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I realise that this may not be of great interest to many people, but I think that the matter before us is extremely important.

</p>

<a name="50406-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The amendment relates to the powers of the passenger transport executives, which were created in 1968 by a late and lamented Member of the House, Barbara Castle. Since that time, the passenger transport executives have been parties to agreements to provide train services in their areas. The aim of the amendment is to keep that   arrangement in place. In the Railways Bill, the government are proposing that the passenger transport executives will lose their powers as co-signatories of franchise agreements, even though they are expected to be funders of the services involved.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I cannot understand why the Government are protesting at the amendment. At first, when the PTEs were left out, we thought that that was an oversight, but it strikes me as an absolute contradiction for a government who have said that they are in favour of regional government and in favour of letting powers be   exercised locally to take away from the bodies that they created the power to be co-signatories to an agreement to which they contribute financially.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I have tried hard to deal with the objections raised in Grand Committee and on Report by the Minister; namely, that on one or two occasions passenger transport executives have delayed signatures for what could be described as political reasons. We have imported into the amendment the fact that the passenger transport executive authorities will, when the agreement is presented to them, have 60 days in which to be co-signatories.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The PTEs believe that the powers are important because, if they are not co-signatories, their power will be taken away, and the franchisee will take little notice of them. They will cease to be, as it were, a material part of the agreement.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I do not intend to delay the House long. The provision is a fundamental flaw in the Bill. I do not think I have ever had so many messages from people of every political opinion saying that something was wrong and that it needed to be changed. Unless we get <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="50406-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment. I have been involved in discussions with the Minister, and I am very grateful to him for that. As the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, in the amendment he has sought to meet the concerns of Ministers that the signatures to franchises could be delayed by PTEs getting difficult.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Given the time that it has taken to award some franchises over the past three or four years, 60 days is not a long period to delay franchises. It is nothing; in fact, it is very short. The key is that at least it gives PTEs, which, after all, represent a local community on transport matters, a say in what happens. As the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, they often contribute to better services, improved rolling stock or whatever.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Government&#039;s agenda is to devolve power where possible, but here the Bill seems to be contrary to that&#151;it is clawing everything back to the centre. It makes one think that, unless the service happens to be a commuter service into London, no one will take any interest in it, as that is the only service that civil servants use. I hope that that is not true; it would be a great misrepresentation of what is happening in this country.

</p>

<a name="50406-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The other thing that I would like to dispel is a story that has been put around and mentioned by the Minister on a few occasions&#151;that is, if PTEs are allowed to be signatories, the next stop will be the Mayor of London, Transport for London, the Greater London Authority or whatever. It should be clear to everyone that the Greater London Authority and Transport for London are not PTEs. Whatever one may think of what the Mayor and his organisations do in London&#151;I think that they have done an extremely good job&#151;this arrangement has absolutely nothing to do with them. Regional PTEs are at stake, and the amendment puts forward a good compromise that should have the support of the House. I fully support it.

I am probably speaking in opposition to what the National Express Group believes. I have not discussed the matter with it, but I understand that ATOC, the umbrella organisation of train operating companies, takes the same view as Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#151;that is, that passenger transport executives/authorities should not have a direct role so far as concerns franchising. I hope that it does not get me the sack from the group if I say that I disagree entirely with the view expressed by ATOC.

inconvenient if people elected locally take exception to, or insist on, services that may or may not be provided in the area for which they are elected representatives or if their appointees&#151;the passenger transport executives&#151;administer those areas on their behalf. However, the fact is that it was a Labour government who created the passenger transport executives/authorities in the first place back in the 1960s. As I have said&#151;I do not wish to go down the same road, or railway line, again&#151;many of the local services that now exist around our major cities outside this great city are there because of the efforts, finance and dedication of local councillors who serve on passenger transport authorities and those whom they have appointed to run passenger transport executives.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I see on the Cross Benches a former chairman of British Rail&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Marsh. I do not know his view on the matter but, as someone who had to lobby him on behalf of various organisations, I can understand that he, like members of the Government, occasionally felt that such lobbyists were a bit of a nuisance and that he should get on with the job of running the railway industry. I notice that he is far too polite to agree with me but, although he did not tell me so at the time, I suspect that he thought that about me and about some of the other people who lobbied him during his distinguished career as the chairman of the British Railways Board.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The fact is that, although it is inconvenient, local democracy is worth supporting. As has just been said by my noble friend Lord Berkeley, it is surely inconceivable that a Labour Government who profess to believe in devolution and local decision-making should exclude those who have a direct responsibility for providing train services from any involvement in signing the franchises to provide those services in the first place.
</p>

<a name="50406-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Even at this late hour, I urge my noble friend to reconsider the matter. I have not lobbied him myself because, after what I said the other day, I decided that he was bigger than me and that I had better not take that chance. I hope that he will bear in mind the depth of feeling among those of us who habitually bore your Lordships on such matters. We may well be boring your Lordships again on this occasion, but I hope that my noble friend will accede to the justice of the course that we are putting forward and agree about the issue of local democracy.

<a name="50406-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Morris of Manchester: </b>   My Lords, I gave my views on this amendment and others in the group when moving them on Report on 4 April. Thus I shall not detain the House at any length today.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>On Report, the myth that the Bill would speed up negotiations between franchisees and PTEs was exploded. In truth, it would considerably prolong them. Again and in sharp contrast to the pledge in last year&#039;s White Paper on devolving responsibilities to the PTEs, decision-making would, in fact, be centralised rather than devolved.

</p>

<a name="50406-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I had hoped that on Report we would be told in full detail where the Government stand. Would they prefer to withdraw the Bill rather than have these amendments <br>&nbsp;<br>

included? And, are the other parties determined not to allow the Bill to become law without them? We need to know in this debate exactly where all parties stand in advance of behind-the-scenes haggling on the Bill&#039;s future.

</p>

<a name="50406-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Meanwhile, in the proceedings on the Bill in another place on 27 January, MPs from Greater Manchester tabled amendments to the same effect as those we are now debating. In doing so, they were reflecting serious public concern across the conurbation about the threat the Bill constitutes for local decision-making on public transport. All their amendments were unceremoniously guillotined. Therefore, Greater Manchester MPs will have no say on an issue of high importance to them unless these amendments are accepted and incorporated into the Bill when it returns to the House of Commons.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>What happened on 27 January explains succinctly and in stark terms the importance of the role of this House <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the Bill. The case for the amendment is strong and I hope that my noble friend will today offer a reply that we can honourably commend to the PTEs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="50406-05_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, we supported the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, when he moved the amendment on Report, but we had some concerns, as some PTEs   are better than others. The noble Lord, Lord   Bradshaw, has taken on board our concerns and added Amendment No. 2 to the group, which means that PTEs cannot hold up any franchise agreements. There is a 60-day period. We believe that that is an important change and I thank the noble Lord for making it so that we can fully support the amendment. Quite frankly, I am somewhat baffled by the Minister&#039;s position. I thought that his party believed in improving local representation not in diminishing local rights.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="50406-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this debate, particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who moved the amendment. He has given an example of precision, which I hope will be followed by all movers of amendments that we shall consider on this Bill and other Bills today.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>We have discussed this matter at considerable length in Committee and on Report and we are discussing the issue again today. I have had the benefit of meetings with Members of the House who are greatly concerned about the Bill. On this legislation we have come to a point of principle and we do not and cannot accept these amendments. That was made clear in the other place and it is my duty to reflect that position today for the reasons that I have sought to emphasise during previous discussions on these issues, but not because we disavow the role of the passenger transport executives. At times it seemed to be suggested that we wanted to abolish the PTEs. This legislation does not do that. It clearly envisages an important role for the PTEs which will be involved with the Secretary of State in drawing up the requirements that lead to the signing of a franchise.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The point at issue is whether the PTEs should be co-signatories. I recognise that the noble Lord has   made an attempt to meet some of the objections <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_736"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 736</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that I presented the last time we discussed this issue; namely, that effectively there was an outright veto for passenger transport executives. I heard what the noble Lord said today, that the PTEs make a contribution to services, as indeed they do, but he would be the first to recognise that the great provider of resources for rail services is the Secretary of State and that the contribution of the PTEs, although not unimportant, is on the margins. We are not talking about any equality of partnership under the existing position with regard to co-signatories and who contributes resources. At present, there is equality in terms of being co-signatories.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We seek to change that because a fundamental proposition behind the Bill, and central to it, is the fact that the Secretary of State will be responsible for setting the strategic direction and the amount of national funding that will be invested in the railways. These amendments cut across the fundamental principle of the Bill. That is why, despite the eloquent arguments that have been presented on a number of occasions, I have been unable to move to meet those representations&#151;this is a point of fundamental principle. The Government, of course, have listened to the concerns of the PTEs and we, of course, have moved our position to take account of those concerns as far as possible, but these amendments strike at the principle of the structure under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>An interesting point that has developed in the discussions today, and in the past, is that the Official Opposition have tended to disavow the past, for fairly good reasons when one considers the Opposition&#039;s record on railways, and they have concentrated on the future. My noble friends, and to a certain extent the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, have tended to eulogise the past and not look to the future. I want to make it absolutely clear that this Bill is about the future of the railways. In eulogising the past, they have painted it in   rather rosy colours. The PTEs have not long been co-signatories&#151;only since the time when Barbara Castle, as she then was, set them up. They have been co-signatories only since 1993, under the structure created by the previous administration, which my noble friends have been only too eager to support me in dismantling and putting in place a more constructive, more accurate and effective system for running the railways.

</p>

<a name="50406-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I say to my noble friends that I recognise the achievements of the passenger transport executives in the past. We will not disavow their role for the future. We see them as constructive contributors to the provision of services in their localities. The point at issue is whether they are co-signatories with the Secretary of State, given his significant responsibility for national resources devoted to the railways under the framework of the Bill and with his overall responsibility for strategy.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The system envisaged in these amendments goes back to an adversarial arrangement that would perpetuate and exacerbate the worst of the old system which the Bill is designed to replace. That is a system where some&#151;not many&#151;passenger transport executives use the fact that they have to co-sign a franchise before it can be let as a <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50406-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, says that delays should be limited to 60 days. We have a problem with the definition of 60 days because it is not clear from his amendment where the 60 days begins. We have to be absolutely precise in law about when the clock starts ticking.

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I am objecting to the principle&#151;that delay costs money. Of course having a limit of 60 days would reduce the ability of the PTEs to create delay. That would not alter the fact that delays could occur over that period of time. Delays in signing such contracts are costly and the cost would be borne by the taxpayer. Who is responsible to the taxpayer? Not the PTEs, but the Secretary of State. That is why the Bill is constructed as it is. So, we are not clear that the 60-day part of the amendment produces significant benefits. We merely see dangers attached to it.

</p>

<a name="50406-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The phrase used is, &quot;when the agreement is being finalised&quot;. If the franchise agreement has been finalised, why would the PTEs need 60 days to consider whether they wish to sign? As the terms would be clear at that stage, the only reason could conceivably be if they wished to re-open negotiations in order to secure further concessions. To reach the signature stage and then to seek to start negotiations again would be totally inconsistent with an efficient, cost-effective franchising process.
</p>

<a name="50406-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>In many ways I think that the amendment makes the situation worse than is the current system. At present, although PTEs might use the threat of delay to lever advantages, no PTE would think that they could legally refuse to sign for two months. The amendment would give them precisely that power.

</p>

<a name="50406-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The amendment also does not change the fact that PTEs could use their co-signatory status during the course of the franchise. That would lever in very significant power. We do not deny the contribution that the PTEs can make to the development of an effective rail system. We recognise&#151;it is in the Bill&#151;that the Secretary of State is involved in consultation with PTEs, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_738"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 738</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before he establishes his position regarding a franchise, in order to take account of their position. But that is very different from the concept of co-signatory status.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way. Perhaps he can say a little more about the Secretary of State taking into account the views of the PTEs in dealing with the   people to whom he is minded to award the franchise. What does &quot;take into account&quot; mean? Is this a 10-minute meeting saying, &quot;This is what I propose to   do. What do you think?&quot; or is it a real and meaningful consultation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   It is a real and meaningful consultation, my Lords. The Bill clearly envisages that the Secretary of State cannot be a party to the franchise and develop a position regarding the franchise without taking on board and making arrangements to take on board the views of the PTEs. I am at one here with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who has articulately expressed his view on several occasions, as have my noble friends. I am at one with their arguments that we should not create a system in which the PTEs, and therefore a local voice, has no effect and no role to play in the development of the railway in signing franchises.

</p>

<a name="50406-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Bill envisages an effective role for the PTEs in relation to the Secretary of State. But it carries as its absolutely cardinal principle that the Secretary of State bears responsibility for the strategic development of the railways&#151;and of course he is the person who is responsible to and accountable for expenditure on the railways, which is provided to the greatest extent by national taxpayers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Snape: </b>   My Lords, am I to use my noble friend&#039;s own phrase &quot;na-vely eulogising the past&quot; in pointing out to him that it was a Conservative government who created this shambles in the first place, which allowed all the PTEs&#151;all of them Labour controlled&#151;to be signatories of franchise agreements in their areas? Here we have a Labour government saying to PTEs&#151;most of them Labour controlled&#151;that they cannot have any say in franchises. Am I &quot;na-vely eulogising the past&quot;, or are his ears going slightly pink with embarrassment about that particular contradiction?
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is adept at bringing physical characteristics into our exchanges. I hope to sustain them on an intellectual level. I emphasise to my noble friend that&#151;of course he may derive some satisfaction&#151;the PTEs, because of their role as co-signatories, were able to make a minor contribution to what in fact was a totally ineffective structure for the railways.
</p>

<a name="50406-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>We knew that it was a totally ineffective structure. That is why in 1997 it was an important part of our manifesto that we would change the system. We duly set out to do so, supported by an overwhelming majority of the elected House. We went before the country in 2001 with the same response, and we come <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_739"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 739</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before this House today recognising that the partial change we effected on the railway a few years ago needs to be completed by the Bill.

</p>

<a name="50406-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>In doing so, the Bill absolutely clearly&#151;I am sure all my noble friends join me on this&#151;centres the responsibility for the strategic development of the railways on the Secretary of State, because the Secretary of State is responsible for the resources which are used mainly with regard to the railways. That is the proposition behind the Bill. It is why, despite several attempts by those who are motivated by the very best of intentions in seeking to emphasise the constructive role of the passenger transport executive, I am unable to accept the amendment or their arguments. It is not that I am against the role of the PTEs in representing their areas and their transport needs regarding the railways. That role is protected under the Bill. The Secretary of State cannot fulfil his responsibilities effectively without consultation with the PTEs in order to ensure that he has the right background for signing any franchise.
</p>

<a name="50406-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Nevertheless, the position is clear. Fundamentally the Bill places the responsibility where it should be&#151;with the Secretary of State. It is on that basis that I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Morris of Manchester: </b>   My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, and reverting to the time-limit of 60 days, if by consultation that can be clarified by redrafting, is he prepared and is the department prepared to join in that process?
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I fear that my answer to my noble friend is in the negative. As for the 60 days, I am in favour of, and the Bill envisages, effective consultation between the Secretary of State and the appropriate PTE for rail services in its area before any franchise is entered into. I ask my noble friend to accept that the concept of 60 days, even if it were drafted more accurately than it is in the amendment, would give to the PTE a restricted veto&#151;restricted in time, but nevertheless a veto&#151;over the signing of any franchise. That runs counter to the fundamental principle behind the Bill. That is why I cannot accept the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="50406-06_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his reply; I find it totally unsatisfactory. He protesteth rather too much this afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, we invited the Minister to consider the amendment and suggest alternative phraseology but I assume that there is a time during the negotiation of a franchise when the document is ready. We are saying that there should be 60 days during which the Secretary of State, the PTE and the franchisee, whoever he happens to be, will sign it. Obviously, in any such period, there will be room for further negotiation; there always is.
</p>

<a name="50406-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>To pretend that 60 days is a long time when some franchises have taken three or more years to finalise is nonsense. I am sure that many Members of the House find it very difficult to give that credence. If we carry the amendment, there will be an opportunity for that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_740"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 740</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to be revisited. I do not think that presents a great difficulty. The Minister should reflect on the fact that we will give the PTEs something from the Bill; whereas I fear that, in his words, &quot;such resources as the Secretary of State may devote to the railways&quot; may leave the PTEs at the very sticky end of the wicket: they will be called on to close down services in their areas without any power to do anything about that and the Secretary of State will shuffle the responsibility on to them, because they will be the part-funding authority.
</p>

<a name="50406-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I have long experience of the matter. The PTEs are a power for good. I beg to test the opinion of the House.

(b)   in the case of a franchise agreement, the agreement shall be amended so as to relieve the franchisee from the obligation to comply with its terms to the extent that, if the agreement were not amended, compliance would be impossible or more onerous by reason of the proposed determination.


<br>
(2D)   If the Office of Rail Regulation fails to make a determination under paragraph 1G(2) by reason of one or both of the considerations specified in paragraph 1G(2C), the Secretary of State or Scottish ministers as appropriate shall ensure that public financial resources shall be increased accordingly.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="stpa_48"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, it is disappointing at this late stage of a Bill, and this Parliament, that we have been unable to come to an agreement on this issue. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, has been as helpful as he can, but I am afraid that his colleagues down the other end have not been so obliging.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>My amendment protects the rights of private-sector investors, passenger and freight operators, in the railway industry who could be aversely affected by cuts in spending imposed by the Secretary of State, if those cuts diminish the value of their existing rights under access contracts or cause them to face impossible or more onerous conditions in fulfilling their franchise agreements.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Under the Bill, the Secretary of State has the power to set network outputs&#151;the things that the network must be and the things that it must be able to do in terms of capacity or its condition. The Bill removes that power from the independent Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) and gives it to the Secretary of State. It does so because the Government wish to reassert complete control over spending on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_744"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 744</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

railway. The problem is that in setting the network outputs in that way the Secretary of State may, due to a cash squeeze from the Treasury, have to put the network into decline. We all know what happened during the days of nationalisation.

</p>

<a name="50406-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>If the Secretary of State exercises that power and the network gets worse&#151;for example, to the extent that it can accommodate fewer trains or they must go slower because of speed restrictions related to the condition of the track, or something like that&#151;it could cause serious difficulties for existing private-sector operators. The value of their rights under existing contracts&#151;I stress that we are talking about existing contracts, not future ones&#151;could be diminished, perhaps materially.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Freight operators could find that the maintenance burden on their rolling stock goes up, or that they must use more trains to provide the service levels to which they are committed under their contracts with commercial customers. Passenger operators may find themselves in a bind, with an obligation under their franchise agreements to produce certain outputs in terms of frequency, reliability, punctuality and overcrowding levels on trains, but unable to do so because the network is being cut back. Alternatively, it could be more expensive because to do so their resources need to be increased just to stand still and to provide the agreed level of service under their contract.

</p>

<a name="50406-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>None of those things would be the fault of either the freight or passenger operators concerned. The network getting worse because the Treasury has decided that it should be so can hardly be blamed on private-sector operators just trying to do their jobs, so they should not be penalised.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>On 9 February 2004, at the start of the rail review, the Secretary of State promised that those adverse consequences would not be visited upon private-sector operators, but I am afraid that that is exactly what the Bill does. For those reasons, my amendment provides essential protection in these limited but potentially very serious circumstances for private-sector operators.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I stress again that the amendment protects only existing contractual rights. What contracts operators may enter into in the future, once they have seen how the regulatory and operating environment has been changed by the Bill, is another matter that is not affected by my amendment. We are concerned about the rights of existing operators, and that they should not be assaulted or trampled on by the Bill.

</p>

<a name="50406-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The Minister said at an earlier stage that his department was working to develop access contracts and the network code to provide protections of the kind that the amendment seeks to establish. But there is a problem: the ORR can change the network code, which is part of every access contract, in a way that could diminish the protections and rights to compensation to operators when cutbacks are made. It has that right. If it exercises that right, it has no obligation to provide any redress or compensation for those who lose out as a result. If that happens&#151;and I know that the ORR is coming under considerable pressure to make changes of that kind&#151;the Minister&#039;s assurance that he kindly gave us in Committee <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_745"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 745</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will have no effect because operators&#039; rights will already have been diminished. They need more than assurances which have, I am afraid, no bite.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="50406-07_time0"></a><h5>4 p.m.</h5>

</p>

<a name="50406-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The Minister has helpfully said that the Government accept that franchise agreements would need to be varied in the event of inadequate funding being available for outputs for the network, should the level of services operated by the franchisees be made undeliverable. That is helpful, but it does not go as far as it needs to.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>It does not cover the case, which is much more likely than the service being impossible to deliver, of it being more expensive or more difficult to deliver the contracted service. The Government have so far shown no inclination to allow such amendments into the template franchise agreements, which are now being put to the private sector. The Minister will not accept that that protection should be wider than he has proposed or that it should be in the Bill. We believe that it should be both of those things.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The alternative offered by the Minister&#039;s department is the inevitable judicial review. What a prospect: what a deterrent&#151;judicially reviewing the Minister; the same Minister you rely on for your contract and for its eventual renewal when the result will not be known until long after the contract has expired. There is the uncertainty and the huge expense. The other alternative offered by the Minister&#039;s department was litigation in the courts. That, too, is expensive and uncertain, and the process takes a long time. It can easily take three or four years, which is probably well beyond the unexpired life of a contract.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>In offering those alternatives, the department appears plainly to accept that the operators need redress or relief in the circumstances contemplated by the amendment. But rather than dealing with the acknowledged problem here with clarity, certainty and finality, it favours long, drawn-out litigation.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I believe that we should all be looking at the Bill to prevent people having to go to court, not encouraging them into litigation by passing bad legislation. My amendment will help to ensure that the Secretary of State behaves in a reasonable manner and respects the private rights of investors in the industry. Of course, if no cuts are made to the funding of the rail network, which could cause these serious adverse effects to the operators, there will be no need for this process. It is there as a protection if the Treasury gets its way and forces budget cuts.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Without this change, private sector contractors will find their rights and protections diminished. There would be a very costly knock-on effect in the future as anyone contemplating taking on a franchise or an access contract to run any kind of service&#151;whether passenger or freight&#151;will have to build in a huge margin, just in case. So it will eventually cost the taxpayer.

</p>

<a name="50406-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The Minister accused me on Monday, at Report, of asking the Secretary of State to sign a blank cheque. That is simply not true. My amendment relates only to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_746"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 746</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unexpired part of rail franchise and access contracts. I say again: it does not in any way affect future contracts. I think that the Minister now accepts that. In future contracts, if so inclined, the Secretary of State&#151;in the case of franchises&#151;and the ORR&#151;in the case of access contracts and the network code&#151;can ensure that they contain output adjustment mechanisms which avoid the need to compensate the operator in the future.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>My amendment ensures that if the Secretary of State changes the circumstances in which the contract has been set, and does not allow those affected relief under their contracts, he must allow changes to their contracts. He must compensate them or he must not do it. The choice will be his. The Secretary of State can avoid that happening by treating the operators fairly. He does not have to cut the network, but if he does he must recognise that existing private sector rights must be honoured and protected. There is no blank cheque, but just a simple, straightforward protection.
</p>

<a name="50406-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>My amendment is about fairness. It protects and gives confidence to those who invest in rail. Most importantly, it will benefit the poor, long-suffering passengers who are often overlooked in this debate. I beg to move.
</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="50406-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, my name is added to this amendment. I shall not detain the House because the noble Viscount has set out very succinctly the purpose of the amendment. It would protect train operators, including freight&#151;I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group&#151;against government action that adversely affects their business. It is quite simple and is quite a normal principle.

</p>

<a name="50406-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>On Monday, at Report, my noble friend basically made two points. The first was that this matter could be resolved by using the network code, which was prepared and run by the independent Office of Rail Regulation. Comfort should be taken that this office was independent. The second point was that the Government did not like to see the word &quot;compensation&quot; in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Perhaps I may remind the House that on both those issues the recently published Crossrail Bill does   precisely what my noble friend said should not be in this Bill. The Crossrail Bill seeks to fetter very significantly the independence of the rail regulator by allowing the Secretary of State to instruct or direct him to give priority to one group of train operators over another, which would very seriously and adversely affect those who might have to have their access contracts changed. If one accepts that, it is reassuring that the Government have chosen to put in that Bill the fact that those people adversely affected should be capable of receiving compensation.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>So compensation is accepted for Crossrail, but it is not apparently accepted for the rest of the railway. Even more seriously, it demonstrates that one cannot rely long-term on the Government accepting that the rail regulator office should remain independent, which is one of the absolute foundations of the private railway network today. Whether people like privatised <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_747"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 747</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

railways or not, that is what we have. The Office of Rail Regulation ensures that private sector interests, which have invested billions in the railways, should be able to enjoy the benefit of their investment without subsequent interference from the Government.

</p>

<a name="50406-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Both of the arguments put forward by my noble friend should be treated with caution if the Government are prepared to change them so soon. This amendment is a very important part of the comfort that private-sector investors in the railways need if they are to invest with confidence in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="50406-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I am pleased to associate these Benches with the remarks made by the noble   Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Lord, Lord   Berkeley. We are very keen that nothing should stand in the way of people&#039;s appetites for investment. That applies particularly to the freight sector, which, as I said at Report, is so vital and for which&#151;I do not expect to treatise on that now&#151;the Government have done very little to deal with the huge problem of congestion on the roads. I am pleased to support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="50406-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for their contributions to this debate on an issue that we considered in more general terms probably at Report stage. I congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord   Astor, on having refined his amendment and for concentrating his comments on the real issues at stake.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I am well aware of and, of course, understand the concern of the train operators regarding the potential impact of any future access charges review on their businesses. I recognise the validity of concern expressed by all three noble Lords who have contributed to this debate.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>As we have stated previously, the Government are keen to provide operators with the certainty that they will receive mitigation or compensation should their businesses be affected by these processes. We have made public an exchange of letters between the Secretary of State and the Office of Rail Regulation to that effect. So the debate on the amendment comes down to clear points of principle.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>First, we believe&#151;not, as I think was suggested, that   compensation should not be offered in proper circumstances&#151;that compensation and mitigation are matters which should be dealt with through the access contracts. That is why we continue to work with the industry to ensure that access contracts and the network code deal as effectively as possible with these issues. If we accepted the amendment, it would bring legislation into an area where the existing contractual arrangements are working well and are clearly understood by the parties. It would be wrong to do this in principle and would set a dangerous precedent that could undermine the commercial stability sought by private sector operators and investors, which was the burden of the remarks made by all three noble Lords.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_748"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 748</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>But the second point of principle is one which I sought to emphasise on Report. Again I address it to all parts of the House, but I suppose that I am bound to address it particularly to my noble friend. It is for the Secretary of State and for Scottish Ministers to determine how much they are willing and able to spend in support of railway services. No statutory requirement should be added to   that budget subsequent to their decisions. While I recognise my noble friend&#039;s defence of the interests he represents so ably&#151;he has every right to do so&#151;I ask him to accept that we are debating this at a point when the nation is about to decide in a general election who should be its representatives, and that Members of the other place are now putting their own positions on the line. I also ask him and other noble Lords to consider whether it is right that a budget established by the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers in their area should be increased by statute in circumstances over which they would have no direct control. Surely that goes against the fundamental democratic position of accountability. That ought to be borne in mind by all of us in this House who do not have to stand for election in order to reach our judgments on this issue, one that concerns funding and resources for which the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers are responsible.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I turn to the second argument put forward by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. This refined amendment would come into effect only in limited circumstances and would cover only the difference between what would be paid under the contract and what is adequate so that the risk to the Government is not that great. I would argue that we do not know what the risk would be. The amendment establishes the principle that the Secretary of State is open to having his budget extended, and we do not know what the circumstances might be and therefore the sums involved in terms of compensation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="50406-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving way. I accept that no one wants the Secretary of State to have a blank cheque. That would be totally stupid. What the amendment is trying to do is suggest that if there is a problem with the overall budget&#151;and these situations do not arise overnight&#151;compared with what the Secretary of State wants to buy in terms of services, he has various options. He could cut the passenger services he is buying, or he could reduce the state of the network so that non-passenger, non-franchise services incur higher costs. He could do any of those things. However, if these companies then incur higher costs, he could include in his budget a contingency for compensation.

</p>

<a name="50406-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The Secretary of State does not need to increase his overall budget. He needs only to recognise that there may be a justifiable claim for compensation and therefore he needs to include in his budget a contingency for meeting such a claim. I suggest to my noble friend that there is no question of the budget having to be increased <i>ad infinitum</i> because of an open-ended claim of the type he suggests.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_749"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 749</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="50406-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend must be a little careful with the concept of contingency funding. I can think of certain expenditures from the contingency fund of hugely significant proportions for government, so I am not sure that that concept can be translated to legislation in quite the rather facile way he suggests.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>We maintain that the contracts should be signed and the work done on the basis of understanding aspects of risk. Built into that is proper consideration of when things might go wrong. But the idea of having a kind of sinking fund created by the Secretary of State with taxpayers&#039; money available to be dipped into and shelled out under ill defined circumstances is one that I am surprised to see my noble friend supporting. But I am even more surprised that the Conservative Party, on the brink of a general election in which they are spending so much time showing how proper their candidates must be about public expenditure plans, is actually promoting an amendment that is an open-ended demand on a Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I hope that the noble Viscount will recognise the wisdom of withdrawing his amendment and accept that the Government&#039;s provisions adequately meet the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="50406-08_spnew5"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, I have to say to the Minister that that was a good try, but this amendment does not in any way increase public expenditure. He   knows that, I know that, and the noble Lords, Lord Berkeley and Lord Bradshaw, know it. But the Minister has to stick to his brief and we sympathise with him.

</p>

<a name="50406-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The noble Lord has talked about principle. We know already that the Government have accepted the principle of my amendment because they have published it in the Crossrail Bill, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. The ORR is independent and I hope that it will remain so, but I remind noble Lords that the Strategic Rail Authority, created by this Government in 2001 and which was supposed to be the answer to managing the rail network for the future, is to be abolished by this Bill. We do not know what is going to happen.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The important point is that the Bill will allow the Secretary of State to change the circumstances in which the contracts were originally negotiated by the private sector. My amendment would ensure that if the Secretary of State does change those circumstances, he will not unfairly penalise those who have signed contracts with the Government. That is an important principle. If the Government do not accept it, it will affect every future contract in the private sector signed with any department. All of them could just be changed.
</p>

<a name="50406-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>My amendment does not increase public expenditure and has nothing to do with increasing the Secretary of State&#039;s budget. It is a simple protection measure. I am disappointed that the Government will not accept it and, while I understand the Minister&#039;s position, I wish to press the amendment to a vote.

The powers will be used proportionately and only for the   most serious offences. These amendments signal the Government&#039;s commitment to ensure that there will be an appropriate seriousness test for the use of these powers with certain financial offences. They set a minimum threshold of &#163;5,000 for offences under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, the Value Added Tax Act 1994 and the Theft Act 1968.

</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="50406-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </b>   moved Amendment No. 14:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>Leave out Clause 110</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope it will be acceptable to your Lordships that something more should be said on this clause and on this part of the Bill. The way the matter fell in Committee&#151;the marshalling of the amendments and the way in which they were, for the most part, not moved on this clause&#151;was something on which I sought advice. I appreciated, perhaps rather later than I should, that the only way for the Government to say a little more about this matter was for me to put down the amendment on the Marshalled List, which I shall duly dispatch in the expected manner. This is an important matter because there is hardly a more serious deprivation of liberty than being the subject of lawful arrest.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I appreciate, too, that the law is in rather a mess. Fundamentally, it was not my understanding that the Government really had to adopt the option which they did in relation to it. Looking back over our Second Reading debate and at the extensive debate in Committee in another place, from which one could hardly say a complete consensus emerged, I have to admit that I&#151;and not only I but various experts in the field who have spoken to me about this&#151;was rather surprised that this was not a matter which could have been left over for another Parliament, when I think we would have had a much closer and prolonged debate on it. The calendar, of course, is in the Government&#039;s arrangement, and certain parts of the Bill have been left aside because they are controversial. One of the points about putting this amendment down is that the Government may find, as time goes along, that the new pattern of powers to arrest is rather more controversial than they appreciated.

</p>

<a name="50406-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The two matters raised in Clause 110 are the powers of a police constable to arrest and the citizen&#039;s power of lawful arrest, without a warrant in each case. I touch briefly on the basic matters: we are abolishing the distinction between arrestable and non-arrestable offences. We are introducing a power for the constable lawfully to arrest without a warrant anyone who is about to commit an offence. That specifically includes any offence whenever committed, someone who is in the act of committing an offence or suspected of being about to commit an offence and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed, so long as it is necessary to arrest the person in question. New Section 24(5)(e) provides that that includes allowing the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or&#151;and I stress the disjunction&#151;the conduct of the person in question. It deals not merely with the investigation of offence but investigation of conduct.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Commentary on this matter has already begun in the journals. I am sure that the Government understand that that is there. I should like to refer to just one of the articles which are appearing and are about to appear. Professor Spencer of Cambridge, an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_755"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 755</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ex-colleague of mine, who is not to be lightly brushed off as some extravagant gadfly on the law and is a very serious authority, has suggested that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;the power to arrest will be limited, in theory, in that it will &#039;only&#039; arise if one of a list of conditions is present. But the limitation is illusory, because the list contains 11 items, one of which is &#039;to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or the conduct of the person in question&#039;. It will be a rare case indeed in which one of these conditions&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>such as that one&#151;&quot;does not exist&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Although Professor Spencer agrees that it is desirable for us to move forward and modernise, as the Home Office has put it, the law on arrest, both for constables and non-constable citizens, he questions seriously whether the Government&#039;s position on the matter is right in any respect. Having read all the proceedings, I have not really found a clear statement of the justification for moving at such speed and in such a direction on this matter. I therefore offer the Government an opportunity of saying something fundamental on the issue.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>For instance, Professor Spencer says that the Government have promised that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;after the Bill is passed, it will put limits on the  . . . powers of the police by issuing a new code of practice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>But, he says, this is deeply unsatisfactory:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;What the government is telling Parliament, in effect, is this: &#039;Vote to extend police powers now&#151;and trust us to impose some limits afterwards&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>That is put in the manner in which the author normally puts his points&#151;rather directly.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>He continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;In a democracy that respects the rule of law, the limits of coercive powers like these should be laid down in primary legislation, not in codes, written and rewritten as each new Home Secretary sees fit&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>On the brink of an election, the power of the last words is immediate.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>It is difficult to understand what traumatic damage to the social fabric would have been caused if a reform of this area of the law, which everyone agrees needs rethinking, had been left for a short or medium term in which much more profound debate could take place. With great respect to the other place, which spent some time on this issue on 18 January, one cannot think that all the corners of what is a vast territory were touched.

</p>

<a name="50406-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Of course, similar criticisms are being made about the citizen&#039;s power of arrest. The new citizen&#039;s power of arrest for any offence will include one where the person is in the act of committing an indictable offence:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;Anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing an indictable offence&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>or guilty of an indictable, offence and it is necessary to arrest the person.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_756"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 756</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Professor Spencer offers some thoughts on that new power, which goes far beyond breach of the peace and the like, in saying that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;the Bill proposes to extend the existing power to cover all indictable offences, and limit the power,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>of the non-constable,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;for the suspect to be restrained or detained. For the citizen out of uniform, this new package would be as obscure and unhelpful as the present law. Unless they have law degrees, &#039;have-a-go heroes&#039; do not know which offences are indictable, and which are not&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>or indeed&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;which ones are punishable by five years&#039; imprisonment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>He suggests that this particular reform will create a great deal of danger for people who think that they can operate their powers as a non-constable citizen.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Therefore, I wish to raise two issues with the Government. The first that I have raised is why push this particular package through? My understanding, and my noble friend will correct me if I am wrong, is that the review of the PACE statutory powers did not require the Government to adopt this option. It is their choice and a great number of technical problems arise other than those that I have mentioned.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Secondly, it seems very strange for the power of arrest to cover all offences, serious or trivial. I understand what my noble friend on the Front Bench said in Committee. She said that the Government will come out with the new code of practice,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;so there will be an opportunity for debates and consideration of those issues&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/4/05; col. 639.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-10_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Those are the issues that were raised in connection with the power of arrest. I should have thought that such a fundamental issue as deprivation of liberty without breach of the law on the part of the person doing it would have required fundamental debate of all the issues, including the necessity of the arrest&#151;of which particular criticisms can be made, whatever the code of conduct&#151;before the legislation went on the statute book.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I do not see how it would be a breach of any of the Government&#039;s obligations. Was this a manifesto commitment? It does not seem to have been. Why push this through now? We know that parts of this Bill are not being pushed through now because they are controversial. The fact that people in the other place and here have not spotted the controversy is not now open to the Government because I am pointing it out to them. This is very controversial: it will be controversial in the literature and in practice.

</p>

<a name="50406-10_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>There is a final point which authors are raising immediately. Academics are allowed to raise points these days about ordinary people&#151;they are rather ordinary people, especially academic lawyers. They are saying, with some seriousness, that the relationship between the police and ordinary people in the public is precious. If the <br>&nbsp;<br>

new powers are more likely to give rise to mistakes&#151;and I have every sympathy with someone who has to exercise them and avoid mistakes&#151;surely it should have been argued out in much greater detail and not put into the calendar of the general election. It is not really suitable to be rushed through.
</p>

<a name="50406-10_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>That expresses a strong view of my own, but I rely on those writers who are writing about the matter rather more critically than the Government have yet appreciated. Naturally, I look forward to the response of my noble friend on the Front Bench and hope that she will give us some rather better reasons for what has been done. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="50406-11_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to give a fuller explanation and I am sorry that we are doing that so late in the day.

</p>

<a name="50406-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The proposals in Clause 110 focus on simplifying the current complex array of arrest powers which has developed since the introduction of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act over two decades ago. My noble friend was right to raise the issue of the review because we think that the provisions reflect one of the primary recommendations of the review of PACE carried out in November 2002 by the Cabinet Office and the Home Office in consultation with stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>The review recognised the need for greater clarity and definition of arrest powers. It made a number of suggested changes around definition and lists of offences, but the more substantive recommendation was for more radical ideas about expanding the scope to arrest and to consult on those proposals. That is what we have done. The consultation paper on modernising police powers, published last autumn, set out this new approach which simplifies, both for the police and the public, the powers of arrest but which, importantly, also maintains key safeguards and protections for the public. We understand and are aware of the need for safeguards and protection.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>In doing so, we have sought to enable the arresting officer to consider the individual circumstances of each case&#151;to look at the needs of the victim, the nature of the offence, the requirements of the criminal justice system and the circumstances of the offender. This is where the concept comes in.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Section 25 of PACE currently provides a constable with a general power of arrest for any offence. In making use of the power, a constable is required to consider the conditions set out in the Act and is required to make a judgment in each case. The framework powers of arrest for arrestable and serious arrestable offences under Section 24 of PACE remove the arbitrary decision on whether arrest is possible, but it still remains a decision of the officer on the street whether there are legitimate grounds to exercise that power. The necessity test would raise the level of accountability of the arresting officer in each individual arrest situation and minimise the ability for arbitrary interference.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_758"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 758</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>During the passage of this Bill, both in this House and in the other place, concerns have, as my noble friend rightly said, been raised that extending the power of arrest to all offences might lead to a significant rise in the numbers of arrests being made as people are arrested for minor crimes. We are not suggesting that the seriousness of the offence is not a consideration when a constable decides to make an arrest. But it is not the sole consideration. Rather it is just one of a number of necessary factors which should be taken into account.

</p>

<a name="50406-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>However, these powers must be proportionate to the offence. That is why we are producing a new PACE code of practice on arrest which will amplify the reasons justifying an arrest of a person. The code will be drafted in consultation with a range of stakeholders and will be subject to the draft affirmative parliamentary process.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>As my noble friend identified, this clause also deals with the powers of arrest for persons who are not constables by inserting a new power into PACE in Section 24A. Similarly, we are looking to provide clarity in this area by indicating that a person other than a constable may arrest in those circumstances where it is necessary to prevent harm or injury, loss or damage to property or the person is making off before a constable can assume responsibility. Additionally, the person must be satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for a constable to make the arrest instead. All of those are within the ken of the normal, average citizen.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>In the other place, we tabled an amendment that the so-called &quot;citizen&#039;s power of arrest&quot; was applicable only in relation to indictable offences. The amendment was tabled in response to concerns expressed during the public consultation exercise and in the other place that the citizen&#039;s power of arrest should not be extended to minor offences.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The rationalisation of powers in this whole area represents a significant change to PACE and the framework of arrest. That is not done lightly nor without significant consideration that it improves and enhances the existing structure. We believe that it does and that view is supported by a large number of respondents to the public consultation exercise. We also believe that we are proposing a new structure that is proportionate and balances the needs of the police while protecting the rights of the individual.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I hope that, given that full explanation, my noble friend will be content that the course that we have taken is appropriate. We shall have an opportunity to discuss the matter when it comes back by way of affirmative resolution. There will also be discussion with all the stakeholders, who, I am sure, will make their views on the provisions crystal clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="50406-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   My Lords, will it be a defence for an individual who carries out a citizen&#039;s arrest, believing mistakenly that the offence that he is preventing is an indictable one, to argue that the law is hazy or unclear on the precise dividing line between indictable and non-indictable offences?

<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="50406-11_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will know that defences are set out in the jurisprudence that we have and in the statutes and that anyone can take advantage of those defences and no other. As I made plain, the measure was not originally in the Bill; it was brought in because there was a strong feeling among noble Lords opposite, Members in the other place and people elsewhere that there had to be some sort of benchmark to differentiate between minor offences and more serious ones. But it is also plain, if one looks at the type of situations when an individual may feel it appropriate to arrest&#151;I have already identified those&#151;that they fall into the more serious category as opposed to the minor. I invite my noble friend therefore not to press his amendment.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>Leave out Clause 120</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, yesterday, I spoke at length about custody sergeants and the need for them to retain that substantive rank in custody suites. I return to this because the answers given by the Government were wholly unsatisfactory.

</p>

<a name="50406-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>None of the real concerns expressed in stringent terms by the police was addressed. I was deeply disappointed to hear that the Conservatives in another place have decided to accept the Government&#039;s position on nothing more than a promise that whoever is chosen to go into the custody suite will be well trained and held in sufficiently high esteem by their colleagues to perform their duties. What on earth does that mean? What does   a person have to exhibit before he or she is deemed to be held in such high esteem? Who will watch over those new appointees and judge whether they will be suitable to hold people in custody&#151;and, more, that they will be under the full power of PACE? Can the IPCC&#151;the   Independent Police Complaints Commission&#151;investigate complaints against civilian custody officers? If so, how will that be publicised, so that a person held in custody will know that they have the protection of that law?

</p>

<a name="50406-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I contacted the Police Superintendents&#039; Association this morning and got its views. Thinking back to the time before the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&#151;the time of Judges&#039; Rules and so on&#151;they remembered a time, as do I, when many abuses were carried out regarding the detention of suspects. PACE was necessary to codify what the police should and should not do with suspects. The linchpin of all that was that custody officers, who have protection in law for their decisions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_760"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 760</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taken in support of the Act, were able to have the strength of the law behind them, even if it meant speaking out against senior investigating officers, who might want to interview a suspect against the requirements of PACE.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The service respects that independence, and I was told that senior detectives had accepted custody officers&#039; decisions when clearly they had been unpopular. The new provisions do not provide anything like the proper independent statutory role for this post. A member of police staff&#151;a civilian custody officer&#151;may not have the same authority with senior investigating officers as a police colleague would do. I am fearful that it will not be long before we reap the whirlwind that that might unleash.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Custody, surely, is part of the investigative process. Many crimes have been detected in custody suites, and what I fear is behind the Bill is the aim that a custody suite will be enabled to be operated by a private company. I am sure that I do not need to elaborate on the problems that that might cause.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Yesterday, I listed a range of important players in the police field who have expressed deep concern about this part of the Bill&#151;bodies such as the Police Federation, the Police Superintendents&#039; Association, Liberty, the Law Society, Centrex, and so on. Even at this late hour, I ask the Government to reconsider their position.
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Yesterday, the Minister told us that Customs officers and others had similar expertise. I should like to know how many people Customs officers &quot;and others&quot; have held in their custody and under what regulations. Were they subjected to PACE regulations, as well? When will all the training for those &quot;other&quot; people take place, and what happens in the lacuna before that training is completed? In my experience, different applications of training standards apply across the individual police forces, with the result that national standards are not always adhered to. Those standards ought to be crystal clear and certainly understood before the Bill is enacted. Who will be the independent evaluator of the pilot studies? Will we have the opportunity of seeing that evaluation and assessing for ourselves whether the pilots have been successful?
</p>

<a name="50406-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>It is simply not right to keep telling us that it is to be a new and different agency from traditional policing. It is still going to deal with crime. The whole area has been so badly thought out and flies in the face of such strong policing opposition that I hope that the Minister will reconsider her position on the use of civilians as custody officers. I beg to move.

<a name="50406-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I shall be brief in supporting my noble friend Lady Harris.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I served as a member of the Police Complaints Authority, and it was at this time that I came into close contact with custody officers in police cells. In cases when violence or death in custody were being investigated, the first point of contact was always the custody sergeant. The responsibility for what happens in custody suites is very heavy, and the Police <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_761"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 761</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Federation is right to criticise the Government, because no civilian without the type of training that a sergeant receives can carry out his or her duties satisfactorily.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Only a few minutes ago, I received an e-mail from a member of the Police Federation. The crux is that the Police Federation believes, according to this particular member, that the measure,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;will have a detrimental effect on the care and custody of prisoners. It is vitally important that this remains a role carried out by fully sworn, experienced police officers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50406-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The question that my noble friend Lady Harris posed concerned the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and its relationship to custody officers. It would be very helpful if the Minister were to explain whether civilian custody officers would form part of the Independent Police Complaints Commission&#039;s machinery; in other words, can an individual make a complaint about a civilian custody officer? What processes and procedures will be in place to make the public aware that that can be done?
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The police have paid out millions of pounds in compensation where cases have been taken up not by the Independent Police Complaints Commission but where cases have been brought in the civilian courts long before the IPCC or the PCA had the opportunity to consider them. What would be the position of civilian custody officers if cases were brought against them by suspects who considered that they had been violently treated or had not received appropriate treatment? We need to clarify those questions at this stage.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50406-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, I too would like to support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, as I did yesterday. Indeed, I have very little to add to what I said then. I simply emphasise that this matter is of serious concern to the police themselves. I also emphasise the point that SOCA will not deal with civilian complaints, civil matters, but with hardened criminals. It will be necessary to have experienced people to deal with that kind of work. My noble friend Lord Clarke started when he heard mention of a privatised suite, as did I. It seems to me that we are privatising a service which has previously been properly and efficiently handled by the police. It will be handed over to civilians who, no matter what training they have, will not have the same authority and experience of criminals as have the police. Our discussion now and, indeed, our previous discussion on Amendment No. 14, which was moved by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn, shows that that is the case.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I did not intervene in the discussion on the previous amendment as, frankly, the whole issue was so complicated that it was difficult to grasp it in the short time available. That is happening with the amendment which we are currently discussing, has happened with many other amendments which we have discussed and with other matters which we shall not discuss. It is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_762"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 762</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disgrace that we are pushing this important Bill forward with such haste and with so little scrutiny by this House of the many matters contained in this Bill with its 174 clauses and 18 schedules. It is an abuse of parliamentary procedure.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I repeat what I suggested yesterday; namely, that we should not have allowed the Bill through. It should be returned to the House of Commons after the election and given a formal passage through all its stages and then it should be sent back to this House to enable us to discuss it properly. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="50406-12_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I should underline very clearly that the Bill has been fully scrutinised in the other place. There was proper debate and anxious consideration of it. We have spent considerable time exploring the issues both on Second Reading and in Committee. Therefore, I shall not weary the House by repeating everything that I said yesterday in replying to the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, or in replying to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. However, I should like to deal with a couple of points that they identified as being still of concern in relation to the IPCC.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The noble Baroness asks what we are going to do about complaints regarding non-police officers who take up the role of custody officer. Part 2 of the Police Reform Act 2002, which set up the IPCC, gives the commission oversight of the investigation of complaints against police officers and police staff. In addition, noble Lords will know that, as now, police authorities, as the employers of police staff, are liable for any wrongful acts committed by such staff. That will also be the case with civilian custody officers.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Looking at the general position, I emphasise that the proposals in the Bill do not remove the ability for a police sergeant to continue in the role of custody officer. We very much recognise the contribution made by uniformed sergeants to the post and the effective and efficient operation of custody suites. We do not want to lose that experience or those skills. In the Bill we are providing a capability for others who have demonstrated that they have the appropriate skill to discharge this function to do so. I said yesterday, and I repeat, that there is provision for appropriate training before any individual could be entrusted with this role. We have spoken about Centrex&#039;s role and the guidance.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I remind the House that PACE itself sets the benchmark for how an individual should be treated when detained in a custody suite after arrest. Those provisions will apply as strongly to any new custody officer as they have always applied to those who are detained.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I appreciate the anxiety expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, and what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. However, this is a new body. It will have to be properly integrated. I would not be surprised if in the first instance the majority, if not all, the custody officers who join SOCA come from the police. However, we are not putting in place provisions for what happens now, this year or next year but for the long-term development of the agency. Over time, a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_763"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 763</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

number of people will enter the agency who will be, or may be, fitted for that role by virtue of the experience of having worked within it. It is important for us to remember that.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that there is no question of privatisation of the role of custody officer. We are talking here about enabling chief officers&#151;I emphasise that&#151;to appoint to that role police staff employed by the police authority. Therefore, there is no reason for there to be concern that somehow something will be inappropriately done.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I hope that with that further explanation the noble Baroness will think it appropriate not to press her amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="50406-12_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for attempting to ameliorate some of the harm that has been done in this Bill. Sadly, her arguments do not persuade me one little bit. Custody sergeants were always going to be my <i>cause c&#233;l&#232;bre</i>.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>For instance, how is the noble Baroness going to ensure that national training standards for this very important role are going to be rolled out and used in exactly the same way in every police force in the country? They have not been so far. As I said earlier, national standards, while they apply, have been used differently in different police forces. There is still no way of getting around that.
</p>

<a name="50406-12_para13"></a>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="50406-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby </b>   moved Amendment No. 17:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>Page 96, line 29, leave out from second &quot;is&quot; to end of line 31</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we have already heard some impressive speeches this afternoon. I immediately express my apology for not having been able to be present in Committee yesterday, but I was present at Second Reading. I feel extremely strongly about the issue, and I shall be brief.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and my noble friend Lady Harris of Richmond have drawn attention to the fact that, in the Bill, there are a number of unrealised and insufficiently appreciated elements that will have a major effect in our society in years to come. One of them concerns demonstrations and whether they can be held within the ambit of Parliament Square and the areas that traditionally in this country have been the centres of demonstrations for many decades.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Either on grounds of security&#151;not necessarily justified&#151;or even on arguments of tidiness, we are gradually seeing the colour and the vivacity of our democracy leeched out. Many of us are conscious that we live in a society that feels much less free than it did 10 or 15 years ago. We always have to ask whether it is necessary to take such steps. In these clauses, it is not necessary to do so. Let me say one or two quick words about that.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Demonstrations are a crucial safety valve&#151;a way in which our fellow citizens can express their indignation, anger or disgust at government policy. I say that about all governments at all times. It is crucial to allow our fellow citizens to demonstrate peacefully because, if we make that extremely difficult, sooner or later they will demonstrate non-peacefully. That is the lesson from many other societies.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Let us look at the examples of two recent great demonstrations. Both were great credits to our democracy, and both saw Parliament as their target and the hub of their protest. The first was the great Iraq march, in which many of us took part. It brought home to the Government the extent to which many of our fellow citizens felt deeply concerned about that war and the arguments leading up to it. The second, from a very different part of the political spectrum, was the Countryside Alliance demonstration. It was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_766"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 766</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

widely rumoured in the press to be likely to get out of hand, but was actually conducted with extraordinary courtesy and restraint.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>It has been a credit to our democracy that, on both sides of the political spectrum, such demonstrations have been held, to the great admiration of many other parts of the world. It might be said by the Government, &quot;There is no reason for you to object. After all, we are still going to permit demonstrations&quot;. However, they will be demonstrations so controlled and capricious that it would be very difficult for them to take place within the &quot;designated area&quot; with any degree of true freedom. I shall give three examples.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>First, the designated area is much wider than it need be to protect the Houses of Parliament. It is simply ludicrous that the designated area as it stands&#151;I am not clear exactly where it will run&#151;includes almost all the areas of traditional demonstration in London, such as Whitehall, the Embankment and Parliament Square itself. Then there is a question about whether Trafalgar Square is in or out; it is certainly within a kilometre of the Houses of Parliament.

</p>

<a name="50406-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Secondly, there is some uncertainty about the degree of notice required. Will it be six days except in exceptional circumstances, and how does one define those? Will the exceptional circumstances be widely recognised so that anyone dealing with a demonstration about a recent event&#151;something new that has happened or an announcement by the Government&#151;would be permitted to go ahead?
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Thirdly&#151;this was hardly debated at all in Committee, and not debated much in the other place&#151;huge uncertainty is constituted by Clauses 134 and 135, which are rather innocently described as supplementary provisions. If I understand them properly, they allow, amazingly, any &quot;senior police officer&quot;&#151;defined as the most senior person in any group who happens to be present at the time, which often may be a constable or someone only a little more senior&#151;to change, vary or add to the conditions. Those are the very conditions laid down by the commissioner of police that have required notice to be given.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>That is intolerable. It means that a decent organiser of a demonstration will not know until he is actually involved in it precisely what conditions have to be met by those whom he has organised to take part in it. That would not be so serious were it not for the scale of the punishment that would be visited on him or her if he   or she got it wrong or was unable to change what the demonstration did at what may be the very last moment. Those sentences include 51 weeks of custody or a level 4 fine&#151;the kinds of punishment that we normally reserve for people who have committed some substantial crime in the ordinary world.

</p>

<a name="50406-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Do we really want to put police officers in a position in which they vary and change conditions at such a high price to the genuine citizen taking part in a demonstration? That will gradually drive people away from the designated site altogether, which is far from desirable because&#151;bluntly&#151;it is important that Parliament feels in itself the anger and indignation of its fellow citizens and does not try to encapsulate itself from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_767"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 767</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

any such inconveniences. We worry about the gap between Parliament and the people; the Bill will widen that gap yet further, completely unnecessarily.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>In conclusion, all of us in the past few weeks have hugely admired the amazing demonstrations in the Ukraine against rigged elections, which went right up to the doors of the parliament and which brought about, totally non-violently, the change in the Ukrainian regime and the ushering in of genuine democracy. We have admired the demonstration of tens of thousands of people in the Lebanon, calling for the Syrians to leave. That was described, from the White House to 10 Downing Street, as a remarkable example of the great attempt to extend democracy to new parts of the world.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>How bizarre and how ironic it should be that those very things that we praised in the Lebanon, in the Ukraine, in Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere, we are now beginning to make almost impossible in our own country. I would ask the Minister to think seriously about the implications if the Government&#039;s proposals, not only here, but also far beyond where British influence and British example have long been regarded as important. I beg to move.
<a name="time_14"></a>
<a name="50406-13_time0"></a><h5>5.30 p.m.</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="50406-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I rise briefly, not to add to the passionate and sensible speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, but simply to point out that, as a Front-Bencher, my remarks on this were put on record at Second Reading and yesterday. For the record, I remind my colleagues, who may not be present at this moment but may read the record, that if a Division were to occur it would be on a free vote.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="50406-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak briefly in support of my noble friend Lady Williams. I fear that this part of the Bill in particular gives such wide and discretionary powers to the police, and those to whom they are expressly given, as to create a dangerous regime. I should add to my noble friend&#039;s remarks that, for example, under Clause 136, a constable can arrest a single demonstrator in the belief that the demonstrator has not obtained the necessary authorisations.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>A demonstration could constitute a single person, because the Bill makes it clear that the demonstration can be by someone who is merely shouting in the street&#151;for example, when seeing someone leaving these Houses who that demonstrator feels passionately about in relation to the issue concerned. That individual will, if the provision is passed, be subject to immediate arrest by any policeman in the vicinity. That is not remotely right or sensible.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>If the Minister says that the police will of course exercise their discretion, it would underline my concern about the discretionary nature of these vast powers. Parliament is increasingly dealing with that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_768"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 768</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

type of legislation and it is bad legislation. I merely wished to say that and to support strongly the comments that have been made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="50406-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   My Lords, I have an open mind about Amendment No. 17. Regarding Amendment No. 18, I acknowledge the stirring speech given by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, and I take on board the many interesting points that she made, with which I agree to a considerable extent.
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Is not one of the problems with Amendment No. 18, as drafted, that a 100-metre exclusion zone that started even at the south-eastern corner of Parliament Square would not, I suspect, protect the Black Rod&#039;s Garden entrance, for example, nor&#151;although I have not had time to pace it out&#151;would it protect the southernmost part of our car park?
</p>

<a name="50406-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Would the noble Baroness consider returning at Third Reading with an amendment that compromises at somewhere between one kilometre and 100 metres? I would suggest a quarter of a mile&#151;and I declare an interest as patron of the British Weights and Measures Association, to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, also belongs. Survey after survey has demonstrated that the great majority of people in this country, of all age groups, continue to think in Imperial terms, despite years of metric indoctrination. Setting down the limits in terms of yards or fractions of a mile would help the public to understand&#151;quite literally&#151;how far they could go.
</p>

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="50406-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. I do not wish to repeat what I said yesterday, but I feel that I am living in some type of Cloud-cuckoo-land when a Labour Government are bringing forward this type of legislation.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I was in the Labour Party for 54 years and in that party we believed that people had the right to assemble in virtually all circumstances and that it was part of this country&#039;s freedoms and heritage that they should be able to do so. We were always proud of the right to assemble outside Parliament and to be able to demonstrate our views to the elected representatives of the people and do so without let or hindrance; and, indeed, with the assistance of the authorities and the police.

</p>

<a name="50406-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Now we have a piece of legislation which will keep people away from the doors of our great and ancient Parliament. We will discourage them from coming here and will put them at the risk of arrest, as far as I understand, for the minor offences that they may commit. I cannot hope to emulate the language of the noble Baroness. She put the case so well that it needs little addition, but I emphasise that the most disgraceful part of the proposal is that it comes from the Labour Party&#151;a party that was built on the right of people to speak and to act in support of freedom, to demonstrate&#151;particularly against Tory governments&#151;when things were going wrong and to allow trade unionists to march in the vicinity of this place. I think that trade unionists shall still be able to do so, but I do not see why it should be only them.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_769"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 769</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>I wish to express my sheer disappointment that we should have this type of legislation from the party of which I was a member for 54 years, which I admired throughout that period and for which I worked with great alacrity. I regret the passing of such a party.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="50406-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I shall be brief, as I spoke at some length on this matter yesterday. It is not often that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, but I am delighted with his contribution today. The point that I made yesterday was right&#151;if I may remind the Minister again&#151;that when the Leader of the House of Commons, Peter Hain, was the chairman of my Young Liberal movement, he and I repeatedly passed outside the House, shouting various slogans. It would be nice to seek his opinion on this clause&#151;but I shall leave that matter on one side.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>My reason for standing up was to talk about Amendment No. 17. Its purpose very much relates to the comments of my noble friend Lady Williams. We believe that the reduction by the Government from six days to 24 hours of the need to notify the commissioner still does not allow spontaneous protests in the vicinity of Parliament. The purpose of our amendment is to remove this provision and to ensure that spontaneous demonstrations are possible.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>There is one other concern, about Black Rod&#039;s Garden. My noble friend Lady Williams talked about the Houses of Parliament. I take it that that includes Black Rod&#039;s Garden.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="50406-14_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I should like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that the Labour Party has not changed in the 54 years in which he has been a member&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="50406-14_spnew3"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="50406-14_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   To this extent, my Lords. We still passionately believe in the freedom of assembly and the freedom to demonstrate. We are proud, too, of the right, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said, to assemble before Parliament to demonstrate before the elected Members.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I should also like to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, that we similarly believe that great credit should be given to our democracy for that ability to protest. We do not believe that the controls that we put in place are capricious, as she fears; they have to be judiciously and reasonably exercised. It is incumbent on any commissioner who has this duty and capacity to exercise that power reasonably. As she knows, there are perfectly robust ways of ensuring that the proper exercise of that power is maintained and is not capriciously used. It will therefore be incumbent on the Metropolitan Police Commissioner to act reasonably. Therefore, it is putting the case far too high to suggest that it would be impossible for reasonable protest to continue.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_770"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 770</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I remind the House that although it is reasonably understood, the concern that has been expressed is not justified. These clauses would require protesters to give prior notice of their protest to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. However, he or she is obliged&#151;I emphasise that word&#151;to authorise the demonstration. It will, however, be open to him or her to attach conditions to the authorisation where necessary; for example, to safeguard the operation of Parliament or to prevent a security risk in the area. &quot;Necessary&quot; is an important word. If you can combine necessity with reasonableness, then it is quite clear that the power would have to be judiciously and properly exercised.

</p>

<a name="50406-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The Government believe that no point in the designated area may be more than one kilometre in a straight line from the point nearest to it in Parliament Square. I say straightaway to the noble Lord, Lord   Monson, that I understand his preference to use the old ways of defining distance rather than metres. I have that prejudice myself. However, in this we have to move with the times, and it would be more appropriate to remain in kilometres.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I can assure the House that the Government intend to lay an order on the precise area to be covered. We intend to consult with the Metropolitan Police on this   area so that it covers the area where the demonstrations that disrupt the work of Parliament and hinder access to the House take place. In this Bill we do not want to restrict unnecessarily the area that will be covered.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>As I indicated yesterday, we are aware of concerns about the designated area taking in Trafalgar Square, a matter which has been raised in this House on a number of occasions. The House can be assured that in exercising the order-making power we shall ensure that Trafalgar Square is excluded. As a result, demonstrations could continue there without the need for prior notification from the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The nature of a demonstration may well change during the course of the demonstration, and as such it is entirely appropriate that the senior officer on the ground should be able to vary the conditions to reflect the changing conditions. That is already the case. Under the Public Order Act, in the case of processions, the senior officer on the scene could attach additional conditions in certain circumstances; for example, if there is a serious threat of disorder. So that is not a new change; it merely confirms the position that has existed for some time.

</p>

<a name="50406-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I turn to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Dholakia, on timing. The Government have responded to the concerns expressed about the requirement to give at least six days&#039; notice of any demonstration. In Committee yesterday, the House agreed an amendment that recognises that there should   be provision for a shorter period of notice&#151;24   hours&#151;in exceptional circumstances. For example, a demonstration may be organised as a response to an event that could not be foreseen, precisely as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said. An important issue could spring up at very short notice and it would be important to demonstrate about it. This provision allows that to take place in a way that is proper.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_771"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 771</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The Government believe that the notice period is an   essential part of these provisions, so that the commissioner is able to consider the circumstances of the demonstration and its likely effect on the work of Parliament and the security of the area around it. He can then set conditions that are appropriate and proportionate. The Government have recognised that there may be occasions when demonstrations are organised as a response to events that, as I said, could not have been foreseen. We have therefore shortened the notice in response.

<a name="50406-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>So what we have done both on the ambit of the designated area and the notice period is to respond in what we hope is a positive and sensible way to the concerns that have been properly expressed. I make it clear that it is no part of the Government&#039;s intent to restrict the proper demonstrations that should continue to occur on those matters about which the public feel strongly. That is a fundamental part of our democracy, of which we are justly proud.

<a name="50406-14_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister very much for what she said and indeed for her reference to Trafalgar Square, which I mentioned on Second Reading. She made a very eloquent and reasonable defence of the position of the commissioner, and I accept that what she said is correct. The Government are very fortunate to have the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, to argue their bad case.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I was, however, particularly concerned about the supplementary provisions, which among other things refer not to &quot;a serious disturbance to the life of the community&quot; but only to &quot;any disturbance to the life of the community&quot;. I used the word &quot;capricious&quot; because those words are so wide and go so far beyond what is provided in the Public Order Act that the nature of the   demonstration will allow far more of those supplementary provisions to be relevant.
</p>

<a name="50406-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>However, in view of the lateness of the hour and my sense that it is a fairly empty House, it would be inappropriate to press the issue to a Division. So, with great sadness, at this point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50406-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dholakia </b>   moved Amendment No. 19:
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>Leave out Clause 141</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment has the support of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and my noble friend Lady   Falkner of Margravine. We spoke at some length to this matter yesterday but the Minister did not address two issues in reply. I therefore wish to raise them again.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_772"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 772</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The issue relates essentially to the proposal in Clause   138 to reverse the presumption on withholding from the public the identity of a child accused of breaching an ASBO. The current legislative presumption that a child subject to criminal proceedings should not be identified enshrines the principle of Article 40 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;State parties recognise the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognised as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child&#039;s sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child&#039;s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child&#039;s age and the desirability of the child&#039;s reintegration and the child&#039;s assuming a constructive role in society&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The convention goes on to state that the states parties shall ensure that children alleged as or accused of having infringed the penal law shall have the guarantee that their privacy will be fully respected at all stages of the proceedings. We ask whether naming and shaming individuals is compatible with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="50406-15_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   My Lords, my name is also attached to the amendment and I strongly support the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, relating to the convention. Last night I mentioned the issue of scrutiny. While much of the Bill was scrutinised in the other place, this aspect of it received no consideration there. We had an occasion to discuss it late last night but, given that those on the front line are so concerned about the Government&#039;s current agenda of improving services for children and giving more thought to the needs of those who work directly with children, we should give the matter careful consideration and listen to those concerns.
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Last night I raised the issue of research into the impact of publishing the names of these children&#151;a practice that has been going on for several years. When the Anti-social Behaviour Bill passed through this House, I urged the Minister to produce research into the consequences of that activity. At the time, I believe that the Minister replied that it would be too difficult to carry out such research, and she repeated that in her response last night.

</p>

<a name="50406-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I am also concerned at the division that such a practice might provoke among agencies working together to improve outcomes for children. I shall come to that later.
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I reflect on my experience of being responsible for the type of children covered by this clause. I remember 20 years ago working in an intermediate treatment centre with a 10 year-old traveller boy. He would hit all the workers and, to ingratiate himself, would tell obscene jokes about his mother to the older boys&#151;he was by far the youngest in the centre. He was a deeply troubling and deeply troubled young man.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_773"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 773</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I think of a boy with whom I worked last year&#151;a 10   year-old, who got into fights with other children. One lunchtime, we came across him lolling in a tyre-shaped inflatable, rocking himself backwards and forwards like an infant. It was only towards the end of our time working with him that we learned that he had just come out of care and had been newly adopted.
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I think of a young man with whom I worked recently who had just come out of his minority. He demanded attention from all the staff and young people in the hostel and made himself deeply unpopular. He was eventually excluded from the hostel but fortunately he has found another place.

</p>

<a name="50406-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Those are the kinds of young people whom we are discussing now. As the noble Baroness herself made clear in a conversation that we had on this subject, she recognises that many of the young people whom we are discussing and who will be caught by this clause are the kind of young people to whom I have referred. In its evidence to the Select Committee on Education and Skills in the other place, the Association of Chief Police Officers said that it was important to recognise,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;that children who commit offences, without excusing them or trying to defend them, are exactly the same constituency as children who get excluded from school, children who become in need of protection or have CAMS [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services] needs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Last night, the noble Baroness spoke of the difficulties of research in this area. I recognise that it can be difficult to conduct such research where there are a number of interventions with these children and their families and where there are parenting orders and so on. Nevertheless, if we are to encourage the local media to publicise the identities and photographs of these children&#151;we have been doing so for several years now&#151;it is incumbent on us, if we really believe that every child matters, to conduct as rigorous research as we can to find out what happens as a result.
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I was pleased to be put in touch by the Minister with one of her civil servants to ask about research. He told me that the Youth Justice Board will shortly undertake some research in this area. So I urge the Minister to wait until we know better what the impact of the very controversial publication of these children&#039;s names would be before proceeding on this matter. I share the concerns of those outside that, if these children and their families are identified, they may become the targets of people in the local area. I am concerned that labelling them in this way may reinforce some of the bad behaviours that we are seeing and that it may impact on the children&#039;s rehabilitation.

</p>

<a name="50406-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>We need research, but that has not been forthcoming. There is a possibility of it taking place in the future&#151;fairly soon, I hope. So let us wait until the outcome of that research is available to us and to the courts which have to make decisions in this area. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="50406-15_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Stern: </b>   My Lords, I do not want to repeat what was said last night; I just want to make one point. Since the mid-19th century, people concerned with the welfare of children have been working towards <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_774"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 774</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enshrining in law measures for their protection. One aim of the campaigners has been that the identity of children in court, children in trouble and children from problem families should not come into the public domain. As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said last night, protecting the privacy of children has always been a basic principle of the youth court and, before that, the juvenile court. We frequently hear in the media about, for example, a 16 year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons, and we accept that that is how the law works.

</p>

<a name="50406-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>That principle has become fundamental when dealing with youths in trouble, and there are reasons for that. One is that they may be exposed to danger by hounding, vilification or violence, and another reason is that they should enter adulthood without carrying with them a bad reputation which they gained before they were of an age to be deemed fully responsible.
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Those principles are enshrined in United Nations treaties, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, reminded us, and accepted throughout the world. Yet, here we are discussing a Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill&#151;not policy about children, youth crime, youth courts, neighbourhoods or any relevant topic&#151;and, without proper discussion and without any substantial analysis, we propose to throw in the rubbish bin the received wisdom of all those who care for the rights of children and who fought for them for nearly two centuries. In my view, we should not be doing that; we should certainly not be doing it without giving it a great deal more thought than we are in relation to this Bill. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="50406-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, I rise briefly to add my support for the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and also to add one extra point in support of my noble friend Lady Stern and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel.
</p>

<a name="50406-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>At present, in areas such as parts of Merseyside and the Wirral, there are populations of children who will fit into the description of children who, if this law comes into being, will be named and shamed. At the moment, a great deal of effort is put into various agencies working together to try to prevent that. I fear that, if this legislation goes through, the various agencies will have less patience in relation to such children and there will be a tendency to say, &quot;All right, we have given them sufficient time so let&#039;s put the law into effect by exposing them&quot;. I think that that would be a very dangerous practice.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="50406-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I understand the anxiety about which the noble Lord, Lord Chan, speaks. I also understand the passion that causes the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and others to bring the issue to the fore. The plight of these very vulnerable and often damaged children is of the utmost importance. I want to make it absolutely clear that we understand that. However, we also recognise that, because of the nature and extent of their damage, many of those children are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_775"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 775</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

also damaging in the way in which they behave and in the threat that they may, from time to time, present. We have to recognise that there is a small cadre of children&#151;it is not all of them&#151;who fall into that group.

</p>

<a name="50406-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>As I said last night, the question is how we should respond to those children. Yesterday, I outlined the broad spectrum of interventions that noble Lords graciously agreed were helpful in ameliorating the level of dysfunction and addressing the needs of such children, which, I respectfully suggest, are perhaps greater than they have been for a very long time. The Government have invested considerable energy in ensuring that those better provisions are available.

</p>

<a name="50406-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>With regard to these measures, it is important that the courts and professionals who deal with such children understand the nature of the difficulties that they face and the broad spectrum of provisions that now apply to them. So the juvenile Bench, which has the proper training, will determine which cases should or should not have disclosure of identity. Professional judges, who have the skill, training and aptitude to deal with the cases, will judge the proportionate response to make.

</p>

<a name="50406-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I understand the concern expressed, but the provisions are proportionate. They are entirely compatible with the convention to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia mentioned it. Two important safeguards ensure compliance with the terms and the spirit of the convention. The court will retain discretion to make reporting restrictions where it considers that such restrictions are necessary; for example, in the best interests of the child or in the interests of justice. As the order is generally subject to publication, there is no anonymity to protect in this context. I remind the House that the issue of publicity in such cases will have been dealt with at the making of the ASBO.

</p>

<a name="50406-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The reason why we introduced the anti-social behaviour orders in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is well known. I remind your Lordships of a case. We believe that it is right for the community to know that an anti-social behaviour order has been granted, and in the case of <i>Stanley</i> v <i>London Borough of Brent/Metropolitan Police Service</i> in October 2004 it was accepted that ASBOs needed publicity to operate and that appropriate and proportionate publicity was compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998. Equally, we feel that it is right that it is known what happens if one is breached, so that everyone is clear about the consequences of a breach. Otherwise the community will lose confidence in the system designed to protect it. However, we are mindful of the distinct issues that surround offenders who are under 18, as I have already made clear. That is why we have issued specific guidance on publicity and highlighted the fact that specific consideration should be given to the age of the individual perpetrators and whether they are vulnerable.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_776"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 776</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>We listened carefully to the concerns raised in the House during yesterday&#039;s debate. We intend to retain the clause, but we propose to address some of those concerns as follows. I make it plain that we believe that some of those concerns are proper concerns. We shall issue guidance via our Together website and a step-by-step guide on the operation of the new clause prior to its commencement. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, requested that yesterday in the Chamber. That guidance will make it clear that, in a breach case involving an under 18 year-old, although the presumption will initially be in favour of allowing publicity, the court must consider whether publicity was allowed when the anti-social behaviour order was initially granted. If it was not, then unless there has been a significant change in the intervening period, publicity should normally be refused. If publicity was originally allowed, it should again be allowed, unless the court directs otherwise. I hope that noble Lords will consider that a robust and proper response to a concern properly and judiciously expressed.
</p>

<a name="50406-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>We shall also ensure that the guidance clearly refers to welfare and safeguarding issues, so that they are in the mind of the court when it makes its decision. We believe that that provides a way forward that addresses the needs of the community and of the young offender in a reasonable, balanced and proportionate way. I urge your Lordships to retain Clause 141.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="50406-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have supported the amendment. I accept and appreciate much of the Government&#039;s work on youth justice, but like the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, I still find it difficult to accept that a Bill that deals with serious crime should incorporate provisions for naming and shaming our children. That does not fit in the Bill. As the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said, more research is vital. For that reason, it is right that we should put on record our concern. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<br>
   (2)   &quot;Relevant vehicle insurance information&quot; means information relating to vehicles the use of which has been (but no longer is) insured under a policy of insurance, or security in respect of third party risks, complying with the requirements of Part 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52).

   (3)   The regulations may in particular&#151;

<p><a name="st_117"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in Committee yesterday I indicated in response to two amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Simon that we would bring forward these amendments which effectively import into the Bill two clauses from the Road Safety Bill. As noble Lords will know, unfortunately that Bill did not survive the wash-up.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The two new clauses will, first, enable the police to have access to insurance industry data relating to vehicles whose use is no longer insured; and, secondly, permit police to carry out an evidential breath test not only at a police station, but also at a hospital or at or near a place, such as the roadside, where a preliminary breath test has been administered. In the last of these situations the police constable making the requirement must be in uniform. I hope that will suffice. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="50406-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I have Amendment No. 22 in this group of government amendments, which is tabled as an amendment to Amendment No. 21. I believe that the whole group still stands. I look to the noble Baroness for guidance. I think the Table agrees with that. Therefore, I can go ahead.

</p>

<a name="50406-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I apologise for taking time: the whole point of this was not to. As the noble Baroness said, yesterday, amendments were tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, and I and others added our names in support of those amendments to new clauses. When the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, introduced the amendment, he made clear that, at this late stage in the Bill, we anticipated that the whole point was that we should have further opportunity to debate these matters after an election, whatever government happened to occupy the government Benches then.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The noble Viscount moved his amendment at 10.45 p.m. I added my support to that view at that late stage. The Government seized on that opportunity with a &quot;whoopee&quot; to put them into the Bill straight away. I cannot complain about that because I support the clauses, as did my honourable and right honourable friends in another place, but that highlights the difficulty that we have in wash-up&#151;as has been noted earlier&#151;because we rush through a large and important Bill of this nature with insufficient scrutiny. Although I and the noble Viscount support the clauses&#151;naturally, the Government do&#151;other Members of this House may not and are therefore denied the opportunity for detailed debate.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I have therefore tabled Amendment No. 22 merely to ask the noble Baroness to put on record some reassurances about one aspect of a change to be made. In the past, whenever a breath test has been taken, the screening test&#151;the first test, if I may put it that way&#151;may be done at the roadside. The change is that the second, the evidential, test may now be taken by the roadside or at a hospital, instead of only at a police station. The noble Baroness looks pregnant with information.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="50406-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Yes, my Lords, it was probably remiss of me. I really wanted to shorten this debate and I honestly confess to the noble Baroness that I had forgotten that this was the time for me to make a full explanation. I am happy to do that; I thought that, as we were all going to agree, it would go through quickly, but I apologise to her for failing to recollect that that was the purpose. If it will assist her, I will now go through how the provisions will operate, so that she does not have be put to the trouble of doing so herself.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>We have made the changes to the second new clause&#151;powers to require specimens of breath at the roadside or at a hospital&#151;in response to comments made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its 13th report of Session 2004&#150;05 about clauses in the Road Safety Bill that the committee considered to be at risk of incompatibility with Article 5 of the ECHR. The Government are grateful to the committee for its advice and are acting accordingly to deal with that matter.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The effect of the changes is to modify the conditions under which a constable must release from detention a person who has been detained following a requirement to provide a specimen of breath, blood or alcohol. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_780"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 780</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

They require that a constable should be able to detain a person only if he has reasonable grounds for believing that that person would commit an offence under Sections 4 or 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 if released. The two amendments to Clause 177 are consequential on the insertion of those two new clauses.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I turn to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. It may help if I explain that procedures for dealing with drink/drive cases are covered by a precisely worded set of documents, known as the MGDD forms, that can be found on the Home Office website. The key form includes the following passage, which it may be convenient if I read into the record:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;As the specimen with the lower proportion of alcohol is in excess of the prescribed limit, but contains no more than 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, you may claim that it should be replaced by a specimen for a laboratory test. If you elect to provide such a specimen it will be of blood or urine which, in the case of blood, will be taken by a doctor (or health care professional) . . .  You will be supplied with part of the specimen if you so require. The other part will be sent to a forensic laboratory for analysis. The result of the analysis of the laboratory specimen will replace the result of the breath test. Do you wish to provide a specimen for laboratory alcohol analysis?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The police, in conjunction with the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service, will adapt those forms to deal with the roadside and hospital circumstances for breath testing. I can assure the noble Baroness and other noble Lords that the procedures to be undertaken at the roadside will be no less rigorous than those at the police station. The history of drink/drive law has been peppered with challenges in the courts. That is why Sections 4 to 11 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 have been amended only where absolutely necessary&#151;and then with great care and attention.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I hope that that will better explain to anyone who is not in the Chamber but able to read our proceedings later how the provisions will interact.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="50406-17_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, as this is Report, may I interpret that as a very helpful intervention from the noble Baroness, so that this is not my second speech on the same group of amendments? The best laid plans go awry, because I telephoned the noble Baroness&#039;s office first thing this morning to explain why I was tabling the amendment and that there was no hostile intent.
</p>

<a name="50406-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I thank her for anticipating all the questions that I would have asked about my amendment and giving a more thorough and helpful explanation than may have been possible in another place on 25 January, when Standing Committee A was considering the Road Safety Bill. When we reach my amendment in the list, I shall not move it.

   (5)   For subsection (2) substitute&#151;

(c)   at or near a place where a relevant breath test has been administered to the person concerned or would have been so administered but for his failure to co-operate with it.


<br>
(2A)   For the purposes of this section &quot;a relevant breath test&quot; is a procedure involving the provision by the person concerned of a specimen of breath to be used for the purpose of obtaining an indication whether the proportion of alcohol in his breath or blood is likely to exceed the prescribed limit.


<br>
(2B)   A requirement under this section to provide specimens of   breath may not be made at or near a place mentioned in subsection (2)(c) above unless the constable making it&#151;

(a)   is in uniform, or


<br>
(b)   has imposed a requirement on the person concerned to co-operate with a relevant breath test in circumstances in which section 6(5) of this Act applies.


<br>
(2C)   Where a constable has imposed a requirement on the person concerned to co-operate with a relevant breath test at any place, he is entitled to remain at or near that place in order to impose on him there a requirement under this section.


<br>
(2D)   If a requirement under subsection (1)(a) above has been made at a place other than at a police station, such a requirement may subsequently be made at a police station if (but only if)&#151;


<br>
(a)   a device or a reliable device of the type mentioned in subsection (1)(a) above was not available at that place or it was for any other reason not practicable to use such a device there, or

<br>
&quot;(2A)   If the person who makes a claim under subsection (2) above was required to provide specimens of breath under section 7 of this Act at or near a place mentioned in subsection (2)(c) of that section, a constable may arrest him without warrant.&quot;

<p><a name="st_127"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is an important amendment that will allow SOCA to be included in the provisions that exempt police, fire and ambulance vehicles from speed limits, where it is necessary in pursuit of their functions. Section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, which makes that exemption, will not automatically extend to SOCA as the   agency will not be a police body pursuing police purposes. Noble Lords may recognise that similar provisions were included in the Road Safety Bill. They have therefore enjoyed previous scrutiny and debate. However, as that Bill will not receive Royal Assent in the current session, it is essential that we make provision for that exemption in the SOCA Bill. There are safeguards inherent in the amendment that will limit the exemption to SOCA staff who are carrying out the purposes of the agency and those who are undergoing training to do so. Furthermore, the exemption covers only those vehicles driven by someone who has had training to drive at high speeds. With those considerations, I invite noble Lords to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="50406-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The advisory council points out that, although the amendment is welcome as a specific response to one problem, the original clause in the Road Safety Bill had a wider remit. It applied to fire, ambulance and police services and other prescribed purposes. That has been omitted from the Government&#039;s new amendment&#151;naturally, because this is not the Road Safety Bill. The noble Baroness said that that Bill had been drowned in the wash-up. It is hardly surprising, given the vast raft of Bills that the Government introduced in the Queen&#039;s Speech knowing full well that they could not get through. Indeed, their own noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton, in the latest edition of <i>The House Magazine</i>, trumpeted broadly the fact that everybody knew that the Government had done that knowing that a load of Bills would fail. Here is such an example, but we have managed to salvage something, on which all-party agreement has been reached, to tuck into this Bill, which looks as though it will have a safe passage today.

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The advisory council says that it would be very helpful if the Minister could give a reassurance that if this particular Government&#151;I have changed its wording to include the word &quot;particular&quot;&#151;were in office and intended to return to such matters, they would look at the wider issue after the general election.

I agree that that should not be overlooked in future legislation. I invite the noble Baroness to give the appropriate reassurances.

<a name="50406-19_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I crave the indulgence of the House. Once we get into Committee it will be inappropriate to make general remarks about the Bill. Therefore, this is the only opportunity to do so. I shall not take more than a few moments of the House&#039;s time.
</p>

<a name="50406-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>These attenuated procedures in which we find ourselves are all very well but they are attenuated. We should realise that there are people outside this place who are very disappointed that the Bill is going through this procedure. As I said at Second Reading, it is a seductive Bill, but it could be much better. There are those outside who wish that the Bill had been stopped so that it could have been brought back and given full, detailed attention. So be it. We made our concerns plain at Second Reading. I thank the Minister for the very full letter that he sent to us all after that stage; it certainly helped with the necessary background information.
</p>

<a name="50406-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I am not sure whether I found it satisfactory that the biggest source of funding for the cost of the Bill, which is still largely uncosted, is savings that are yet to be made. That is a peculiar approach. A number of other matters which we shall not consider today still cause us concern. I have received representations on lighting&#151;one of the subjects whose interested parties had hoped the Bill would be given proper consideration&#151;and the Outdoor Advertising Association, which is concerned that it might be caught by fly-posting.
</p>

<a name="50406-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>We have particular concerns still on the adequacy of resourcing the transfer of responsibility for dogs from the police service to local government, although the Minister has given me an assurance that that transfer has to be made by order and cannot be made without the agreement of the Local Government Association. Therefore, one hopes that the matter will be cleared.

</p>

<a name="50406-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>We still have concerns about fly-tipping. The Minister has given assurances that landowners who are in no way involved in fly-tipping have the same defence that exists under Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act   1990, as has always existed. That is all very well, but the landowner can still be left with high costs. If no one has responsibility for clearing up fly-tipping and the landowner likes to keep his land tidy, in the end he is the one who pays the bill, which sometimes can be very hard. A possible alternative, of course, would be for him to dump what is fly-tipped on his land on the roadside verge, at which point the Act would intervene.
</p>

<a name="50406-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>There are a number of concerns about the Bill, which means that, good though the Bill is, it ought to have gone through the full procedure. The Government have taken their decision to go the country. We have to live with that. I have intervened at this stage simply because I cannot do so appropriately later. We will do what we can to co-operate with the rest of the procedures today. The Minister was warned that I intended to say something, for which I hope he will forgive me.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="50406-19_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   My Lords, I confess that I had intended saying a few brief things on the first amendment; that is, until I felt that the noble Baroness on the Government Front Bench was glowering at me too much.

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>This is not the most momentous Bill before the House in this wash-up. Some people may think that it is not very important and can therefore just be nodded through. In practice, the Bill may have a more direct effect on the lives of ordinary people than many of the far more momentous things that we talk about that might affect some people very greatly. This Bill will affect almost everybody. It is about the quality and the maintenance of their own neighbourhood, their own area, their own countryside and so forth.
</p>

<a name="50406-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>It is an important Bill. To that extent I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. It is a real shame that we have been unable to go through it and worry out clause by clause how it will affect people in the streets, villages and so on, but we cannot, and that is all there is to it. Given that we cannot, it is right that the Bill should go through in its present form, particularly with the two or three helpful amendments that the Minister will move.

</p>

<a name="50406-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The only issue on which I still have nagging doubts is the gating provisions and whether, particularly in areas such as Pennine towns and villages, they could be used to block off legitimate access to countryside walks and footpaths.

Apart from that, we are here to do a job of work which will not take long. So let us get on with it.

Given the circumstances and the parliamentary timetable with which we are faced, it will be worthwhile legislation. The assurances that I have tried to give in the letter and at Second Reading have met many of the points raised. However, there will be other points, including gating, and the responsibilities for clearing fly-tipping waste, as raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, to which the House will need to return at some point.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>Page 74, line 32, after &quot;from&quot; insert &quot;relevant&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment will change the wording of Clause 3 to make it an offence to expose or advertise two or more motor vehicles on a road within 500 metres of each other, rather than, as the original Bill said, when they are parked on the same road. That deals   directly with a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, at Second Reading, to which I think other noble Lords referred as well. It will ensure that the offence can be committed whether cars are parked on the same road, on different roads at a crossroads, where a series of roads come together or where one road changes its name. So long as they are within 500 metres of each other, we can now take action to stop the use of the highway for a sales pitch. I think that that is the desired outcome we were all seeking, and I ask the Committee to accept the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am extremely grateful to the Minister for the amendment, which does exactly what I asked for at Second Reading and which I think was also raised in the House of Commons. I assure the Minister that the problem is one on which some of us will report back very soon with regard to whether the provisions are working or not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   At Second Reading, I raised the question of what was and what was not a road. Can the Minister give us slightly greater clarity on that? In country areas where people do exactly the same thing but are half-parked on the verge, or on the verge in what I call &quot;old spa towns&quot;, will that be covered in guidance or whatever the Government introduce? I raised the issue at Second Reading, and I would be grateful for clarification.
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   The provision relates to the highway, which includes the pavement to the highway, but it would not include grass verges, as I tried to make clear at Second Reading. That is partly because the nature of ownership and the status of verges varies considerably, and we have had to stick with the definition of the highway. It relates to roads, pavements and their equivalent but not most grass verges.
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   Perhaps I may raise the issue again with the Minister because it could be a problem in villages where the same sort of action could take place. This is just a nudge to ask whether it is something that   the Minister could consider in the longer term. Obviously, we are running out of time with the Bill, but it is equally irritating, if you live in a rural village, to have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_789"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 789</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it spoilt by people doing exactly the same as they do in towns. Just because a verge is not considered a highway does not seem to be adequate grounds for not trying to do something about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   I can undertake to look at this again, but it is quite complex because of the status and ownership of the land. What might be regarded from any common-sense point of view as grass verges in some villages I can think of reveal complexities in ownership. Substantial problems could arise in dealing with those issues. While I take the point made by the noble Baroness, I do not think that I would be able to deal with it within the context of this clause, even if we had the time. I hope that the noble Baroness will take my assurance that I will look at the matter again for the future.

</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Whitty </b>   moved Amendment No. 2:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>Page 17, line 8, leave out &quot;specifying standards under subsection   (5)(b) above&quot; and insert &quot;discharging its functions under this section&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>The noble Lord said: The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, raised this concern in relation to the provisions on fly-tipping. Indeed, at Second Reading several noble Lords were concerned that litter clearing notices might be used by local authorities to require occupiers or landlords to clear fly-tipped waste from their land. They feared that this would circumvent the safeguards for occupiers and landowners set out in Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which gives such a power to enforcement agencies in the case of fly-tipped waste, but contains a defence that the occupier did not himself deposit or knowingly cause or permit the deposit of the waste. As I made clear in my response to the debate, it would not be appropriate to use this clause in those circumstances because it relates to litter clearing notices rather than fly-tipped waste.
</p>

<a name="50406-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>We will make that clear in guidance and, if accepted, this amendment will put that guidance on a statutory basis. It will require principal litter authorities to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales in relation to any aspect of the discharge of their functions in respect of litter clearing notices under new Section 92A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which will be introduced by this clause. Currently the clause allows guidance to be given only in relation to standards that may be specified in a notice for the clearance of litter or refuse from the land.

</p>

<a name="50406-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I shall clear up any remaining confusion about the powers under Clause 50, to which cross-reference was made at Second Reading, in relation to removing fly-tipped waste. As I said, Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 enables the enforcement agencies to require an occupier who knowingly allows his land to be used for fly-tipping to remove the fly-tipped waste. Clause 50 will extend this power to landowners, but only in the situation where there is no occupier. In addition, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_790"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 790</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the occupier&#151;and under Clause 50 the landowner as well&#151;will still have the defence that I referred to under Clause 59 of the Environmental Protection Act that they did not knowingly cause or permit the deposit of waste.
</p>

<a name="50406-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The change will help the enforcing authorities to bring irresponsible landowners within the remit of legislation without penalising the victims of fly-tipping. It will help deal in particular with problems that have occurred in urban areas where sites with no occupier, but clearly a landowner in the form of an absentee landlord, are used as illegal waste dumps. Such landlords are not covered by the present provisions, and in effect such a landlord has allowed his land to be used as an illegal waste dump and is thus the target of this clause. However, the defence of not knowingly having permitted land to be used is still valid and, indeed, is extended to the landowner. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="50406-20_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   This is a welcome clarification. The fact that the authority must have regard to the guidance, which the Minister has assured us will be appropriate to meet our concerns, relieves us all. While I support the amendment, my only remaining concern is that situations can arise where waste is fly-tipped, but no one will clear it up because the landowner has   committed no offence and the occupier either cannot be found or has also committed no offence. Nevertheless, the waste has been dumped and has to be dealt with. I fear that that will be a continuing residual problem and there is real concern that the liability will fall on the responsible landowner who wishes to keep his land in a fit state.
</p>

<a name="50406-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The alternative is for every landowner to erect along his boundaries with the highway a six or eight-foot high fence that is deer-proof and proof against people tipping anything over it. That would not improve the look of the countryside.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="50406-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I have already spoken to the Minister, who was kind enough to write to me following our debate at Second Reading in a letter dated 4 April. Since this is the only way I can ensure that it is put in the public record, I have had the Minister&#039;s approval to read out the section dealing with the issue. It is an important matter and should be recorded. Pieces of paper related to the Bill sadly can get lost. I am grateful to the Minister, who in his letter addresses litter clearing notices and fly-tipped waste:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;There was significant debate during Second Reading about the   differences between clause 20, on litter clearing notices, and clause 50, which provides a power to require the landowner to remove fly-tipped waste.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;It may be helpful if I explain the background to litter clearing notices. Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities can designate areas as litter control areas if they consider that they are defaced by litter. Within such areas, occupiers of land that is accessible to the public have a duty to keep their land clear of litter and refuse. If they fail to do so, the local authority can issue a litter abatement notice requiring them to clear the land, and also to prevent it becoming defaced again by litter and refuse. Refusal to comply with a litter abatement order is an offence.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;The system has not worked well, as local authorities have found it complicated to use. It is not well suited to dealing with isolated problems and does not cover land that is not accessible to <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_791"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 791</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>the public. It is thus not possible currently to deal with, for example, gardens of unoccupied houses, building sites and waste ground, all of which can be heavily degraded by litter and refuse, with adverse effects on the amenity of the surrounding area.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;To remedy these effects, Clause 20 gives local authorities a power to issue litter clearing notices in respect of any land (other than land which another agency already has a statutory duty to keep clear of litter); this will require the occupier (or, if none, the owner) of the land to clear it of litter and, where appropriate, to take steps to prevent it from becoming heavily littered again. Litter clearing notices will be much simpler to use than the existing arrangements, doing away with the two-tier litter control area and litter abatement notice system and enabling local authorities to deal immediately with areas of land that are seriously defaced with litter. They will also be simpler to enforce, with the option of using fixed penalty fines, and will enable local authorities to specify standards of compliance.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;Litter clearing notices are intended to deal with litter that accumulates over time in one place. They thus differ from the provisions of section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which addresses the problem of illegally deposited waste&#151;fly-tipping. Among other things, it enables the enforcement agencies to require an occupier who knowingly allows his land to be used for fly-tipping to remove the fly-tipped waste. Clause 50 of the Bill will extend this power to landowners where there is no occupier. This will help to deal with problems that have occurred, particularly in urban areas, where there is no occupier and an absentee landlord is allowing his land to be used as an illegal waste dump. The defence that an occupier (and now landowner) did not knowingly cause or permit the deposit of waste will remain. This change will help the enforcing authorities bring irresponsible landowners within the remit of legislation, without penalising the victims of fly-tipping&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The letter continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;During the debate a number of speakers asked why the defence in section 59 of the EPA was not being extended to clause 20. This is because, in the situations litter clearing notices are designed to address, there is no suggestion that the occupier has consented to their land becoming covered with litter. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect occupiers to take steps to ensure that their land is kept free of large amounts of litter. Land that is covered in litter can degrade a whole neighbourhood; litter is blown onto other land, more littering and other types of anti-social behaviour is encouraged, and the environmental quality of the area is reduced. The law recognises that nuisances that affect other people need to be controlled, and litter, together with land covered in litter, is such a nuisance. While we encourage tough action against those dropping litter, owners and occupiers also have responsibilities.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;I can confirm what I said in the debate, namely that litter clearing notices are not intended to be used to deal with fly-tipped waste, and it would not be appropriate for local authorities to use them for this purpose. The only exception will be for small-scale fly-tipping where, for example, a bag of rubbish is left on land that is already heavily littered. We would certainly not expect litter clearing notices to be used to deal with large scale instances of fly-tipping. We will be making this clear in the guidance we will issue,   and to strengthen this I have tabled an amendment to sub-section 7 of clause 20&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>which we are now debating&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;that will put this guidance on a statutory basis; the amendment requires principal litter authorities to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State (or the National Assembly in Wales) in discharging their functions under clause 20&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>I apologise for that rather long submission but it is important that landowners should understand the commitment that the Government have given. I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to read out his letter and for bringing forward the amendment today.

<a name="50406-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, for reading the letter. It will be very helpful to have it in <i>Hansard</i>.

</p>

<a name="50406-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The only point I wish to make is that whichever party forms the government of this country after 5 May&#151;it may be us; who knows?&#151;I hope that it will produce the necessary guidance quickly. The powers in relation to fly-tipping and littered land in urban areas are very important and the sooner local authorities have those powers the sooner they will be able to tackle some of the eyesores that exist at the moment. These are proving intractable for the reasons set out by the Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="50406-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Dillington: </b>   I am still not very relaxed about Clause 20. I have a series of questions&#151;most of which probably reflect my ignorance of the way in which these things work&#151;about which I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me.
</p>

<a name="50406-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>First, what is the legal difference between littering and fly-tipping? In other words, what clarity do I have, as a farmer whose land has been despoiled by a visitor to the countryside, that the mess created falls under Clause 50, of which I approve, or under Clause 20, of which, in its current form, I do not?

</p>

<a name="50406-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The Minister has kindly agreed to provide statutory guidance to local authorities but I remain slightly unconvinced by that route. Without the guidance being on the face of the Bill, what is to prevent the &quot;appropriate person&quot;, or a future &quot;appropriate person&quot;, changing the guidance without Parliament having a say? To what extent will the guidance become an implicit part of the Act? As I said, these questions are based on ignorance of the way in which these things work.
</p>

<a name="50406-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>My last question is a probing one. It seems from the answers that we have so far received that Clause 20 is specifically directed at the urban environment and at land which, when littered, creates a nuisance&#151;an effect which may devalue people&#039;s property or damage the quality of their lives. I get the impression that the Government do not intend it to apply to farmers&#151;or to anyone in a rural situation for that matter. I hope the Minister will be able to clarify that.
</p>

<a name="50406-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>If that is the case, could not the Government agree to an amendment to Clause 20? At page 16, line 33, proposed new Section 92A(1) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;A principal litter authority may in accordance with this section serve a notice  . . . in relation to any land in its area which is open to the air&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I would look to see added to that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;and is within the curtilage of a domestic or business property which is contiguous to other property not in the same ownership&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I apologise for suggesting a verbal amendment but the circumstances are quite strange in this wash-up Session. That, of course, may not be the exact wording, but I remain convinced that the clause needs to be more focused. Implicit in the Minister&#039;s letter is an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_793"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 793</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

acknowledgement that the Government have not yet got it right. I would prefer to see the clause amended rather than qualified by &quot;easier-to-adjust&quot; statutory guidance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="50406-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   The problem with the non-amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, is that there is no pre-existing definition of &quot;litter&quot; or &quot;fly-tipping&quot;. Therefore, any definition would require lengthier amendments than the one that he informally proposed. But the guidance will clearly make the distinction, and that is the way in which we have approached this matter. The guidance, of course, will be augmented by my assurances, both at Second Reading and today, and, indeed, by the parts of my letter read out by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. She clearly regards me, on occasions, as much more convincing in writing than in person in the House.
</p>

<a name="50406-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>We are dealing with two different kinds of litter. It is not rural against urban or open land against curtilage land, but there are different kinds of litter. That will be   made clear in the guidance, which, in the circumstances of the structure of the Bill and pre-existing legislation, is the best we can do. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, it is of course important that we introduce the guidance as rapidly as possible. We can then begin to ensure that local authorities follow the guidance and use these powers.

</p>

<a name="50406-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>As to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, in relation to placing a requirement on the local authority or Environment Agency to take responsibility for clearing fly-tipping, that is not in the Bill. No doubt, had we proceeded normally, amendments would have been brought forward in that regard. Of course, that would place a significant burden on local authorities or the Environment Agency and would raise a wide range of other issues, including resourcing. We have not thought it sensible to engage with such issues in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>With that, I hope, clarification&#151;the noble Baroness has helped me to get my words on the record&#151;I ask the Committee to accept the amendment.

<a name="50406-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   I intervene simply to fulfil a commitment I made to clarify this in relation to questions raised on the Liberal Democrat Benches. The clause deals with fly-posting and fly-tipping. Concern has been expressed that the provision might allow removal notices to be used to require the removal of advertisements where there is a question of the advertisements&#039; lawfulness as a result of the interpretation of regulations, for example, where an advertisement has deemed consent.
</p>

<a name="50406-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>However, the intention is that this power will be available only where the relevant surface has been defaced by a poster or flyer and the defacement is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_794"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 794</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

detrimental to the amenity of the area or is offensive. It is therefore unlikely that the provision could be used where there is a question of the lawfulness of the advertisement itself. That will, in any case, be made clear in statutory guidance so that local authorities should use this power only to target the visual blight and defacement caused by fly-posting, not to police the technicalities of, for example, the Town and Country Planning Act.

</p>

<a name="50406-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Similar concerns have been raised in relation to Clause 34 that local authorities might use their powers under Section 225 of the Town and Country Planning Act where there are disputes over the planning status of otherwise legitimate adverts. The use of Section 225 would be completely inappropriate in such circumstances. We will also issue guidance and advice to local authorities so that it makes that clear. I hope that that clarification deals with the concerns raised.

</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>The noble Lord said: On Second Reading, concern was expressed by the noble Baronesses, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer and Lady Byford, that Clause 101 could have an adverse impact on biodiversity. The clause deals with insect nuisance and it was feared that naturally occurring concentrations of insects, on farm land in particular, might be regarded as a statutory nuisance. Similar concerns have been expressed to us by the conservation charity, Buglife.
</p>

<a name="50406-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The intention of the clause is to deal with a nuisance which might be caused by sewage or sewage treatment works or other industrial activities. It was not intended to affect insects emanating from farmland, so we have tabled the amendment for clarification. It would exclude the types of land and water listed in it from the statutory nuisance regime in respect of insects. We are confident that the types of land will cover most farmland and open waters. There is also a power for the Secretary of State or the National Assembly to exclude other types of land by way of regulation if there proves to be a problem.
</p>

<a name="50406-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The amendment is intended to deal with unfarmed land such as that under certain agri-environmental schemes. It should be noted that types of land which are not business premises such as commons, which are not grazed, are not covered by the clause, since it extends the statutory nuisance regime in respect of insects only to industrial, commercial and business premises. I hope, therefore, that the exclusion of water and farmland meets the concerns which were expressed on Second Reading and since. I beg to move.

<a name="column_798"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 798</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

intention of seeking the opinion of the Committee on the matter, but I hope that the Minister, having listened to what I have to say, will be able to put on record some of my concerns.

</p>

<a name="50406-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Clause 2 is the one that I feel most strongly about. We raised the matter in the other place, and we do so here as well. Let me explain my reasons. I see a number of dangers arising from Clause 2. Of course, there is an advantage as far as the police are concerned. It may reduce the amount of police time spent in court. The clause is trying to reverse the previous practice, whereby, on a charge of intent to supply, police had to bring in expert witnesses, normally drug squad officers. They would give evidence on what would constitute dealer quantities and what inferences could be drawn from the possession of certain other articles. It is possible that in making a presumption we would avoid the attendance of drug squad officers, particularly in summary cases. Although I see the attraction of that, it may not necessarily be an advantage.
</p>

<a name="50406-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>It is a big advantage to the drug squad officers to give evidence in court and to have the experience of being cross-examined by solicitors, advocates or barristers in a court. It keeps them sharp and allows them to build up expertise. I have spoken to a colleague involved in training police officers. In such cases, officers are then able to be used to much better effect on the big cases in the High Court, when it really matters.
</p>

<a name="50406-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The real danger that I can see in the clause is on the practical side. I foresee that, with the best will in the world, busy police constables working in the streets will come across cases in which there is a substantial amount of drugs but that substantial amount falls short of the level that is prescribed by the Secretary of State by order. In those circumstances, the police officers will think, &quot;Well, it is not a dealer quantity according to the regulation, so I will just charge him with simple possession&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50406-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>There is another downside. The provision will bring with it a laziness of attitude, which will mean that ultimately the community is not better served. I am concerned that if we operate with such a presumption, a busy constable in the street or a busy duty sergeant will take the attitude that, if the amount does not come up to the prescribed level, they will go for simple possession. By the time the matter is reported by the prosecuting authorities, the evidence that might have been there will no longer be there.

</p>

<a name="50406-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>I do not think that the provision achieves anything new. Existing case law says that simple possession of a substantial amount of drugs is sufficient for a court to infer intent to supply. There will be real difficulty for the Government when it comes to establishing what level of drugs will be stipulated in the order. The Minister says that there will be different levels for different drugs, which makes common sense. There will be different situations in different towns and cities. If we get the level wrong, the traffic of cases through the courts will be affected enormously. Given the geographical distances, I cannot see how we would get the issue right.

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>If there were a real lacuna or gap in the law, the measure might be worth trying. However, the law as it exists is perfectly capable of dealing with all the issues if the police and prosecution services are given sufficient resources to give each case proper consideration and preparation before it goes to court. I suspect that, if there is a problem, it stems from lack of resources, and the provision will not help that. If anything it might make it worse. It is for those reasons that I oppose the Question that Clause 2 stand part of the Bill.

<a name="50406-23_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Mancroft: </b>   I share some of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, which is why I added my name to the amendment on the Marshalled List.
</p>

<a name="50406-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>I noted the comments that the Minister made at Second Reading about how it would be possible to prescribe the amount of different drugs. Having read those comments carefully, I still say that they are pretty confusing. It would be extremely difficult to say which amounts were relevant. The Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs may be expert on drugs, but I am not certain it is expert on the amounts that people carry with them on the street. The issue is going to be difficult and will remain a grey area. We heard the Minister&#039;s comments on that.
</p>

<a name="50406-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The area of the clause that particularly worries me is the part that says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;the court or jury must assume&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>There is no ability, if the amount prescribed is for some reason incorrect or the person is carrying an amount outside the prescribed limit for a reason that I cannot imagine now&#151;perhaps none of us can&#151;but there is no grey in this at all. There is no ability for the defendant to offer any mitigating circumstances. It is somewhat draconian to assume automatically that, because someone has a quantity of a drug, they are supplying it. I entirely understand what the clause is meant to achieve and recognise that there is some merit in it, but the drafting concerns me.
</p>

<a name="50406-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I have been trying all day to come up with a suitable analogy, without a great deal of success. The only one that I can come up with, though obviously it is not right, is that we could imagine that one of your Lordships were going to France in your car to buy a car-load of wine. Clearly, none of us can drink a car-load of wine in one go&#151;or I should hope not, anyway. If the same standard were to be applied to that example as applies in this clause, the fact that you were carrying more wine than you could possibly drink in one sitting would automatically mean that somebody would assume that you were a wine merchant, as the Customs used to a year or so back, and that you were going to sell it. That is of course completely ridiculous, and the same problem is caused by the wording of the clause.

of proof for the offence, which means that the onus will be on the accused to prove that he did not intend to supply&#151;that is, that he is not a dealer. Convictions for this offence generally attract considerably higher sentences than equivalent convictions for simple possession, and can also trigger the application of a minimum sentence on third conviction.

</p>

<a name="50406-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Proof of an intention to supply therefore has very serious consequences for a defendant. We believe that evidential presumptions of this type should rarely be used in criminal proceedings, since they can water down the criminal standard of proof. I am sure that the Minister is aware that the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland has said that presumptions should not be used unless, having done so, the court would be left satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. Justice suggests, in its briefing, that the House of Lords would take a similar approach should that be applied in England.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;Clause 2 undermines the traditional presumption of innocence at common law and due process rights under Article 6. Further, any alternative, human rights-compliant reading of the Clause would render it pointless. If an individual is to be convicted of intention to supply a controlled substance, the court should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this intention existed at the relevant time. In line with the &#039;golden thread&#039; of English law, the presumption of innocence should be upheld, and the quantity of drugs in the possession of a defendant should continue to be only a factor in the consideration of a case&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="50406-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>The Bill has several defects, not only this one, however praiseworthy are the parts that aim to point drug-dependant people towards treatment. My noble friend Lady Scotland said, at Second Reading, that we should,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;properly discharge our responsibility to scrutinise carefully the legislation that comes before the House&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/3/05; col. 1077.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>That was in relation to this Bill. I could not agree more but, of course, for that we would need proper time between stages in which to do that very thing. I believe that the Bill should have been reintroduced after the election; it should have been withdrawn, and we could have had proper time to debate it later.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>The clause that we are debating is a good example of why the Bill needs such scrutiny. I agree with the points made by noble Lords who have spoken, advocating that this clause ought to be dropped.
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="50406-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Cobbold: </b>   I support the point on the presumption of innocence raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, and point out that I raised the same matter at Second Reading.
</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="50406-24_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It is right that we had a detailed discussion of this matter on Second Reading. I understand fully the concerns that the noble Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_801"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 801</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Dholakia, raised. I hope that I shall be able to clarify some of those points for him so as to make him a little more satisfied that the way in which he would like the provisions to work is in fact the case.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>As noble Lords know only too well, the clause creates an evidential presumption of intent to supply when the defendant is found to be in possession of a particular amount of a controlled drug. The effect is that when the presumption applies, a court or jury must assume that the defendant intended to supply the drug in his possession. However, I invite noble Lords to cast an eye at the second part of Clause 2, because insufficient regard has been paid to it. The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, referred to new subsection (4A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, but that must be read in conjunction with new subsection (4B), which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;Subsection (4A) above does not apply if evidence is adduced which is sufficient to raise an issue that the accused may not have had the drug in his possession with that intent&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>So it is a rebuttable, not an absolute, presumption.

</p>

<a name="50406-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The clause places an evidential presumption, rather than a legal burden of proof, on the defendant. The presumption is rebutted when evidence is adduced which raises an issue or arguable case that the defendant did not intend to supply the drugs in his possession. If such evidence is raised, the prosecution will be required to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to supply the drugs in his possession.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>I know that noble Lords have expressed concern regarding the fact that the Joint Committee on Human Rights found that it was unable to reach a definitive view on whether the evidential presumption placed on defendants to an offence of possession with intent to supply controlled drugs was compatible with the convention. That was because the Joint Committee had not been informed of the prescribed amounts of drugs that would trigger the application of the statutory assumption. Those amounts will be provided in regulations subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>The Joint Committee has emphasised that the convention will require there to be a sense of proportion in the amounts which are prescribed by regulation, <i>vis</i>-&#224;-<i>vis</i> the seriousness of the offence of possession with intent to supply controlled drugs. We are very mindful that any levels to be prescribed by regulations with a view to triggering the statutory assumption must be appropriate, reflect and be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>We believe that consultation with a range of bodies which have expertise in the field of drugs is essential to ensure that the particular levels prescribed are appropriate. In another place, the Minister responsible for drugs undertook to consult the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs as well as a range of other people, including the Forensic Science Service, the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. Other bodies that will be consulted will include the Department of Health, the National Treatment Agency, the Association of Chief Police Officers, and non-governmental organisations working in the drugs field. I say to the noble Lord, Lord   Mancroft, that that is important, because it deals <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_802"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 802</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with his point about where to draw the line between the users and abusers and those who actually enforce. We believe that we should listen to everyone on that matter, in order to get it right.

</p>

<a name="50406-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Any levels prescribed by regulations must be debated by both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure. We consider that such consultation and debate will provide the necessary transparency and safeguards and will assist us in securing prescribed levels that are indeed proportionate. The need for the thresholds to be agreed by affirmative resolution of both Houses will give noble Lords the opportunity to scrutinise the thresholds which it is proposed to adopt. I anticipate that we will be in a position to bring forward such a resolution late in 2005 or early in 2006.

</p>

<a name="50406-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>To give an indication&#151;and it is only an indication&#151;of what these thresholds might be, the level set out in an informal agreement reached between one police force and the CPS locally regarding when a charge of possession with intent to supply is appropriate are: in relation to heroin, bulk 7 grams or more, or 10 separate 0.1 gram wraps or more; with crack cocaine, bulk 7   grams or more, or 10 separate 0.1 gram rocks or more; with cocaine, bulk 7 grams or more, or 10 separate 1 gram or 0.5 gram wraps; and ecstasy, 10 tablets or more. Finally, for cannabis resin the relevant figure is 112   grams or more or 10 individual pieces or more. For the leaf it is 0.5 kilograms or more or 20 individual bags or more. That gives an idea of what one police force has done to approach this matter. However, I need to make clear that when we tackle this matter it will not just concern local protocol. The process will take into account all the medical and other evidence and try to establish a measure that will apply right across the board.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>However, I should emphasise the importance that consultation will have regarding where we finally end up. The purpose of this clause is to achieve greater consistency right across the country on when a defendant is charged with possession with intent to supply; clarify the point at which the quantity of drugs in a person&#039;s possession becomes above and beyond that reasonably held for personal use; increase the success in convicting dealers and disrupt the activity of dealers. It is on that basis that I move that Clause 2 stand part of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="50406-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I remind the Committee that we had Second Reading of this Bill on Monday as I believe that no one was aware that it was taking place. Only three Back-Benchers were able to speak and all three of them were pretty much opposed to the Bill. It was not at that stage moved into Committee; in fact, it was not referred to a Committee of your Lordships until a short while ago. I am not quite clear why we are now having to go through this because it is not exactly news that the election is coming. We have known about it for some time.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I believe that I have never heard of a Bill coming through the wash-up stage&#151;which is entirely a Front Bench process and nothing to do with us poor old foot soldiers on the Back Benches&#151;that has not been at least moved into a Committee and has not had any scrutiny at all in this House. It is not an urgent Bill. If it was urgent, it should have come forward earlier in the Session. Therefore, it is rather undesirable for the noble Baroness to point out the desirability of having consultation. A number of organisations that I know well would have liked to offer briefing on this Bill. We Back-Benchers need and appreciate those briefings on many different subjects. However, we have not had the opportunity to receive those briefings on this Bill. It is an extremely unsatisfactory way to proceed on a controversial and difficult Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>Clause 3(5) refers to the person&#151;rather than defendant at this stage as he or she has not been charged&#151;not being able to refuse what is called a &quot;drug offence search&quot; without good cause. Clause 3(5)(a) states that,

<a name="50406-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord   Mancroft, confined his comments to a very narrow compass. Therefore, I shall respond in like terms. The real focus of Clause 3 is what the jury is supposed to infer.

</p>

<a name="50406-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>As the noble Lord knows, Clause 3 introduces in England and Wales&#151;and Clause 4 similarly introduces in Northern Ireland&#151;the requirement that the suspect&#039;s written consent is obtained prior to the intimate search being carried out. Detainees must be informed that an intimate search has been authorised and the grounds for it. The authorisation for the search, the grounds for it and the giving of the appropriate consent must be recorded in the custody record.

</p>

<a name="50406-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>The clause also allows a court or jury to draw such inferences as appear proper should consent to an intimate search be refused without good cause. Where there is good cause, no such inference will be drawn. By way of example, a pregnant prisoner may well have good cause for refusing to consent to an intimate search. Cultural sensitivities will also be relevant when determining what constitutes good cause. Often it will be a question of fact which will pertain to the particular case. Similarly, some drug dealers will swallow drugs suitably wrapped upon their arrest to conceal evidence.
</p>

<a name="50406-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Clause 5 with regard to England and Wales, and Clause 6 with regard to Northern Ireland, enable a police officer of at least the rank of inspector to authorise an X-ray or ultrasound scan of a person arrested for an offence where he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has swallowed a class A drug which he had in his possession with intent to supply or with intent to export unlawfully. Any charge made by the National Health Service would be met by the police.

</p>

<a name="50406-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>We tabled a government amendment this morning. The relevant amendment that we tabled is only a technical amendment which related to the SOCA Bill and staff custody officers. We waited until the subject was discussed yesterday before tabling the amendment. Had the outcome of the SOCA Bill been different, our amendment would also have been different. We finished consideration of the SOCA Bill today. We had to wait until those issues were dealt with before tabling our amendment. All the matters that are before the Committee are properly before it in accordance with the matters outlined at Second Reading earlier this week.
</p>

<a name="50406-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>As with Clauses 3 and 4, Clauses 5 and 6 require that the suspect gives his written consent to an X-ray or ultrasound scan being carried out. The suspect must be informed that such a procedure has been authorised and the reason for that authorisation. As with Clauses 3 and 4, should a person withhold consent for such a procedure without good cause, a court or jury may draw such inferences as it sees fit. The whole purpose of Clauses 5 and 6 is to give the police an indication of the need to detain someone to allow drugs to pass through their body.
</p>

<a name="50406-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>The Committee will have noted that Clause 8 has some relevance to Clauses 5 and 6. It introduces the power for magistrates to remand into police custody for an extended period upon charge a person suspected of swallowing a drug. The purpose of Clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6 together is to enable those in possession of controlled drugs with the appropriate criminal intent to be brought to justice by deterring those who conceal them in a body cavity or swallow them from withholding consent for the appropriate procedure without good cause, and enabling courts and juries to act should they do so.
</p>

<a name="50406-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Appropriate intent means for these purposes having possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply them or to export them unlawfully; in other words, the provisions are targeted at drug dealers not drug users. Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 9 seek to remove the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_805"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 805</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provision for courts and juries to draw such inferences as appear proper from a refusal without good cause. The effect would be to allow those seeking to conceal evidence of possession of a class A drug to do so by refusing consent to an intimate search, X-ray or ultrasound scan without consequence. Hence, it would maintain a loophole that the police have identified to us as one used by dealers to frustrate justice. It is for that reason that we cannot support the amendments.
</p>

<a name="50406-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>I hope that I have said enough to explain to the noble Lord why the provisions are proportionate, will be necessary, and can be dealt with perfectly properly.

This is a probing amendment. Can the noble Baroness tell us how this will work in practice? Will the police take the defendant or the person, if he still is a person, to a hospital accident and emergency department and ask him to queue up? What happens if a doctor or a nurse, who make their living caring for the sick, does not want to do the police&#039;s work for them? How will that work? <br>&nbsp;<br>

Are people going to have to sit around for ages? Is the police doctor going to arrive with ultrasound equipment? It seems rather complicated, and it would be helpful if the Minister could describe how the Government foresee or envisage this rather complex process working. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="50406-25_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The noble Lord will know that in relation to these matters it is already the position that when X-rays and other procedures have to be arranged, practical arrangements are made and defendants undergo the tests without any difficulty at all. I take it that the noble Lord is referring to Amendment No. 10. The practical ability to do that has not been an issue at all in relation to the way in which that has been managed. I can certainly write to the noble Lord in relation to the practical matters, but in this Bill we are setting out the ability to do it, and those practical issues will be resolved between the relevant agencies in due course.

<a name="50406-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Mancroft: </b>   I do not intend to press the amendment tonight, or to go any further with it, but it is a bit odd to put a complex procedure in a Bill and then not be able to explain how it will work. Bills all have practical consequences, and these are difficult areas. I tried to describe a situation that might happen. It does not apparently appear to be a problem, but my understanding from people who work in the field is that those matters are difficult and there are problems.

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>They are particularly distressing for defendants and for their families, particularly when people find out in the end that they have been incorrectly charged.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;An analysis of the sample reveals that a specified Class A drug may be present in the person&#039;s body&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>Clearly, if noble Lords read the rest of the clause and the subsections following, that is an important point. This clause allows police officers to require a person to attend an initial assessment and remain for its duration. On a purely practical point, that seems a little pointless if that person has not tested positive for class A drugs but merely might have done.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>I ask noble Lords to think about it in context for a moment. A person is arrested and not charged&#151;which means he may not have done something wrong and he may not even have drugs in his body, because we still have &quot;may&quot; at the top&#151;but he is still required to go for an initial assessment on the whim of the police officer. The criteria are fulfilled, and then he may even have a follow-up assessment. Assume that later he is found innocent of the original charge, or even that it is dropped, and it turns out that he has no class A drugs in him. He could still be guilty under this Bill and be imprisoned for 51 weeks or fined up to level 4 for failure to attend an assessment that he did not need, for drugs that he had not taken, after a crime that he did not commit.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>I accept that that will probably not happen, but it could all be avoided if one ensures in the wording of the clause that the drug test must be positive. I really do not see that in these difficult areas you can play with people&#039;s lives by leaving grey areas. There is a world of difference between a test that is positive and one that might be. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="50406-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hear what the noble Lord is saying, but I assure him that he is being unduly pessimistic about how the provisions will work. The groups of amendments from Amendment No. 10 to Amendment No. 30 seek to reduce the impact of the provisions contained in Part 3 of the Bill, which require those who have tested positive&#151;that is the most important thing, that they have tested positive for class A drugs&#151;to attend an initial assessment and, where required, a follow-up assessment. That is the condition precedent. We are not talking about someone who has not taken the drug or has nothing to do with it; they must have tested positive if the process is to apply to them.

<a name="column_808"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 808</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those who may only be starting on the road of drug misuse and crime. The noble Lord has an interest in making sure that those who have become or may become addicted to drugs have as early a point of reference to help and support as possible. The provisions very much help that to take place.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>Amendment No. 10 would mean that the analysis would have to reveal that a specified class A drug was actually present before a police officer could require a person to attend an initial assessment and stay for its duration. Let me explain what happens with a testing on charge under Section 63B of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; we envisage that it will continue if Clause 7&#151;it is on testing for the presence of class A drugs on arrest&#151;is enacted.

</p>

<a name="50406-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>The technology used in the police custody suites is a screening tool and will reveal the presence of all opiates rather than the specified class A drug of diamorphine&#151;heroin. That is because, currently, no test is available that can be economically and reliably used to test for heroin alone. It is therefore possible that, under the current testing regime, legitimate drugs within the opiate range such as codeine may be detected when using the on-site police custody test. However, should that be the case or if a person challenges the result, the test sample can be sent to the Forensic Science Service for a forensic analysis to provide a conclusive result using the &quot;gold standard&quot; test provided by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry&#151;GC/MS.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>To accept the amendment would mean that all test samples would have to be sent for the further analysis before the requirement was imposed. That would be costly and delay the police imposing the requirement to attend an assessment for no obvious benefit. Currently, under the testing on charge, only 3 per cent of tests are challenged and sent for the further analysis. Of those challenges, only 4.4 per cent are upheld. We will issue guidance which provides that, where a person challenges the result of a drug test at the time of the test, the assessment will not be scheduled until after the results of the further analysis are received. Where the further analysis is negative, the obligation to attend the assessment will cease. That will prevent innocent people being assessed in the way in which the noble Lord fears.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>On the basis of that explanation, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

The amendment&#039;s purpose is simple&#151;to ask the Government what a suitably qualified person is. I confess to having a certain history on the matter, having spent about 10 years in the Department of Health trying to persuade it to get involved with the certification and qualification of drug counsellors. I regret to tell the Committee that they were not remotely interested and it had to be done by the voluntary sector, which I never thought entirely satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>It is extremely difficult to know who is properly qualified. Too many people in this country who are not qualified in the way that we would desire are still practising.

Who is suitably qualified to act in these processes is extremely important. We still have too much amateurish treatment, although the quality is rising rapidly. One would not want those not qualified to be involved.

<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="50406-26_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I understand now why the noble Lord tabled the amendments as he did. The substitution of &quot;properly&quot; does not add anything material to the meaning and is unnecessary in view of Clause 19(6), which defines what is meant by a suitably qualified person for the purposes of the assessment.
</p>

<a name="50406-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>&quot;Suitably qualified person&quot; and its definition is consistent with the term used in Section 3 of the Bail Act 1976 in relation to the provisions for the assessment of drug users as a condition of bail under the provisions relating to drug users&#151;the restriction on bail. Clause 19 provides for the Secretary of State to specify from time to time the qualifications or experience which a suitably qualified person must have.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_203"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to raise concerns about the phrase that appears in line 11, regarding a &quot;propensity to misuse&quot; drugs. There has been a difficulty for a long time in this country about the difference between misusing drugs and addiction to drugs. These are important.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>In the initial and follow-up assessments regarding the sending for treatment of people who commit crimes due to their drug addiction, &quot;treatment&quot; is another word for healthcare. Healthcare is for people who are unwell. In the area that we are discussing, that means addicts. Treatment for drug addicts is getting much better in this country and is working well in many fields. That is great. But you cannot treat misusers, because misuse is not an illness.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>The alcohol analogy is the simplest&#151;many, or one or two, of your Lordships occasionally use alcohol. One or two of your Lordships may know people who are alcoholics. One or two of your Lordships may have occasionally misused alcohol once or twice in their lives. Those three matters are completely different. Whereas you can treat alcoholism, you cannot treat misuse. The fact is that users misuse and alcoholics misuse. But misusers are not necessarily alcoholics. That may sound complicated and I hope that it will look better in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow morning. The reality is that the phrase &quot;propensity to misuse&quot; is most extraordinary and I have no idea how anyone will be able to understand its meaning or identify it.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>We know that genetics plays a part, as does environment, but those cannot be grounds for a referral to treatment, unless you wish to clog every treatment facility with unmotivated and disruptive time-servers who are sent there by the courts. As chairman of the Drug and Alcohol Foundation, which is one of the leading day care providers here in the City of Westminster in Dartmouth Street, exactly one street away from the Home Office, I can say that we are, as a tiny agency, clogged with people who are sent to us by the courts. Those people are not motivated, they should not really come to us and they are extremely disruptive both to the staff and the other clients. That is a real problem and my understanding is that it is a growing problem in many agencies throughout the country. It relates to our discussions during an earlier amendment regarding misdiagnosis, which has always been a particularly British problem.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>In tabling this amendment, I draw attention to the fact that a &quot;propensity to misuse&quot; is a deeply unfortunate phrase. It would be better if it were not in the Bill. I hope that guidance can ensure that people <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_811"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 811</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

who misuse, but are not addicts and probably not treatable, are not referred to, and therefore clog up, treatment facilities where there are few enough places at the moment for too many clients. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="50406-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   First, perhaps I may comfort the noble Lord in saying that the term &quot;has a propensity to misuse&quot; has already been used in other legislation. For example, it is used in Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which amends Section 3 of the Bail Act 1976. It is a term with which those who have to deal with legislation are familiar, and know how to interpret it. Therefore, it is understood to a great extent.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>Amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 17 would reduce the scope of assessments in Part 3 of the Bill to establishing only whether a person had a dependency upon any specified class A drug. It would preclude establishing whether those individuals who have not reached the stage of dependency may have a propensity to misuse specified class A drugs. The aim of Part 3 of the Bill is to help those who are using specified class A drugs&#151;heroin, crack and cocaine&#151;into treatment and to lead drug-free and crime-free lives.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>These drugs not only do terrible harm and damage to the individuals taking them, but to the communities they live in. The initial and follow-up assessments will give help and advice and steer those who need it into treatment. We do not want to help just those who are already dependent on those drugs, but those who may be just starting on a way of life involving drug misuse and the crime associated with it.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>The noble Lord, from his long experience of dealing with those who have, tragically, become addicted to drugs, knows that sometimes the journey to that dark place of total addiction can be rapid&#151;but can sometimes take a long time. If we can interrupt that pathway quickly and at the first stage, it may be that the drug addiction will not ripen into a full-blown, debilitating addiction, which destroys the life of the abuser and, usually, everyone around them&#151;particularly their family, who love them, often very dearly.

As I said&#151;and we have said twice tonight, I think&#151;early diagnosis and early intervention are extremely important. This is an extremely difficult issue. I raise it because it is causing considerable difficulty in the field. There are too many inappropriate referrals, and they are fantastically disruptive when they do happen, as I have said, to staff and other clients.

</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>We have not yet got this right. Definition is very important and very difficult: the difference between abusers and misusers, and addiction and dependence.

Indeed, what happens if he does not? Are we going to charge him as well? At what point does someone&#039;s healthcare become their own business? What happens if the assessor is concerned about patient confidentiality, which is very   important? This is a very difficult healthcare issue and these are very difficult and vulnerable people&#151;even if to some they are simply awkward offenders, as undoubtedly they are. However, they have their right to privacy and their need for healthcare as well, which is really why we are going through this process.
</p>

<a name="50406-27_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>So, at what point does someone&#039;s healthcare become their own business? As I understand it, at this stage the person has still not been found guilty of an offence. We are already obliged to appoint suitably qualified persons as assessors, as we have just discussed. However, if in the   process those suitably qualified persons, who presumably have a duty of confidentiality as part of their qualification as assessors or as healthcare professionals, betray the confidences of their client, then they, like most of the qualified people I know, would lose their licences to practise. So perhaps the counsellor will wish to keep the treatment process confidential.

<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>My experience of treatment, which is quite considerable now, is that breached confidences in the treatment process invariably wreck that process. I am certain that that is not the Government&#039;s intention. It seems to me that the drafting of this clause is somewhat draconian, although it provides no sanction. Unless I have misunderstood it, which I may have done, it may have the exact opposite effect of that intended. I beg to move.

<a name="50406-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I understand why the noble Lord has opened this matter, so that we can respond, but I should like to reassure him that the way in which the amendment is phrased would not in fact assist an assessor. While the aim of the amendment may be to assist the drugs worker/client relationship, we believe that this would place the initial assessor in a difficult if not invidious position.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>It is not an offence for the assessor not to inform the police. All the assessor needs to do is to say whether the   person has attended. The requirement to attend the initial assessment and remain for the duration is imposed by the police. The duty on the assessor is merely to report whether the person complied with the requirements&#151;basically, to tell the authorities whether they turned up and whether or not they stayed for the assessment. It will be for the prosecuting authorities, and ultimately the courts, to decide whether a person has failed to do so without good cause and is therefore guilty of an offence.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>The noble Lord agrees that people must be assessed so that we know the nature of the condition that they have and what assistance they may or may not need. If the court is to do that, it is important that we have a way of confirming that the person did or did not take advantage of that opportunity. That is all that the provision seeks to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="50406-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Mancroft: </b>   I am most grateful for that response and, on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_211"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 23, which is grouped with Amendments Nos. 24, 28 and 29, is merely intended to raise the issue of the size of the penalties in the Bill. In my amendments, I replace those penalties with other ones. I do not know whether they are right; I am not a great expert on the level of offences. But it seems to me that a year in prison or, I believe, a &#163;4,000 fine at level 4 is slightly high for what is effectively missing an appointment, although it may be a very important appointment.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Under these charges, a great many people will be arrested for acquisitive crime, mainly to fund their drug habits&#151;even the dealers. We are not talking about the &quot;Mr Bigs&quot; of this world; we are talking about small-time dealers, and basically most of them supply drugs to fund their own habits. The reason for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_814"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 814</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that is that they do not have any money. How will they pay these fines? Unless they are lucky enough to be in one of the small, but admittedly increasing, number of prisons that have good drug programmes, the likelihood is that they will end up with a worse habit when they come out than when they went in.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>Standing back from this issue, such people are stealing only because the drugs are so expensive, although they are far cheaper than they used to be. The reason they are so expensive is that they are illegal, which is government policy. Those who steal are arrested and end up being fined. They cannot pay the fine and so they go to prison&#151;for which we have to pay and which probably makes them worse&#151;and they come out and do it again.

</p>

<a name="50406-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>The object of this legislation&#151;one with which I think everyone in the Committee and beyond would agree&#151;is to try to stop what we called the &quot;revolving door syndrome&quot;. My concern is that if people are fined at too high a rate or if they are chucked into prison&#151;obviously the object of the Bill is to stop them going to   prison&#151;then the revolving door syndrome is perpetuated.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Therefore, in raising this point, I am questioning whether the level of fine and potential sentencing to prison is proportionate to the offences involved in this piece of legislation. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="50406-28_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I assure the noble Lord   that on summary conviction up to 51 weeks&#039; imprisonment and/or a fine will be the maximum penalty when the relevant sentencing provisions introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 come into force. Until that time, the maximum term of imprisonment will be three months. Where a defendant has tested positive on arrest or charge for a specified class A drug, indicating a possible addiction to drugs which may lead him into a life of crime, as the noble Lord has already indicated, it would be inappropriate to introduce a lower penalty and would, we believe, send the wrong message to the group.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>One must bear in mind the very broad variety of sentences introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The whole menu is available, and the fine and the term of 51 weeks&#039; imprisonment is the outer limit. We think that the penalty under this provision is therefore the same as that for the failure to provide a sample when requested to do so on arrest or charge. We believe that it is at the appropriate level and is proportionate. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="50406-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Mancroft: </b>   Again, that was a very helpful explanation. I am delighted to hear that a whole menu of appropriate penalties is available. I hope that the appropriate authorities will be looking at the lower end of that menu, particularly when considering someone who, as the noble Baroness said, has been tested for a possible addiction. If you have a possible addiction and you have been tested for it, that means that you are ill. We have identified someone who is ill, so immediately we up the sentence.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>I have a feeling that, when people look back on this in a generation&#039;s time, the way in which we treat drug addicts in the first part of the 21st century will be <br>&nbsp;<br>

If one stands back and looks at the situation, one can see that it is immensely barbaric, apart from being an incredible waste of time and money. Nevertheless, we shall pray for the whole menu, and on that basis I shall withdraw my amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_214"></a>
<a name="50406-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Cobbold: </b>   The Bill has many problem areas, as the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, so ably pointed out. Clause 21 has the air of having been slipped in at the last minute, and its removal would have no influence on the rest of the Bill. The clause seeks to classify so-called magic mushrooms as class A drugs alongside heroin, crack and cocaine.
</p>

<a name="50406-28_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>Magic mushrooms grow wild all over the fields of England and have been enjoyed recreationally for many years. It is true that they contain a quantity of the substance psilocin, which in its pure and concentrated form is already classified as a class A drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. But experience tells us that the mushrooms themselves have a low danger to health relative to most other commonly used drugs and according to the Government&#039;s Talktofrank website, they are,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;not addictive in any way&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50406-28_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>As I said at Second Reading on Tuesday, the point at issue is to what extent any government have the right in a free society to interfere in the personal choices of individual citizens and, with the excuse of protecting their health, to impose criminal sanctions on anyone who disobeys the rules. Government have every right and indeed a duty to educate and to warn the public, particularly the young, of the risks to personal health of all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. Indeed, the campaign against smoking in recent years is a good example of what can be achieved by publicising potential harm to health.

<a name="50406-28_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>Publicity and health warnings are one thing, but criminalising the enjoyment of a relatively harmless mushroom that grows wild in our fields is surely a step too far. Are farmers to become criminals because class A drugs grow on their land? That is absurd. The clause will drive the existing, modest trade underground and into the hands of criminals, and it will increase the burden on the already overstretched criminal justice system. I hope that the Government will agree to drop Clause 21 from the Bill.

<a name="50406-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   I support the noble Lord, Lord   Cobbold, for reasons that he may find hard to determine. I stand here to make a plea on behalf of the mushroom hunter. I have already disclosed my interest as a peasant farmer in France and a wine grower.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>I want to refer to the rather improper remarks made by my noble friend Lord Mancroft on the subject of wine. I carry large quantities of wine in cars and trucks, and I sell it. Of course, when wine is in the grape, with maybe 14 degrees alcohol, it is not treated as alcohol or wine and regarded as dangerous. Wine and mushrooms go well together. Noble Lords will know that you may not shoot a wild boar during the hunting season when the grapes have not been picked. There is a relationship in the land that I have between the wild boar and the mushroom hunter. The hunters who hunt the wild boar hunt with guns. The hunters who hunt the mushroom remember the old adage that there are bold mushroom hunters, old mushroom hunters but no old, bold mushroom hunters. The mushroom is a very dangerous creature. There are over 2,000 of them. Will the Minister kindly let me know how many of them contain psilocin?
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>The Destroying Angel is a mushroom that bothers me. It is far more dangerous than the magic mushroom. I understand that in the United Kingdom there are about five different types of magic mushroom. They are only treated as class A drugs once they have been processed. There are problems with the difference between Jack o&#039; lantern and Slippery Jack: I have forgotten which of those is deadly poisonous and which is not. We all may know of cepe, morel and chanterelle mushrooms and that their value is considerable. There has been a tremendous growth in mushroom hunting throughout Europe, including the United Kingdom, with groups from Switzerland, Austria and France coming over into certain parts of the world. It is a secretive business because the value of cepe mushrooms or others is very high.

</p>

<a name="50406-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>I have a fear that if the Bill goes through, as is, genuine mushroom hunters may well pick up a mushroom or a fungus that is full of psilocin and thus commit a criminal offence. That matter is solved in many countries. Mushrooms are so deadly and dangerous that unless you are a competent person you cannot tell the difference. So normally you would pick them using surgical gloves. Poisonous mushrooms must never touch non-poisonous mushrooms, otherwise they will pollute them. You would take the mushrooms to the local pharmacist who will say &quot;Yes, no, yes, no&quot; and tell you how to cook them. In the United Kingdom, we do not have that knowledge. Is the Minister concerned in any way that the provision <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_817"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 817</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

may offend against the European Convention on Human Rights? Is she concerned about protecting mushroom pickers? Does she or her department know anything at all about mushrooms?
</p>




<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="50406-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Mancroft: </b>   I will add my voice to that of the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, if it survives much longer, which it sounds as though it is not going to. I do not want to repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, has said. He has listed most of the points, but I shall make three very short points.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>First, my understanding is that&#151;the noble Baroness may be able to help us on this&#151;a ban on magic mushrooms in this country may not be legal under European law. I gather that there is an appeal to the European Court on the subject because the things are sold completely legally throughout Europe. It would presumably be some sort of interference with trade, bearing it in mind that they are legally sold in hundreds of shops around the country at the moment.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>Secondly, has the plan to make magic mushrooms into a class A drug been referred to the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs? Thirdly, the legislation is simply disproportionate. Magic mushrooms really do not cause any harm at all, they cannot be addictive and have never caused a public order issue. The idea that they should be put into the same category as heroin and cocaine is so ludicrous that it makes the provision a laughing stock. The legislation will have no effect on the use or misuse of magic mushrooms. Most people will not take any notice of it, understand it or, probably, even know of it. The only effect that it might have is a minor, inadvertent and rather undesirable effect on the poor people who inadvertently grow them or have them on their land and those who sell them not realising that they are illegal.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>The provision is disproportionate and has no place in the Bill. It would be much better to remove the clause. So I support the noble Lord&#039;s argument.
</p>




<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="50406-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rea: </b>   My noble friend said at Second Reading that magic mushrooms could have damaging, hallucinatory effects equivalent to those of LSD. That is certainly not my clinical experience. LSD can cause alarming hallucinations that may have lasting effects. But I have never met anyone who has come to any harm from the use of magic mushrooms. The house in which I used to live when my boys were growing up backed on to Hampstead Heath. They frequently went on magic mushroom foraging expeditions with their friends. Neither they nor their friends had anything other than pleasurable experiences as a result.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>I shall cite an e-mail that I received from a probation officer recently. Other noble Lords may have had the same message. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;Being a probation officer, I have helped people who have been addicted to alcohol, ecstasy, cannabis, heroin and crack. But I never met a person who has been addicted to magic mushrooms. They are totally non-addictive and grow naturally. Why ban them?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50406-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>Indeed, following up what the noble Lord, Lord   Cobbold, said, how can you ban something that grows naturally on UK soil?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_818"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 818</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>My noble friend also said in her speech that clarifying the status of fresh magic mushrooms as a controlled drug will, &quot;we hope&quot;&#151;she said&#151;decrease the trade. I suggest that that is unlikely to occur. In fact, the trade will go underground into criminal hands; the strength will probably be increased and unknown. As both the noble Lords, Lord Mancroft and Lord Cobbold, said, it will occupy police time unnecessarily, as is the case with other controlled drugs. As other noble Lords have said, it would do no harm just to drop the clause, if the Government must have the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="50406-29_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hear the words, &quot;Drop it&quot;, coming from some parts of the Chamber. I am unable to drop the clause for the following reasons. Perhaps I may clarify something that I said on Second Reading. The clause will clarify and extend the law on magic mushrooms and remove any doubt that the importation, exportation, production, possession or possession with intent to supply and the supply of fresh mushrooms, as well as prepared ones, is an offence.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>On Second Reading on 4 April, I responded to contributions from the noble Lords, Lord Mancroft and Lord Cobbold, about clarification of the law on magic mushrooms. Having reviewed <i>Hansard</i>, I should like to clarify my comments. At the time, I wanted to make clear that Clause 21 will not change the classification of magic mushrooms. By virtue of the nods that I received when speaking, I knew that the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, understood that. Magic mushrooms that are prepared or are in the form of a product are already class A drugs, as are the active ingredients, psilocin and psilocybin. Clause 21 will simply ensure that fresh magic mushrooms, which may not necessarily be a product or be prepared, are also class A drugs. That will ensure legal clarity and consistency.

</p>

<a name="50406-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>It may not be apparent to all noble Lords that in the past two years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of outlets selling imported fresh magic mushrooms and there is growing concern about the impact that they have on public health. The Government estimate that more than 400 establishments in the United Kingdom are selling those drugs and are mostly supplied with imported magic mushrooms&#151;predominantly from Holland. Customs and Excise estimates the import for 2004 to be between 8,000 and 16,000 kilogrammes.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>I hope that your Lordships will agree that it is undesirable that those drugs be on open sale in the high street. Contributions in this House and another place indicate that there seems to be something of a misconception about the harms and potency of magic mushrooms. Let us be in no doubt that they are highly hallucinogenic and equivalent in effect to LSD. I hear what my noble friend Lord Rea says, but, from the information available to the Government, magic mushrooms appear to be particularly harmful to those with a mental illness or an underlying mental health problem and can precipitate psychosis. They can be very harmful to those with a heart condition and users are also vulnerable to self-harm while under the influence of mushrooms. As with LSD, those misusing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_819"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 819</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mushrooms may experience negative flashbacks. We have therefore decided to take steps to remove any doubt over the legality of their importation and commercial sale.

</p>

<a name="50406-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>At present, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the chemicals inside magic mushrooms&#151;psilocin and psilocybin&#151;constitute class A drugs. Magic mushrooms themselves constitute a class A drug if they have been prepared or are in the form of a product. As such, importation, exportation, production, possession, possession with intent to supply, or supply of those mushrooms is an offence. It is for the courts to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes a preparation or a product. A number of those involved in the commercial sale of magic mushrooms argue that picked fresh magic mushrooms for, or on, sale do not constitute a preparation or a product. We disagree.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>In December 2004, one judge recommended that Parliament consider new legislation to clarify the legal position. The law change proposed in the Drugs Bill would do that, putting an end to uncertainty by making it clear that all magic mushrooms are class A drugs whatever form they are in.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>The taking of magic mushrooms is much more prevalent than some may be aware. The British Crime Survey for 2002-03 showed 180,000 16 to 59 year-olds using magic mushrooms in that year. All indications are that the numbers for 2003 and 2004 will show a dramatic increase in that number, underlining why it is important for Her Majesty&#039;s Government to take this measure.

</p>

<a name="50406-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>These measures are aimed at addressing the relatively new phenomenon of imported hallucinogenic mushrooms. As the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, said at Second Reading, varieties known as liberty cap mushrooms are indigenous to the United Kingdom. Her Majesty&#039;s Government have already considered how to consider those mushrooms in the context of this amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>On 3 February, during Committee stage of the Drugs Bill in another place, the Drugs Minister, my honourable friend Caroline Flint, undertook for Her Majesty&#039;s Government to draw up regulations dealing with certain exemptions from the offence of personal possession and agreed not to bring the relevant provision into force until the regulations were also in force.
</p>

<a name="50406-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971 places psilocin in Schedule 1, the highest level of control. So there is international consensus that those substances present certain serious harm. I understand the concern that noble Lords may have about picking magic mushrooms. I emphasise that the purpose of this offence is to cease the sale and importation of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, asked how much this Government know about mushrooms. A great deal, it would appear. How much does this Minister know? My Lords, she is learning all the time.

driving them into criminal hands underground makes control easier than if they are a perfectly legal substance? Would it not be easier to monitor what is going on if they were on sale in the open market? It would also be possible for environmental health officers and others to check on the strength of magic mushroom preparations, whereas, after the passing of this Bill, they will go out of sight.

<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="50406-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I repeat what I have said already. Of course, magic mushrooms in their   prepared form are already classified as class A drugs. That classification has been endorsed on an international level in the way that I have just indicated. The difficulty has been in the way matters have been dealt with when coming before the court and there is an assertion that, although the constituents are present in fresh mushrooms, they are not a preparation and they are not therefore covered.
</p>

<a name="50406-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>The courts have indicated that that lack of clarity was causing difficulties. We have sought to deal with that in the way that I have just described. It is an important issue because these drugs&#151;and drugs they are&#151;are being imported and sold for considerable profit, and are causing real harm. It is that real harm with which we really have to deal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="50406-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Cobbold: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for that response. On listening to the technical explanation that she has given, it seems that she is saying that prepared elements are already categorised as class A. But this clause will change ordinary, unprocessed, fresh mushrooms growing in the fields of England from being just nothing to being a class A drug, which I think is unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="50406-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Because this clause does not affect any other part of the Bill, I feel that we are justified in testing the opinion of the House.

<a name="50406-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones </b>   moved Amendment No. 20:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>Page 160, line 13, leave out &quot;reflects&quot; and insert &quot;has been calculated so as to reflect&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_225"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment, I should like to use the opportunity to explain, especially for the benefit of external organisations that have argued long and hard on the Bill, the approach that our Front Bench will be taking during this very compressed Committee stage of the Bill. On a wash-up of this nature, with only one day of the Committee stage behind us, there is a huge number of potential amendments, many of a technical but important nature, in the Marshalled List.
</p>

<a name="50406-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Agreement has been reached, however, between the Government and opposition parties in both Houses to   allow the Bill to pass, provided certain key amendments are made. It would not be fair in these circumstances, we believe, to single out a few other amendments or spend the next several hours debating points and seeking clarification on issues which are not part of that broad agreement. It would, in fact, defeat the purpose of the wash-up agreement to expedite the passage of the Bill before dissolution.
</p>

<a name="50406-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>We recognise that we are this evening essentially going through a set of formalities where it is simply impossible, in the time available, to raise substantive issues, many of which have merit. Our Front Bench will therefore not be moving further amendments. However, I want to put it on record, and seek the Minister&#039;s acknowledgment of the fact, that the text of the Bill has not received the fine tuning that passage through the Lords normally ensures. In those circumstances, it would be helpful for the Minister to give the assurance that the Gambling Commission will take account of this in its operation of the Bill and that the commission and the Government will ensure that an early and thorough review of the operation of the Bill will take place. That assurance would be helpful in circumstances in which there are still many doubts and fears about the precise operation of many parts of the Bill and the definitions contained in it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="50406-30_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   I concur with what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has said. We and the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_823"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 823</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Liberal Democrats have achieved a deal with the Government. Therefore, we see this very much as a formal process. That said, I want to put it on record that I feel we have achieved a great deal, given the lack of time and proper scrutiny of this controversial and, in many ways, difficult&#151;albeit important&#151;Bill. Time has been so short, and a lot of us feel this keenly.
</p>

<a name="50406-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>To that end, I am grateful to the Minister for publishing the Ministerial Statement in <i>Hansard,</i> for the various meetings that we have had and for his listening approach to the Bill. Again, I concur with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in that there are many people beyond your Lordships&#039; House who would like to have heard more from our Benches and from others about certain issues. We cannot go into detail on all those tonight. We accept that, but we want to be sure that the Gambling Commission and the Government will take on board the necessity to consider in detail many of those areas of an important Bill on which one day in Committee has not really provided enough scrutiny.

<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="50406-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   I shall speak to government Amendments Nos. 28, 29, 31, 32, 293, 297 and Clause 258 stand part. Before I do so, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for their opening remarks. I give them both an assurance that the Gambling Commission, when it is established later this year, and the Gaming Board are very conscious of the issues they have raised. Much of the discussion has not been, as it commonly is, in Committee and on the Floor of the House, but elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness for acknowledging that on the most important issues raised by amendments other than government amendments, I have been able to respond&#151;giving, I hope, a degree of satisfaction&#151;to the points made in those amendments. By including them in a Ministerial Statement which was published on Monday morning, I have ensured that those responses and arguments appear in <i>Hansard</i> and provide some protection which is not possible to provide in private letters.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>That is not the case for the government amendments. The Committee will forgive me, but I have to say some words about those because although I have explained them in letters to Members of the Committee, I have not actually said so in <i>Hansard</i>.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>The government amendments in this group are designed to improve protections for charity lotteries and are the result of extensive discussions between DCMS officials and a number of interested parties. One of the problems that the Bill has sought to tackle is the vague and subjective boundary between lotteries and competitions. We think that it is right that lotteries should be permitted only for good causes and not for commercial ends. It is not fair that some companies are running de facto lotteries and not having to comply with the regulatory rules that charitable lotteries must follow.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_824"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 824</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>We have listened to those who suggested that Clause   14, as originally drafted, was hard to understand and would present practical difficulties for prosecution and defence alike, and we agree that it can be improved. Amendments Nos. 28, 29, 31 and 32 therefore make the clause more user-friendly, without diluting the rigour of the definition or the principles underpinning it.

</p>

<a name="50406-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>The amendments allow those designing competitions to judge, in advance, whether their competitions are in fact illegal lotteries. In addition, they assist those who need to police the boundary between lotteries and prize competitions to determine where that boundary is placed. That benefits promoters of prize competitions, who will be able to satisfy themselves that their competitions are not in breach of gambling law, and lotteries, which can rest assured that the boundary between lotteries and competitions can be properly and fairly policed.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>Our intention under Clause 14(5) has been clear all along: any competition that calls for a derisory element of skill will be treated as a lottery. The companies running commercial competitions will need to ensure that they stay well on the right side of the law because the Government will expect the Gambling Commission, with its new enforcement remit and powers, to be energetic in clamping down on abuses in the area of lottery scams that divert money from charitable causes.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>We have listened carefully to the many society lotteries that have asked that the monetary limits on lotteries set out in Clause 97 should be reviewed on a triennial basis. We think that that it is preferable to retain the flexibility to review the limits when a review is needed, rather than prescribe reviews at regular intervals. However, given the importance that the sector attaches to such reviews, the Government will as a matter of custom and practice expect the Gambling Commission to offer them advice every three years.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>The Government are also aware of the society lotteries sector&#039;s strong request for an increase in the limits now, and the Government will expect the Gambling Commission to undertake the first such review before the end of the current calendar year. If the case for an increase is accepted, implementation will not be delayed. Amendment No. 293 addresses a technical concern over who may promote a small society lottery.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>We have received a number of representations from society lotteries stating that they use people such as barmen and newsagents to sell their lottery tickets. Paragraph 32 of Schedule 11 would stop that practice. We do not think that it is necessary to limit the promotion of society lotteries in that way, and we are happy to see the current practice continue.

</p>

<a name="50406-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>Under the current draft of the Bill, if a person does anything in Great Britain in relation to a lottery, wherever it is held, they will commit an offence unless the   lottery is licensed or exempt. That would prevent business in Great Britain from taking advantage, for example, of contracts to print material for foreign lotteries. We do not wish to constrain businesses in Great Britain in that way. Amendment No. 297 will, therefore, permit certain activities to be done in Great Britain in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_825"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 825</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relation to foreign lotteries, while maintaining the general prohibition on tickets for foreign lotteries being sold in or to persons in Great Britain. The amendment also creates a defence against the offences of promoting or facilitating a lottery where a person reasonably believed that the lottery was a foreign one.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>We have looked carefully again at the need for Clause 258, which makes specific provision for controlling rapid play lotteries, in the light of concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft. On further reflection, we have concluded that there is no need to make separate and specific provision for excessive repetitive lottery play. There are enough powers in Clauses 73, 75 and 76, so we propose to remove Clause 258.

</p>

<a name="50406-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>I would like to respond in advance to the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, starting with Amendment No. 37. I understand her determination to act against bogus lotteries because such scams prey on the vulnerable. They lead them to believe that they have won a prize when either there is no prize or people are forced to part with considerable sums to collect it. They reduce public confidence in legitimate charitable lotteries. I pay particular tribute to the citizens advice bureaux for their work tackling that problem.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I assure the Committee that the Gambling Commission will have the powers that it needs to investigate and prosecute commercial lotteries or lotteries that break the rules with the utmost vigour. The problem is that many of the scams that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, describes are just that&#151;they are scams, not lotteries. If there is no prize, it is simply not a lottery. We agree that we should make life difficult for those people, but the Gambling Bill is not the place to do it, as it can regulate only gambling activities. There is other legislation in the Enterprise Act 2002 and there is the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. Ofcom, ICSTIS and the DTI work closely together to tighten the regulatory regime, improving the likelihood that the victims of scams will get redress. We expect further announcements to be made on that matter shortly.

</p>

<a name="50406-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, raised an important point. I want the Gambling Commission to play its role alongside those other authorities, and I want to say two things to her and to the Committee. First, we expect the Gambling Commission to draw to the attention of the appropriate authority any scams of that sort that it comes across. Secondly, my officials will arrange a meeting with the Gambling Commission, the DTI, ICSTIS, Ofcom and the OFT to discuss arrangements for information sharing and joint working, so that nobody slips through the gap.
</p>




<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="50406-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for what he said. As he knows, it was my intention to make a detailed attempt through the amendments in my name to persuade the Government that the Bill could be changed in such a way as to give the Gambling Commission power to deal with what is clearly a growing epidemic of fraudulent so-called scam lotteries.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_826"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 826</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>I know, too, that other noble Lords hear my concern at the growing number of individuals who find themselves the target of bogus lotteries. Indeed, as the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, on 21 March, showed all too clearly, noble Lords themselves have been bombarded by many such scams. But as has been said, organisations such as the CAB are at the receiving end of many of the vulnerable people who are increasingly being targeted in that way, and there are a considerable number of victims of those unscrupulous fraudsters.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>I accept what the Minister and the Government have said and their firm belief, about which I originally had my doubts, that the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle to deal with such scams. I was particularly impressed by what the Minister said in expressing his own concern and by the firm undertaking that he made that more efforts would be made to bring all the interested parties together to take the necessary action required to end that situation.
</p>

<a name="50406-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>I am sure that the Minister will not be surprised to hear me say that once your Lordships are once again back at work in this Chamber, I shall keep an interest in the issue and see how far the situation can be remedied.

<p><a name="st_233"></a>The noble Lord said: This group contains a very large number of minor drafting and technical amendments to the Bill. I have speeches on all or any of them if anyone wants to hear them. However, if no one wants to hear them, I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="50406-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I have a large number of amendments in this group, to which I shall not speak individually or in any great detail. The Committee will perhaps be pleased to hear that. However, I should like to make a few brief comments on my Amendments Nos. 182 and 183.

</p>

<a name="50406-32_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>Amendment No. 182 concerns the relationship between the licensing system for casinos and the planning system. Amendment No. 183 seeks to determine whether a regional casino&#151;however many or few we may get&#151;will contribute towards regeneration in the area in which it will be situated.
</p>

<a name="50406-32_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>It seems to me that these two issues have not been satisfactorily &quot;bottomed&quot; yet. As regards the relationship between the licensing system and the planning system, we clearly do not have time to discuss that in detail within this wash-up procedure. Nevertheless, however few casinos may be built, we should consider how the systems will work out in practice. If the new regional and large casinos have the effect on an area which it is claimed that they will have&#151;whether that is beneficial or otherwise&#151;clearly, their impact will be important <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the spatial planning system. It seems to me that the Government simply have not thought out the relationship between, and the sequence of events involved, in the two sets of decision-making, how they interact and which will be regarded as the primary system of decision-making. In my view that ought to be the spatial planning system, but I think that the Bill suggests otherwise.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_828"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 828</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-32_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>Great claims are being made in this area as regards regeneration. We shall no doubt find out through experimentation whether that is the case. However, in my view before a decision is made to go ahead with one of these casinos, the local authority concerned and, indeed, the adjacent authorities, need to be absolutely satisfied that the regeneration benefits which are claimed will occur. An independent assessment of that needs to be carried out in each case just as a project of that size which had great environmental implications would have to undergo an environmental impact assessment.
</p>

<a name="50406-32_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>I wish to put on record that I believe those matters have still not been properly sorted out. We have still not received satisfactory explanations, answers and guarantees regarding those issues. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, with regard to the issue that she raised, we shall have to return to these issues in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="50406-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for raising those serious issues and legitimate concerns, but the trouble is that they are not really legitimate concerns for this gambling regulation Bill. They are matters for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and you cannot very well include planning matters in a gambling regulation Bill. If the noble Lord had been present at the many meetings that we have had with ODPM officials and with Ministers, he would appreciate the complexity behind the request that he is making.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="50406-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   If the Minister would like to invite me to such meetings in future, I should be delighted to attend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="50406-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   We shall see who is around after 5 May, shall we?
</p>

<a name="50406-32_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>The issue was recognised by the Secretary of State on Second Reading in the House of Commons. She confirmed that any change of use of a building into a casino will be subject to planning control, which is one of the most important aspects of planning. That cannot appear in the Bill, but it is enormously important in the regulation of casinos. We have been considering how to do that. We have been considering changes to the regime for planning together with ODPM, and those discussions have included regional spatial strategies, on which ODPM has placed a great   deal of emphasis, and to which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred.
</p>

<a name="50406-32_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>Amendment No. 183 is not particularly helpful, because the Bill already has plenty of provision for licensing authorities to make clear their regeneration objectives for the licensing of casinos, and they have all the powers that they require to secure those benefits. Although I do not disagree with the sentiments, I do not see what value it adds to the Bill. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will keep a close watching eye on those developments as they proceed after the Bill becomes law.

(b)   whether an offence is being committed under or by virtue of this Act.&quot;</p>

This group of amendments focuses on a number of improvements to the Bill designed better to protect children and vulnerable adults. Amendments Nos. 68, 111 and 328 add to the powers of the Gambling Commission. They allow the commission to assess whether offences are being committed under the Bill. In particular, they allow the commission to use young people in test purchasing activities to assess the effectiveness of age controls. Because of those powers, licensees will have to be vigilant at all times in ensuring that children are kept out of their premises.

<a name="50406-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>Amendment No. 108 is about gaming machines that children can use, which we call category D machines in this Bill. It follows up the commitment that I made on Second Reading to give Ministers power to limit the effect of any new age requirements for category D <br>&nbsp;<br>

machines to particular types of gaming machines. If there is evidence of a particular risk from children playing one form of machine gaming, Parliament will be able to take action focused on that risk and not damage harmless amusements. That means that we can exclude machines such as penny pushers and crane machines from any future age restriction, if appropriate. It also means that, before proposing to Parliament that an age limit be placed on the use of particular types of machine, the Secretary of State must consult the Gambling Commission, relevant parts of the gambling industry and people involved with problem gambling.

<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>Amendment No. 79 provides that equipment used by remote gambling operators to store their customers&#039; personal information and to keep records of customers&#039; gambling transaction history will count as remote gambling equipment for the purposes of the Bill. Amendment No. 82 amends the definition of remote gambling equipment by replacing equipment to process payments with equipment to record the results of gambling&#151;whether someone has won or lost. Both that and the previous amendment ensure that equipment integral to the provision of remote gambling is covered by the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>Amendment No. 89 excludes remote communications providers from the offence of installing or supplying gambling software. It clarifies that a person does not commit an offence if they provide only communications equipment or services&#151;for example, a mobile telephone network&#151;even if they are then used to download gambling software. Amendment No. 142 corrects a drafting error. Amendments Nos. 143 and 158 address concerns about the way in which the Bill works in relation to player-to-player operations such as online poker equipment shared between British and overseas companies.
</p>

<a name="50406-33_para17"></a>

<p><a name="st_256"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No.   102A, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 135 to 138, 187, 220, 234A, 244, 247 to 249, 378A and 381.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>The Government decided earlier in the passage of the Bill that the number of regional casinos should be subject to a limit of eight in the first place. Some have argued that eight is too many and that there should be a smaller test of the regional casino concept before more licences are authorised.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>In another place the Opposition proposed an amendment which would have applied a limit of four to regional casinos. They have now maintained that that is too high and that there should be no more than a single regional casino in the first place. They have made it clear that their support for the passage of the Bill is contingent on such a limitation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_834"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 834</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-34_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>We have from the outset emphasized the precautionary principle. In other words, where there is room for reasonable doubt about the social impact of allowing more opportunities for gambling, we should err on the side of caution and maintain stricter regulation until there is empirical evidence which provides the necessary reassurance.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>In the case of regional casinos an initial limit of one rather than eight is consistent with the precautionary principle. We have therefore agreed with the Opposition that the Bill should be amended to provide for one regional casino licence, rather than eight. This group of amendments includes Amendment No. 234A, which has that effect. It also includes Amendment No. 235 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, which has the same effect, although our quantity is better than his.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>However, I wish to make it clear, as the Government have made it clear to the Opposition, that we do not and cannot rule out at this stage the possibility that at some later stage there might be a case for asking Parliament to agree to some increase above a single licence. In that event, it would be for Parliament to decide. The Bill, as already drafted, provides for any change to the number of regional licences to require the affirmative resolution of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>However, the effect of the present amendment is plain: the Bill will provide for one and only one regional casino licence in the first place. We will proceed with planning for implementation on that basis. We will keep the position under review with an open mind, and we will look to Parliament to do the same if the need arises.

</p>

<a name="50406-34_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>When the House met in Committee on 10 March there was strong feeling that more needed to be done in the Bill to ensure that casinos maintained effective controls on entry to the gambling areas of their casinos. On 10   March, I highlighted the very rigorous measures that are in place and that the Government intend to impose through the Bill, which together will ensure that only adults can enter the gambling area of casinos; that when they gamble they are provided with the toughest protection against problem gambling anywhere in the world; and that effective measures will continue to be in place to protect against any threat of money laundering in casinos. In each of these areas&#151;the exclusion of children from gambling areas, effective action to protect against problem gambling, and action against money laundering&#151;the Government are confident that the combination of action under the Bill and the existing money-laundering regulations will achieve all the objectives which I think are shared across the House.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_597"></a>The Government took careful note of the mood of the Committee on 10 March and I said that I was only   too happy to discuss the matter in detail with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and the noble Lord, Lord   Clement-Jones. We have had very constructive discussions. Those have resulted in government Amendments Nos. 102A and 243A.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>I want to reiterate what I said about money laundering and the requirements on casino customers to provide identification now and in the future. The second money-laundering directive is enforced now <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_835"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 835</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

through Treasury regulations. Those regulations require identification of casino customers on entry, and the Gaming Board and the Treasury issue guidance on acceptable forms of ID. That system is working well and will continue to have effect whether or not this Bill comes into effect.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>Alongside the enforcement of the second directive, we are now considering with other member states a third directive. Like the second directive, the draft third directive offers casinos the option of identifying customers on entry or when they spend a given amount of money which is proposed at 1,000 euros. No final decision on the third directive has yet been taken. I want to be clear, however, that the Government are entirely committed to firm action to combat money laundering and to the requirements for identification that comes with that. We will impose effective identification requirements on casinos now and in the future.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_600"></a>I want to reiterate also what I said about action to combat risks of problem gambling. The Bill bristles with new powers to protect vulnerable consumers. It gives the Gambling Commission unprecedented powers to interfere with the detailed operation of gambling premises to negate risks of problem gambling. It requires the commission to issue a code of practice on social responsibility. It makes it a condition of each operating licence that the licensee complies with the code. I can say without fear of contradiction that no consumers in any modern gambling industry will be as comprehensively protected as those in British casinos.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_601"></a>The amendments give expression to the pledges I gave. Amendment No. 234A imposes new requirements on casino operators to ensure that those under 18 cannot gain entry to casinos or the gambling areas of regional casinos. The amendment is mainly concerned with ensuring two things: that there are staff supervising all entry points, and that where there is any reasonable doubt whether a person is aged 18 or over, that person is required to produce evidence of age. Under the amendment the Gambling Commission will be required to issue a code of practice spelling out the detailed arrangements which operators are to make to achieve those two objectives. The Gambling Commission code will deal specifically with the nature of ID evidence that operators will need to obtain. The code of practice on age verification will be mandatory, not advisory.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>It will be a condition of the premises licence that the licensee complies with the code. If they do not, they will breach the terms of their licence even if it turns out that the person concerned was in fact over 18. So the burden of responsibility falls squarely on the casino, as it should.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_603"></a>As I said in Committee, there is already in the Bill a specific criminal offence in Clause 46(1) that places a strong burden of responsibility on casinos to keep children out. But I want to underline that we have listened. In these amendments we have proposed even tougher arrangements that will protect children and can reassure parents. Government Amendments Nos. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_836"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 836</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

135, 136, 137, 138 and 244 follow on from the announcement I made on Second Reading about the use of credit cards in casinos. They prevent customers using their credit cards in payment for gambling in a casino. The Bill as already drafted prohibits the use of   credit cards in gaming machines, but these amendments extend this to all gambling in a casino. They do allow cash machines to remain in casinos so long as there is no commercial relationship between the casino and the machine provider. The casino must also ensure that conditions relating to the location of such machines are observed properly.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_604"></a>We also gave an undertaking to provide the Secretary of State with a reserve power to order licensing authorities to consider whether to pass a casino resolution. Amendments Nos. 187 and 220 do that. Amendments Nos. 247, 248, 249 and 381 ensure that, where bingo and casino operators use their own staff for door supervision purposes, they continue to be exempt from being licensed under the Private Security Industry Act 2001. We believe that the controls in the Bill are enough to regulate those matters.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_605"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 378A. Some of the provisions in this amendment are merely consequential on the provisions of Part 12 of the Bill relating to alcohol licensed premises. They ensure that the provisions of the Gaming Act 1968 are consistent with the provisions of Part 12, but the amendment also makes new proposals in relation to casinos licensed under that Act. The amendments indicate the Government&#039;s positive and constructive response to the concerns raised by the British casino industry, which were reflected in a number of comments in Committee and at Second Reading.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_606"></a>The Government are pledged to take a precautionary approach to the reform of the law on casinos. The public and the House of Commons demanded changes to the Bill that ensured a controlled evolution of the casino market, and we will honour our promise to take this process of change slowly.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_607"></a>The Bill allows for new styles of casino, with many more gaming machines than existing casinos. Of course, all companies operating casinos now will be eligible to apply for the new licences, and I am sure that they will be well placed to win them. The Bill sets limits on the number of new licences in the first phase of the new regime. There will be no more new-style licences until we have had an opportunity to assess the impact of the new casinos and the effectiveness of the Gambling Commission&#039;s new protections against problem gambling. We think that this precautionary principle is necessary and we shall not compromise on it.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_608"></a>In that context, the Government do not consider it prudent to allow all existing casinos to convert into new-style casinos immediately. We think it more appropriate to delay such conversion until the safety of the new forms of casino has been confirmed in practice. Equally, we believe that it is reasonable to permit existing casinos some of the new commercial freedoms offered to new casinos. Accordingly, existing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_837"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 837</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

casinos will be able to advertise and will not be required to operate as members&#039; clubs if they do not want to do so.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_609"></a>The Government have reflected carefully on the mood of the House in Committee and have considered very carefully since then whether existing casinos can be permitted some additional commercial rights without jeopardising our essential priority of ensuring a cautious and gradual approach to the process of change.

</p>

<a name="50406-34_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_610"></a>After careful consideration, and in the light of the improved protections offered by the new system of regulation to be administered by the Gambling Commission, the Government feel able to come forward with new proposals today. Those proposals are as follows.

</p>

<a name="50406-34_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_611"></a>We propose to increase the maximum stake for existing casino jackpot gaming machines from its present 50 pence to &#163;2, and we propose to increase the maximum prize for existing casino jackpot gaming machines from &#163;2,000 to &#163;4,000. We shall also allow casinos, within an overall enhanced limit of 20 machines, to provide a new form of gaming machine, with stakes and prizes the same as now offered by fixed-odds betting terminals in betting offices. We propose that all these changes relating to machines should be implemented as soon as practicable after Royal Assent, and certainly this year. We also propose that existing casinos should be entitled to install 40 automatic terminals for casino table games. Lastly, we propose that the statutory delay of 24 hours between joining a casino and first being permitted to play should be abolished as soon as practicable following Royal Assent, bringing forward the lifting of this burden by two years.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_612"></a>Those changes will be given effect partly through the Bill and partly through the use of secondary legislation under the Gaming Act 1968. But I give a pledge today that the Government will implement the changes as soon as possible following the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_613"></a>I recognise entirely that the proposals in this Bill on casinos have caused concern and controversy. People across the country have strong views and a certain anxiety about casino gambling. The Government respect those views and we agree that they should be taken slowly, in a way that Parliament and the Government can control. We also want the system to be fair to all sections of the casino industry, as we believe it is. Fair does not mean that everyone gets what they might want in an ideal world; it means that there are reasonable opportunities for all concerned to prosper with a framework where public protection is paramount.
</p>

<a name="50406-34_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_614"></a>This package of new proposals is the final part of the overall package of reform for casinos. It has been a difficult process and the Government are committed to keeping close control over the issue as it develops. But, with the reassurances I have offered today about effective supervision in casinos, I hope that the Committee will agree that the Government now have the overall balance about right. I beg to move.

<a name="50406-35_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Southwell: </b>   I am very grateful, as I am sure others are, to the Minister as, after the first day in Committee, he kindly sent very fulsome explanatory notes to us all on some of the technicalities of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_615"></a>I refer particularly to Amendment No. 234A. I too would like to add my support to the measure which would reduce the number of regional casinos to just one. These new casinos will house some of the most addictive forms of gambling and if they are to be introduced into the United Kingdom at all, it is better to do so very slowly to minimise any potential explosion in the number of problem gamblers.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_616"></a>I also pay tribute to some of the organisations that have consistently argued for better protection for children and vulnerable people in the Gambling Bill, including those from the faith communities, especially the Salvation Army and the Methodist Church.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_617"></a>Of course, there are parts of the Bill that still disappoint. I am still deeply saddened that the Bill will leave the UK the only country in the developed world which allows children to gamble. That is all the more disappointing when one learns that more than 50,000 people signed a petition in the last few weeks of the Bill&#039;s progress calling on children to be prohibited from playing on fruit machines.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_618"></a>I hope that the Government and the new Gambling Commission will continue to look at this issue&#151;the Minister has already hinted at that&#151;as it is one that has generated wide public interest and concern. Having said that, the Bill is in an infinitely better state than when it was first introduced to Parliament last October. On balance it is now better to have it than not. If nothing else, the whole process has shone the spotlight on the hidden addiction of problem gambling. I hope that children and vulnerable people will always be put first in social legislation of this kind in the future.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_619"></a>Will the Minister correct a misunderstanding of mine? I believe that under the powers of the Bill he has the ability to make orders. If that is the case, will the Minister give an undertaking to the House not to use order-making powers without a proper pilot period, without an independent impact assessment and without publishing it first in Parliament? If I am misguided on that, I am sure that the Minister will correct me.

<a name="50406-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Blaker: </b>   Like the right reverend Prelate, I too wish to speak to Amendment No. 234A. I declare an interest in that for 28 years I was a Member of Parliament for Blackpool and, therefore, I have been deeply interested in the entertainment industry. It is very sensible to start with one licence as opposed to eight. If there are lessons to be learnt from the experience, which is a new one, they will apply to only one as opposed to eight.

<a name="50406-35_para5"></a>

to making innovations. We all know of the Blackpool Tower and the Tower Ballroom. Blackpool was the first town in Britain to have trams; the illuminations were invented in Blackpool; and we still have the Pleasure Beach which every year moves forward with terrifying rides on which I used to be obliged to ride to launch them when I was a Member of Parliament for that constituency. So Blackpool is doing much to remedy the tourism deficit that we suffer as a country. I believe that a casino in Blackpool will help the town to strengthen that role. Blackpool needs regeneration. The days of the Wakes Weeks disappeared some time ago. Foreign travel has provided very serious competition to all our tourist towns.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_621"></a>The mobility of the British people, because they now   almost all have motor cars, has adversely affected our traditional holiday resorts. So the pattern in Blackpool, as in other seaside towns, is now very much the day visitor as opposed to the two weeks&#039; stay of the Wakes Weeks tourist. It has meant a decline in investment in Blackpool, which has been suffering for the past couple of decades. A casino would enormously help the regeneration of Blackpool.

<p><a name="stpa_622"></a>My last point is that the people of Blackpool are very keen to have a casino. This is the view of all three parties in the town. The Labour Party is the largest party, but the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties agree on the importance of a casino for Blackpool. That is also the view of businesses in the town and of most of the residents, with a very few exceptions. There will always be some opposition in whatever place the casino is.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_623"></a>I conclude by saying that I believe that Blackpool has all the qualities necessary to make a success of the first casino.

<a name="50406-35_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Thornton: </b>   I refer to Amendment No. 243A. I realise at this stage in the Bill that comments and questions are not very welcome. I start by congratulating my noble friend the Minister on the way he has conducted the discussions on the Bill by paper. I think that he has created new methods for grouping and discussing things on a Bill, from which perhaps we could learn something for the future.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_624"></a>My concern&#151;and I am happy to have this answered in writing&#151;is that if the amendment we passed in Committee is carried through and proof of identity works properly, it seems to me that this amendment&#151;and I am always in favour of protecting children and young people&#151;is not necessary. If, however, this amendment is being proposed by the Government because of a deal they have made with the Opposition to drop or somehow change the amendment agreed earlier in Committee, I am puzzled and dismayed by that.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_625"></a>My second brief point is that those of us who are concerned with protecting children will want to look at the matter very carefully, because I am not sure that this amendment affords protection. I heard the words my noble friend said and then I looked at the words here. I am not absolutely sure that this is as robust a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_840"></a>

protection as one would desire for children. Certainly later on when we are looking at codes of practice we will wish to look at that more carefully.

<a name="50406-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I wish to speak particularly to Amendments Nos. 234A and 235. It would be churlish of me not to congratulate the Government on accepting the amendment which I tabled as Amendment No. 235 to reduce the number of regional casinos to one. I am not sure that they have not been dragged kicking and screaming to that position by the other parties. Nevertheless, I congratulate them on it.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_626"></a>I also congratulate the Government&#151;it would be churlish of me not to&#151;on their superior grammar. The Minister referred to the fact that the Government had discovered that singular nouns in English normally do not take an &quot;s&quot;, which was something that had escaped me. But then I thought, &quot;Well, the Government have parliamentary draftsmen, haven&#039;t they, and this is the kind of thing they must be good at&quot;. So I think that is a good move.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_627"></a>In fact, I would congratulate both Opposition Front Benches generally on the changes which they have achieved to the Bill during the wash-up. I say that to the Conservative Front Bench as well as to my own. I do not agree with all the changes; I think that some of them are wrong. Nevertheless, overall the Bill is a better Bill, or perhaps a less bad Bill in some respects&#151;there are huge parts of this Bill which are good&#151;than it was when it first came to this House.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_628"></a>The wash-up process is not very desirable, with deals done not so much in smoke-filled rooms nowadays but certainly behind &quot;closed doors&quot; rather than on the Floor of the House, where they ought to be seen to be done. Nevertheless, I suspect that the Bill, when it is enacted, will be better than it would have been had we done things the proper, democratic way. That might have resulted in lots of ping-pong, with messages delivered up and down the corridors every two hours and eventually your Lordships having to give in to the elected House, as happens so often. The wash-up is perhaps an opportunity for the opposition parties to exercise a bit more power, which is a good thing. For those of us who were not part of that process, it is all a bit confusing and bewildering.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_629"></a>I tabled an amendment to reduce the number of casino premises licences to one on the basis that, although it should be possible to have an experiment, there ought to be just one on something as big as this. The noble Lord spoke about Blackpool, although the Bill does not state where the one regional casino will be. That decision is subject to the processes laid down in the Bill; the Government must decide. Bids and offers must be made. The newspapers are full of suggestions that the location will be Blackpool, but it may be somewhere else. If it is Blackpool, I hope that caution will be exercised.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_630"></a>The noble Lord suggested that people in Blackpool were dancing in the streets at the prospect of a regional casino, but I am not sure that that is entirely the case. Blackpool Council was almost unanimously in favour of a casino&#151;some Liberal Democrat councillors <br>&nbsp;<br>

oppose it. The council and the main organisations in the town have united to mount an extremely effective presentation and campaign in favour of a casino in Blackpool.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_631"></a>I do not know whether people in Blackpool generally would favour a casino when all the implications and arguments for and against one had been put forward. I am told by friends in Blackpool that it is by no means clear that people in the town are in favour of a casino; they believe that people are not. I challenge Blackpool Council or any other council wishing to submit a proposal for a regional casino, particularly somewhere such as Blackpool, where it would dominate the town, unlike in Manchester or Birmingham, to hold a referendum. Edinburgh City Council held a referendum on its controversial congestion charging scheme. Some said that it was foolish to hold a referendum; it had the guts to do so, but it did not get its own way. If Blackpool councillors want a regional casino, they should hold a referendum among their people; otherwise, they cannot prove that people in Blackpool really want one.
</p>

<a name="50406-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_632"></a>Having said that, it would be churlish of me not to welcome the Government&#039;s acceptance, by some means or other, of my amendment in all but its grammar.

<a name="50406-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   There are in the Chamber at this late hour five members of the joint scrutiny committee that looked at the draft gambling Bill. Noble Lords will recall that that Bill is very different from the one that we are approving today.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_633"></a>The committee was completely united on the need for new gambling legislation, the establishment of the Gambling Commission and new regulations to take account of the changes in technology that have occurred since the last occasion on which Parliament reviewed the law on gambling. If the price of getting that legislation is that there must be fewer casinos than the Government would have preferred, it is worth paying.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_634"></a>There was considerable unease in the joint scrutiny committee about the prospect of a free market applying to where the new large regional casinos should be located. One of the ironies of the free market argument was that, if there were to be a significant number of regional casinos elsewhere in the north-west, the one place where one would not finish up was Blackpool. The circle has now turned completely, and it seems very probable that the process that the Government are setting up will come to the logical conclusion that Blackpool is the right place.

I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is right to say that there is substantial opposition in the town. Certainly, the Joint Scrutiny Committee was satisfied by the strength of support that we found at all levels&#151;from councillors and elsewhere.

</p>

<a name="50406-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_636"></a>It is interesting that the press release put out by the Conservative Party earlier this week in the name of Mr John Whittingdale states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88"></a>&quot;We have . . .  told the Government that we will accept the establishment of just one regional casino as a prototype, in order to assess its impact. Its location should be a leisure resort where the regeneration potential is greatest. The case for locating such a casino in Blackpool is very strong&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50406-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_637"></a>I do not disagree with that. I do not expect my noble friend to comment on it, but I am sure that the team of wise people that he sets up will take account of what the Conservative Party has said, what the leader of the Liberal Democrat Peers said so forcefully earlier and what a number of other Members of this House have said in favour of giving Blackpool the opportunity to prove whether or not regeneration can be achieved through casino development.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_638"></a>The Government are sensible to agree, through the usual channels, to allow that to happen. It is crucial that we pass the Bill tonight. I commend the work that my noble friend Lord McIntosh has done in that respect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_262"></a>
<a name="50406-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   I, like the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, was a member of the Joint Select Committee. I speak in that capacity, and I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, said about our attitude to the Bill and the changes that have latterly occurred. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on having been the first person to select the number that the Government have now adopted. He and I have a curious idiosyncratic allegiance and alliance on a series of bits of legislation, and I am delighted to see that he has maintained his usual standard.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_639"></a>I am conscious that the Government have powers under Clause 173(4) for influencing the choice of where the one casino will be. I, like the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, will not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, said, which was a highly coherent and eloquent observation about Blackpool. However, Blackpool was, as I recall, the first entity outside London to make an approach to the Joint Select Committee and to make it clear that it would be necessary for us to make visits outside London in order to see what was going on on the ground. Indeed, that prompted our first visit outside London.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_640"></a>I echo the comments referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, from Mr Whittingdale. If there is a strong motivation in the legislation for using the regional casino concept as an instrument of urban regeneration and if the Bill affords power only to have a single casino as a pilot project, there is a strong case for having that pilot project in an area where leisure provision specifically has played a singular and notable part in the past.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_641"></a>I say that, in particular, because it is important that the regional casino should not simply be thought of as a casino but as one that has the same comprehensive and integrated approach to leisure activity that some Members of the Committee saw on a visit to France. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_843"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 843</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Since Blackpool has those specifications, it represents a potentially extremely apposite test-bed for the first pilot project to be run.
</p>




<p><a name="st_263"></a>
<a name="50406-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   First, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for his kind words about the so-called deal that has been struck. We certainly have some sympathy on these Benches for what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said about the wash-up. In many senses, it is not satisfactory, but the truth is that we have a Prime Minister who has chosen to go to the country after fewer than four years of this Parliament.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_642"></a>Right from the start, the Bill has been treated as a tail-end Charlie. Tonight is no exception. It was known this morning that this is the one Bill that is now uncontentious and widely acceptable, yet we are put on last, having seen all the contentious Bills taken first. Sometimes I question whether the Government feel that this legislation really is a priority.

</p>

<a name="50406-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_643"></a>We have always made it clear that we support much in the Bill, in particular the establishment of the Gambling Commission and the regulation of remote gambling. Those issues have been largely uncontentious. We also agree with noble Lords who have said tonight that it is important that these measures reach the statute book as soon as possible. To that extent, we are pleased to have reached the stage where we shall see the Bill pass.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_644"></a>On regional casinos, we have felt strongly about this from the start. I said at Second Reading words to the effect that the question of the number of regional casinos was almost irrelevant because it is to be a complete shot in the dark. We are talking about a huge cultural step change in considering regional casinos in the form of resorts or leisure facilities&#151;whatever they may be called. This is a very different cultural concept from anything we have experienced hitherto in this country. So, after much thought and consideration and taking into account all that has been said in both Houses in the brief time we have had to debate the matter, along with the extensive input from beyond your Lordships&#039; House, we feel that this precautionary measure should be taken. I use the words of the Minister in agreeing that we should begin with the   cautionary measure of having one test case. We are grateful that the Government have conceded and accepted that approach. The deal will allow this Bill to go through.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_645"></a>I want to add my support to all noble Lords who have referred to Blackpool. I was keen to echo the words of my honourable friend Mr John Whittingdale, who I see is here with us, but that has already been done for me by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, to whom I am extremely grateful. Of course it is not for us to dictate which town or city should be lucky enough to have this opportunity, if they deem it right. But I have to say that Blackpool has made an extraordinarily strong case. We have always said, as have the Government, that the priority must be regeneration. The case for locating a casino in an established leisure resort away from the doorstep seems entirely sensible.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_844"></a>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 844</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50406-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_646"></a>I want to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who suggested that perhaps people would be dancing in the streets of Blackpool tonight. I have to say to the noble Lord that only a short while ago I spoke to the chief executive of Blackpool Council who made it absolutely clear that whatever is said tonight in your Lordships&#039; House, the people of Blackpool are not complacent. There is no question about that. They know that this is not in the bag and that a job has to be done. But it is clear that Blackpool representatives have worked hard to persuade noble Lords and others that the resort has a strong case. Indeed, that case has been strengthened by my noble friends Lord Blaker and Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville.

</p>

<a name="50406-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_647"></a>I want to put one question to the Minister. He said that under the affirmative order, it would be possible to introduce more regional casinos. I believe he said that it would not be ruled out at a later stage to provide for additional casinos by affirmative order. On what basis would those additional casinos be introduced? Is it a question of demand, in which case what kind of tests will be used to assess it? Can the Minister reassure us that they will not be introduced as the result of pressure put on the Government by commercial companies or local authorities? Given the speed with which this Bill is passing through all its stages, we want to feel comfortable that all the necessary considerations and consultations will be taken carefully into account to ensure that the test case has proved successful and that the impact has not been derogatory.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_648"></a>At this point I am looking straight at the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, who I know feels as strongly as I do about child protection. I strongly support the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell in relation to the need to consider the issues of child protection and   problem gambling. The social impact is of crucial importance. It was the priority of our debates on the first day in Committee and I wish to question the Minister briefly on that point.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_649"></a>That is all I have to say in relation to regional casinos. However, I wish to respond briefly to the question of the   noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, in regard to identification for entry into gaming areas. The noble Baroness knows that I felt strongly enough about this issue to bring forward an amendment on the first day in Committee and to press it to a vote. That was not easy because the Minister was seeking to reassure me in Committee that the amendment was not necessary. However, I felt that it was necessary&#151;I do not regret it&#151;and I am grateful that the amendment was passed.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_650"></a>That said, however, since then the Minister has persuaded me that we should accept Amendment No.   243A in lieu of our amendment. I hope the Committee will support me in that. I have considered the amendment with care and I have heard what the noble Baroness has said. Her concern perhaps is that what the Minister has said in relation to the amendment does not add up to what is stated in the amendment itself.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_651"></a>After much thought, I have decided that we should accept the amendment because, in a sense, it is rather more flexible in regard to supervision and what may be introduced in the years to come. The test case regional <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 845</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

casino will not be established for some years, by which time it is hoped and assumed that technology will have developed such that the wording of our amendment perhaps might be otiose or anachronistic. Methods of testing individual identification in order to check age will have improved, and I have decided that we should be sensible and leave it to the Gambling Commission to &quot;watch that space&quot;. It is mandatory that it should consider and issue one or more codes of practice in regard to access to casino premises for children and young persons. I hope that begins to clarify the point.
</p>

<a name="50406-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_652"></a>That is all I have to say. We are grateful for the   concessions that the Government have made. However, when we are in government&#151;which will be following the election&#151;I can reassure the Committee here and now that we will proceed with care with this legislation when it is put in place.

<p><a name="st_264"></a>
<a name="50406-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   The group of amendments brought forward by the Minister is absolutely crucial to the agreements that have been reached between the Government and the Opposition Front Benches. I add my thanks to those of other noble Lords to the Minister for tabling the amendments, which hide a considerable amount of work carried out by officials and those who have had discussions with the Minister and his colleagues. We on these Benches agree that they broadly improve the Bill and emphasise the precautionary approach.
</p>

<a name="50406-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_653"></a>To that extent&#151;and I note what the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said&#151;I very much agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, on the issue of identity. The government amendments address the key issues that we raised in principle on the first day in Committee, despite the fact that they do not go as far as referring to photographic identification. We shall see the upshot of this when, in a sense, the experiment is carried out. We will then be able to assess whether or not this really is a proper precautionary approach or whether a firmer approach should be taken.
</p>

<a name="50406-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_654"></a>Finally, I could not stand here without mentioning Blackpool. I will draw the attention of my noble friend Lord McNally, my leader in this House, to the words of all noble Lords who have mentioned Blackpool, including myself. We will not be allowed by competition law to stack the cards&#151;if that is the right expression in the context of this Bill&#151;in favour of Blackpool, but it will depend on the strength of its case. I think that all noble Lords agree that it has a very strong case indeed.

<a name="50406-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_656"></a>The right reverend Prelate is quite right that as a result of this process we know more than we did about problem gambling, and we have brought that to the fore. That has been true of the process right the way through, from the Budd report to the Government response to the Greenway committee and to the proceedings in Parliament. We may know more than we did, but we do not know anything like enough. I still think that much more needs to be done in researching problem gambling before we can be certain that we have our policy objectives right. There are indications which we have followed, but I repeat the assurance about continuing with prevalent studies and going further in terms of research into problem gambling.
</p>

<a name="50406-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_657"></a>The right reverend Prelate asked me to give an assurance that when we use our order-making powers, we will test them and consult widely. I can certainly give him that assurance. The Gambling Commission will of course be critical in advising us on what order-making powers should be used and how they should be used. We will also be consulting widely, as I have said on more than one occasion, not just with the industry but with the public and those who are expert on issues of problem gambling.

<a name="50406-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_658"></a>I shall not be drawn down the path of support for any one location for a single regional casino. It would be absurd for a Minister to bring forward a Bill which institutes an independent advisory panel to say where regional large and small casinos would be and then say, &quot;By the way, we have decided the answer to the question we are setting you&quot;. Anybody with any sensitivity will have heard the views that have been expressed in the House but they are not going to be expressed by me.
</p>

<a name="50406-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_659"></a>My noble friend Lady Thornton asked about Amendment No. 243A. I can confirm that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is right that we have tabled Amendment No. 243A in preference to the amendments which were debated on the first day of the Committee stage. We took the view that behind those amendments were two particular problems, those of money laundering and preventing access by children. There were problems with the amendments which were debated before, which I shall not go into, but we believe that these amendments address those issues, and I am glad that there has been agreement on that.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_660"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, asked when and in what circumstances we think it would be safe and prudent to permit more than one regional casino. It is not possible to predict that at the moment. We would have to make a judgment that balanced the risks of enlarging the number of people who would be affected against the risk of drawing the initial phase too narrowly to produce reliable evidence. In due course, it might be possible to remove numerical limits altogether, but we would not rush to any such judgment and I can repeat the assurance that I gave the noble Baroness that this decision would be one that would be taken by Parliament.

&quot;(2)   An operating licence may be subject to a condition (whether imposed by virtue of section 73, 75 or 76) that a specified gaming machine may not be made available for use in reliance on the licence if the Commission has notified the licensee in writing that the manufacture, supply, installation, adaptation, maintenance or repair of the machine&#151;

<br>
(a)   was not carried out in reliance on a gaming machine technical operating licence, or


<br>
(b)   did not comply with standards established under or by virtue of section 94.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_276"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 140 is a practical measure, allowing the commission to notify licence holders that the gaming machines that they use have been manufactured or supplied without a licence or in breach of technical standards. We would expect <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 850</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

all operators to take proper steps to check such matters, but there may be times when the commission is aware of problems, when operators are not. Once notified, conditions can be attached to the operator&#039;s licence requiring such machines not to be used. That will help to protect the public from illegal machines.
</p>

<a name="50406-38_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_729"></a>Amendment No. 146 is a drafting amendment. Amendments Nos. 233, 274 and 275 will allow casinos to provide automated casino games in addition to their gaming machine entitlement. We propose that casinos should be permitted no more than 40 player positions. The Gambling Commission will then control the specification of those machines by licence conditions.

<p><a name="stpa_730"></a>Amendments Nos. 269 to 271, 276, 277 and 281 are drafting amendments designed to ensure that the definitions and scope of powers in Part 10 are effective.

<a name="50406-38_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_731"></a>Amendment No. 272 addresses a point raised by the noble Lord, the Lord Mancroft, at Second Reading. The noble Lord said that it was unreasonable for the definition in Clause 229 to prohibit lottery vending machines that also displayed the result of the lottery. We have thought about that, and we are content for such machines to be outside the controls of Part 10. However, we need to retain control over the speed at which results can be displayed. If they were displayed every 30 seconds, for example, they could be very addictive. Amendment No. 272 also requires Ministers to set a minimum time before the result of the lottery can be displayed on the machine. We will gladly discuss that matter with the industry and the Gaming Board.
</p>

<a name="50406-38_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_732"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 273A, 275, 319B, 319C, 319D, 319E and 326A ensure that seaside and other arcades will continue to be able to offer prize bingo by machine, outside the normal gaming machine regime. The amendments also resolve some related technical difficulties in Part 13 of the Bill. In particular, they ensure that forms of prize bingo where the prize is in part determined by the progress of the game&#151;for example, where an enhanced prize can be offered to anyone calling &quot;House&quot; within a set number of numbers&#151;can continue.

(b)   for that purpose, require the holder of a casino premises licence to ensure&#151;


<br>
(i)   that each entrance to prohibited premises or to a prohibited area is supervised by one or more persons whose responsibilities include ensuring compliance with the code of practice (&quot;the supervisor&quot;), and

<a name="50406-47_para3"></a>

The measures are effective 30 days after the adoption of the resolution, unless the Security Council decides that the parties concerned have complied with their commitments in the peace process and demands made by the council in this and previous resolutions. Resolution 1591 (2005) also established a UN sanctions committee and a panel of experts to monitor implementation and enforcement of the measures.

<a name="50406-47_head9"></a><h3 align=center>Barcelona Review: UK National Contribution</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="50406-47_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   At last November&#039;s EuroMed foreign ministerial meeting in The Hague, EuroMed Foreign Ministers launched a review of the first 10 years of the Barcelona process and its future direction. A copy of the UK&#039;s national contribution to the Barcelona review has been placed in the Library of the House.

</p>

<a name="50406-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>We believe that the review provides the opportunity to refocus the priorities of the Barcelona process and help ensure it delivers results that have a real positive impact for EU and Mediterranean partner citizens. We want to see the review generate a real debate among all EuroMed partners, and in their civil societies, of how to enhance the partnership. We believe that EuroMed should be guided by the principles of the EU&#039;s strategic partnership with the Mediterranean and Middle East and the European neighbourhood policy, but mostly by the desire of Mediterranean partners for the EU&#039;s engagement and assistance in meeting the challenges of political, social and economic development.
</p>

<a name="50406-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>Our national contribution proposes a strategic approach to achieving the vision set out in the 1995 Barcelona declaration. We want to focus EuroMed on achieving a limited number of 10-year targets on governance, education and economic reform. Improved education systems and more vigorous open market competitive economies are crucial to economic growth in EuroMed countries. Without these countries we will not be able to take advantage of trade liberalisation and the creation of a Euromed Free Trade Area by 2010. And improved governance based on democratic institutions, and civil society institutions especially for women and free media, will facilitate the achievement of these targets, as will focused and effective development assistance from the EU.
</p>

<a name="50406-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>This is an ambitious agenda, but one whose success is critical to removing the barriers to development in the Middle East and North Africa and to enhancing the relationship between Europe and that region. The review will be negotiated among the 35 EuroMed partners, all of whom will have their own aims and objectives. It will be submitted to Ministers at the EuroMed foreign ministerial meeting in May and will constitute the main input to the EuroMed tenth anniversary event, which the UK will host jointly with Spain in November in Barcelona.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="50406-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach </b>  : My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50406-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>I am announcing today the award of a contract to Westland Helicopters Ltd for phase one of the Sea King integrated operational support programme, part   of the wider defence logistics transformation programme, which is seeking to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of military logistics support to the front line. The contract is worth &#163;300 million over the first five years, with a price review thereafter, and includes the provision of technical and spares support to the Sea King fleet. It will result in savings of some &#163;50 million over 10 years, which is a considerable improvement on current support costs.
</p>

<a name="50406-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>There are seven different variants of Sea King currently in service with the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force in a variety of roles including maritime, air-sea rescue operations and support to land forces. The Sea King integrated operational support programme will improve the way in which support is provided for the Sea King platform, focusing on maximising aircraft availability, improving spares delivery and reducing through-life costs. It will secure the ability of the Sea King to continue operations in support of the UK Armed Forces in the future.
</p>

<a name="50406-48_para5"></a>

1   Departments and agencies which received 10 MPs/Peers letters or less during 2004 are not shown in this table. Holding or interim replies are not included unless otherwise indicated.<br>

2   Internal restructuring and changes to the correspondence handling system undertaken during second half of 2004. As a result, performance improved to 88 per cent during that period.<br>

3   Includes all ministerial correspondence.<br>

4   Downturn in performance due to internal restructuring and changes in the correspondence handling system. Introduction of new system improved performance to 82 per cent in the last quarter of 2004.<br>

5   Unit is aware of poor performance in 2004 and is taking the necessary measures to improve performance in 2005.<br>

6   Performance improved to 91 per cent in final quarter of 2004.<br>

The situation in Darfur was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by a United Nations Security Council Resolution on 31 March. The UK sponsored this resolution, and we believe that the ICC is the best judicial mechanism to deal with the perpetrators of the crimes in Darfur.

<p><a name="wa_qn_38"></a>
<a name="50406w05_wqn3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_46"></a>What are the implications of the transitional provisions in paragraph 2(1) of the Electricity (Applications for Licences, Modification of an Area   and Extensions and Restrictions of Licences) (No. 2) Regulations (S.I. 2004/2952) and the Gas   (Applications for Licences and Extensions and Restrictions of Licences) (No. 2) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/2983).   [HL1549]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_42"></a>
<a name="50406w05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville:  </b>  The implications of the transitional provisions are that any applications that were made under previous regulations and were being processed when these regulations came into force would be deemed to be valid under the new regulations.
</p>

<a name="50406w05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_22"></a>In previous cases where we have produced amended regulations we have said that the applicant will need to provide any additional information required under the new regulations or something to state that no further information is required.

<a name="50406w05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a>However, in this case, as there were no changes to the regulations that would affect outstanding applications (as the only change was the introduction of interconnector provisions), this was not necessary; therefore outstanding applications were automatically valid under this provision.

<p><a name="wa_st_43"></a>
<a name="50406w05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville:  </b>  The Symantec research referred to by the noble Lord supports my department&#039;s assessment that there is a challenge to raise awareness among home users on how to use the Internet safely and the sensible precautions they can take.
</p>

<a name="50406w05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a>The DTI is actively engaged in a wide range of activities aimed primarily at business users and the DTI information security website provides best practice guidance for businesses. My officials also regularly work with other government departments, law enforcement agencies and business in promoting awareness and best practice to all users. Current projects include developing warning, advice and reporting points (WARPS) to support user communities and promoting ITsafe (a government website and alert service, providing users and small businesses with help to protect computers and other devices from malicious attacks). In the near future, Project Endurance, a collaborative project involving industry, law enforcement agencies and government departments such as the Cabinet Office, the Home Office and the DTI, will focus on awareness raising and crime prevention for home users.
</p>

<a name="50406w05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a>Of course, educating users is only one solution and there is work to be done in preventing the development and distribution of malicious software. UK law enforcement agencies continue to seek to detect and prosecute individuals in the UK involved in the creation and dissemination of this software, and where appropriate pass on details of such activity to counterparts in other jurisdictions. This is a global issue and my officials continue to work with industry, agencies and other governments in developing ways in which to minimise the impact of computer malware.
