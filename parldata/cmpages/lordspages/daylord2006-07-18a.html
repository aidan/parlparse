My Lords, there are already in place regulations to
protect privacy in the electronic communications field. The Privacy and
Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and the Data
Protection Act 1998 implement the relevant EC directives in this
respect. The Government will keep this legislation under review as the

for that reply. I am sure that he will know that 8 billion embedded
microprocessors are produced each year, which is an alarming number.
The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology states in its
<I>POST note</I> that it is important that the volume of transmitted
data should be kept to a minimum, that transmissions should be
encrypted and sent anonymously without reference to the owner and that
security should be treated as ongoing. The Minister has said that
security will be treated as ongoing. Evidently, there is some concern
about whether manufacturers should be encouraged to build in safeguards
from the very earliest stage. Will the Minister comment on
that?</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000021"></a><b><a name="06071884000306"></a>Lord

Lords, I do not know whether trying to keep the amount of information
to a minimum is a realistic strategy. This will clearly be a huge and
developing trend in the future; now that microprocessors have in-built
communications, this will be a growing field. The Privacy and
Electronic Communications Regulations were introduced to address just
these questions. They require, for example, a system of consents for
processing location-based data. Service providers are required to take
appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the
security of services. For the moment, that seems to be appropriate
legislation but, as I said, we will need to keep it under review as the
technology
develops.</p><p><a name="06071884000022"></a><b><a name="06071884000307"></a>The

the Data Protection

required, it would be sensible to wait until that committee had

for example&#151;debate about whether the Data Protection Act covers
the matter? The National Consumer Council is concerned about whether
people could have all their information transmitted from, say, their
home&#151;or even their body, as was described in relation to medical
things&#151;and not know that it was being obtained or what use it
was likely to be put to. That could be a bad
use.</p><p><a name="06071884000029"></a><b><a name="06071884000314"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> My
Lords, as I said, there are two pieces of legislation: the Data
Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications
Regulations. The second obviously covers the security of data
communication from one place to another. As I said, that involves
issues of consent and security, which are well covered in that
legislation. Of course, it may turn out that the legislation does not
properly cover the subject and that there are issues to be considered.
As I said, however, there have been no complaints on that point as
yet.</p><p><a name="06071884000030"></a><b><a name="06071884000315"></a>Lord

Sainsbury of Turville:</b> Yes, my Lords. This is an
interesting subject. Some microprocessors now have in-built
communication facilities. The most obvious example of that is radio
identification. I do not suppose that the noble Lord ever goes to the
back of his local supermarket, but if he did he would see that packages
that are brought in have an identification code that can be read
electronically without taking the goods off the pallet. That is done by
radio communication and is an enormous step forward in efficiency. The
same principle applies to smart keys; one can open a car door from a
range of three feet with a smart key, using the same
technology.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071884000009"></a>Fuel

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords,
the Government take seriously the problem of oil frauds in Northern
Ireland and have taken strides to deal with that. Matters are
improving, as the noble Earl has acknowledged. I am aware that he has
pursued the suggestion of vehicles having to fill up when they leave
Great Britain, but the Government&#146;s position on that is still
the same: we think that is likely to be regarded as contrary to the EU
treaty concerning quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and,
in any event, would cause considerable practical difficulties such as
the delay caused to vehicles leaving the country and the Customs
resources needed to apply
it.</p><p><a name="06071884000036"></a><b><a name="06071884000321"></a>Lord
Newby:</b> My Lords, could the Minister give us some
idea of the scale of the fraud to which the noble Earl has referred?
Given that it is significant, what discussions are under way with the
Government of the Republic of Ireland to try to minimise
it?</p><p><a name="06071884000037"></a><b><a name="06071884000322"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, the estimates of
non-UK duty-paid consumption for Northern Ireland are based on the
total situation, rather than on just the illicit market, so they do not
distinguish between cross-border shopping and illicit activity. The
latest figure that I have for the amount of lost duty is &#163;245
million for 2004. A considerable amount of activity has been
undertaken, resulting in the dismantling of 76 laundering plants, the
disruption of 17 criminal gangs, 25 convictions for oil frauds and the
seizure of more than 9.94 million litres of fuel and 4,285 vehicles
from oil
fraudsters.</p><p><a name="06071884000038"></a><b><a name="06071884000323"></a>Lord
Hylton:</b> My Lords, from his base in the Treasury,
is the Minister aware that already most of the fuel pumps in Northern
Ireland located within10 or 20 miles of the border have closed
down? Ina sense, it is too late to act. However, would
harmonising duties be of considerable benefit to the rest of the
economy of Northern Ireland?</p><p><a name="06071884000039"></a><b><a name="06071884000324"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, we
have to have uniform duties throughout the UK. I think that that is the
right approach. Once we start having a regional basis for duties for
fuel oil, what else will follow from that? On dealing with fraud, I
have outlined the figures and the action that the Government have taken
that is improving the
situation.</p><p><a name="06071884000040"></a><b><a name="06071884000325"></a>Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean:</b> My Lords, is this not a
general problem caused by the fact that the Irish Government have been
reducing the overall burden of tax, resulting in increased revenues and
growth in its economy, while this Government have increased the burden
of tax? The problem is not only that fuel suppliers are closing on the
border; we now see inward investment going into Ireland rather than
coming here because of the burden of tax that has been imposed by the
current Government.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1121"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000041"></a><b><a name="06071884000326"></a>Lord

other countries in Europe and worldwide, the UK stands strong. In 2005,

Forsyth, said, it is a tremendous disadvantage to Northern Ireland if
that is not considered by the Government in the light of taxation and
other fiscal arrangements in the south. Is there any expectation that
the Government will look at the problem, particularly in relation to
the level of corporation
tax?</p><p><a name="06071884000043"></a><b><a name="06071884000328"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, huge problems would
be associated with having a separate corporation tax regime for
Northern Ireland, such as how to compute the profits that fell within
Northern Ireland for companies that operated generally in the UK.
Tremendous problems would be associated with that and other levies that
might be pursued on the same basis. It would not be the right way
forward.</p><p><a name="06071884000044"></a><b><a name="06071884000329"></a>Lord
Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, I live within 15 miles of
the Irish border, and I can assure the House that all petrol stations
are open there. Is the Minister aware that most people in Northern
Ireland are suspicious of those who campaign for uniform taxation
systems in the island of Ireland and suspect that there is another
agenda? Will he confirm that, if we reduced either fuel tax or
corporation tax in Northern Ireland, the central Exchequer would have
less income from Northern Ireland and would logically then transfer
less to the devolved administration for public expenditure on schools,
housing and
infrastructure?</p><p><a name="06071884000045"></a><b><a name="06071884000330"></a>Lord

reduced fuel duty rates for Northern Ireland and reduced corporation
tax are not on the Government's agenda, so we do not need to address
that issue. Starting to look at those things on a regional basis would
genuinely raise the issues that the noble Lord has identified. However,
it is not on the Government's
agenda.</p><p><a name="06071884000046"></a><b><a name="06071884000331"></a>Viscount

ludicrous and an insult to the industry. Seemingly, there is not even a

said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to
AmendmentsNos. 59, 60, 61, 121A, 125A, 125B, 125BA, 125C, 125D
and 182. This set of 10 amendments aims, on the one hand, to probe the
process of competition for the setting up of trust schools, asking in
particular what kinds of bodies the Government are looking for as
sponsors for such schools and, on the other, to put forward the notion
of the community-sponsored trust&#151;or, as we have called it, the
&#147;community foundation&#148;&#151;as an alternative to a
private sector sponsor. Finally, Amendment No. 182 probes the whole
question of the schools
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06071884000081"></a>The first set of
amendments deals with the process of competition. Amendment No. 58 asks
that the time period specified for preparation and submission of
proposals in any competition should be reasonable. When a similar
amendment was proposed in the Commons, the Government made it clear
that they were sympathetic to the need to have balance between speedy
competition and adequate time to prepare the proposal but did not think
that the addition of the word &#147;reasonable&#148; was needed. We
are concerned that inadequate time will favour the corporate
sponsors&#151;the Edisons of this world who will perhaps have a
ready-made proposal that they can pull off the shelf&#151;over, let
us say, a local parents&#146; group. I believe that the Government
are anxious that such groups should put forward proposals. If those
groups are to make such a proposal, they will need to find professional
help, and the money to pay for such help in putting their proposal
together. We feel that it is reasonable that &#147;reasonable&#148;
should be included on the face of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071884000082"></a>Amendments Nos. 59 and 61
seek to prove the kinds of qualifications the Government have in mind
for sponsors of trust schools. Perhaps we might put alongside
Amendments Nos. 59 and 61 Amendments 121A and 125A, which seek to
establish a register of institutions regarded as suitable to establish
such foundations. Similar amendments were tabled on Report in the
Commons. In response, the Secretary of State
said:</p><ul><a name="06071884000244"></a>&#147;Allowing
schools to choose a trust partner only from a register would fetter the
freedom of governing bodies to decide what is best for their schools,
in light of their individual circumstances. It would lead to additional
bureaucracy and delay, especially when schools were considering local,
community-based trusts that would not benefit from a centralised
process for formal approval&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
Commons, 23/05/06; col.
1358.]</ul><p><a name="06071884000083"></a>During
the Committee stage, the draft guidance on trust schools was circulated
to MPs serving on Standing Committee E. This guidance singled out as
unsuitable to become partners in running a trust school companies
involved in tobacco, alcohol, gambling and adult entertainment. It
stated that governing bodies should,</p><ul><a name="06071884000259"></a>&#147;ensure that
&#145;trust&#146; partners are not involved in activities that may
be considered inappropriate for young
people&#148;.</ul><a name="06071884000084"></a>However,
there is concern that any attempt to set out a list of inappropriate
organisations will not address widespread concerns about trusts because
of the organisations that the guidance fails to proscribe.For
example, nothing in the guidance would necessarily protect young people
from religious extremists,extreme political groups, pressure
groups or fast-food manufacturers.

is not exhaustive and that decision makers must have particular regard
to the strength of parental and other local opinion about the
appropriateness of trust partners&#146; activities. It goes on to
list positive examples of trust scenarios. These include a
top-performing school taking over a weaker school, universities or
colleges linking up with schools to improve the take-up of higher
education and groups of schools banding together to share computer or
financial management facilities. I suppose that that would extend to a
group of schools already federated. We are very happy with those
examples, but, significantly, there is no mention of faith groups or
private companies in that list of positive examples.</p><p><a name="06071884000086"></a>At Second Reading in the House of
Commons, the then Secretary of State, Ruth Kelly, sought to address
concerns regarding trusts. She
said:</p><ul><a name="06071884000245"></a>&#147;I can tell the
House that there will be very strong safeguards to prevent the
acquisition of inappropriate trusts. That is essential. As a result,
they will be regulated by the Charity Commission as well as by the
local authority. They will be funded by the local authority, which will
be able to object on educational grounds to any trust that it thinks
will damage children&#146;s educational standards. However, perhaps
the most important safeguard will be the common sense of the parents
and governing bodies. They will decide whether it is in a
school&#146;s interest to adopt a particular
trust&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/3/06; cols.

this first set that I have not so far dealt with&#151;Amendment No.
60. If common sense is to be the arbiter of who might be a suitable
partner, parents will be looking for a sponsor who will improve
provision in their area. Therefore, it is utterly reasonable to ask, as
Amendment No. 60 does, that those seeking to establish trust schools
should specify how they would improve provision in the area and
especially provision for the disadvantaged, since trust schools are to
be established particularly to ensure that the disadvantaged get a
reasonable share of the pie.</p><p><a name="06071884000089"></a>That first set of
amendments deals with the process of competition and, in particular,
selection of sponsored partners. The second set of amendments in this
group of 10 includes Amendments Nos. 125B to 125D. Their purpose is to
promote the Liberal Democrat alternative to the Government&#146;s
vision of the trust school. We would call it a &#147;community
trust&#148;, or, in the words of the Bill, a &#147;community
foundation&#148;. We have throughout argued in favour of viewing
education from a community perspective. In this series of amendments,
we propose a foundation run by a local authority or a grouping of local
authorities. For example, a grouping of local district councils and the
county council might form what we have called the community
foundation.</p><p><a name="06071884000090"></a>Amendment
No. 125B specifies that the foundation will consist of one-third
elected local authority members, 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one-third parents and one-third other community representatives. I am
afraid that the gremlins got into the drafting of the amendment, which
is incorrect on the Marshalled List. However, a new version of it has
been circulated. Amendment No. 125C seeks to provide that such a
community foundation would embrace all the schools in a given area, and
would require that they all collaborated and worked together. Amendment
No. 125D is consequential to those two
amendments.</p><p><a name="06071884000091"></a>It
is notable that, in their evidence for Second Reading, both the General
Teaching Council and the Association of School and College Leaders
strongly endorsed the idea of encouraging schools to collaborate
according to the concept of the local federation. The Government have
been promoting such federations of schools at a local level, and the
amendments seek to capture some of that enthusiasm and to translate it
into what we believe to be acceptable&#151;a local and locally
accountable community foundation. I make no bones about the fact that
we are not enthusiastic about foundations run as national chains of
schools, whether they are run by Edison, Chris Woodhead or the United
Learning Trust. We are not enthused by a model that separates out local
schools and sets school against school and parent against parent, which
we feel will happen under the Government&#146;s proposals, as I made
quite clear in our discussions on earlier amendments. I repeat that we
are anxious to see local schools working together for the good of their
local
community.</p><p><a name="06071884000092"></a>Finally,
Amendment No. 182 is designed to probe the role of the schools
commissioner. Is he there just to supervise the work of the local
choice advisers? Is he there to encourage the growth of new trust
schools nationally? Is he there to ensure that the right people are
setting up trust schools? We suggest that this is where he might
perform quite a useful role if we really are to have another level of
highly paid official to ensure that the Government&#146;s agenda is
working properly. I believe that the post has already been advertised,
so the Government are already moving to appoint a schools commissioner.
It would be a great responsibility for schools to have to vet anyone
who comes before them with proposals to turn the school into a trust
school. Small schools in particular often do not have the resources to
probe the background of such people, so the Secretary of State may well
delegate the task of vetting those people to the schools
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06071884000093"></a>By publishing an open
register, as the amendment proposes, we would avoid the need to have to
use the freedom of information legislation, as now, to find out who has
applied to form a trust. An open register would give parents and
schools confidence in a system that is very new and highly suspect, in
the view of many of our fellow citizens. It is therefore in the
Government&#146;s interests to go along with this idea. Although
local authorities should be able to decide what sorts of people are
acceptable locally, there should be some sort of national standard of
what is acceptable, otherwise undesirable people might simply go from
one area to another until they find one that is not so choosy. The
standards should be much more detailed than simply ruling out
pornographers and tobacco manufacturers.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1129"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000094"></a>The Government might say&#151;indeed,
they do say&#151;that the Charity Commission will vet potential
trustees, but the Charity Commission cannot do so for two reasons.
First, it does not have the capacity to deal with the expected volume.
Secondly, it would need to change and extend the checks that it already
carries out on charity trustees in order to make them fit for purpose
for this educational task. It is much better for the Secretary of State
to delegate this task to the new commissioner. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071884000095"></a><b><a name="06071884000359"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> I strongly support my noble
friend&#146;s arguments in favour of this group of proposals. Let us
be very direct: if we believe that the Bill gives parents new powers,
new strengths and a new influence, it is vital that those parents are
properly informed about the decisions in which they will participate.
My noble friend has pointed out that parents will not know exactly who
is proposing to be part of trust schools or to start academies, or what
their qualifications and standards are. It would be simply foolish in
the light of a good deal of information that has emerged in the past
few months to pretend that we are certain that all those people who put
their names forward will be likely to contribute substantially to the
standard, the quality and, if I may say so, the moral integrity of our
education system.</p><p><a name="06071884000237"></a>There are
already some worrying examples. For instance, although Mr Bernie
Ecclestone was not successful in his bid, we know now as a result of
the Freedom of Information Act that he put in for running one of the
academies in Sheffield. I am not in a position&#151;nor would I
wish&#151;to make personal remarks about Mr Bernie Ecclestone, but he
would not immediately leap to mind as an ideal figure for sponsoring a
new school. In the case of the academy recently started in
Peterborough, to take another example, we know that all three of the
governing bodies of the schools to be replaced protested that there was
no reason to believe that the sponsor had any particular interest in
education. Other examples spring to mind. One of the most troubling is
the possibility that arms manufacturers might be involved in starting
up a trust school in the south-west of England. Arms manufacturers may
well have a legitimate role, but again they do not leap to mind as an
ideal model to be in charge of sponsoring a major new school. Perhaps
one would want someone with a rather wider view of the needs of our
globalising world.</p><h5><a name="06071884000290"></a>3.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06071884000238"></a>For such reasons,
it seems to me that we should support the concept that my noble friend
has put forward: a register giving the names and qualifications of
those seeking to become trustees or sponsors of trust schools, which
should be made available to those who are most interested and
concerned&#151;either the parents of children who may go to that
school or the parents of children registered with schools that are
being replaced by the potential trust school or academy.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1130"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000096"></a>I register with pleasure the
Government&#146;s intention in the Bill to make parents play a much
larger part in the education of their children, but there are two huge
weaknesses in the Bill. The first is the absence of adequate
information for those parents to make up their minds and the
second&#151;which we will come to later and to which I will make no
further reference at the moment&#151;is the absence of a proper
system of balloting so that we know exactly the wishes and preferences
of parents. The principle is fine, but the devil is in the details. So
far I for one am not satisfied that the details bear out the
Government&#146;s stated wishes for the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071884000097"></a>There are two other things
worth adding. One is the point made by my noble friend about the
ability to check up on the sponsors of schools at a later stage. Not
only do we know that the Charity Commission does not have the capacity
to do that, but the truth is that it does not do it. The recent answers
that were given on the assessment of academies indicated that the
Charity Commission does not regard this as a central part of its
duties&#151;indeed, it would not be expected to do so, given its
functions.</p><p><a name="06071884000098"></a>The question again
emerges: who is responsible? Who guards the guardians? The answer may
lie with the schools commissioner or with the local authority, but it
is not at all clear where the responsibility lies. My noble friend has
pointed to a real hole or gap in the Bill. She is endeavouring to fill
it in a way that the Government, if they want the best possible
outcomes from sponsored schools, should respond to favourably. Frankly,
I do not think that the answers given in another place to the arguments
put forward on this front for one moment hold sufficient water. Ruth
Kelly, when she was Secretary of State, referred to the &#147;common
sense&#148; of parents. I agree with her about the common sense of
parents, but parents who are uninformed and not given the information
that they need to reach proper opinions and make proper decisions
cannot be blamed if they get it wrong. It is the responsibility of the
Government in the Bill to make sure that as far as possible parents are
given the information to enable them to get it
right.</p><p><a name="06071884000099"></a><b><a name="06071884000360"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> I should like to speak to some of these
amendments and explain why we will not be supporting them. I refer in
particular to Amendments Nos. 121A, 125A and 182. So far as we can
understand, Amendment No. 121A would mean that trusts for trust schools
would have to be centrally registered. I do not see the purpose of this
since the governing body already has to have regard to guidance on the
acquisition of trusts which makes it clear that unsuitable trusts may
not run schools. Under the Bill the foundations already have to be
charitable. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, evidently believes that
registered charity status, together with the additional restriction on
persons who may act as charity trustees for a foundation, is
insufficient to ensure that trusts are suitable. I also doubt that any
school would truly opt to acquire a trust that was actually as
unsuitable as she and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, have
suggested.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000100"></a>Amendment No. 182 goes further and
underlines the opposition of the Liberal Democrats for the concept of a
school driven by parents. While it would prevent non-approved
foundations proposing new schools without first registering with the
Schools commissioner, it would also apply to groups of parents or any
other private promoter. Furthermore, it would require local authorities
to seek approval from the Schools commissioner if they wish to
establish new schools, which I am not sure is the intention here. This
would mean an awful lot more bureaucracy with unintended consequences.
Indeed, it is interesting to note that while the Liberal Democrats have
spent so much time both here and in another place criticising the
Government and the Opposition for imposing central control from
Whitehall, here they propose an unnecessary central layer of
bureaucracy from
Whitehall.</p><p><a name="06071884000101"></a>Turning to a
redefinition of the word &#147;foundation&#148;, set out in
Amendments Nos. 125B to 125D, we see that Amendment No. 125B redefines
foundations where a local authority is represented on the foundation.
It would mean that
a,</p><ul><a name="06071884000260"></a>&#147;majority, but no
more than 33 per cent., of its members shall be
members&#148;,</ul><a name="06071884000239"></a>of
the local education authority. However, it should be noted that members
of local education authorities are currently prohibited from acting as
charity trustees under the draft education regulations 2006 covering
the requirements as to foundations. I am not sure what a
&#147;majority, but no more than 33 per cent.,&#148; means. Perhaps
the noble Baroness meant plurality, although perhaps not since it also
specifies that a second 33 per cent would be represented by parents.
The remaining third would be represented by the community. I am not
sure of the purpose behind this amendment. However, it would prevent a
number of possibilities, including the possibility of a local authority
entering into partnership with a philanthropic organisation such as an
educational charity or livery company for the purpose of running a
school, which would be a great shame&#151;in fact, it would be a
disaster.<p><a name="06071884000102"></a>I
hope that Amendment No. 125C is unnecessary since I imagine that trusts
could already act in the way envisaged in the amendment. Amendment No.
125D would remove new Section 23(b) of the Schools Standards and
Framework Act, which will allow the Secretary of State to remove
charity trustees. This was raised in another place, at the end of which
Sarah Teather MP said that the then Minister had addressed most of her
concerns. At the time the Minister made it clear that the removal of a
charity trustee was a fallback position to be used in exceptional
circumstances and gave compelling reasons for having such a power,
particularly that it is impossible to set out in regulations all
possible future circumstances. Paragraph 7 of the draft regulations
shows that the power can be used only where the Secretary of State is
satisfied that the person has acted in any way incompatible with the
objectives or purposes of the foundation or the person is likely to
bring into disrepute any school to which the foundation appoints
governors. I believe that when we are dealing with children in
education, it is vitally important to protect them from unsuitable

the criteria listed in
regulations.</p><p><a name="06071884000103"></a>Perhaps
I may add a point on the absence of information for parents to act on
when choosing a school. We look forward to seeing the amendments
proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, who I know is keen on
having some form of information pack. Indeed, he goes further than that
by suggesting information centres to give parents the opportunity to
gather information easily on the different schools and choices
available to them within their
area.</p><p><a name="06071884000104"></a><b><a name="06071884000361"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> Amendment No. 58 seeks to ensure that the
time for promoters for submit proposals should be reasonable. We agree,
but I am glad to say that in fact the regulations concerning this
provision, which I have now circulated, lay down that the period must
be at least four months. As those regulations will be in place, that
will be an absolute requirement. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady
Sharp, and other noble Lords will agree that four months is a
reasonable period, including for community groups that may take longer
to put proposals together.</p><p><a name="06071884000105"></a>On
Amendments Nos. 59, 61, 121A, 125A and 182, we agree that there need to
be appropriate safeguards against unsuitable partners being involved in
the running of schools. That is why we have a proper process in place
for governing bodies to publish proposals in respect of trusts and to
take decisions in relation to them. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, recognised, substantial guidance is being made available to
schools on this, which I think meets the points raised by the noble
Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Williams. I have circulated the draft
guidance to the Committee. I quote from page 128 of
it:</p><ul><a name="06071884000246"></a>&#147;In determining the
suitability and appropriateness of a particular Trust, a governing body
should
therefore:</ul><ul><a name="06071884000247"></a>&#147;Consider
whether and how the acquisition of the particular Trust will support
the school in raising standards, improving the quality of teaching and
learning and improving delivery of the five &#145;Every Child
Matters&#146; outcomes for all
children;</ul><ul><a name="06071884000248"></a>&#147;Consider how
the Trust fits with the school&#146;s character and ethos and how it
will develop the culture of the school
further;</ul><ul><a name="06071884000249"></a>&#147;Consider what
perspectives, experience and skills the Trust will bring to support the
school&#146;s
mission;</ul><ul><a name="06071884000250"></a>&#147;Consider the
potential impact of the partnership on other schools in the locality
and on any other organisations or bodies likely to be
affected;</ul><ul><a name="06071884000251"></a>&#147;Take into
account the local authority&#146;s and parents&#146; view of the
potential Trust and the nature of the partnership with the
school;</ul><ul><a name="06071884000252"></a>&#147;Take into
account the Trust&#146;s previous track record of involvement in
schools and education more generally, as well as the experience and
expertise of the proposed
Trustees;</ul><ul><a name="06071884000253"></a>&#147;Consider
whether particular Trusts should be considered unsuitable on the
grounds of inappropriateness&#151;for example, ensure that Trust
partners are not involved in activities that may be considered
inappropriate for children and young people (for example, tobacco,
gambling, adult entertainment, alcohol etc.)&#148;.
</ul><a name="06071884000240"></a>I believe that that meets
the points raised in that regard.

parents <I>per se</I> are not given an opportunity to contribute to

and why is it a matter only for the governing body to determine how far
their views are taken into
account?</p><p><a name="06071884000108"></a><b><a name="06071884000363"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> The governing body will need to take into
account the views of parents. We shall debate later the noble
Baroness&#146;s precise amendments on ballots of parents. I do not
want to rehearse all the arguments, but this is the standard procedure
for schools taking decisions of the utmost gravity affecting them in
many other areas, including a whole range of other characteristics
concerning the future of the school. We do not believe that, in
qualitative terms, this is any
different.</p><p><a name="06071884000109"></a>However, over and
above the requirements on the school governing body both in terms of
how it makes the decision and the factors that it must take into
account, we have given a power to local authorities to refer proposals
to the adjudicator when they are concerned about the implications for a
particular trust of standards at a school. The adjudicator will then
make a professional and impartial judgment, which, of course, will
override that of the governing body in the event of that judgment being
different. We do not think it necessary to regulate further than that.
In particular, we believe that the creation of a national register
would act as a barrier to innovation and fetter the freedom of
governing bodies to decide what is best for their own schools, subject
to oversight by the adjudicator.</p><p><a name="06071884000110"></a>In so far as the
register proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, is intended to be
illustrative and informative to encourage the development of
appropriate trusts, this function will indeed be performed by the
national schools commissioner, who will keep a record of all trusts
established and make it available on his website. Therefore, there will
be no need TO use the FoI Act, as the noble Baroness
feared.</p><p><a name="06071884000111"></a>With
regard to the kinds of trusts that may come forward, we expect that
they will include higher and further education institutions, existing
successful schools and bona fide education and business foundations. A
particular concern of the noble Baroness is whether they can include
community trusts. If she means trusts that have local authority
engagement within the provisions of the Bill as it stands, they
absolutely can. We will give strong encouragement to local authorities
to be engaged in trusts alongside other local community groups and
organisations which can make a substantial contribution to improving
schools.</p><h5><a name="06071884000291"></a>3.45

No. 60 would require a notice published by a local authority inviting
bids in a competition to specify in what ways proposals would improve
education in the area, especially those from disadvantaged homes. I
believe we have covered that. The illustrative regulations 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1134"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I made available to the committee require the notice setting out
the invitation to partners to come forward to provide a new school; to
explain why the new school is considered necessary; the reason for the
choice of sites; the size and age range of the school; and any extended
or special needs provision. The notice can also specify other matters,
including objectives specifically in respect of disadvantaged pupils or
communities. Furthermore, local authorities will judge the competition
unless they choose to enter their own proposals, in which case it will
be the adjudicator. That will enable local authorities to ensure that
the successful proposal meets the needs of the disadvantaged and
demonstrates the right
characteristics.</p><p><a name="06071884000113"></a>Amendments Nos.
125BA and 125C seek to enhance the influence of the local authority
over trusts and trust schools. As I say, we support the concept of a
community trust. If that means a trust as set out under the provisions
of the Bill, of course it can proceed. The 20 per cent level for local
authority engagement in trusts, as set out in the Bill, gives local
authorities the flexibility to play a valuable role in brokering those
relationships and supporting the formation of trusts in their
communities. The 20 per cent figure is also consistent with provisions
in local government legislation about local authority involvement in
companies and trusts more widely.</p><p><a name="06071884000114"></a>However, we do not believe that it is
right to increase that proportion beyond 20 per cent, which will get
close to making local authorities the dominant force in a trust. If a
local authority wishes to have that level of control over a trust, it
anyway has the option of promoting a community school and exercising
this control directly, provided that its track record is good enough.
When taken in the round, our policy on trusts is balanced, proportional
and workable. Our policy on collaboration is enabling and not
prescriptive. I hope that I have met the concerns that have been
raised.</p><p><a name="06071884000115"></a><b><a name="06071884000364"></a>Baroness
Sharp of Guildford:</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for his response. I should like to clear up one or two misconceptions
on the part of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, before replying to
some of the points that he has made. I should make absolutely clear
that we are not opposed to trusts being established by groups of
parents. Essentially, we would very much like to see that. The concept
of the local community trust is the local authority and local groups of
parents getting together to promote a local community of schools. I am
sorry that the noble Baroness did not read Amendment No. 182 to mean
this, but that is what we meant.</p><p><a name="06071884000116"></a>I also think that the
noble Baroness misread another amendment. The clean version which has
been circulated in manuscript today makes it quite clear that we are
looking at members of local authorities. We are specifically looking to
a situation where it might be the district council, which is not an
education authority, participating in the local community trust. We
feel that this is a question of trying to get local community and
democratic representation within the concept of the trust. So far as
the trust is concerned, schools will be spending a considerable
proportion of money. It is appropriate

system. A situation such as one has with academies where the only
accountability is with the Secretary of State is not one that we feel
to be thoroughly
satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="06071884000117"></a>In relation to the
other set of amendments, we accept, as the Minister says, that four
months is reasonable. As I have suggested, in so far as it would be a
group of parents proposing to do this, it would take time to get
together, particularly if proposals have to be put forward in full
legalistic form. It takes time to find the appropriate legal expertise
and to raise the money to pay for the expertise that one has to lay on
in the circumstances. The Minister made it clear that it is up to the
school governing body to be discriminatory among those who might be
suggesting themselves as sponsors of trusts, particularly if it is a
small primary school, However, it is also important to remember that it
is not always easy for such a governing body to be particularly
knowledgeable and in this sense I am pleased to hear that as far as he
is concerned they will have the help of the schools commissioner in
being able to discriminate between what one might term good and bad
sponsors. The framework of regulations as he says lays that down but
nevertheless they have to be interpreted and implemented by the
governing body and it is not always easy for a governing body to be
able to discriminate in this way. It could be useful to have a register
in such circumstances.</p><p><a name="06071884000118"></a>I am
delighted that the Minister is as positive ashe is about the
concept of community trusts or foundations. From these Benches this is
very much our vision of the way in which we would like to see the
provisions working. We have made it clear that we are not enamoured of
the private sector sponsors and would prefer to see such foundations
emerging from the local community, but with the reassurances that he
has given us I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="06071884000119"></a>Amendment, by leave,

noble Baroness said: The heart of this group of amendments concerns
ballots and their consequences and the expression of parental opinion
in a clear majority with regard to the establishment of new schools and
the laying down of proposals for the establishment of new maintained
schools. The essence of the Government&#146;s view of the Bill as I
mentioned a moment or two ago is that the role of parents should be
given the fullest possible width and that parents should be involved in
the maintenance and establishment of schools to the limit that is
possible within a system.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1136"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000123"></a>The earlier group of amendments that we
discussed was intended to give the maximum possible information about
future sponsors of schools to parents. This group of amendments
concerns the right of parents to make their views known about the
establishment of a new community school or a new community special
school in certain circumstances where it is clear according to
regulation that parents have established that they have a majority wish
to go ahead with the establishment of a new community school that
should override any attempt to limit that, for example, by requiring
the Secretary of State&#146;s consent.</p><p><a name="06071884000124"></a>To put it simply, either the Government
believe that parents should have the decisive voice in the
establishment of one type of school or another, or they do not. We have
therefore indicated in this group of amendments the circumstances in
which parental opinion should be decisive. One of those is with regard
to an attempt put forward by a local authority to establish a new
community school where it is clear after consultation with parents that
the majority of parents wished that to happen. We do not believe it is
right that there should be additional sets of bureaucratic requirements
that would override that wish of parents.</p><p><a name="06071884000125"></a>We have also indicated
that where a local authority puts forward proposals for a new community
school, those proposals should be published if again it is the wish of
the parents of children registered at school or registered at feeder
schools that the proposals should be considered and should go ahead.
Some years ago, parents were largely excluded from the education
process. That changed rather dramatically in 1976 with the Taylor
commission, which was the responsibility of the noble Lord, Lord
Taylor, who is I am delighted to say a Member of this House. The
commission proposed that one-quarter of the governors of the governing
bodies of maintained schools should be elected by parents and should
represent
them.</p><p><a name="06071884000126"></a>One
concern that we have about this Bill is that with trust schools and
academies the role of parents is decisively reduced. We find that hard
to associate with a Bill that is intended to give parents a larger not
a smaller voice. Therefore, to put it straightforwardly, on the crucial
issue of changes in category of schools and on the proposals for
establishing new maintained schools, and for putting forward those
ideas, we believe that a ballot should be held. The ballot should turn
on a majority of parents having their voices heard and their opinions
made known, which should be a decisive factor in deciding whether to
establish a new school of a maintained community nature or, for that
matter, in putting forward such
proposals.</p><p><a name="06071884000127"></a>I
remind the House what the former Minister, Ruth Kelly, said in another
place, when she referred to the common sense of parents. My noble
friend quoted her remarks. But if we do not know what parents want,
referring to their common sense does not add up to very much. I pay
tribute in that respect to the previous Conservative Government, who
insisted that there should be a ballot before a school became a
grant-maintained school. Some 2,000 ballots were duly held, after the
establishment of the idea of grant-maintained 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1137"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools, on which the Government made it plain at the time that parents
would be given the opportunity to express their views. One-third, or
about 800 of those 2,000 ballots, went against the proposal for the
grant-maintained school, and that was respected by the Government, who
did not go ahead with imposing grant-maintained status on schools whose
parents did not wish it. In two-thirds of the cases&#151;that is,
some 12,000 ballots&#151;the parents agreed to the establishment of
grant-maintained schools, which duly went ahead. We on these Benches
would profoundly regret a reduction in the influence and voice of
parents, and we cannot believe that that is what the Government intend,
as it is not what they have
said.</p><p><a name="06071884000128"></a>So what is the argument
against ballots, in straightforward terms? The strangest one that I
have heard so far, which was put forward in another place, was that
ballots would in some way restrict the likelihood of foundation schools
being allowed to go ahead and restrict the innovatory prospects for
academies and CTCs, so that it would not be wise to give parents this
major part in the system. One thing that has emerged clearly from
discussions on the Bill, from beginning to end, in discussing children
with special educational needs and those who are disadvantaged and
whose parents do not take a full part in concern for their education,
is that it is absolutely crucial to a good education that parents are
involved from the beginning to the end. It is crucial that their
association with their child&#146;s future and school and with their
own responsibilities in that respect should be considered as a primary
purpose of legislation.</p><p><a name="06071884000129"></a>Sadly,
we live at a time when there is not a great deal of trust in the
political system and when more and more people argue that they are not
consulted and listened to and that their views are not taken fully into
account. There is a simple mechanism for taking those views fully into
account&#151;a mechanism that has been tried and tested over many
decades in this country and which, above all, should apply to schools.
It has been much welcomed by parents, who have enthusiastically taken
part in ballots of this kind. Indeed, the grant-maintained school
ballots attracted turn-outs of 67 per cent and more on average, far
above the level of turnout that one associates with local government
and roughly level with what one associates with general elections.
There is no evidence whatever that parents are apathetic about this
kind of question; indeed, they feel very deeply
involved.</p><p><a name="06071884000130"></a>Not to prolong the
discussion&#151;although I believe it to be absolutely central to the
whole nature and quality of this Bill&#151;we must ask whether we
believe that parents should be fully involved. If so, why do we not
trust them to make that decision on the basis of a properly organised
ballot on the crucial issues of changing a school from one category to
another and of whether a school should continue when there is a
proposal to discontinue it? Surely, we should listen to the parents
and, when they are of suitable age, the pupils. I beg to move the
amendment, and I do so with very strong feeling about how much is at
stake.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06071884000292"></a>4

Gould of Brookwood:</b> I am
strongly in favour of empowering parents; I am in favour of empowering
everyone. That is the basis of my politics and that is why I support
this Bill. I want parents to have the chance to choose the school that
is right for their children; not just a good local school, but the best
possible school for them. This Bill is about empowering parents and
about giving them choices, voices and access, as the noble Baroness
said, from the beginning until the end. That does not mean a compulsory
one-off ballot; it is not about that. It is about a continuing process
of engagement and participation through school choice, parental
councils, schools that respect and listen to the views of parents as
mandated by the Bill, real rights of redress and a real involvement
over time on a continuing basis. Some 72 per cent of parents want more
involvement in their schools, and the Bill enables that to
happen.</p><p><a name="06071884000132"></a>The question that we
have to ask is whether the amendment mandating balloting takes the
cause of empowerment forward or back. Compulsory ballots are a
cumbersome, time-consuming and rather intimidating procedure that is
intended to slow down the pace of reform and to make genuine parental
participation less likely rather than more. That is not to say that
ballots should not be held if the governing body wishes to hold them;
but it is to say that one-off, compulsory ballots do not help the cause
of greater parental empowerment but are likely to slow it down. One-off
compulsory ballots are not genuine participation; they are a device to
get in the way of genuine participation, and they should be
resisted.</p><p><a name="06071884000133"></a>The metaphor of
politics has been used. Just as it is true to say that a general
election every four to five years no longer represents participation
and no longer represents involvement, it is true to say that a
compulsory ballot, held possibly once in the life of a parent, does not
begin to offer the participation that we need. This Bill is about real
empowerment and real involvement over a period of time from the
beginning to the end, as the noble Baroness said, and the compulsory
balloting procedure is an attempt to get in the way of that, not to
assist
it.</p><p><a name="06071884000134"></a><b><a name="06071884000367"></a>Lord

noble Baroness unconvincing. I thought that the amendments were
confused, and I wanted to hear her explanation. I now am clear where
she starts from; as I understand it, she wants the views of parents to
predominate. That is her main consideration. I agree with that, but I
do not think that this is the way to do it.</p><p><a name="06071884000135"></a>The Government clearly expect from this
Bill something corresponding to the Scandinavian pattern where, as a
result of allowing communities to come together, there will be a
welling-up of the parental opinion saying that they want a new school.
They will put forward their proposals, and the parents will be very
committed. I do not think that there will be an absence of parental
commitment to fulfilling the objectives of the Bill, and I support
that.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000136"></a>Let us suppose the
parents in a town such as south Bolton came together and said that they
wanted a new school. Who should vote in that ballot? All the parents in
south Bolton? All the parents of primary school children in south
Bolton? All the parents of secondary school children in south Bolton?
It is a totally impractical suggestion when you are considering a new
school. You could not devise the electoral list on which a ballot could
take place.</p><p><a name="06071884000137"></a>But what of a ballot in
a school which already exists? This was the problem with which I was
faced when I introduced grant-maintained schools. Back in 1988, if I
had left it purely in the power of the governing body to create a
grant-maintained school, I could not have got the Bill through. I could
not have got it passed either by the House of Commons or the House of
Lords. Many Conservative local education authorities would have burnt
my effigy and said that it was absolutely unforgivable. So I introduced
the complicated arrangements of ballots, and I did so to break the
mould. I agree with the noble Lord who has just spoken. If they were
introduced now, they would be used as a delaying device by the local
education authorities, because in nearly all those
grant-maintained-school ballots, pitched against the wishes of parents
was the local education authority, which would spend vast sums of
public money on publicity in an effort to prevent schools becoming
grant maintained. Many local education authorities will not embrace the
idea of new community schools being established. They like to maintain
their hegemony and their monopoly. I do not believe that their
attitudes have changed at
all.</p><p><a name="06071884000138"></a>Therefore, the proposals of
the Liberal Democrats in this matter are not at all feasible as regards
new schools and are unnecessary as regards established schools. They
would have a delaying effect. As I have said, I did what I did to break
the mould. The mould is broken. Parents are now much more involved in
the running of schools than they were back in the 1980s. They are very
committed, not only in the leafy suburbs but also in the inner cities.
The amendments are unnecessary and would be harmful to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071884000139"></a><b><a name="06071884000368"></a>Baroness

Lord, Lord Gould, talked about one-off compulsory ballots as if they
were the only way in which we on these Benches wanted to have parents
involved in schools. Of course, that is not the case. There is no
reason why a one-off compulsory ballot should preclude all the other,
very desirable ways in which good schools should involve parents. It is
like saying that you can have four or five years of focus groups, but
that you cannot have a general election at the end of it. Does the
noble Lord assume that the results of the ballots will get in the way
of the expansion of trust schools? In objecting to the amendment of my

sure when we consult parents that we consult all parents and not merely
those who are accustomed to public speaking and those who have a voice;
we must listen also to those who are deprived and
disadvantaged.</p><p><a name="06071884000141"></a><b><a name="06071884000370"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> The amendments would amend the process by
which schools are established and, in some cases, interpose another
statutory layer, the parental ballot, into the local decision-making
process.</p><p><a name="06071884000142"></a>Parental
ballots were the subject of long debates and, indeed, a ballot in the
elected House of Commons, which voted by a huge majority of
291&#151;that is, 412 votes against 121&#151;against proposals
similar to these. The Governments arguments against these proposals
have not changed: first, a ballot may be an appropriate form of
consultation in some circumstances&#151;I am strongly in favour of
local ballots in appropriate cases, including local referendums
conducted by local authorities&#151;but both governing bodies and
local authorities have powers to conduct such ballots at present. It
would be disproportionate to require ballots for a change to trust
status to take place. Secondly,if ballots are to be mandatory,
as the noble Lord, Lord Baker, said, the precise electorate for the
ballots would need to be set out either in primary or secondary
legislation. It would be highly problematic to do so and it is not
attempted in any of the amendments before
us.</p><p><a name="06071884000143"></a>Thirdly,
it is fairly obvious from the debate so far that the essential
motivation behind these amendments is one of antipathy to trusts and
trust schools. This is shown by the fact that there is a whole range of
other equally&#151;if not more&#151;fundamental decisions affecting
the character of schools and local educational provision, in respect of
which no amendments requiring ballots have been tabled. For example,
there are school closures&#151;including the closure of special
schools, the single most emotive issue for parents that crosses my desk
as a Minister&#151;changes to admissions arrangements, the addition
or subtraction of 6th forms&#151;another highly emotive issue for
parents&#151;the addition or subtraction of special needs provision,
the change to specialist status, the choice of specialism, the
relocation of a school and the move in a locality from a three-tier to
a two-tier system.</p><p><a name="06071884000144"></a>All those are hugely
difficult and often controversial issues of educational policy for
individual schools and local provision, and there are no amendments
down to ensure that these are subject to ballots. Nor do I recall the
Liberal Democrat amendments to the Children Bill which would have
required ballots on the setting up of children's centres, or the
judging between, for example, proposals put forward by existing state
schools as against those put forward by private and voluntary sector
providers.</p><p><a name="06071884000145"></a>Fourthly,
there are, however, substantial requirements as to consultation in all
the changes of school status and organisations set out in the Bill, and
on proposals 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>put forward by local authorities. These are in accord with established
consultation procedures for the other kinds of change of status and
provision I have just mentioned. They are satisfactory. Furthermore, in
the case of a school wishing to acquire a trust, there is a further
specific power in the Bill for local authorities to refer such plans to
the adjudicator when the local authority believes there has been
inadequate consultation, including with parents. These amendments are
neither necessary nor desirable. That concludes our
case.</p><p><a name="06071884000146"></a><b><a name="06071884000371"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> Briefly, I
will not push these amendments at present, but I shall make a couple of
points. First, we have specifically called for a ballot on the
discontinuance of a school, one of the areas the Minister referred to.
We have indicated that, where a school is to be discontinued, there
should be a ballot of parents because they are profoundly affected by
it. We proposed, in a new clause, that there should be a meeting of
parents before any final decision is made. That goes some way to refute
the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Gould of Brockwood, who suggested
that we were only pressing for a single ballot once there was to be a
change in the nature of a school, or the advancement of a new school.
That is not the case: we specifically called for a parental
meeting.</p><p><a name="06071884000147"></a>The
Government are using the argument that this will delay everything in an
extraordinary way. Surely what matters most, as has been central to our
discussion of this education Bill, is that there should be the highest
possible quality of schooling and that children should be secure in a
well organised, accountable and responsible school. That is what
concerns us. As we have often argued from these Benches, there should
be a level playing field. Parents should have a strong voice in the
choices to be made. Whatever our views may be on a particular trust
school one way or the other, our crucial responsibility is to ensure
that parents are given the choice of the kind of education they want
for their child. Frankly, without a ballot or a requirement for a
parents&#146; meeting, it is difficult to see why governing bodies
should think they know what parents&#146; wishes might be better than
the parents themselves. However, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw
the amendment.</p><p><a name="06071884000148"></a>Amendment, by
leave, withdrawn.</p><p><a name="06071884000149"></a><b><a name="06071884000372"></a>Baroness

Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made in
another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. The
Statement is as
follows:</p>&#147;With
permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a Statement about the G8 Summit
which took place on 15 to 17 July in St Petersburg. I pay tribute to
President Putin's chairmanship and the Russian 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1142"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government's handling of the summit. The whole of the summit was
understandably overshadowed by the tragic and terrible events in
Israel, Palestine and Lebanon. For days, we have seen the innocent
killed by terrorism, as a deliberate act, by Hezbollah; civilians
killed in the course of military retaliation by Israel; and the
disintegration of our hopes for stability in this, the most fraught
area of dispute in the
world.&#147;Over 1,600
rockets and mortars have fallen on northern Israel, in an arc from
Haifa to Tiberias, deliberately targeting civilians. In Lebanon, more
than 230 people have been killed, the vast majority of them civilians.
Houses, roads, essential infrastructure, factories and Lebanese Army
facilities have been damaged. Once again, we have made it clear to
Israel that it is essential to take account of the humanitarian
situation, and ensure that military action is proportionate. We grieve
for the innocent Israelis and innocent Lebanese civilians who are dead,
for their families who mourn and for their countries that are caught up
in the spiral of escalating confrontation.
&#147;There are also more than 10,000
British nationals in Lebanon, and probably many more, including a
significant number of dual Lebanese British nationals. I know that
people who are there, and their families in the UK and elsewhere, are
worried about the situation. We are working as hard and as quickly as
we can to ensure that we are able to evacuate all those who wish to
leave. We evacuated 63 of the most vulnerable British nationals from
Beirut by air yesterday, but the safest way to evacuate large numbers
of civilians is by sea. This is a complex and enormous logistical
operation, which we are co-ordinating with our EU and international
partners.
&#147;Teams of
consular, military and medical officials have deployed to Beirut,
Cyprus and Damascus. We have six ships in the region or heading for the
region: the &#147;York&#148; and the &#147;Gloucester&#148; are
now offshore, and the &#147;Illustrious&#148;,
&#147;Bulwark&#148;, &#147;St Aubens&#148; and &#147;RFA
Victoria Fort&#148; are heading there. The first evacuation by ship
is taking place today, and further evacuations will follow. The advice
to British nationals is to stay put and remain in contact with the
British
Embassy.&#147;However,
we should be in no doubt about the immediate cause for this situation.
It started with the kidnap of an Israeli soldier in Gaza and then
action by Israel, targeting Hamas on the Palestinian side. Then,
without provocation, Hezbollah crossed the blue line established by UN
resolutions, killed eight Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two more.
Israel then again retaliated in air strikes against targets in Beirut.
This situation therefore began with acts of extremism by militant
groups that were, as the G8 said unanimously, without any justification
and, of course, were designed to provoke the very response that
followed. &#147;In the
communiqu&#233; issued by the G8, we refer to and condemn the
activities of the extremist groups and, more elliptically, as we say,
&#147;those that support them&#148;. For most of us at the G8, we
can 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1143"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be less elliptical. Hezbollah is supported by Iran and Syria: by the
former in weapons&#151;weapons incidentally very similar if not
identical to those used against British troops in Basra&#151;by the
latter in many different ways and by both of them financially.
Therefore, what is at stake could not be more stark.
&#147;On the one
side, there is Lebanon, a remarkable democratic achievement from the
days when Lebanon was a by-word for instability and conflict. I have
once again given the Prime Minister my solidarity and support in the
immense difficulties he now faces. There are also those in Israel and
in Palestine desperate to see progress towards the only solution that
will ever work there; namely, two states, Israel and Palestine, both
democratic, both independent, both at peace. But on the other side are
those who want no compromise, who cannot see that terrorism is not the
route to a solution but a malign, fundamental obstacle to it. They
persist in terrorism, knowing that its impact there is the same the
world over: to divide, to create hatred and to drive out negotiation.
That is the purpose of it.
&#147;So what can be done? I know many
wanted the G8 to call for an immediate ceasefire on the part of Israel.
Of course, we all want all violence to stop and to stop immediately,
but we recognise that the only realistic way to achieve such a
ceasefire is to address the underlying reasons why this violence has
broken
out.&#147;In
respect of Lebanon, the G8 proposed rapid work on inserting an
international security presence in southern Lebanon to stabilise the
situation, ensure that the terrorism from the Lebanese side ends, and,
most important, to provide conditions in which the Lebanese armed
forces can take control and assist in doing so.
&#147;Meanwhile, the UN
Secretary-General's special envoys are in the region, and will report
to the Security Council later this week, and US Secretary of State Rice
also intends to make an early visit. We welcome and support these and
other efforts to calm the
situation.&#147;We also
encouraged dialogue between the Lebanese and Israeli Governments and we
pledged at the G8 further economic support to Lebanon. And of course we
demanded the return of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Only in this way
can we at last implement UN Security Council resolutions 1559 and
1680.&#147;In
Gaza, we made clear that our goal was an immediate end to the violence,
and we put forward the measures necessary: release of the Israeli
soldiers and of the Palestinian Ministers and parliamentarians; an end
to attacks on Israel; resumption of security co-operation between
Israel and Palestine; restarting political contacts between Israeli and
Palestinian officials; and an end to Israeli military operations and
the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But let us be very plain. We can and
must stabilise the existing situation in Lebanon and in Gaza. We must
use such stabilisation to help Lebanon rebuild and eventually to
re-begin negotiations between Israel 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Palestine. But at root, we need to recognise the fundamental nature
of the struggle in the region, which has such far-reaching consequences
far beyond that region and consequences even in countries like our
own. &#147;All over the
Middle East there are those who want to modernise their nations, who
believe as we do in democracy and liberty and tolerance. But ranged
against them are extremists who believe the opposite, who believe in
fundamentalist states and war not against Israel's actions but against
its existence. In virtually every country of the region, including on
the streets of Baghdad, such a struggle is being played out. The danger
is that moderate voices get squeezed. When this current vision abates,
this is the issue to which we must return, in the way the G8 outlined
two years ago but has not so far put fully into
effect.&#147;Let
me touch on issues that were raised elsewhere. On Africa, we made
modest, but important, progress in taking forward the commitments of
last year through the discussions on infectious diseases and education,
including: scaling up action on HIV/AIDS through replenishing the
Global Fund in 2006 and 2007; new initiatives on vaccines for malaria
and pneumoccocus and fully funding the education fast track initiative.
We agreed to review progress on Africa again at the G8 Summit in 2007
and I have asked the International Development Secretary to set out key
milestones for the coming 12 months in his next report to Parliament.
These will include us supporting 10 African countries, developing
long-term education plans and getting the debts cancelled for five more
African countries. Kofi Annan will also convene the Africa Progress
Panel to monitor progress on commitments
given.&#147;I also
discussed Sudan with a number of G8 leaders and Kofi Annan. We agreed
the situation in Darfur continues to be unacceptable and the need for a
quick deployment of the UN
force.&#147;On
trade, at the final session, it was at last agreed by all to empower
their negotiations to go further. The cost of failure for the world's
poor, global growth and multilateralism would be high. Presidents Bush,
Barroso, Lula, Mbeki, Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Singh of
India all agreed to show flexibility, so we asked Pascal Lamy to
immediately convene trade negotiators to turn this clear commitment
into action that delivers real cuts in agricultural tariffs, and
subsidies and progress on non-agricultural market access. I do not
minimise the very substantial obstacles that still remain, but at least
this renewed commitment from the US, the EU and the G20 was immensely
welcome.&#147;We also
agreed a strong package for poor countries, including $4 billion a year
aid for trade and action on rules of origin and we remain fully
committed to ensuring that, in any event for this round, it would be
utterly wrong for there not to be a full development package for the
poorest
nations.&#147;There
was a fascinating debate on energy at the summit, of direct relevance
to this country. There was a virtual consensus around the fact that
energy prices will continue to rise, with an increase now 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1145"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>predicted of around 50 per cent in energy demand by the year 2030; that
climate change is now universally accepted as happening, including by
the United States, and therefore there is an urgent necessity to take
the measures to make further economic growth sustainable; and that
countries will therefore need to have balanced energy policies in which
clean coal technology, carbon sequestration, renewables and nuclear
power will have to play a part. Our own energy review was therefore
absolutely in line with that
consensus.&#147;On
nuclear, what was interesting was the statement by China that it
intends to develop nuclear power, by India that it regarded it as
indispensable and by many of the main oil producers including
Kazakhstan that they would also balance their reliance on their own oil
and gas with nuclear. It was also the conclusion of the J8, the young
people from around the world who debated the
issue.&#147;The G8 also
agreed on the need to accelerate discussions on an inclusive dialogue
for a post-2012 framework and that framework importantly includes the
United States, China and
India.&#147;The G8
supported the need for a goal to stabilise greenhouse gas
concentrations, which will be a central part of the future framework.
The Gleneagles dialogue meeting in Mexico would be the next step in
taking this work
forward.&#147;This was a
summit held in circumstances none of us could have foreseen. It was
dominated by the Middle East, but its conclusions on Africa, on trade
and on energy will, I hope, stand the test of time and I commend the
conclusions to the
House.&#148;<p><a name="06071884000153"></a>My

Leader of the House for repeating the Statement&#151;an unusually
lengthy Statement and a very useful report back. We had a full

the fomenting of terrorism&#151; I think that was the word President

courting of President Assad given us in
Damascus?</p><p><a name="06071884000156"></a>Do the Government also
agree with the view of the United States that the greatest
responsibility for the financing and arming of terrorism lies with
Iran? Is it not essential that Damascus and Teheran get a united
message, not only from the G8, but also from China and India, so
recently tragically affected by terrorism, that the promotion of
terrorism must stop?</p><p><a name="06071884000157"></a>How much
could have been done to relieve the evils of poverty and suffering that
we see in Gaza and in Lebanon if only one hundredth of the money poured
into financing terrorist training guns and arms had gone into
education, the fight against disease and the promotion of civil
society, as the G8 rightly asked?</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1146"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000158"></a>It is clear that a solution must include
the release of Israeli hostages, the end of rocket attacks on Israel,
the end of the bombardment of Gaza and Lebanon, whose governments were
lawfully elected, and a future for Lebanon without armed militias, as
so many of its people have shown they
want.</p><p><a name="06071884000159"></a>The G8 brought together
leaders of the world&#146;s major powers. There were great
declarations but what specifically will be done? Some people have the
impression that the role of the Prime Minister is largely to act as a
Sherpa for President Bush. Can the noble Baroness assure us that
Britain will make a distinctive and independent contribution? How
widespread is support for the Prime Minister&#146;s concept of an
intervention force? How could it be injected when the level of violence
is so high and without the consent of the contending parties? How could
we make it more valuable than the existing UNIFIL? Would it have a
potential combat role in restoring stability, that the British Army
finds itself undertaking in Afghanistan? If so, who would take part?
What undertakings were given in St Petersburg? How could our stretched
Armed Forces help?</p><p><a name="06071884000160"></a>We know that
the Prime Minister is considering visiting the Middle East, preparatory
to a possible visit by the US Secretary of State. Is there any view on
when that visit might take place and what the objectives would
be?</p><p><a name="06071884000161"></a>Naturally the whole House
is concerned about the safety of British citizens, but who is
co-ordinating the evacuation effort? How many British citizens are in
Lebanon? How many have been evacuated? Is it 10,000 in, 63 out, as the
Statement indicated? What is the current advice to British citizens and
are they all able to access it? Does the noble Baroness have any
concerns that our efforts to date have been less decisive than those of
some other countries? How many people can be accommodated on Cyprus and
what contingency plans are being put in place for a long
stay?</p><p><a name="06071884000162"></a>We
welcome the united stance of the G8 on restraining the nuclear
ambitions of Iran and North Korea, but what in practice was decided in
relation to North Korea? President Putin said that it was too early to
speak of sanctions on Iran, but if Iranian intransigence continues,
will the G8 states not have to return to the Security Council with a
view to possible sanctions? He also laid great emphasis on energy
policy, which is scarcely surprising. Was the UK one of the countries
that, in the words of the communiqu&#233;, underlined the important
contribution of nuclear power to global energy security? Does the noble
Baroness share my disappointment at the relatively weak emphasis on
reducing energy consumption when there was a great deal on advancing
oil and gas sales? Can she confirm that all states subscribed to the
declaration that producer countries, notably Russia, should be enabled
to take over energy assets in consumer countries? Does that mean that
the UK Government will positively welcome acquisitions by Gazprom and
other Russian giants in the United Kingdom? Can she write to me if she
does not have the answers now about what discussions there were, if
any, about corporate governance issues?</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1147"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000163"></a>I know that the noble Baroness will share
my disappointment that the crisis in the Middle East meant that there
was less momentum behind the initiatives on Africa and fighting world
poverty. The communiqu&#233; was a little thin on concrete action on
that front&#151;&#147;modest&#148; was the word that the normally
effusive Prime Minister used. The noble Baroness will not be surprised
if I ask her to tell the House what steps were agreed against the
murderous Mugabe regime. I note that that was not mentioned as one of
the key milestones for the International Development Secretary to
report on.</p><p><a name="06071884000164"></a>A successful trade
round will do more than anything else to alleviate poverty. Are the UK
Government satisfied that all the G8 leaders are prepared to compromise
to do a deal? Time is running out, but world attention is focused
elsewhere. There was discussion on Kosovo and Nagorno-Karabakh. Does
the noble Baroness agree that the only sensible outcome should be
multiethnic? Did the UK Government raise the issue of Georgia and
separatism in Abkhazia and Ossetia? How does the UK assess risks of
linkage if western members of the G8 encourage independence for
Kosovo?</p><p><a name="06071884000165"></a>This is a time of major
tests for the G8. The urgent need is for peace in the Middle East and a
common front to eradicate violence and terrorism, but the vital need
for long-term progress is on trade and the eradication of disease. Does
the G8 not also need to show renewed momentum and intensify efforts to
achieve those worthy goals?</p><h5><a name="06071884000295"></a>4.34
pm</h5><p><a name="06071884000166"></a><b><a name="06071884000375"></a>Lord
McNally:</b> My Lords, for the man and woman in the
street, I suppose there could be no greater contrast in watching their
evening news than seeing the pomp and circumstance of a St Petersburg
summit&#151;a gathering of the most powerful nations on
earth&#151;and a fast cut to a disaster in the Middle East, of which
those mighty powers seem totally impotent to influence the outcome.
That is the worry: the juxtaposition between the activities of the big
powers and the capacity of individuals and organisations to set in
train destabilisation of a whole region. In the light of the experience
in St Petersburg, has the quartet of the US, Russia, the UN and the EU
any feelings of special responsibility and activity at present? If we
have to understand why there should be no call for an immediate
ceasefire, when should such a ceasefire take
place?</p><p><a name="06071884000167"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, spoke of the situation of UK nationals in
the conflict zone. A large number of countries is taking action at
present. On the tapes I saw about eight different evacuation plans
under way. Is there any co-ordination to make those plans more
effective?</p><p><a name="06071884000168"></a>Like the noble Lord,
I should be interested in clarification of the reported interest of the
Prime Minister in undertaking some kind of shuttle diplomacy in the
region. I may return to that subject when concluding my remarks. I
agree with the Prime Minister that the fundamental nature of the
struggle in the region has to be understood. Do the Prime 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1148"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister and the Government accept that a settlement of the
Palestine/Israel conflict is a pre-condition of winning the war on
terrorism? If the conflict goes unresolved, it will remain the major
recruiting sergeant for extremists seeking a holy war with the
West.</p><p><a name="06071884000169"></a>Do the Government agree
that a disproportionate use of force is counterproductive and has
within it the seeds of a wider regional conflict with unforeseeable
consequences? In that respect, have the Government made any further
clarification of their policy on UK arms exports to the
region?</p><p><a name="06071884000170"></a>On the other issues in
the summit, progress was made, not least on trade. But there was a
feeling that the crusading urgency that dominated Gleneagles a year ago
as regards the war on poverty has been lost. As one aid organisation
observed, after the G8 leaders promised to make poverty history last
year, this summit has been a damp squib. Is there not a particular onus
on the United States and the EU to stop blaming each other and to take
action to follow up the Gleneagles promises to break the trade
deadlock?</p><p><a name="06071884000171"></a>On energy, I find it
most interesting that Russia, although no longer considered a military
superpower, is undoubtedly an energy superpower. Do the Government have
initiatives to involve Russia more fully in future discussions about
energy needs?</p><p><a name="06071884000172"></a>There is a dilemma
in respect of Iran. On the one hand, we want to talk to Iran about its
nuclear ambitions. Yet it stands squarely in the dock as the major
funder of terrorism. How shall we have a dialogue with such a country?
Who will take the lead in trying to talk to Iran?</p><p><a name="06071884000173"></a>Whenever I am faced with these issues, I
feel somewhat old-fashioned and dated. I belong to a generation that
thought that we could settle disputes by the international rule of law
and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Yet each day we see people who
believe that being marginalised by those who think that those disputes
can be settled by military action and by violence, despite all the
evidence to the contrary.</p><p><a name="06071884000174"></a>That
is why I return to the Prime Minister. It is important that we do not
allow moderate views to be squeezed out by those, whether they be
Islamic fundamentalists or American neocons, who think that they can
set the world to their own particular idea of right. I believe that the
Prime Minister has a much larger role than he seems to give himself. I

noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, about the role of Iran and Syria. We are
very concerned about the role of Syria and Iran. Through their support
for Hezbollah, those countries are encouraging extremism, threatening
the stability of the region and putting peace in the Middle East
further out of reach. On what the UK Government can do particularly
about Syria, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, might have missed the
fact that we no longer have ministerial contact with the Syrian
Government since the murder of Rafiq Hariri. However, we will continue
to work with others who can put pressure on Iran and Syria and, through
them, on Hezbollah.</p><p><a name="06071884000177"></a>The G8
statement makes it absolutely clear that there was support from all G8
countries for a stabilisation force. Clearly, there is an issue about
the relationship between that force and the current UN force in
Lebanon, which has a role in monitoring. At the Security Council on
Thursday this week, all these issues will be discussed and looked at
further. The important thing is that we want all sides to stop the
fighting.</p><p><a name="06071884000178"></a>On the issue of our
citizens, we, the United States, France and Canada probably have the
largest numbers of nationals in Lebanon. We think we have about 10,000,
plus as many more who are dual Lebanese citizens. The arrangements that
we put in place in case every one of those individuals wants to leave
have to be robust, safe and secure. That is being co-ordinated through
my right honourable friend Adam Ingram. The MoD, the Foreign Office and
all the relevant parts of government are working together on this. I
can assure noble Lords that we are doing much of the international
co-ordination and are working very closely with our EU
colleagues.</p><p><a name="06071884000179"></a>Obviously, we have
to work closely with the Government of Cyprus. They have worked closely
with us on this. It happens to be the holiday period in Cyprus, so they
are also dealing with a large number of holidaymakers. However, I must
say to the House that they have dealt with this extremely impressively.
Our plan is to charter aircraft from Cyprus to bring individuals back
to the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06071884000180"></a>I can say
more about the number of British naval ships that are close to Beirut.
We will continue the evacuation in the coming days, but things are
moving fast and I have no doubt that we will issue a Written Statement
to the House if there are any more
developments.</p><p><a name="06071884000181"></a>On energy
security, the G8 made a number of things clear: the importance of the
increased diversification of sources of energy; the fact that nuclear
power has a role to play; the focus on renewables and alternative
energy sources; and the importance of an inclusive dialogue post-2012
to include China and India. This builds very closely on the Gleneagles
dialogue, and I have to tell the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that we
were very pleased that what came out of this year&#146;s G8 summit
mirrored so much of what came out of our own energy
review.</p><p><a name="06071884000182"></a>On the
wider issues relating to Russia, which the noble Lord, Lord
Strathclyde, mentioned, I understand that there were robust and frank
discussions about G8

criticism and therefore the importance of having independent media and
an independent judiciary. These were not reflected in the
communiqu&#233;, but these discussions were held and included a
discussion of the situation in
Chechnya.</p><p><a name="06071884000183"></a>On Iran, to which the
noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Strathclyde, referred, there is a
plan for a UN Security Council resolution on Iran&#146;s nuclear
programme in the next 10 days or so. As to who will continue that
dialogue with Iran, we would like the Iranians to respond to what we
thought was a very generous package from the European Union. If it does
not respond positively to that package, we will have to look at this
issue again and think about how we continue the
dialogue.</p><p><a name="06071884000184"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
McNally, asked about the quartet, which we see as the custodians of the
road map. We want a ceasefire and an end to hostilities, but this needs
to happen on all sides. I think that we would all agree that we cannot
only look to Israel in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06071884000185"></a>I assure the House that
the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and others will continue to
work extremely hard to bring about a resolution in the region. This
issue has personally engaged the Prime Minister for many years. I
remind the House that on 4 July he said to the Liaison
Committee,</p><ul><a name="06071884000261"></a>&#147;unless we
manage to get the situation into a different position then the Israelis
are going to continue to take punitive action and the Palestinians are
going to continue to have a burning sense of injustice. Now I have
learned enough about this situation over the years to realise that
going in and condemning either side is not deeply helpful ... What
frustrates me more than anything else about the Israeli-Palestinian
situation is there is no agreement about the final
outcome&#148;.</ul><a name="06071884000241"></a>My right
honourable friend has been dealing with these issues for many years,
and he will continue to exert all the influence that he can to ensure
that we make progress.<p><a name="06071884000186"></a>On
trade and the deadlock, my right honourable friend chose his words very
carefully when he talked about those at the summit who were prepared to
go further in the trade negotiations and to deal with them flexibly. On
the basis of that agreement, Pascal Lamy had a meeting last night with
the G6 countries. I do not know what the conclusions of that meeting
were, but next month will be critical. I totally agree with the noble
Lord, Lord McNally. I, too, am old-fashioned and I cannot say how much
it pains me that those who want to negotiate and who have moderate
voices on these issues are being squeezed out by the terrorists. We
must do all that we can to ensure that the conclusion of the crisis in
the Middle East is one that we want and not one that we would all find
it impossible to support.</p><h5><a name="06071884000297"></a>4.50

Hannay of Chiswick:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for the Statement and her answers, and welcome the impetus
given to the trade talks in Geneva. Will the Minister give an assurance
that the British Government and, through them, the EU will at the right
moment encourage Pascal Lamy to come forward with his own set of
tie-breaking proposals? 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1151"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is only too likely to be the only way of ensuring that there is not
yet another deadlock. Given that the Director-General of the WTO does
not have the power of initiative in this, as I am sure the noble
Baroness knows, he needs encouragement. I noticed that the list that
she gave of those who have given encouragement so far did not include
the head of state of Monsieur Lamy&#146;s own country. No doubt that
was not
fortuitous.</p><p><a name="06071884000188"></a>My
second question involves a matter not in the Statement but in the
documents, for which I hope the noble Baroness will forgive me. I
regard as a major step forward the effort that is now going on at the
International Atomic Energy Agency to work up a scheme for guaranteed
supply of enrichment and reprocessing services. We have gone from
having a situation in which there were no proposals on the table to one
in which there now appear to be three proposals, which is probably two
too many. However, will the Government give a high priority to getting
agreement at the IAEA on such a scheme, recognising that this is a
crucial element&#151;particularly in the light of the large amount of
nuclear build that is likely to take place in the coming
years&#151;in ensuring that proliferation risks do not
increase?</p><p><a name="06071884000189"></a><b><a name="06071884000378"></a>Baroness
Amos:</b> First, I say to the noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, on the issue of encouraging Pascal Lamy, that my understanding
is that he is already thinking about the possibility of coming forward
with his own set of proposals, given the deadlock that there has been
so far in the talks. As we are extremely keen to see these talks move
forward, I am sure that we would encourage him to go in that direction
should there be no other way of
progressing.</p><p><a name="06071884000190"></a>On the second
issue, I have to confess to the House that the IAEA is not a matter
that I know a great deal about. My understanding is that we are very
positive about the moves so far. I am absolutely sure that we would
want to see one of these proposals agreed. In that sense, we would want
to give high priority to
it.</p>

Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, we should not be
surprised that terrorism is used in the Middle East. After all, Israel
was established by terror, by the blowing up of Deir Yassin, by the
hanging of British sergeants in an orange grove in Beersheba, and by
the Stern gang riding through Jaffa saying to the Arabs, &#147;You
must all leave with the British&#148;. Two million Arabs have been
removed from Palestine. Not surprisingly, they are cross about
it.</p><p><a name="06071884000192"></a>We must
understand what drives people. I am not making a judgment; I am stating
historical fact. Unfortunately, that injustice of 2 million Arabs being
asked to leave has not been addressed for 60 years. Something has to be
done about it. A much less intransigent territorial dispute, that
between Germany and France over Alsace-Lorraine, took place between
1685, when the French nicked it, and 1945, when the Germans finally
gave up wanting it back. That was a minor dispute compared with what is
going on in the Middle East. We must be less sloppy about using the
word &#147;terrorism&#148;. One man&#146;s terrorism is another

other guy&#146;s hands, you are likely to use it yourself. I make no
moral judgment, but draw the House&#146;s attention to the historical
facts.</p><p><a name="06071884000193"></a><b><a name="06071884000380"></a>Baroness

agree that there are different ways in which to read history. I know
that from my own background and, indeed, from my presence in this
House. The impact of colonialism and imperialism on countries in the
Caribbean is viewed in very different ways in the country where I was
born from how it is understood in the United Kingdom, so it is
absolutely right that we appreciate how people understand their
history. But our responsibility now as politicians is to seek a way
through what is a highly complicated, emotive and deeply sensitive
issue. That lies at the core of our responsibility. I make no judgment
in terms of whether we should be surprised at what is happening in the
Middle East, but what we should seek to do is use the influence and
power we have as a nation, working with those around us, to try to find
a solution. That will not be easy, especially given the deep-rooted and
deep-seated historical nature of this
crisis.</p><p><a name="06071884000194"></a><b><a name="06071884000381"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords,
moving to the current terrible situation, the Leader of the House will
know that for every day that there is not a ceasefire, scores more
innocent civilians will be killed in Israel, in Lebanon and in Gaza.
Can the noble Baroness tell us whether the United Kingdom Government
are solidly behind the call for a ceasefire, and in particular what
consideration has been given to the proposal made by the Prime Minister
of Lebanon that Hezbollah should withdraw back to the Litani river,
thus creating a situation of ceasefire because it could no longer reach
key towns in Israel? Can she tell us whether that proposal, made by a
Government very much under threat&#151;but, as she observed,
democratically elected&#151;has been seriously considered at the G8
Summit?</p><p><a name="06071884000195"></a><b><a name="06071884000382"></a>Baroness
Amos:</b> My Lords, all the
proposals which have been put forward over the past few days have been
looked at either in formal or informal discussions in a number of ways.
Of course what we want is a ceasefire; that is our top priority. But it
has to involve the participation of all sides in the conflict. Therein
lies a major problem because those countries which have an influence on
Hezbollah are fuelling the conflict. At this point they are not
remotely interested in moving forward in a negotiated
way.</p><p><a name="06071884000196"></a><b><a name="06071884000383"></a>The

the aid/trade/debt cycle that was begun last year and on which there is
a still a long journey to travel? In the midst of all the other issues
that are lurking, I hope that we shall lose energy around
that.</p><p><a name="06071884000197"></a>I hope
that the noble Baroness will allow me to comment on the wider issues at

all this, one made up, first, with the despair of millions of people
who have been displaced in the Middle East? I have met some who are
still carrying in their pockets the keys to their houses from
nearly60 years ago. Secondly, the reality is that we are
dealing with predominantly young societies with the future in front of
them, so despair is a very lethal force in the Middle East.
Thirdly&#151;and the noble Baroness might like to comment on this
with regard to the G8 Summit&#151;there is an impression that the
leaders in the G8 are not entirely in agreement among themselves about
what to do. That leads to a sense of impotence. When you have despair
and impotence at work, is that not the sort of lethal cocktail which
drives people into the hands of those who present other sorts of
solutions, ones sadly involving violence and damage to innocent
people?</p><p><a name="06071884000198"></a><b><a name="06071884000384"></a>Baroness
Amos:</b> My Lords, with respect to the issues of
aid, trade and debt, which I forgot to mention in my opening response,
I can tell the right reverend Prelate that we are not losing energy on
those issues. We always knew that this was a year of consolidation and
implementation. Many of the commitments made at the G8 last year run to
2010 or 2015. Therefore, it is important for us to have a clear plan in
terms of how we will deliver on those commitments.</p><p><a name="06071884000199"></a>I have to tell the
House that since last year 21 countries have already qualified for 100
per cent debt relief. We hope to add to that list another five African
countries. We have seen the education fast-track initiative take off
and we want to develop long-term educational development plans for 10
countries. In addition, of course, there is the commitment to ensure
that further funding is found for the Global Fund on HIV and
AIDS.</p><p><a name="06071884000200"></a>On the wider situation in
the Middle East, the right reverend Prelate is absolutely right. Sixty
per cent of the population is under 25 years of age &#151; a young
population for whom in our own country we would want to see the
benefits of the development of education and a secure future. That is
what we are all fighting for in this
region.</p><p><a name="06071884000201"></a><b><a name="06071884000385"></a>Lord

was no mention at all of Zimbabwe either in the conference or in the
margins of the conference? If that is correct, is it not rather
extraordinary, given the importance that the Prime Minister has
attached to the whole of Africa over the past few years? Considering
the absolutely appalling conditions in Zimbabwe, which get worse every
week, is it not surprising in relation to the credibility of the
treaties that the African countries have signed to exercise human
rights, the rule of law and good governance? Is it not also relevant
that, after many years, the Government of Zimbabwe has not yet replied
to the biting criticism made by the Human Rights Commission of the
African Union of conditions in Zimbabwe? Should not these matters have
been raised?</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000202"></a><b><a name="06071884000386"></a>Baroness
Amos:</b> My Lords, Zimbabwe was not discussed. I do
not find that extraordinary, precisely for the reasons that the noble
Lord has just set out. If you look at the whole of Africa, you are
talking about 53 countries, of which Zimbabwe is one. In the light of
the G8 agenda and the agenda of the continent itself with respect to
the new partnership for Africa&#146;s development, and in the light
of the peer review mechanism, where we have seen Ghana and Rwanda go
through a very intense period of having their economies, political
systems and governance looked at, we have seen the stable transition
from one democratically elected Government to another, we have seen
conflicts resolved, but where we have a continuing difficult situation
in the Sudan, it would be absolutely wrong to focus on Zimbabwe as an
example of what is happening in the entire African
continent.</p><p><a name="06071884000203"></a><b><a name="06071884000387"></a>Baroness
Northover:</b> My Lords, does the
Minister feel that the G8 Summit adequately addressed the catastrophic
issue of AIDS? Last year the G8 gave the very welcome commitment that
all who needed treatment should be in receipt of it by 2010. Warm words
were expressed at this summit, but little by way of action that could
be charted. Indeed, the concentration on infectious diseases tended to
emphasise, if anything, the flu pandemic, which obviously does not at
the moment threaten the same number of people as does the AIDS
crisis.</p><p><a name="06071884000204"></a><b><a name="06071884000388"></a>Baroness
Amos:</b> My Lords, last year, a very clear set of
actions was set out with respect to HIV/AIDS, which is precisely what I
meant in responding to the right reverend Prelate about the importance
of monitoring and implementation. At this year&#146;s summit, part of
what the G8 did was to look at the replenishment of the global fund on
HIV/AIDS and make a commitment that those replenishment rounds would be
fully met. There is a plan for HIV/AIDS looking forward to 2010. What
happened this year was part of the monitoring of that plan. I would be
happy to write to the noble Baroness setting out the detail if it would
be
helpful.</p><p><a name="06071884000205"></a><b><a name="06071884000389"></a>Lord

quietly urge the Israelis to be more careful and selective in their
retaliation against Hezbollah? Killing more than 200 civilians, only a
small proportion of whom are Hezbollah supporters and a high proportion
of whom are children, and causing hundreds of millions of pounds of
damage to the Lebanese infrastructure which was so laboriously built up
after the long years of civil war, is hardly likely to win friends for
the West or to lead to a long-term peaceful

states:</p><ul><a name="06071884000256"></a>&#147;It is also
critical that Israel, while exercising the right to defend itself, be
mindful of the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions.

on reinforcements to Afghanistan in which the strain on our resources

It will be looked at in detail at the UN. As noble Lords know, there is
already a UN force in Lebanon. The role of any such force and where

the President of the United States has his fast-track authority to
agree such deals. </p><p><a name="06071884000210"></a>However, even
we have a problem with the European Union. How does the Leader of the
House feel that the British Government will influence even the European
Union to ensure that the Trade Commissioner has sufficient authority in
this last month to make sure that this deal happens? Apart from the

from the fact that the Uruguay round took much longer before it was
completed. On the British Government&#146;s role with respect to the
European Union, the noble Lord will know that it is not just a case of
influencing the European Union and the Trade Commissioner. The Trade
Commissioner is operating on behalf of 25 EU countries. Part of our

amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 88, which is grouped with
it. The amendments seek to place a prudent and sensible brake on the
irresistible march of the academies project and ensure that where one
is being is considered the local authority must have regard to the
impact on the other schools in the area and not just consult them. Any
bright shiny new school is going to be attractive to parents
andpupils but in the current climate of falling roles the
impact on other schools will be even greater. The Government say that
they want parents to have choice, but without the amendments they could
end up taking choices away from parents and children through the
closure of other schools that might become
unsustainable.</p><p><a name="06071884000215"></a>Amendment No. 66
asks for a proper evaluation of the existing academies before any more
are established. Given that handing over &#163;20 million and the
control of the school to some unknown body that does not necessarily
have any track record in running an educational establishment is a
radical step, I would have thought that a proper evaluation was only a
reasonable and prudent measure to take. The Education and Skills Select
Committee in another place reported last year on academies after a
two-year inquiry into secondary education. It questioned the average
&#163;7,000 per pupil extra cost of establishing an academy and
described the current programme asan untested model. It
recommended a halt to the programme pending proper evaluation given its
lack of coherent strategy, inflated cost and the impact of academies on
neighbouring schools.</p><p><a name="06071884000216"></a>Many but
not all of the academies take over failing schools and we on these
Benches are not averse to directing extra resources towards helping the
pupils in such schools to achieve their full educational potential:
quite the reverse. We believe that we should spend more on them, as
long as the money is carefully and wisely spent. But we question the
wisdom of throwing quite so much money at a set of managers who have
not yet proved themselves. Why do the Government think that being able
to run a large retailer, manufacturer, service industry business,
charity or Formula 1 motor racing competition qualifies a person to run
a school? Of course it is accepted wisdom that the leadership in a
school is an important factor in its success, but by leadership we
usually mean the head and management team, not some person or
organisation that promises &#163;2 million funding to sponsor a
school and then does not deliver it, as many of them have
not.</p><p><a name="06071884000217"></a>The Select Committee found
that the link between schools with different kinds of governance and
improving standards was not proven. We have to look at the intake.
Academies showed mixed results and many were below the national average
at key stages 3 and 4. Many academies take over low attaining schools
but they do not all show the progress that we should be able to expect
at such a high cost. The cost is not just financial; the loss of
accountability to the local community and the impact on other schools
should be added to the financial cost.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1157"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000218"></a>The <I>Times Education Supplement
</I>recently analysed the GCSE results of academies using the new
measure of including English, maths and science in the benchmark of A
to C grades. In 2005, only 16 per cent of academy pupils achieved that;
an increase of only 3 per cent on predecessor schools. Two of the three
longest opening academies had worse results on the new measure than the
schools they replaced. When GNVQs were removed, the percentage fell by
at least half in eight of the 14 academies studied. At Walsall Academy
the achievement of five good A to C grades slumped from 67 per cent to
7 per cent when the <I>Times Educational Supplement</I> used that
measure. That calls into question the use of GNVQs in skewing the
apparent achievements of some schools. Research undertaken by York
University quoted by the Select Committee suggests that academies are
raising their standards by improving their intake rather than by doing
better with the same pupils, which is what they are supposed to
do.</p><p><a name="06071884000219"></a>Even
Ofsted has suggested that standards in some academies, such as Unity
City Academy in Middlesbrough and West London academy are a cause for
concern. The Government make two conflicting arguments: on the one hand
they argue that academies need more time to improve having taken over
failing schools; on the other hand they argue that academy results are
so good that they need to push on to expansion without delay. They
cannot have it both ways. Which of these is true? If academies need
more time to improve, why is not the same amount of time to be given to
or maintained schools that are
failing?</p><p><a name="06071884000220"></a>All in all, academies
are an unproven model&#151;and it would be reasonable for the
Secretary of State to halt their expansion until the various factors
that contribute to their success for failure are properly evaluated.
When that evaluation is done, it should be done on accepted scientific
principles of comparing like with like. It would be only fair to
compare each academy&#146;s performance with that of a similar school
under normal local authority governance in a similar locality that had
had the same amount of money thrown at it. Indeed, my Liberal Democrat
colleagues in Liverpool have already volunteered some of their schools
for such an experiment. They would welcome the extra money, and they
are confident that given the same amount of resource they could do at
least as well as any academy, and probably better. Will the Minister
take up that challenge?</p><p><a name="06071884000221"></a>In his
response to Amendment No. 16 on the first day in Committee last week,
the Minister said that the Government&#146;s structure of academies
was more likely to raise standards. What shred of evidence does he have
to justify such a claim? There has been no study to justify any such
statement. If there is no evidence, I call on him to accept Amendment
No. 66 forthwith and to commission a fair study with a level playing
field to see whether such evidence exists anywhere, except in the Prime
Minister&#146;s dreams. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06071884000298"></a>5.15

Judd:</b> Lying behind Amendment
No. 184 is the concern that we in the Joint Committee on Human Rights
registered about this part of the Bill. The 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1158"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>purpose of the amendment is to make all the relevant statutory
protections for pupils at maintained schools available to pupils at
academies and city technology
colleges.</p><p><a name="06071884000223"></a>The
committee was deeply concerned about whether there would be the same
protection for pupils at city technology colleges and academies. We
wrote to the Minister and, as I have said before, received a very full,
considerate and detailed reply from him, which we very much
appreciated. In that reply, the Government&#146;s position seems to
remain that academies and CTCs should not be defined as maintained
schools. The Government&#146;s position is that they are regulated
not through statutory requirements but rather through funding
agreements with the Secretary of
State.</p><p><a name="06071884000224"></a>As we
understand it, the Government suggest that it is incorrect to put
forward the view that the protections offered to the pupils are
inferior. On exclusion, for example, the Government argue that the
model academy funding agreement requires the academy to have regard to
the Secretary of State&#146;s guidance on exclusions as if the
academy were a maintained school and requires that appeals panels must
be impartial and constituted in accordance with that guidance. As we
understand it, too, the Government argue that the same principles apply
to SEN and admissions, and they hold to the same argument that,
although the arrangements may be different in detail, in effect the
pupils are at no disadvantage. Most academies have adopted the model
academy funding agreement without any
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071884000225"></a>The committee
welcomed the Minister&#146;s response in so far as it implicitly
accepted, in principle, that protections enjoyed by pupils at academies
and CTCs in relation to exclusions, admissions and SEN should be no
less than those enjoyed by pupils at maintained schools. We also
recognised from the Minister&#146;s reply that the Government accept
the importance of the rights that are at stake&#151;for example, the
right to a fair hearing before being permanently excluded from school,
and the importance of not treating pupils at academies and CTCs less
favourably than pupils at other state schools in respect of their
enjoyment of rights such as the right to a fair
hearing.</p><p><a name="06071884000226"></a>Now
we come to the rub. Having gone so far in welcoming the
Minister&#146;s reply, we remained unconvinced by it, which is what
led me and my colleagues to table Amendment No. 184. We are not
persuaded that regulating academies and CTCs through their funding
agreements with the Secretary of State is conducive to ensuring that
equivalent protections are enjoyed by the pupils at those institutions.
I want very briefly to give the three examples that we gave in our
report, which I commend and which I am sure all noble Lords have read
in great detail. Just to indicate how hard we work in that committee, I
should say that it is the 21st report of the current
Session.</p><p><a name="06071884000227"></a>First,
the model funding agreement suggests having a term in the agreement
providing that, in discharging their duties, the head and governors
will have regard to the Secretary of State&#146;s guidance on
exclusions, as if academies are maintained schools. As the Government
appear to have accepted in the context of the admissions code, a duty
to have regard to guidance is very much weaker than a positive
requirement to act in accordance 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1159"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with guidance. It seems to us that there is a problem. It is a
formulation that presupposes that departures from guidance may, in the
end, be
justifiable.</p><p><a name="06071884000228"></a>Secondly,
even where actual funding agreements contain the wording recommended in
the model agreement, the agreement itself might contain certain
provisions that are inferior to the protections available at maintained
schools. The funding agreement between the Secretary of State and
Haberdashers&#146; Aske&#146;s Knights Academy, for example,
specifically provides for a final right of appeal to the governors
against permanent exclusion, but the governors are clearly incapable of
being an independent and impartial
tribunal.</p><p><a name="06071884000229"></a>Thirdly, whereas a
maintained school is required by statute to admit a child with a
statement of special educational needs, there is no equivalent
requirement on academies to do the same. It is because of those points
that we are anxious that the Minister should look at this again to see
whether the Government can move further to give substance to their
general claim that pupils at such institutions are at no disadvantage.
Certainly, we in the Joint Committee on Human Rights are not convinced
on that
point.</p><p><a name="06071884000230"></a><b><a name="06071884000397"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> The two Liberal Democrat amendments in the
group seem a little inconsistent, at least in what they propose,
because the Liberals, having been long-term opponents of league
tables,are now inventing their own to beat academies about the
head with. Similarly, having been long-term proponents of vocational
education, they now spurn academies because that is the direction in
which they have turned. Inconsistency and Liberal
Democrats&#151;perhaps I should expect them to go together.</p><p><a name="06071884000231"></a>I support some aspects of Amendment No.
184. I particularly want to press the Minister on the Freedom of
Information Act. The Department for Education and Skills is a difficult
department when it comes to the Freedom of information Act. The central
part of the department is extremely helpful and co-operative, and I
cannot think of a better department, but some of its important
offshoots are exempt, the principal one being UCAS, which I know is
quasi-independent. Universities are in; the department is in; schools
are in&#151;but UCAS is out.</p><p><a name="06071884000232"></a>A lot of information
flows from schools directly to examining bodies&#151;for instance,
about exemptions that have been given to pupils in respect of
SEN&#151;but it is not available under the Freedom of Information Act
because it does not stick to any government department, but goes
directly to the examining boards, which are, in that sense, providing a
government function on a commercial basis and are exempt from the
Freedom of Information Act.</p><p><a name="06071884000233"></a>Along with such
anomalies, it would be very useful to clear up any lack of transparency
with respect to academies, city technology colleges and/or their
funding agreements and to bring those institutions into line with the
generality of schools and educational institutions. I do not imagine
that that can be done through a funding agreement. I would be happy to
be corrected, but I would be surprised if a funding agreement could
give the rights and the detail of rights that are available to a
citizen under the Freedom of Information
Act.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1160"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071884000234"></a><b><a name="06071884000398"></a>Baroness
Morgan of Huyton:</b> To talk about
city academies and the need for a level playing field is to approach
the matter in the wrong way, because the main reason for the existence
of city academies is that there is not a level playing field. City
academies are being established where there is failure; they are being
established where kids are not getting a fair chance of a decent
education, where schools are profoundly failing those children or where
there are no schools and we are seeking to set up new schools to meet
the needs of the most disadvantaged children. If one looks at any
figures that have been produced, although one does not see improvements
across the piece, one sees in most of the schools clear improvements in
behaviour, attendance and standards. Perhaps the clearest indication of
that is that the schools tend to have waiting lists. We have talked a
lot today about parental choice. It is evident that parents are
choosing to send their children to these schools, which suggests that
we are getting something right in
them.</p><p><a name="06071884000235"></a>I was interested to hear
about the situation in Liverpool. The new city academy that has been
set up there by the Anglican and Catholic Churches is innovative; it is
worth visiting, if the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has not yet done
so. However, my understanding is that, while her colleagues in
Liverpool may be asking for another report, her colleagues in Southwark
are moving ahead very quickly with city academies and are commissioning
their third, if not their fourth, academy. They have recognised that
city academies are the best way of meeting the needs of their
inner-city
children.</p><p><a name="06071899000001"></a><b><a name="06071899000091"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> Perhaps I may respond to the
noble Lord, Lord Lucas, because he is a highly intelligent Member of
the Committee and I know that he would appreciate that, as my noble
friend Lady Walmsley said, the basis of comparison must be the same.
However much one welcomes GNVQs&#151;I certainly do and I know that
she does&#151;they are not on the same footing as GCSEs of the
traditional kind. She simply pointed out, without making any suggestion
that GNVQs were not a valuable qualification, that on a comparison of
like with like the evidence that has come forward so far is not to the
effect that city academies have far outstripped community schools.
However, we on these Benches believe that it is important that enough
time is given to ensure that, exactly as the noble Baroness, Lady
Morgan, said, schools that can assist children in the most
disadvantaged areas are given a fair wind. We are not yet convinced on
the basis of the evidence that is coming forward that an absolutely
clear case has been made.</p>

<p><a name="06071899000002"></a>With
regard to Amendment No. 184, to which the noble Lord, Lord Judd,
referred, I further strengthen his case by saying that there is some
reason to believe&#151;indeed, there is evidence to show&#151;that
the proportion of excluded children is rather higher in academies and
CTCs than in the average run of maintained schools. That suggests all
the more strongly that it is vital that the same requirements are laid
on both with regard to excluded children, and not least to children
with special educational needs, so that schools in both categories
respond to these cases as forthrightly as they
can.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1161"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071899000003"></a><b><a name="06071899000092"></a>Lord

make is that, as soon as you start reducing things to league tables,
you miss the real comparison. If we want children to learn English,
maths and science to a reasonable level, it is surely possible that
that is better delivered to some children with a vocational element
attached to it, rather than by purely academic qualifications that have
become quite debased.</p><h5><a name="06071899000087"></a>5.30

Plant of Highfield:</b> I, too, am a member of the
Joint Committee on Human Rights and my name is on the amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Judd. I will speak briefly in support of what he said.
I do not doubt the Government&#146;s commitment to ensuring that the
protections for academy pupils are not lower than those for pupils in
maintained schools. Given that commitment, the crux of the question is
whether the funding agreement is the best vehicle for securing it. I
share the qualms of Members of the Committee about the detail of those
model agreements and so forth. There must be some doubt over whether
the agreements can deliver what the Government seek. I therefore
strongly support the amendment.</p><p><a name="06071899000005"></a><b><a name="06071899000094"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> I add my voice to those
supporting Amendment No. 184. What the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said
raised some concerns in my own mind. I take entirely what the noble
Baroness, Lady Morgan, said about the good track record of academies
thus far, and the important point that parents are choosing for their
children to go to such schools. However, I do not see that as a reason
for children at academies having fewer rights, especially those
children with special educational needs, about whom we on these
Benches&#151;and I think noble Lords right across the
Committee&#151;are concerned. I hope that we will have some further
reassurance from the Minister.</p><p><a name="06071899000006"></a><b><a name="06071899000095"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> I am compelled to refer to Amendments
Nos. 66 and 88 on academies. They look remarkably similar to those
already debated in the Commons. It is clear, I fear, that the Liberal
Democrats are opposed to the autonomy and independence that are the
driving force in the concept of the academy school. The spirit of
localism so often claimed by the noble Baroness&#146;s party as their
own is somewhat betrayed in this approach. It seems that localism is
all very well in so far as it enforces state bureaucracies at a local
level, but that it does not extend to the level of a local
school.</p><p><a name="06071899000007"></a>These
amendments revisit old ground. The same amendments were debated at
great length in the eighth sitting of the Committee in another place. I
do not want to rehash that debate; it has already been undertaken in
Parliament. Indeed, the honourable Member for Brent East&#151;whose
amendments I think they were&#151;promised to go away and work on the
topic. Even so, the amendments in front of us today remain completely
unchanged. Indeed, the honourable Member herself admitted that
Amendment No. 66 is technically flimsy.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1162"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071899000008"></a>Amendment No. 88, on
the other hand, would give powers to the local authority to prevent an
academy from being set up. Members of another place have already
conceded our points on this debate. The honourable Member Annette
Brooke, of the noble Baroness&#146;s party, stated that she agreed
with many of the points made by my honourable friend Nick Gibb. The
Minister, Jacqui Smith, rightly stated that the Liberal Democrat
argument was based on the false premise that the approach to and
achievements of academies were unproven.</p><p><a name="06071899000009"></a>I do not want to detain the Committee,
but it is important to defend and, in a sense, champion
academies&#146; achievements to date. I shall try to be brief.
PricewaterhouseCoopers&#146; second annual report on academies shows
that the independent ethos of academies is helping to drive up
standards:</p><ul><a name="06071899000076"></a>&#147;A very clear
and significant finding from the early research is that there does seem
to be a significant difference in the learning culture in new Academies
compared to their predecessors. For example, 8 out of 10 pupils in the
survey said that the &#145;teachers at this academy really believe
that all pupils can achieve&#146;. Similar numbers of staff surveyed
said &#145;Staff at this academy believe that all pupils can achieve
regardless of their social
background&#146;&#148;.</ul><a name="06071899000071"></a>We
should bear in mind, as the noble Baroness,Lady Morgan, said,
the fact that these schools are being set up in areas where pupils have
been failed by the state in the past.
<p><a name="06071899000010"></a>The Liberal Democrats have tabled
amendments that would consult pupils on matters affecting schools,
which shows a clear pupil endorsement. However, I wonder whether they
would be so keen to listen to those pupils who endorse academies. Those
pupils and teachers of academies are evidence of a part of the
potential of academies. The National Audit Office report <I>Improving
poorly performing schools in England</I> cites the statistics of
success:</p><ul><a name="06071899000077"></a>&#147;Key Stage 3
test results for 14-year olds at academies improved faster than the
national average: 9 per cent in English and mathematics compared with a
national average improvement of 6 and 7 per cent in English and
mathematics
respectively&#148;.</ul><a name="06071899000011"></a>What is
more, of the three academies that had been open for more than a year in
2004, all had improved GSCE performance.
<p><a name="06071899000012"></a>We can see the vast
improvements in standards made by CTCs since their inception&#151;a
useful evidential analogy, given the structural similarity. CTCs
benefit the most disadvantaged in our society. While the proportion of
pupils on free school meals who achieved the magic five A* to C grades
at GCSE in 2004 was 16.8 per cent in community schools, academies
produced the amazing result of 58.3 per cent of such children achieving
that. The academy scheme is in its earliest years, yet it is already
showing wonderful promise and giving children the best chances in life.
Let us not forget that we sanctioned the different legal regulation of
academies, with full parliamentary scrutiny, in the Education Act 2002.
Academies are kept in check by the terms of their funding agreements,
and cannot go outside the admissions code of practice. We should give
them a chance.</p><p><a name="06071899000013"></a>I know that the
Minister will have a lot more to say in support of academies. In
essence, I will never support measures that would halt the contribution

standards in our schools. These amendments should not be
supported.</p><p><a name="06071899000014"></a><b><a name="06071899000096"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> No argument causes me
moredistress than the one put by the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, that I should be incoherent or inconsistent in my arguments.
I hope at least that the Government are clear and consistent in their
arguments. There is no inconsistency whatever in simultaneously arguing
that academies that have taken over from some of the most challenging
and lowest-performing schools in the country are improving&#151;which
they are, above national average rates&#151;and that they have not
magically become among the best schools in the country in the short
time that they have been
open.</p><p><a name="06071899000015"></a>We do not have to look at
our expectations for the future in a hypothetical way, let alone a
completely unscientific one, to take the noble Baroness&#146;s claim.
We can look at two specific, strongly encouraging pieces of evidence.
The first is the experience of the city technology colleges, which have
now been in existence for 15 years. I am a great believer in
evidence-based policy. In my experience of education policy, there are
few areas of innovation that have yielded more tangible, beneficial
results than the experience of city technology colleges. If the noble
Baroness has not visited any, I encourage her to do so. I pay tribute
to the noble Lord, Lord Baker, who was the moving force in their
establishment. Their success is shown in the work of Professor David
Jesson, who found the city technology colleges to be the subgroup of
secondary schools with the most substantial value added of all the
groups of secondary schools that he analysed. I will send the noble
Baroness the data. With academies, we have broadly sought to take the
city technology college model but to apply it much more resolutely to
areas of disadvantage than was the case with the city technology
colleges.</p><p><a name="06071899000016"></a>The
second piece of evidence supporting the progress of new academies is
the evaluation undertaken to date. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley,
was quite wrong in suggesting that there had been no evaluation.
Onthe contrary, my department has paid
veryconsiderable sums&#151;as it does to
consultancies&#151;to PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct an annual
evaluation of the academies programme. The noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, quoted from the second annual evaluation, which was published
last year. I understand that the third one will be available
shortly.</p><p><a name="06071899000017"></a>The
evaluation as a whole gives a highly positive picture of the progress
made by academies. It concluded that there was a significant difference
in the learning culture in new academies compared with their
predecessor schools, with, for example, 97 per cent of staff thinking
that the principal really believes that the academy can make a
difference to pupils&#146; learning whatever their family
backgrounds; with 90 per cent of the parents who named an academy as
their school of choice attracted by the high academic and teaching
standards of the academy; with 87 per cent of parents satisfied with
the quality of the education provided to their children at the academy;
with 85 per cent of pupils stating that they were pleased with their
school work 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1164"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and had high expectations; and with 90 per cent of parents agreeing that
most pupils liked going to the academy and that their children enjoyed
attending the school. The report goes on to make an important point
about governance. It says that the new academies have 78 per cent of
staff agreeing that the sponsor brings expertise that would not
otherwise be available to the academy, and 82 per cent of staff
agreeing that the sponsor&#146;s resources have a positive impact on
pupils&#146;
learning.</p><p><a name="06071899000018"></a>I
never like to leave an argument unreplied to, so I will write to the
noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and copy to other Members of the
Committee my response to each of the assertions that she made about
academy performance, because I can meet them all. That is in no way
seeking to claim that the academies that have taken over from weak or
failing schools have been able to turn around performance to become
highly successful overnight. That is not the case; the issue is the
rate of improvement that they had been able to make. Evaluation has
taken place. The great majority of Ofsted reports have been
satisfactory or excellent, leading Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of
Schools, David Bell, to say in August last year that, with regard to
academies, in some cases what has been achieved in a short time is
&#147;nothing less than remarkable&#148;. That was said by Her
Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools, not by a
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071899000019"></a>Taking all this
evidence in the round, I believe that we are right to proceed with a
policy that, let us be clear, is focused at one of the most intractable
areas of educational reform&#151;that of bringing good schools to
areas that have had low, and often chronically low, standards not only
for years but often for generations. There is nothing that this Labour
Government should take more pride in than that we are targeting
investment and reform together, not simply thinking that we can put the
money into areas that have been failed so consistently in the past. My
noble friend Lady Morgan has been engaged in the academy movement
through the outstanding work of ARK, a charity that brings great
expertise to this area. The proof of the pudding is in parental views
and whether parents are prepared to apply to academies for their
children. The evidence is highly
encouraging.</p><p><a name="06071899000020"></a>Amendment No. 88
would require local authorities to have regard to the potential effect
of academies on other schools in the area. In point of fact, local
consultation is already required in the development of every academy
proposal. All those with an interest must be consulted, including
neighbouring schools, FE colleges and sixth forms. Decision makers,
including local authorities, when deciding whether to support an
academy proposal, take into account the effects of proposals on other
provision in their area.</p><p><a name="06071899000021"></a>I will depart from my
normal practice and make just a small party-political point in passing.
I am glad to say that what I have just said includes Liberal Democrat
authorities, many of which have been very strong supporters of
academies. Indeed, Liberal Democrat authorities account for some 19
academies that are open or under development, including no fewer than
eight in Southwark&#151;more than my noble friend suggested. To make
an even more developed party-political point, I will add that one of
those academies in 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1165"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Southwark will be enthusiastically sponsored, in co-operation with the
Liberal Democrat authority, by an editor of <I>The Orange
Book</I>&#151;an excellent publication, which I recommend to Liberal
Democrats in this House as precisely the positive direction in which
they should be moving to catch up with us in new Labour by modernising
their approach to public sector reform.</p><p><a name="06071899000022"></a>I will now return to more narrow
educational issues. My noble friend Lord Judd spoke passionately about
equal protection of the interests of pupils in academies. We believe
that adequate protection is afforded. I have written to my noble friend
once on this issue, going through each of the areas that he raised in
turn. I will do so again, taking the three specific areas that he
raised, but I believe that the protection is adequate.</p><p><a name="06071899000023"></a>I say in answer to my noble friend Lord
Plant that the funding agreements that govern academies are legally
enforceable agreements between the Secretary of State and the academy
sponsor. However, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is quite right about the
Freedom of Information Act not being applicable, but that is a matter
to do with the wider law. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is
about to consult on bringing academies within the coverage of the FOI
legislation. The Government believe that that is a welcome development.
We have nothing whatever to hide in respect of the activities of
academies. Although there will be consultation before the relevant
orders are laid, we are favourably disposed towards ensuring that
outcome.</p><h5><a name="06071899000088"></a>5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06071899000024"></a>Finally, in respect of the
Human Rights Act, I assure my noble friend Lord Judd that academies
are, in our view, plainly public authorities under the Act and will
thus be subject to the provisions of that Act. That has not yet been
tested in court, so I cannot say absolutely categorically what a court
would rule, but that is the view of my department's legal
advisers.</p><p><a name="06071899000025"></a>I expect that we will
return to this matter at a later stage, but I hope that, when I have
been able to provide even more information and argumentation in
writing, we may be able to dispel some of the arguments that have been
advanced about academies.
</p><p><a name="06071899000026"></a>To end on a
point made by my noble friend Lady Morgan, in my experience the cure
for disliking academies is to visit one. I strongly urge my colleagues
on the Liberal Democrat Benches to visit some academies. We have
nothing to hide. Some of the most impassioned journalists have taken up
the cause against academies on principle because they involve
engagement with the private sector and all kinds of horrible things
like that, but once they actually see one in action&#151;I can give
the noble Baroness a list of academies to visit&#151;they find that
the reality of improved educational performance and the palpable
difference that is being made to the life chances of children tend to
overcome even the most rigid
ideology.</p><p><a name="06071899000027"></a><b><a name="06071899000097"></a>Lord
Judd:</b> I thank my noble friend for his reply. I
think that he is being very candid. However, the devil is often in the
detail and he says that he has not had an opportunity to look in detail
at the three examples 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1166"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I gave. I hope therefore that his department will look at them in
detail and at the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights
following his helpful letter to that committee.</p><p><a name="06071899000028"></a>I have immense respect for my noble
friendLady Morgan, but we are not concerned about a level
playing field in the sense that she was talking about. We are concerned
about a level playing field in terms of the rights of the child. Our
point is that the Government have taken very seriously their commitment
to the rights of the child and they have made provision in the
maintained sector for how those rights should be protected. Our
argument is that, in the detail of the legislation, what is seen as
necessary in the maintained sector is not 100 per cent followed through
in the CTCs and academies.</p><p><a name="06071899000029"></a>We do not doubt the
Minister's good will, which he always repeats in his intention and in
his letters. He repeated it to the Committee again this evening and I
accept his sincerity of purpose in this respect. Our argument is that
his purpose is not being fulfilled by the detail of the provision.
Therefore, I hope that he will go away and see whether he can make
adjustments to meet the concerns that have been expressed. To add one
other point on special educational needs, I am perhaps going a little
beyond the discipline that I have set myself in commenting on the
Minister&#146;s reply, but it seems unfortunate that academies should
not be subject to exactly the same obligations as everybody else
is.</p><p><a name="06071898000001"></a><b><a name="06071898000093"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> This has been an interesting debate and
I thank the Minister for his response and other noble Lords for their
comments. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who is not in its
place&#151;</p><p><a name="06071898000002"></a><b><a name="06071898000094"></a>Lord

Walmsley:</b> I am so sorry; the noble Lord, Lord
Lucas, is not in his usual place&#151;he has taken up residence on
the Cross Benches for the moment. I wonder when anybody said that
academies were vocational schools.</p><p><a name="06071898000004"></a>We on these Benches are very enthusiastic
about vocational education but we think that it should be available to
all children through secondary schools and not just city technology
colleges, which we accept have done great
things.</p><p><a name="06071898000005"></a>I say to the noble
Baroness, Lady Morgan, that I have not said we oppose all academies. We
just want to see the evidence through a proper dispassionate study,
rather than rushing headlong. Although some parents are very
enthusiastic in wanting academies in their area, in some areas parents
are rejecting academies. That is their choice and I would stand up and
fight for their right to make that
choice.</p><p><a name="06071898000006"></a>The noble Baroness
commented on Southwark. Responsible local authorities will of course
say yes to shiny new schools and millions of extra pounds and if
academies are the only way of getting those things for their local
children, they will grab them with both hands, and so they should. It
is their responsibility to do the very best for the children in their
area. There

to the establishment of the academy that she mentioned. Liberal
Democrat authorities have not been obstructive to the expansion of the
academy programme but when we have a policy like this, which is using a
great deal of public money, we want to see the
evidence.</p><p><a name="06071898000007"></a>I say to the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that if she wants to know Liberal Democrat
policy, she should ask a Liberal Democrat and not just believe what she
hears from somebody from another party. The PricewaterhouseCoopers
report&#151;</p><p><a name="06071898000008"></a><b><a name="06071898000096"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> It is what I read in <I>Hansard</I>
from the debates that took place in the House of
Commons.</p><p><a name="06071898000009"></a><b><a name="06071898000097"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> I accept from her that in this House,
as in another place, people from different parties will agree with
parts of what other people say, but the basis of the amendments we are
tabling is that we are asking for the evidence in a dispassionate
proper scientific study before we go any further with this programme.
If our request for such a report is not accepted, then on the
establishment of any academy we would like the local authority to have
to &#147;have regard&#148; and not just consult on the effect on
any other
school.</p><p><a name="06071898000010"></a>The
PricewaterhouseCoopers report made some of the comments the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, made but it also made other points that were
not so complimentary about some academies. I do not deny that
individual schools have achieved improvements. I would not want to take
one iota away from the achievements of the teachers, the governors, and
in particular the children. Others have not done quite so well. But you
cannot claim that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report is the
cross-cutting report we really need. If academies prove themselves,
such a study as I am asking for will give the Government their
evidence.</p><p><a name="06071898000011"></a>I also say to the
noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that the Conservatives have never tabled
the same amendments in this House as in another place if they were not
satisfied with the answers they were given. We were not totally
satisfied with the answers we were given, and that is why we have
tabled the amendments again and had tonight&#146;s useful
debate.</p><p><a name="06071898000012"></a><b><a name="06071898000098"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> I was trying to gently make the point
that a number of those amendments were Labour Back-Bench
amendments.</p><p><a name="06071898000013"></a><b><a name="06071898000099"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> I do not care where they come from if I
agree with them&#151;and I did agree with many of the amendments that
were tabled by Labour rebels in another
place.</p><p><a name="06071898000014"></a>I
welcome the statement the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, made that there is
no magic wand in terms of the academies. It was always going to be the
case that some of them were going to struggle with the situation they
found they took over from failing schools. None of us wants to support
failing schools to carry on failing but the PricewaterhouseCoopers and
the report 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1168"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that he quoted were looking only at the academies themselves. They were
not comparing them with similar schools that were given the same amount
of money. If any scientist had tried to publish a paper on this basis,
the peer review would laugh them out of the profession. If you are
going to say that the success of these schools is down to the form of
governance they have been given, you must be jolly sure that all the
other factors are the same and that the only difference is the system
of government. Otherwise it is just
hearsay.</p><p><a name="06071898000015"></a>I
have been accused of inconsistency in tabling both of these amendments.
As I mentioned earlier, Amendment No. 66 asks for proper study and
proper proof but we accept that even in your Lordships&#146; House,
the wisdom of our remarks is not always accepted and that we may not
get that amendment accepted. It is therefore perfectly consistent to
ask in Amendment No. 88 that if the programme is not halted pending
further proof, each academy application should be accompanied by the
local authority having proper regard to the effect on other schools of
the establishment of that
academy.</p><p><a name="06071898000016"></a>I have one or two very
small points to make.<I>The Orange Book</I> is blue-sky
thinking and does not represent Liberal Democrat policy. Also, we have
been criticised for continuing to put pressure on the Government but
that is our job. As an opposition party, we are here to put the
Government under pressure. If they are going to put a lot of public
money behind something, we must ask them to prove that the money is
well spent. That is the job we have to do as an opposition party,
rather than just lie down and have our tummy tickled like some domestic
pet. That is the job for an opposition party and that is what we will
carry on doing. I beg leave to withdraw the

brief.</p><p><a name="06071898000024"></a>Turning firstly to
Amendment No. 73, Clause 8 deals with proposals under Clause 7 relating
to community schools. The effect of this amendment is to make it clear
that regulations may prescribe matters which the Secretary of State
will take into account in deciding whether or not to consent to the
publication of proposals for a new community school in a
competition.</p><p><a name="06071898000025"></a>The clause as
originally drafted referred only to the educational standards of
authorities and individual schools and the extent of diversity among
the schools. This amendment will allow a wider range of factors

the Bill, and for these to be more easily modified following
consultation if this is felt
necessary.</p><p><a name="06071898000026"></a>Regulation 7 of the
illustrative regulations made available to the Committee indicates the
kinds of factors we have in mind. These will include the range of
curricular specialisms and the range of extended services offered by
schools, as well as the general standards of attainment and the range
of special educational needs
provision.</p><p><a name="06071898000027"></a>Government
Amendments Nos. 94 to 98, 100, 104 and 109 are technical and remedy
deficiencies in the drafting of the Bill. The only amendment of
substance which I should just say a word about is Amendment No. 97
which provides that a local authority may publish proposals for an
increase in the number of pupils admitted to a school. As it stands,
the Bill provides only for a local authority to propose an increase in
the physical capacity of a school. There may be circumstances in which
a local authority wishes to increase the number of pupils admitted to a
school without having to enlarge the premises significantly. This
amendment brings the Bill into line with existing legislation governing
school organisation, which recognises this distinction between a
physical enlargement and an increase in the number of pupils admitted
to a school.</p><p><a name="06071898000028"></a>Amendments Nos. 99,
101, 117 to 120, 124, 133 to 136 are to protect the assets and the role
of existing foundations that support schools. They follow extensive
discussions, in particular with the Church of England and the Roman
Catholic Church, which account for the majority of such trusts. They
give these trusts broadly the same protection as applied before the
Bill. I beg to move.</p><h5><a name="06071898000092"></a>6

am grateful to the Minister for speaking to these technical amendments.
As he said, some of them are in response to points that I made at
Second Reading in relation to how the proposals would affect Church
schools. I simply express the thanks of the Church of England, and
indeed the Roman Catholic authorities, for how he has responded by
introducing the amendments, which we believe address the points that I
raised. My AmendmentNo. 125 was originally in the group. I
have withdrawn it from the Marshalled List because, from conversation
with the officers of the department and in the light of reassurances
that we have been given, I do not think it is necessary to press
it.</p><p><a name="06071898000030"></a><b><a name="06071898000102"></a>Baroness

amendment. We have before us a group of 20 amendments, so I would like
to use this opportunity to make a few comments about how the Bill is
being handled.</p><p><a name="06071898000031"></a>The Government have got
themselves into a mess. To extract themselves, they are trying to
import the practices of another place into your Lordships' House
without any discussion or vote about the matter. When asked how many
days we needed for Committee on 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this very contentious Bill, we on these Benches said six. The Government
then imposed their own timetable and set four. They added another half
day, as they began to see that we were right. They are so anxious to
finish Committee before the Recess that they have imposed their own
guillotine, without any opportunity for your Lordships to vote on the
matter. They have tried all sorts of devices to curtail proper
discussion of the Bill, such as wanting to postpone Committee-style
discussion of certain sections until Report; wanting the House to sit
until midnight, which is totally contrary to what it has voted for; and
putting together enormous, unwieldy and often non-homogenous groups of
amendments. Indeed the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has degrouped his
amendments from the group of 16 amendments beginning with government
Amendment No. 158.</p><p><a name="06071898000032"></a>We are told that we are
not doing very well. That does not mean that we are not making good
arguments, raising important issues or doing our job of scrutinising
the Bill; it means that we are not getting through the business fast
enough. It is like, &#147;Never mind the quality, feel the
width&#148;. The Bill was not fully scrutinised in another place,
despite the time that it took over it. Whole sections were dismissed in
an hour on the last day. These Benches will play our part in helping
this House to carry out its traditional role of scrutinising every part
of the Bill, and looking into every corner to ensure fairness and that
vulnerable people are protected and human rights upheld. That is what
this House does well and, until it ceases to be our job, that is what
we will continue to do.</p><p><a name="06071898000033"></a>I hope
that the Government will consider the considerable co-operation that we
have already given and any co-operation that we may or may not give
over the next few days as not establishing any precedent that rides
roughshod over the rights and procedures of your Lordships'
House.</p>

Warnock:</b> I am not clear whether Amendment No. 97
means that the local authority will have the ability to insist on the
enlargement of a school, or whether the school will be able to refuse
to take more pupils. Perhaps particularly in the case of schools
mentioned under Clause 19(2) for pupils with special educational needs,
it seems important that the governing body and the head determine the
size of the school. It seems a great danger to think that, if a school
is successful, therefore it ought to enlarge its numbers, because a
school&#146;s character may be determined by the fact that it is
small. Will the Minister kindly clear that
up?</p><p><a name="06071898000035"></a><b><a name="06071898000104"></a>Lord

a note, which may be slightly hazardous. My understanding is that,
where the school is a community school, the local authority has the

another category of school, if the school is not amenable these matters

leave out
&#147;or&#148;</ul><p><a name="06071898000044"></a>The
noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 79, I shall speak to
another large group of amendments, Amendments Nos. 80, 82, 85, 86, 90,
93 and 102. Amendments Nos. 79, 80, 82, 85 and 86 relate to aspects of
school closures, mergers and consultations about mergers and closures,
whereas Amendments Nos. 90, 93 and 102 deal with issues arising from
alterations and expansions. I would like to speak first to that first
half of the group, and then to move the second
half.</p><p><a name="06071898000045"></a>Amendments
Nos. 79 and 80 relate to the special case of when two primary schools
merge, and seek to probe the Government&#146;s thinking on whether
that requires a competition to set up a new school. To reduce the
tensions that can result from the merger of an infant and junior
school, both schools are often closed and reopened as a new school with
a new name, rather than one school simply being taken over by another.
That matter was raised in a letter dated10 May 2006 to the new
Minister for Schools,Jim Knight, by Vernon Coaker MP on behalf
of one of his constituents. In his letter of response dated31
May 2006, Jim Knight explained the proposed regulations governing the
establishment of a community school and the criteria governing the
Secretary of State&#146;s consent. He
concluded:</p><ul><a name="06071898000083"></a>&#147;Proposals
for new schools would normally fall under the above procedures, but the
Bill does make provision in clause 9 for proposals for new schools,
including community schools, outside a competition with the consent of
the Secretary of State. We would envisage that mergers of infant and
junior schools would not normally require a
competition&#148;.</ul><a name="06071898000072"></a>The
letter was written after the current version of the Bill was published
on 25 May, and it is assumed thatit should have referred to
Clause 11 rather than Clause 9. Whichever clause was intended, it would
be helpful if the Minister could provide further reassurances about the
reorganisation of primary schools in that
regard.<p><a name="06071898000046"></a>Amendment
No. 82 relates to Clause 15(4). At present, that subsection relates
only to rural primary schools and largely re-enacts Section 70 of the
Education Act 2005, which we argued over at some length in this Chamber
about 18 months ago, just before the last general election. Section 70
of that Act was the result of a government defeat in this House and
required that, before making a proposal to close a primary school, the
relevant body&#151;the local education authority&#151;must take
account of the effect of the closure on the local community and
transport implications.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071898000047"></a>We argue that these criteria should be
applied not just to rural schools but to any local school. The knock-on
effects of closure need to be considered. There needs to be wide
consultation, not only with parents but also with local district town
and/or parish
councils.</p><p><a name="06071898000048"></a>Amendments
Nos. 85 and 86 relate to Clause 17 which is concerned with the closure
of special schools and seeks to extend the consultation required should
the Secretary of State avail himself of the powers granted by this
clause to shut a special school. Amendment No. 8 would provide that the
consultation should be extended to the parents of children attending
the school. Amendment No. 86 also provides that whenhe gives
notice of his decision under subsection (4) he sets out the reason for
his
decision.</p><p><a name="06071898000049"></a>In
Committee in the other place the Minister argued that both amendments
were unnecessary and that Clause 17(3)(d), which states that
consultation should take place
with,</p><ul><a name="06071898000087"></a>&#147;such other
persons as the Secretary of State considers
appropriate&#148;,</ul><a name="06071898000073"></a>might
be expected to include parents and children attending the school. We
respond that &#147;might be expected&#148; is not good enough.
Given the emphasis that the Government are putting on parents&#146;
views and preferences, and that they also regard the voice of the child
to be an important aspect of consultation, we feel that both should be
on the face of the Bill as
consultees.<p><a name="06071898000050"></a>The
Government also argued that having to set out the reasons for his
decision&#151;as provided in Amendment No. 86&#151;was an
unnecessary bureaucratic burden on what might need to be a hasty
decision in the interests of the health and safety of the children
involved. Again, the amendment does not demand any lengthy report but
merely that the reasons for the decision are given in at least summary
form when the notice is issued. For a Government who produce so many
unnecessary pieces of paper&#151;not to mention unnecessary
legislation&#151;I believe that this is not too much to
ask.</p><p><a name="06071898000051"></a>Amendments
Nos. 90, 93 and 102 deal with the issues arising from alterations and
expansions in schools. Amendment No. 90 is a probing amendment to
clarify that Clauses 18 to 23, which come under the heading of
&#147;Alterations to schools&#148;, include the physical alteration
of the school premises to accommodate more pupils and to add a sixth
form. Those cited in subsection (2) and (4) of Clause 18 are all
alterations to governance structures. But since much has been made of
encouraging successful schools to expand, it is to be assumed that such
expansions are indeed covered by these provisions of the Bill. What has
not been generally publicised is that any such expansion
requires&#151;as I understand from subsection (2)&#151;a community
school to become a foundation school. I seek clarification from the
Minister if that is the case. As we have made clear elsewhere, we have
little sympathy with this element of government policy and regret in
particular the shift away from governors representing the local
community, including elected parent governors, to a governance
structure which reflects the aims, aspirations and preferences of those
running the foundations.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1173"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071898000052"></a>We also seek further assurances from the
Minister about the role of Building Schools for the Future. When I
asked in Committee last week whether they would be using Building
Schools for the Future as a lever to encourage schools to become
foundation schools and to require them if they were to participate in
the programme to become foundation schools, the Minister said very
firmly that that was not the case and that there was no intention to
use that programme in order to push schools into foundation status. I
should be grateful if the Minister would reiterate that statement
because it is an important
one.</p><p><a name="06071898000053"></a>Amendments Nos. 93 and 102
argue a similar cause. In arguing the case about closures and the need
for consultation, I quoted previously the Ofsted report of October
2003, <I>The influence of school place planning on school standards and
social inclusion</I>. I do not wish to repeat what I read out
previously. In particular, the report warned that allowing popular
schools to expand to meet parental demand risks sending an already
struggling school into a spiral of decline. Perhaps I may repeat the
warning contained in the report: losing a school does not enhance a
community. Amendments Nos. 93 and 102 provide that, when expansion is
considered, the overall provision of education within the community as
a whole should be considered, not just the narrow interests of the
particular school or one section of the community. Clause 1 puts the
duty on LEAs to promote fair access to educational opportunity and to
enable every child to fulfil their educational potential. Yet allowing
a free-for-all expansion of popular schools, allowing other schools to
wither on the vine, does not necessarily promote fair access and can
result in the most disadvantaged being even more disadvantaged.
Amendments Nos. 93 and 102 ask, therefore, that when proposals for
expansion are being considered, the impact of that expansion on the
overall provision of education by the LEA as a whole and by other
schools in the area is taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06071898000054"></a>There are two important
aspects regarding further education colleges: the provision of
specialist vocational courses for 14 to 16 year-olds; but also for 16
onwards. Those further education colleges often provide a vital
facility. Schools do not have the specialist facilities to provide
vocational courses such as construction or hairdressing. It is
important&#151;I know that the Government are sympathetic to
this&#151;that where schools want to provide such specialist courses
they should seek to collaborate with the further education colleges
rather than seek to duplicate the facilities. Two sinks stuck in the
corner of a domestic science room and the taking on of a part-time
hairdresser are not enough to offer a course in hairdressing. It is
important that those children are trained using the good facilities
which often exist at further education colleges.</p><p><a name="06071898000055"></a>Many who move from
school to further education colleges do so because they have not
enjoyed school. What is surprising is how often they speak highly of
the courses they study at the further education colleges where they
retake their GCSEs, study for A-level and often do surprisingly well.
In that sense, further education colleges are a very important
second-chance saloon

sixth forms can have knock-on effects on the local colleges&#151;both
sixth form and further education colleges. It is important that those
knock-on effects are taken into account in considering the expansion of
schools. I ask the Minister to confirm the promise that his colleague
gave in the other place. On 25 April, Jacqui Smith
said:</p><ul><a name="06071898000084"></a>&#147;At present,
statutory guidance specifies that among those who must be consulted are
other local authorities and other schools who may be affected by the
proposals, parents and teachers in the area, local dioceses or national
faith groups, the Learning and Skills Council and any other interested
party, for example the early years development and child care
partnership when the proposals affect early years
provision&#148;.</ul><a name="06071898000074"></a>The next

need to be consulted. To put that beyond dispute, I am happy to give
the Committee an assurance that statutory guidance on consultation for

Learning and Skills Council. I hope the hon. Lady finds that assurance

Williams of Crosby:</b> Before the Minister replies,
I simply add my voice in support of Amendments Nos. 85 and 86. The
discontinuation of a special school is, in many ways, a very special
case. Parents of children with special educational needs often put
great weight on their relationship with the school and put a great deal
of work into trying to make that school and their child meet one
another&#146;s needs. While it may well be possible that the Bill
will deal with the issue of consulting parents, I see no real reason
why it should not say so. It would obviously be satisfactory and on the
whole comforting to parents if it did.</p><p><a name="06071898000058"></a>Amendment No. 86 requires the Secretary
of State to give reasons. I can think of no other case where there is a
stronger argument for reasons being given by the Secretary of State to
explain why a special school is being discontinued. In almost every
case this causes great concern and upheaval to the parents and the
children. Therefore, the fact that it is a central government
responsibility of the Secretary of State more than proves that in most
cases the Secretary of State is required to consider the issue very
carefully and should give full reasons for the action he is taking. I
hope therefore that on this non-party contentious issue the Minister
will consider whether he can accept these
amendments.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1175"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071898000059"></a><b><a name="06071898000107"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> I support AmendmentsNos. 85
and 86. We recognise that the SEN amendments would go hand in hand with
the measures introduced in Amendment No. 84 which would ensure that no
special school could be closed unless there are enough places of
sufficient quality to cater for the needs of those children that would
be displaced. I will be interested to hear what proposals, and I hope
reassurances, the Minister has to offer for the future of special
schools in this country.</p><p><a name="06071898000060"></a>We are coming to a
watershed in the debate on special educational needs provision, and I
look forward to a fuller debate on the matter in next week's Committee
debates. In the mean time, I hope the Minister can reassure noble Lords
that the Government have instigated a reaction to the Cambridge
University report, mentioned by myself and the noble Earl, Lord
Listowel, last week, and the Select Committee report released last
week.</p><p><a name="06071898000061"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos.
90, 93 and 102. Amendment No. 90 would explicitly
include,</p><ul><a name="06071898000089"></a>&#147;the
enlargement of premises and the establishment of provision suitable for
the requirements of pupils over compulsory school
age&#148;</ul><a name="06071898000077"></a>as an
alteration permitted under Clause 19. Such an amendment is unnecessary
since such alterations are not explicitly forbidden by subsection (4).
There is also a slight ambiguity in the amendment. It is not clear
whether Amendment No. 90 refers solely to the expansion and creation of
sixth forms or separately to the expansion of any school and the
creation of a sixth form.
<p><a name="06071898000062"></a>Amendment No. 93 prevents the expansion
of schools where this would prevent a local authority or school
carrying out a statutory duty or function. That seems to be slightly
contradictory to AmendmentNo. 90, unless it was intended that
Amendment No. 90 would make clear that such proposals were not
completely prohibited.</p><p><a name="06071898000063"></a>Amendment No. 102 would prevent the
approval of certain proposals involving school expansion. We believe
that the amendment is unnecessary as Amendment No. 93 would already
prohibit such proposals being carried out. Subsection (2)
ofClause 20 lists a number of provisions that may be made by
regulation. None of them allows for proposals to be automatically
forbidden. It would also be totally up to the discretion of the
Secretary of State whether such provision was made.</p><p><a name="06071898000064"></a>The amendments seem to
be based on the assumption that schools expand at the expense of other
schools. We need to examine why schools expand in the first place.
Surely it is because parents demand the best education possible for
their children. At present too many schools do not offer this. Choice
is a vitally important lever for raising standards in failing schools
because head teachers and governors will realise that if they do not
improve the quality of education, parents will be able to go elsewhere.
These amendments would undermine that choice. They would allow local
authorities to block the expansion of popular and oversubscribed
schools and, by extension, result in more pupils attending
undersubscribed failing schools.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1176"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071898000065"></a>The Prime Minister has said
that,</p><ul><a name="06071898000090"></a>&#147;you cannot say

<p><a name="06071898000066"></a><b><a name="06071898000108"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> Some perfectly legitimate issues have
been raised in the debate, and I hope that I can provide the
reassurances that have been
sought.</p><p><a name="06071898000067"></a>Amendments Nos. 79 and
80 seek to give local authorities the freedom to establish community
schools if they are formed by the merger of any two or more primary
schools which the authority proposes to discontinue. Local authorities
may seek to publish proposals outside a competition under Clause 10. I
can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the merger of a junior
and an infant school into a single school is exactly the sort of
situation where such consent may be granted under Clause 10. I should
apologise to her and to other noble Lords as my honourable friend Jim
Knight&#146;s letter on this issue should have referred to Clause
10&#151;proposals outside competitions with the consent of the
Secretary of State&#151;and not to Clause 11, which covers special
cases where a competition is never required; for example, nursery
schools.</p><p><a name="06071898000068"></a>Amendment No. 82 would
extend the additional requirements in respect of rural primary schools,
which was added to the present arrangements by an amendment to the
Education Act 2005 made by this House. It would extend those present
arrangements to all schools. The Government recognise, not least under
the influence of your Lordships, which was very plainly felt in a
government defeat, the particular importance of rural schools to their
communities, and we support and encourage their preservation unless
there are strong educational grounds for closure. This is why we
already have a presumption against the closure of rural schools in
statutory guidance to those who decide school organisation proposals.
In addition, we have the provisions in the Education Act 2005 which the
House inserted as factors that must be taken into account before any
decision can be made.</p><p><a name="06071898000069"></a>Those
considering making proposals to close any school will look at a range
of factors, including those set out for rural schools in the 2005
Act&#151;the impact on standards, pupil number forecasts, the pattern
of parental demand and levels of diversity&#151;in addition to the
factors set out in Clause 15. The body that takes the final decision on
such proposals will expect to see hard evidence and well reasoned
arguments for closure on these and a range of other grounds.</p><p><a name="06071898000070"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 85 and 86 to
Clause 17. I should make it clear that Clause 17 re-enacts provisions
giving the Secretary of State the power to direct a local authority to
close a maintained special school on a particular date when&#151;and
I stress this point&#151;it is considered that it is in the interests
of the health, safety or welfare of the children. I entirely 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1177"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accept the points made by the noble Baroness,Lady Williams,
about the need to have maximum possible engagement with parents in the
school community in all such cases. But this is a reserved power to be
used only when there are particularly vulnerable pupils at risk and it
would not therefore be appropriate to go through the normal local
decision-making processes that apply in other cases.</p><p><a name="06071898000071"></a>Clause 17, even in these limited cases
where there are particularly vulnerable pupils at risk and closure is
in the interests of the health, safety and welfare of the children,
allows for consultation with,</p><ul><a name="06071898000091"></a>&#147;such other persons as the
Secretary of State considers
appropriate&#148;.</ul><a name="06071898000080"></a>We
would expect that to include parents of children attending the school,
as indicated in the amendment. We believe it is covered, and I have
made it clear for the record how the Secretary of State would behave in
those
circumstances.<h5><a name="060718114000055"></a>6.30
pm</h5><p><a name="060718114000001"></a>We do not believe that
publishing statutory proposals for the closure of schools under the
clause would be appropriate, because emergency action may be needed
very quickly, and the normal length and scope of consultation may not
be appropriate because of the particular health and welfare issues at
stake when the Secretary of State decides to proceed to closure.
However, the clause already requires the Secretary of State to give
notice of the direction in writing to the governing body and head
teacher of the school. Before issuing a direction, not only should the
interested parties be consulted, as I have said, but a letter giving
the direction should clearly set out the reasons for that direction. I
believe that answers the other points made by the two noble
Baronesses.</p><p><a name="060718114000002"></a>On
Amendment No. 90, on post-16 provision, Clause 18 already specifies
that the prescribed alterations permissible under it may include
alterations of any nature except those listed in subsection (4). They
do not include the enlargement or the addition of a sixth form.
Subsection (3) says that prescribed alterations may include anything
that is not ruled out by subsection (4). Therefore, the objective,
which the noble Baroness seeks to achieve, is met by the
clause.</p><p><a name="060718114000003"></a>Furthermore, the
illustrative regulations made available to the Committee specify in
Schedules 2 and 4 that alterations such as the introduction or
expansion of sixth-form provision are among those for which proposals
must be published. Enlargements and the addition of sixth forms are
significant changes to school organisation for which consultation and
the publication of statutory proposals have long been required. This
will continue, and it will include consultation with the consultees
whom the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp,
listed.</p><p><a name="060718114000004"></a>Amendments Nos. 93 and
102 would, in effect, make it impossible for a school to expand unless
that expansion was endorsed by the local authority. I do not want to
get into the underlying issue of whether it is a good or a bad thing
for schools to expand, but I simply want to make it clear&#151;I
think this meets the noble Baroness&#146;s point&#151;that local
authorities already play, and will continue to play, a decisive part in

<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1178"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decision-making in expansion cases over and above one form of entry.
Indeed, their role will be enhanced under the Bill in that the Bill
abolishes school organisation committees and replaces them with local
authorities as decision-makers. The local authority must decide
expansion beyond one form of entry.</p><p><a name="060718114000005"></a>However, we do not believe that a school
should be required to have the consent of a local authority before it
can submit expansion proposals. That would negate our intention to give
schools the capacity to expand appropriately to meet the needs of
pupils and parents. We think that schools, including community schools,
to which the noble Baroness referred, should be able to submit
proposals to expand. Any category of school may publish proposals to
expand and to add sixth-form provision. The local authority then
decides but, in a dispute between a school and the local authority, the
school may in prescribed circumstances appeal to the adjudicator when
proposals are turned down by the local
authority.</p><p><a name="060718114000006"></a>I hope that responds
to the points made by the noble Baroness to her
satisfaction.</p><p><a name="060718114000007"></a><b><a name="060718114000057"></a>Baroness

competition in those
circumstances.</p><p><a name="060718114000008"></a>I
have one more question to ask the Minister. My Amendment No. 90 was a
purely probing amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, seemed to
take it at face value, but it was intended simply to be probing,
because it was not totally clear whether physical alterations were
included. Am I right that Clause 18(2) means that if a community school
submits a proposal to expand its sixth form, any such alteration must
involve &#147;one ... of the following&#148; alterations in
paragraphs (a), (b) or (c)? That would imply that it has to become a
foundation school.</p><p><a name="060718114000009"></a><b><a name="060718114000058"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> The complexity of Clause 18 eludes me at
the moment. I will respond to the noble Baroness afterwards. The
problem is how the clause relates to the other clauses that also give
other powers to other schools to publish proposals. The fundamental
point is whether all categories of schools can publish proposals to
expand post-16 provision. The answer is yes, they can, and they must be
subject to statutory
consultation.</p><p><a name="060718114000010"></a><b><a name="060718114000059"></a>Baroness

Lords.</p><p><a name="060718114000017"></a>During
our consideration of the Bill, we have heard some truly inspiring
speeches from all sides of the Committee and, indeed, from the Minister
on what constitutes education. Members of the Committee have talked
about reaching academic and sporting potential, about children with
special needs, about learning social skills, about a positive ethos,
about developing creativity, and about education being a force for
social good.</p><p><a name="060718114000018"></a>I do not consider
any of these qualities necessarily to be brought about by faith
schools. I have tabled the amendment because I know that there are
concerns on all sides of your Lordships&#146; House about the
potential expansion of the number of faith schools under the umbrella
of foundation schools. I am a humanist and an associate of the National
Secular Society, so it is obvious where I am coming from. However,
other noble Lords do not share this stance and will have other things
to say. I believe that those of us who are concerned share a similar
view; an expansion of faith schools could divide communities when we
should be trying to unite and integrate them. Reports on Bradford and
Burnley from the noble Lords, Lord Ouseley and Lord Clarke of
Hampstead, respectively, pointed out forcefully the need for young
people to feel more integrated. Lord Ouseley&#146;s report
states:</p><ul><a name="060718114000050"></a>&#147;Some young
people pleaded desperately
for&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="060718114000042"></a>more
cultural and social
interaction&#151;<ul><a name="060718114000052"></a>&#147;to
overcome the negativity they feel is blighting their young lives and
leaving them ignorant of other cultures and
lifestyles&#148;.</ul><a name="060718114000043"></a>Where
better than in schools to do that? The Muslim researcher and journalist
Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has pleaded for schools to represent fairly the
society in which we live
without,<ul><a name="060718114000053"></a>&#147;breaking
it up into minority groups aided and abetted by the
state&#148;.</ul><a name="060718114000044"></a>Ninety-six
per cent of respondents to an online poll conducted by a Radio 4 Sunday
programme in October 2005 thought that &#147;faith schools breed
segregation&#148;. Diverse faiths can be, and are, celebrated in
schools and all benefit from learning about other cultures and from
mixing with a variety of
peers.<p><a name="060718114000019"></a>What about the
parents? My school governing body has parents of three different
faiths, which is of enormous benefit to the school. Parents of
different cultures organise, contribute to and mix at social events.
They benefit, the children benefit and the school benefits. I
understand the historical reasons for faith schools, which was

on Second Reading. However, that was then and this is now, where we

that foundation schools will increase the number of faith schools?
Non-religious schools have been closing to reopen as faith schools.
Eight&#151;one in three&#151;of the new academies are controlled by
religious interests; three of them replaced non-religious schools. This
expansion represents a huge public subsidy. I hope tonight for
clarification on the right reverend Prelates&#146; Amendment No. 128,
on the dispersal of land, and how that will work. It is very worrying
that the expansion of religious schools may well decrease job
opportunities for non-religious professionals. I would seek
clarification from the Minister on the right reverend Prelates&#146;
Amendment No. 129. What is taught in religious education may not be
broad and balanced, and admissions may be carried out on the basis of
religion. I am told that faith schools get good academic results. Any
selective school gets good academic results. A study by the think tank
Iris in 2005 showed that many faith schools take in pupils whose family
circumstances are very different from the neighbourhoods in which they
live. One school, with only 10 per cent of children receiving free
school meals, was in a postcode area with more than 45 per cent on free
school meals. One faith school had much vaunted GCSE results. In fact,
this relied on small class sizes and only six pupils taking GCSE. I am
told that faith schools increase parental choice. Choice is rarely
possible in small communities. In larger ones choice is often at the
expense of others. Faith schools choose their pupils and proliferation
of such schools will decrease choice for other parents unless they are
prepared to join, or pretend to join, a
religion.</p>

<p><a name="060718114000021"></a>I mentioned ethos. I
simply do not believe that faith is a prerequisite of positive ethos.
Ethos depends on a variety of things: pupil intake, parental support,
good teaching, a good pastoral system, links with the community and
parents, and so on. I go back to my main concern about faith
schools&#151;that they separate children out at an early age, when
children should be learning to live together for the sake of a
harmonious society. I believe that we take great risks when we
segregate children and deny them a broad
education.</p><p><a name="060718114000022"></a>I
move on briefly to Amendment No. 205, which is longer than my remarks
will be. This is about assemblies and collective worship. Inclusive
assemblies can quite clearly have educational value, not least in
building a collective ethos by bringing a school community together.
They can contribute greatly to pupils&#146; spiritual, moral, social
and cultural development. Many schools provide such assemblies, but the
current law, which requires &#147;collective worship&#148;, is
against them in this regard. The Ofsted review of secondary schools in
England published in 1998 noted the widespread non-compliance with the
requirements for collective worship and remarked that it &#147;raises
questions about the&#148;
1988</p><ul><a name="060718114000054"></a>&#147;Act and its
interpretation, and in particular whether schools in a broadly secular
society can or should bring their pupils together in order to engage in
worship&#148;.</ul><p><a name="060718114000023"></a>What will
the amendment accomplish? It would replace the requirement to conduct
&#147;collective worship&#148; with a requirement to hold
assemblies that would further pupils&#146; spiritual, moral, social
and cultural education. Teachers, including non-religious teachers, can
and do use assemblies to demonstrate 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1181"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that moral values and responses to ultimate questions of existence can
be inclusively framed. I have done it myself when a teacher. A reform
of the law would encourage such good practice. Sometimes people will
insist that all matters spiritual must be religious, but this is not
the official position. Ofsted&#146;s <I>Handbook for the Inspection
of Schools</I>
states:</p><ul><a name="060718114000051"></a>&#147;Spiritual
development relates to that aspect of inner life through which pupils
acquire
insights&#148;</ul><a name="060718114000045"></a>into
what is &#147;of enduring worth&#148; and which is characterised by
the qualities that I spoke of earlier. If the law on worship in
assemblies is changed, new guidance issued under the new law would
contribute to better sharing of good practice in the provision of
inclusive and educational assemblies, and would represent a new
entitlement for pupils that could command wide consensus, quite unlike
the current requirement to provide collective worship. I beg to
move.<h5><a name="060718114000056"></a>6.45

Flather:</b> I feel that we are at a crossroads. It
is time for serious decisions. We have to look ahead 10 or 15 years and
see what kind of society we are going to create. We already have a
divided society. We already have gross underachievement among many
ethnic minority groups, not least Muslim boys. Instead of addressing
the needs of those who are underachieving so badly, we are saying that
we should put them in separate schools, that we should create a
separate, apartheid school for them. Nobody else is going to go to that
school. It will be a self-imposed apartheid, which is even
worse.</p><p><a name="060718114000028"></a>It is time to consider
how we can provide for the religious needs of all pupils in a school
that has pupils of different faith groups. It is not impossible to
provide. In any case, I do not believe that it is the school&#146;s
responsibility entirely to provide for the faith of a child. It is
largely parents and the religious institutions that should be caring
and providing for that aspect. The most important thing to remember is
what faith schools have done in some parts of the United Kingdom, what
we have seen in Scotland and particularly Northern Ireland. We are
still seeing it there, where the great movement is towards integrated
schools. Why is there that movement? If faith schools were needed in
Northern Ireland, we should certainly not be embarking on that
road.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1182"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718114000029"></a>I find it completely confusing when I
think that in 10 or 15 years some young people will not have grown up
together and may not meet each other until they go to work. As it is,
we have a lot of problems of integration, of coming together and of
sharing. If we separate children from the age of five, I do not think
that they will be able to cope very well. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey, asked, will we have a cohesive society? We have to consider the
needs of everyone, including the children, and that children from
different faith groups may require more attention paid to their faith.
If we all shared in each other&#146;s faith and the teaching of each
other&#146;s faith, we would all be the better for it. Quite
honestly, I find that the major principles of all groups are not so
different. If we learnt from each other, maybe that would bring us
closer together. I make a plea for bringing us closer together, not
separating
us.</p><p><a name="060718114000030"></a><b><a name="060718114000065"></a>Baroness
Tonge:</b> I support the noble Baronesses, Lady
Massey and Lady Flather, in tabling this
amendment.</p><p><a name="060718114000031"></a>I
hope that I understand some of the Government&#146;s reasons for
wanting more faith schools. Certainly there is an issue concerning
money. If a group is prepared to put up some money for the
establishment of a school, that could be very welcome, although I would
rather that the taxpayer paid that money because I believe that
education is the most important service that any state can provide for
its people. However, I can understand the
reasoning.</p><p><a name="060718114000032"></a>I can also
understand that because Anglican and Catholic schools exist, we must be
fair to other faiths. I was born and bred an Anglican and I believe
that we should all recognise the tremendous contribution that the
Christian faith has made to education in this country. I suspect that
there were times in this country when education would have died out
altogether but for the churches that kept it alive. I hope that people
will always recognise that.</p><p><a name="060718114000033"></a>To
be fair to the people of this country, we should surely ask the
Government not to extend the privilege of faith schools to all other
faiths in our communities, but to say, &#147;Without abolishing our
existing faith schools, how can we make them cater for the needs of the
entire community?&#148;. I suspect that someone in the debate today
will say, &#147;Many of them already do&#148;; and that is quite
true. There are many Anglican and Catholic schools that cater for all
religions in their communities. That is a very good thing, and I have
no criticism of it. However, to use their existence as an argument for
extending other faith schools is very dangerous. The noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, argued very eloquently that faith schools have a better
ethos or achieve better results than non-faith schools. I would contest
that view, because the people who send their children to faith schools
are often selective and much more supportive parents than parents in
non-faith schools may
be.</p><p><a name="060718114000034"></a>The
Government are giving us reasons for allowing other faith groups to
fund schools, to make capital available to have other faith schools in
this country, but surely the Government must feel a little afraid that
in future generations, if not in this one, it will lead to a

Northern Ireland the flames were fanned by the existence of different
faith schools. Surely, the Government must see that. Perhaps the
Minister will tell us what he proposes to do, if other faith schools
are set up in this country, to ensure that our communities are not
divided. For example, will he ensure that children of all faiths attend
Muslim schools? Are we going to insist that there should be a mix of
children in all our schools, or are we truly going to have the children
in our communities, sometimes from the age of five, divided in Muslim,
Catholic, Anglican, Hindu and Jewish schools? It is a recipe for
disaster. We must understand
that.</p><p><a name="060718114000035"></a>In
conclusion, I would like the Minister seriously to address this
question: what will the benefits be and how will the Government ensure
that our communities are not divided further by the existence of more
faith
schools?</p><p><a name="060718114000036"></a><b><a name="060718114000066"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Peterborough:</b> I apologise to the
Committee. I hope that I can now speak to my two amendments and to the
other amendments in this
group.</p><p><a name="060718114000037"></a>The first amendment
standing in my name and that of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of Southwell and Nottingham is Amendment No. 83. That would require
local authorities, when they consider whether to propose the closure of
a school, to have regard to the balance of denominational provision.
For some time there has been a clear expectation from the Government
that local authorities will preserve the denominational balance. The
Bill provides a good opportunity to place that expectation in primary
legislation rather than in regulations or guidance. That is
particularly important if, as is proposed by the Bill, school
organisational committees are abolished. From the point of view of the
dioceses of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, those
have been very good forums in which local authority members have
engaged directly with representatives of the Churches and listened to
their points of view. The world envisaged by the Bill will not provide
such obvious contexts for that
engagement.</p><p><a name="060718114000038"></a>Amendment
No. 129 would modestly extend the freedom of governing bodies of
schools with a religious character to appoint staff who will actively
support the ethos of the particular school. The first part of the
amendment would affect only voluntary-controlled schools, almost all of
which are Church of England schools. In the case of Roman Catholic
schools and roughly half of the Church of England schools that are
voluntary-aided, the governing body has a majority of its members
appointed by the Church locally, and new faith schools are also in that
voluntary-aided category. The voluntary-controlled schools have a
minority of governors appointed by the Church and are controlled, often
strongly as to their character and ethos, by the local authority. I
have to admit that the name is now a little curious because local
authorities do not have that kind of relationship with any school, but
the category remains.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1184"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718114000039"></a>Voluntary-controlled
schools have always been able to appoint up to one-fifth of their
teachers as so-called reserve teachers, in the same way as teachers are
appointed in voluntary-aided schools, taking into account their own
faith commitment and, therefore, their willingness to give active
support to the religious character of the school. At present the head
teacher of a voluntary-controlled or foundation school cannot be a
reserved teacher. Since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, it
has been possible for the governing body of voluntary-controlled or
foundation schools to select a head teacher on the basis of his or her
fitness and ability to preserve and develop the religious character of
the school.</p><p><a name="060718114000040"></a>If this amendment
is agreed, the governing body will be able to go further and appoint a
head teacher in the same way as a reserve teacher is appointed, being
selected directly on the basis of his or her commitment of faith. That
would happen only if the governing body decided that it should count
the head teacher appointment as one of its reserve teachers. Of course,
the amendment does not require that to happen, nor does it permit the
Church to impose this provision, since the Church-appointed governors
are in a minority&#151;usually consisting of only two or three. It
would, however, make it possible for a head teacher also to be a
reserve teacher.</p><p><a name="060718114000041"></a>The second
part of the amendment clears up an oddity that has become obvious since
the 2003 legislation. Under the Employment Equality (Religion or
Belief) Regulations, it has been possible for organisations able to
demonstrate a genuine occupational requirement in relation to a
particular post to appoint to that post, taking into account the
successful candidate&#146;s religion or belief. However, in the 1998
Act there is a bar against taking into account a candidate&#146;s
religion or belief when appointing support staff in a school with a
religious character. This amendment would remove that bar, which would
then allow a genuine occupational requirement to be applied if it could
be demonstrated in a particular case. The kinds of posts that we have
in mind are high level teaching assistants, clerks to the governing
body, non-teaching house staff&#151;all roles that carry a
considerable importance in relation to maintaining the ethos of a
Church school. The safeguards would be strong, the governing body would
need to agree it and it would need to be justified under the 2003
regulations. So much for my specific
amendments.</p><h5><a name="060718101000027"></a>7
pm</h5><p><a name="060718101000001"></a>I should
like now to make some brief comments on the amendment in the name of
the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen. This may initially appear of
little relevance to Church schools as it seeks to preserve the status
quo and not to close any existing religious schools. I nevertheless
hope that Members of the Committee will resist it, as I believe that it
would have a major impact, not only on the 7,000 or so existing Church
schools&#151;mostly Church of England and Roman Catholic&#151;but
also on local authorities. It is a matter of debate whether it would
have the effect desired by its supporters of promoting community
cohesion&#151;an effect of course which I wholeheartedly support.

community cohesion needs to be addressed in other ways.</p><p><a name="060718101000002"></a>The
Church of England has an established plan to expand its provision in
secondary education since<I>The Way Ahead</I>, the 2001 report
by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. His thesis was that with one in four
primary schools currently being Church schools, but only one in 20
secondary schools, we need to expand our secondary provision. Since the
publication of the noble Lord&#146;s report, 29 new secondary
schoolshave been opened or considerably expanded; always in
response to local demand and with parental andlocal authority
support. There are currently plans for 120 additional secondary
schools, the majorityof which will serve the more
disadvantaged communities.</p><p><a name="060718101000003"></a>As
the noble Lord, Lord Dearing&#146;s report made clear, Church of
England schools are intended to be distinctively Christian and
inclusive. We want them to make space for those of other faiths and for
those of none, as well as for Christian and local children. There is a
very good example in the diocese of Peterborough where we have recently
opened a Church secondary school in Northampton. It is sited in an
ethnically mixed area. It has a significant proportion of pupils from
ethnic communities and a variety of faiths. A number of leaders of
other faiths fully supported our initiative in opening the school two
years ago.</p><p><a name="060718101000004"></a>There have also been
changes in primary provision. Over the past five years, as primary
roles have fallen by 4.9 per cent, Church of England primary school
roles have fallen by only 1.7 per cent. That is because Church schools
are popular with parents and their number has consequentially increased
disproportionately. To prevent the opening of new faith schools, as
this amendment would suggest, would therefore potentially limit
parental choice&#151;a point that the noble Baroness has
recognised&#151;precisely when they are exercising it in favour of
such schools. Reorganisation within local authority areas always
involves Church schools, often involving the closure of some and the
opening of new Church schools. This amendment would therefore
effectively blight some local authority reorganisation.</p><p><a name="060718101000005"></a>In 2002, the House of Bishops publicly
declared its support for other faith schools. In recent years, there
has been a welcome increase to six Muslim schools in the maintained
sector, with perhaps 30 or 40 more to follow. There is a similar number
of Jewish schools. That is not in itself divisive. I believe that it is
rathera clear signal to the British Muslim and Jewish
communities that they are a fully accepted and important part of
British society. With a similar commitment to being distinctive and
inclusive, their existence is a move against extremism and, I believe,
for rather than against community
cohesion.</p><p><a name="060718101000006"></a>I shall turn more
briefly to the amendment relating to religious education and collective
worship. The Churches and the faith communities, including a
representative of the British Humanist Association, were closely
involved with the then Secretary of State in 2003-04 in developing a
non-statutory framework for religious education. In many ways we on
these Benches can see the argument for making it
statutory. 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1186"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>But it is a good piece of work and it is already having an impact on
local authority agreed syllabi. In the Church of England we are
committed to our schools basing RE on its provision.</p><p><a name="060718101000007"></a>In
February of this year, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Portsmouth in his capacity as chairman of the Church of England Board
of Education signed a statement with other Church and faith leaders
welcoming the framework and committing all our Church and faith schools
to teach sympathetically about other religions. In our view, now is not
the time, as the framework beds down, to make changes in legislation
affecting RE in schools of any kind. The time may come, but the
framework would need adaptation to make all its provisions work in a
Jewish, Muslim, Sikh or Hindu school. We would prefer to build
gradually on that recent, hopeful and very positive
development.</p><p><a name="060718101000008"></a>We
would also strongly support the retention of the current law on
collective worship, which we see as flexible and permissive. The right
reverend Prelate recently wrote to the Secretary of State in his
capacity as chairman of the Joint Education Policy Committee of
Churches. He asked the Secretary of State to enable trainee teachers
and those preparing for work as school leaders to be better trained in
understanding the opportunities that current law provides. We see it as
important that children and young people become familiar with the
language and silence common to many forms of public worship. They are
all likely to attend at the very least at some point in their lives a
funeral, a wedding or a baptism.</p><p><a name="060718101000009"></a>I believe that collective worship is a
shared experience. It offers children, young people and adults an
opportunity to participate in humanity&#146;s shared search for God
and, in doing so, builds community in and beyond the school. Collective
worship in most schools also provides the opportunity for students to
gain an awareness of worship and worship practices of faiths other than
their own. Above all, it provides shape and formation to that instinct
for prayer which is in all of us. Provision for spiritual and moral
development without the opportunity of prayer and worship would not
have that effect.</p><p><a name="060718101000010"></a>I have
already detained the Committee for some time on these important
matters, but I hope that Members will permit me one final comment
onthe amendment in the name of the noble Lord,Lord
Lucas, which seeks to impose restrictions on schools of a religious
character in terms of admitting pupils of the same faith as the school.
As I have already indicated, the Church of England is committed to
ensuring that our schools provide an education of the highest quality
within the context of Christian belief and practice. But it should also
be able to provide that education to all who seek it, whatever their
faith. In practice, many Church of England schools admit a majority of
pupils without any faith test. But it would be unfair if committed
practising Christians living some distance from the school, perhaps in
a poorer area, stood no chance of admission against children living
near whose parents whatever their belief have been able to afford a
house near the school. I believe that the amendment is a sledgehammer
that we do not need. We prefer to address the issue more
deliberately.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1187"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718101000011"></a><b><a name="060718101000028"></a>Lord

good intentions in tabling Amendment No. 81. They have all expressed
their concern about division in communities and children being brought
up separately. I should like to express my concerns on the amendment
and address some of the issues that have been
raised.</p><p><a name="060718101000012"></a>Until
about six years ago, less than 25 per cent of Muslim children in
state-run schools achieved five GCSEs at grades A to C when the
national average was about 48 per cent. I congratulate the Government
on the standard being raised to 38 per cent, but it is still not good
enough to meet the national average. I know that approximately 135
voluntary Muslim schools have raised the standard of education for
Muslim children. The pass rate in those schools is about 55 or 60 per
cent on average but there are six state-funded schools that are
achieving highly: 100 per cent in the case of Islamia; Al-Hijrah is
achieving 86 per cent; and the girls Islamic school in Bradford is
competing with Eton, Harrow and some of the 10 best British
schools.</p><p><a name="060718101000013"></a>Islamic schools have
raised the standard for Muslim children, who are achieving less than 25
per cent in five GCSEs grade A to C. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
talked about the problems in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley. I live in
the north and visitall those towns regularly and I know about
the disturbances that took place. I know that not a single student from
the Islamic or faith schools was involved in the disturbances. Yes, we
have segregation and, yes, we do have a division within the
communities. There are some state-run schools with 98 per cent ethnic
minorities from one ethnic group. I have gone to Rochdale and Bradford.
I have been to Oldham. We can go to Brixton or east London: there are
schools with 98 per cent of children from ethnic minorities or even
some with 99 per cent. It is not the religious divide that is dividing
the communities, but there are other divides that also need to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="060718101000014"></a>For instance, I
have been to the annual awards at the Islamic school Karamia in
Nottingham where they have linked with the local schools, where the
local schoolchildren, the headmasters and the councillors come to the
school and the children also go to the state-run school. There are many
who have established relationships with their local schools. They have
twinned with local schools or they have some sort of links with local
schools where they try to mix the children. The message that we want to
send is to make sure that children who come out of the schools become
good citizens. They know about their citizenship responsibilities and I
know that that is taught in Islamic schools.</p><p><a name="060718101000015"></a>We need to make sure that there is a
higher standard of achievement. I am telling your Lordships that the
standard of education in Islamic schools has risen. There is no
evidence that any of the fanatics, terrorists or extremists are coming
out of them. I go to many schools to give out certificates and I know
that the best students are coming out of them and going to
universities, and that is where they interact and integrate with the
wider community and they are at ease with it because that is what they
are taught.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1188"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718101000016"></a>When we talk about
parental choice, raising standards and responsibility within the
communities, I know as a Muslim that for 18 years the Muslim community
was trying to obtain state funding for Muslim schools. We did not
obtain it until there was a Labour Government. Thank God that the
Labour Government gave state funding because the Muslim community was
feeling as though it contained second-class citizens for 18 years
because we have Christian schools, Jewish schools, Sikh and Hindu
schools; there is no reason why Muslims cannot have schools that are
responsible, that raise standards and that make our children good
citizens.</p><p><a name="060718101000017"></a>I am sure that we
need to take initiatives to try to integrate our children more at local
level, but we have to do it in state-run schools first or in parallel
with them because we have those divisions in state-run schools too. I
hope that the Committee will resist this
amendment.</p><p><a name="060718101000018"></a><b><a name="060718101000029"></a>Lord
Baker of Dorking:</b> Before I speak to Amendment No.
146A, I want to comment on the speeches of the noble Baronesses, Lady
Massey and Lady Tonge, and my noble friend Lady Flather, who all spoke
eloquently in favour of secularism? That has a long and honourable
tradition in the debates on education in our country. But secularism
has never become very popular in our country for historic reasons. It
required the French Revolution to create anti-clericalism that led to
the exclusion of religious education in French schools. When new
countries set up their education systems, America also excluded
religious education from state schools.</p><p><a name="060718101000019"></a>But in our country, schools and religion
have gone together for centuries. The secondary school I went to, St
Paul&#146;s, was founded in the churchyard ofSt
Paul&#146;s. In those days&#151;1509&#151;it had a remarkable
foundation by Dean Colet, who said that 153 boys should receive free
education and they could come from all colours and creeds. That is a
remarkable statement for 1509. It is indicated clearly that there has
always been an inclusive nature in much of the Christian education in
our country.</p><p><a name="060718101000020"></a>My amendment
would say that when groups come together and seek to establish a new
faith school, permission will be given only if at least 30 per cent of
the children come from other faiths. That is not as it were the
ultimate argument that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, is making; it
is a different way of approaching the problem. I say that because the
points made by the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, have to be met. The ethnic
communities and the other religions in our country&#151;not only the
Muslims but also the Hindus, Sikhs, the Greek Orthodox and the
Jews&#151;have always felt that they should have some share, as it
were, which my amendment would still provide.</p><p><a name="060718101000021"></a>My point is that traditionally Anglican
schools have not been exclusive for a long time. I went to a state
Anglican primary school in Southport. We went to church twice a year.
We had a hymn and a prayer at the beginning of the day, but that
happened in every school in those days. There was no exclusion: my
closest friend was a Jewish boy and I learned about the Jewish faith by
going to his home in the evening 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and finding out how he prepared. We were all in together. I certainly
was not told that I was one of the elect and I was going to be saved by
going to that school.</p><p><a name="060718101000022"></a>Very few
Catholic schools are now exclusive. Originally they were, but I
remember visiting several Catholic schools when I was Secretary of
State, which included children from all faiths and no faiths, because
frankly they had run out of Roman Catholic pupils. I do not believe
that the two Christian faiths in this country are exclusive. They are
inclusive. I believe strongly that a separate education is not the
ideal way forward for our country at the moment. A separate education
based on faith means a separate status and eventually a separate
community. It is inevitable. In Northern Ireland, apartheid starts in
schools; 90 per cent of children in Northern Ireland still go to
separate faith schools and look what has happened there.</p><p><a name="060718101000023"></a>There is a growing opposition to more
exclusive faith schools. Trevor Phillips, who is the most eloquent
spokesman for racial and ethnic equality, has come out against them. So
has the National Union of Teachers. David Bell, the former chief
inspector, writing a year ago,
said,</p><ul><a name="060718101000026"></a>&#147;many young
people are being educated in faith-based schools with little
appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British
society&#148;.</ul><a name="060718101000025"></a>More
recently, the director of the Institute for the Study of Islam and
Christianity has also come out against them.
<p><a name="060718101000024"></a>Separate faith schools that are
exclusive are bad for both the majority community and for the minority
community. They are bad for the minority community because they
emphasise the separateness and the separate status that that community
has&#151;that is what they are there for. It might be ways of
handling themselves; ways of dress; all sorts of things, but they are
separate. They are not part of the wider responsibilities that David
Bell talked
about.</p><p><a name="060718106000001"></a>I
happened to listen to a broadcast on BBC Radio 4 when I was driving up
one morning about a fortnight ago, with a young man from Pakistan who
was visiting exclusive faith schools&#151;Muslim and
Christian&#151;and non-faith schools. This is what he
said:</p><ul><a name="060718106000047"></a>&#147;When I went to
school in the 1980 state schools like these didn&#146;t exist. My
parents were Pakistani immigrants&#151;education was to be my way out
of working in a factory like my dad. They sent me to a mainly white
comprehensive where I was one of a handful of Asians. At this point I
should be complaining about feeling alienated and excluded but the
truth is&#151;that school was the best thing that happened to me. I
learned how to socialise and talk to other kids&#151;unlike the Asian
boys who went to the all-Asian schools&#148;.</ul><a name="060718106000039"></a>That is an eloquent expression of
someone from a Pakistani background who experienced growing up in our
country.<p><a name="060718106000040"></a>There is
no doubt that the schools are highly exclusive. I have managed to get
through the internet the admissions policy of some of these schools,
although I am waiting for some others. I have only those from Islamic
schools. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, and hope he will
understand that I have nothing against Islam. As a practising
Christian, I have great respect for all other faiths. But

photographs; I do not think that that is done in other state schools.
There is one Islamic secondary school that
asks:</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60718-1007.htm"/>


<ul><a name="060718106000048"></a>&#147;Can your child
read the Qur&#146;an fluently? ... Has your child completed
reading the Qur&#146;an? ... How much of the Qur&#146;an has
your child read? ... How many Surahs of the Holy Qur&#146;an has
your child
memorised?&#148;.</ul><a name="060718106000041"></a>I do not
know whether the right reverend Prelate could tell us how many
Christian schools ask whether their pupils have read the Bible and how
many things they remember from it. The answer is none&#151;because
there is no exclusive questioning of that
sort.<p><a name="060718106000002"></a>Let us be aware of the
exclusive nature of the schools that are being established. Another
admissions policy that I have found states that the aim of the school
is to produce,</p><ul><a name="060718106000053"></a>&#147;total
Muslim personalities through the training of children&#146;s spirits,
intellect, feelings and bodily
senses&#148;.</ul><a name="060718106000042"></a>I
have nothing against that, but I believe that that instruction should
take place in mosques, synagogues, temples and churches. Until 1997,
that was the policy. The Government changed the policy, reversing the
policy of all previous Secretaries of State, including myself. On the
whole we resisted giving permission to exclusive faith schools. In my
time, I had no applications from Christian bodies but I had
applications from Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh bodies. I always found
good reasons why one could not give permission, and I believed that
that was the right policy to follow. The Government changed that
policy, which was a grievous and huge mistake, and successive
generations in our country will suffer from
it.<p><a name="060718106000003"></a>I should like to see the
sort of movement that is now happening in Northern Ireland, where there
is a movement to have integrated schools. One school that I have come
across is the Hazelwood integrated school, which has 40 per cent Roman
Catholics, 40 per cent Protestants and 20 per cent others&#151;other
faiths and no faiths. That is the sort of mixture that I am trying to
achieve in my
amendments.</p><p><a name="060718106000004"></a>Finally, I draw
your Lordships&#146; attention to the comments of a Nobel Prize
winner and one of our most distinguished academics, Professor Amartya
Sen, who was the master at Trinity and is now a professor at Harvard.
He won the Nobel Prize in 1998 for his work on economics of equality,
poverty and famine and on social choice theory. He is quite convinced
that the policy of separate and exclusive faith schools is wrong. I
have read that:</p><ul><a name="060718106000049"></a>&#147;What
grates on Sen is the idea that individuals should be ushered like sheep
into pens according to their religious faith, a mode of classification
that too often trumps all others and ignores the fact that people are
always complex, multi-faceted individuals who choose their identities
from a wide range of economic, cultural and ideological
alternatives&#148;.</ul><a name="060718106000043"></a>He has
said that:<ul><a name="060718106000050"></a>&#147;Being
defined by one group identity over all others ... overlooking
whether you&#146;re working class or capitalist, left or right, what
your language group is and your literary tastes are, all that
interferes with people&#146;s freedom to make their own choices
... I think there is a real tyranny there. It doesn&#146;t look
like tyranny&#151;it looks like giving freedom and
tolerance&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="060718106000044"></a>those
are the arguments that are
used&#151;<ul><a name="060718106000054"></a>&#147;but
it ends up being a denial of individual freedom&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1191"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718106000005"></a>Those comments are
very pertinent today. In our society, which is having a great deal of
trouble absorbing different groups, although we are making a better
fist of it than most other Western countries, to create exclusive faith
schools is fundamentally wrong. At a time when the world is faced with
two religious wars, it is extraordinary that we are prepared to
consider this. So I hope that your Lordships will give some
consideration to the amendment that I have tabled. I am not against the
sort of faith schools that exist in our country, but any new ones
should not be exclusive. They should have children from other faiths as
well.</p><p><a name="060718106000006"></a><b><a name="060718106000060"></a>Baroness
Whitaker:</b> In the interests of time, I restrict
myself to discussing the amendments in my name and that of the noble
Lord, Lord Lester, dealing only with the curriculum for religion,
beliefs and values. I add &#147;beliefs and values&#148; to
&#147;religion&#148; because the amendment would broaden the
statutory definition of religious education so that it better reflects
the more inclusive approach of the 2004 non-statutory national
framework for RE produced by the QCA, which the right reverend Prelate
commended. That framework referred to &#147;religions and
beliefs&#148; and explicitly recommended that &#147;other world
views&#148; such as humanism should be studied. I declare an interest
as the vice-president of the British Humanist
Association.</p><p><a name="060718106000007"></a>The
amendment goes on to require voluntary-aided schools with a religious
character to follow the locally agreed syllabus for RE rather than
their own, putting them in the same position as voluntary-controlled
schools with a religious character. By the way, the reference in the
Marshalled List should be to Schedule 19 to the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998, not Schedule 8; it is a misprint. I hope that that
makes it clear that we are not in any way seeking to deny parents with
children at voluntary-aided faith schools the right to have their
children receive religious instruction, but are seeking to ensure only
that all children in all maintained schools have an entitlement to know
broadly what the range of accepted religious and non-religious beliefs
are all about.</p><p><a name="060718106000008"></a>Of course, not
all locally agreed syllabuses are as broad, balanced and inclusive as
they might be, but at least they are subject to an overall structure
for the diverse views that they should introduce children to, and they
will, one hopes, become even more inclusive as the influence of the
non-statutory national framework on RE trickles down to the local
committees that set the RE
syllabuses.</p><p><a name="060718106000009"></a>In an ideal world,
there might be a national curriculum subject of beliefs and values that
educated all our children about all our important religious and secular
beliefs, underpinned by a thorough education in the universal human
rights that the UK has committed itself to in the international human
rights instruments. That would be the national basis from which
different religions and beliefs would take their own path in the
curriculum.</p><p><a name="060718106000010"></a>As
it is, we have citizenship education, which includes some human rights
education as a part of the national curriculum, and religious education

curriculum. It is the fact that RE is not a part of the national
curriculum that this amendment seeks to mitigate. That is why
voluntary-aided faith schools do not need to follow the locally agreed
syllabus of RE as other maintained schools do, but may follow a
syllabus of their own. It also means that the quality of locally agreed
syllabuses across the country is fairly patchy, with no common
standard. So, requiring voluntary aided faith schools to follow the
agreed local syllabus rather than their own would at least mitigate
what might be the effects of allowing some faith schools to teach an
unbalanced curriculum of religious education, something that many
people fear. It would ensure that our children have the opportunity to
know what the full range of our heritage of values and beliefs is while
learning the particular perspectives of their
own.</p><h5><a name="060718106000058"></a>7.30
pm</h5><p><a name="060718106000011"></a><b><a name="060718106000061"></a>Lord
Skidelsky:</b> I support the
non-exclusive version of the faith school amendment moved by the noble
Lord, Lord Baker. He made a powerful argument against complete
separation, but at the same time he did acknowledge the powerful case
made by the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed. I should like to say a few words
about that, but here I must take issue with the noble Baroness, Lady
Flather. I always hate to disagree with her, but in this case I think I
must. It is no solution to the problem of under-achieving Muslim boys
to force them into low-achieving, multi-faith or no-faith schools. Many
Muslim parents and other parents who choose faith schools do so not
because they want to preserve their family religion, but because they
are fed up with the quality of education they would otherwise be
getting in state schools. This illustrates the point that parents
choose faith schools because they want a good education for their
children and faith schools are much more likely to provide it. I agree
with the point made that they should not be
exclusive.</p><p><a name="060718106000012"></a>In principle, of
course everyone should rise together, but equally, highly motivated
minorities should not be held back by majorities. As for the
integration argument, the best way to integrate Muslim and other
minorities is to get as many as possible into the middle class, and the
quickest way of doing that is up the educational escalator. I would not
mind so much if people had a period of relatively separate education
provided that they could mingle together at university and there find
their role in British society according to their abilities. That is why
I support a moderate version of the faith
school.</p><p><a name="060718106000013"></a><b><a name="060718106000062"></a>Baroness

lessons&#148;, but taught as beautiful myths, as stories to be
believed in only by a credulous society living in a world before
science as we now know it began. Now, thousands believe them and are
being taught to believe them. Biology teachers at a sixth form college
have told me that many of their students say that they will learn the
theory of evolution in order to get their A-levels and go on to higher
education, but they know very well it is false and that God created the
world in six days.</p><p><a name="060718106000015"></a>The usual
answer to the question, &#147;Is creationism taught in faith
schools?&#148; is &#147;no&#148; and that what is taught is the
national curriculum requirement, the theory of evolution. Those
replying usually fail to add that creationism and/or intelligent design
is taught alongside it as a viable option, or taught in religious
education classes. Professor Steve Jones, addressing the Royal Society,
has said that to give creationism and evolution equal weight in
education is,</p><ul><a name="060718106000055"></a>&#147;rather
like starting genetics lectures by discussing the theory that babies
are brought by
storks&#148;.</ul><p><a name="060718106000016"></a>The Roman
Catholic and Anglican Churches have no problem with evolution, as they
have none with the descent of man. Fundamentalists of almost all faiths
refuse to accept this and therefore want their children to subscribe to
it too. The Seventh-day Adventist school in north London became in 1996
the first school run by a minor Christian denomination to receive state
funding. It teaches Darwin because it is obliged to, but teaches
creationism as well, as do some Muslim schools and a Hasmonean school
which educates more than 1,000 Orthodox Jewish students. The director
of Jewish studies at the school has made it clear that he would prefer
Darwin to be dropped from the national
curriculum.</p><p><a name="060718106000017"></a>I have been told by
a child attending one of these schools that we have nothing to fear
from global warming because God had promised that the Flood would never
be repeated. When students learn that God created the world in six
days, they will also hear the extremely sexist viewpoint that a woman
was responsible for bringing sin into the world. In the face of fossil
and dendrochronological proof, some creationists insist that the earth
is 4004 years old and appear to believe that pine trees in California
may seem to be nearly 10,000 years old only because God put the rings
in their trunks for some obscure purpose intended to deceive mankind.
Professor David Read, vice president of the Royal Society,
Britain&#146;s leading scientific academy, has
said:</p><ul><a name="060718106000051"></a>&#147;The Royal
Society fully supports questioning and debate in science lessons, as
long as it is not designed to undermine young people&#146;s
confidence in the value of scientific
evidence&#148;.</ul><p><a name="060718106000018"></a>Surely
the teaching of creationism and such views as I have just mentioned,
even when presented alongside the theory of evolution in a cynical
attempt to comply with the national curriculum, is done plainly to
undermine young people&#146;s confidence in proven scientific
evidence. Are we in danger of entering a phase of existence in which,
thanks to the encouragement of fundamentalism, to believe in
creationism is the norm while to accept as truth evolution and the
descent of man is an eccentricity?

Earl of Onslow:</b> I rise to support my noble friend
Lady Flather, but I also have difficulty with supporting her. That may
sound slightly schizoid, but if we go back to the Book of Common
Prayer, the Authorized Version of the Bible and Shakespeare, those were
the great works which were taught in Church schools before state
education came along. The Church of England primary school in our
village is a totally excellent and tolerant institution. The Roman
Catholic school, whose prizes I gave out some years ago, is another
excellent school in Guildford. What I suspect has happened is that we
avoided the clash to which my noble friend Lord Baker
referred&#151;the clash between the Church and the state as happened
in France. It was a vicious argument that lasted for 100 years and
ended in total victory for
secularism.</p><p><a name="060718106000020"></a>However,
because the Churches produce such good and tolerant schools, we think,
&#147;What a good idea&#148;. I also suggest that the Muslims, the
Jews and the Roman Catholics are saying that they want to follow the
good example of the Church of England in its contribution to education.
But the dangers pointed out by my noble friend Lord Baker override
that. His speech on the admission criteria of some Muslim schools
struck me, first, as something which the great Muslim intellectuals of
Baghdad who translated from Greek into Arabic the principles of
mathematics, chemistry and algebra, certainly would have regarded as
profoundly intolerant. What my noble friend read out for the Committee
were the conditions of intolerance. The conditions in Northern Ireland
are those of intolerance. It is that intolerance and exclusivity which
is harmful to society. We have enough stresses in modern society, and
we have enough difficulties with people who come here with completely
real faiths that are not the same as what the country has been used to
for many years. We must, because we are a tolerant and a successful
society, adjust and ensure that we accept those arguments. What we
cannot do is to apartheid-ise anything. Ghettoisation would be nothing
but extremely bad, so, reluctantly, I come down to the view of my noble
friend Lady Flather. I can see the argument for the tolerance of the
Church of England system but, reluctantly, I come down to the view of
supporting her

the right reverend Prelate has spoken to this evening, concerns the
employment of staff in schools with a religious character. I hope that
the Minister will not feel inclined to accept the amendment, which
would mean that very good and competent teachers might face
non-employment. The idea that there should be arrangements under which
teachers, before being appointed, should be willing to accept the
religious colouring of the school in question is not acceptable. We
have debated this from time to time in this House, and I think that
there has been general agreement. Not all subjects have a religious
content, and it should be possible for a teacher of, say, mathematics
to still have a job at a religious school even though he may not
himself adhere to the religion of the academy or organisation
concerned. The amendment should not be accepted. Although it is perhaps
not what the right reverend Prelate intended, I am quite sure that if
it became part of the statute it would very soon become a practice
among those foundations and voluntary schools or schools with a
religious orientation. I hope that it will not be
accepted.</p><h5><a name="060718106000059"></a>7.45

how separate schools will further that aim, because the acknowledged
purpose of such schools is to inculcate religious beliefs in children.
The Church of England has declared that it aims to promote the Church
of England through its schools; Catholic schools promote the Catholic
religion and the aim of Muslim schools is to teach Islam. The
headmaster of the Islamia School, to which the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed,
referred, said that it was part of the aim of his school to inculcate
profound religious beliefs in the children&#151;I think that that was
how he 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1196"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>put it. That must move people away from the kind of ideals expressed in
the rabbi&#146;s letter. We live in a multicultural society, and I am
in favour of a multicultural society, but with a maximum amount of
integration. That integration must come from the schools. With great
respect, I do not agree withthe noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky,
that this can be left to the university stage&#151;the earlier the
better.</p><p><a name="060718106000025"></a>My second reason for
supporting the amendment is one that perhaps does not command more
widespread support. I have no objection to schools teaching about
religion, but it is wrong that schools should teach children to
believe. They should teach doubt, and they should teach critical
thinking. As a humanist, I respect the role of faith in people&#146;s
lives, and I know that many people have come to hold their religious
beliefs after long critical thought. But I am worried about the
attitude of uncritical acceptance, without regard to evidence, of
certain articles of faith, which is likely to be taught in religious
schools. Consider a debate about stem cells and whether one should use
embryonic cells or adult cells. That is an issue of evidence. Some
people may argue that perhaps adult cells could be sufficient and one
need not use embryos, but other people of a particular religion could
not accept the evidence if it showed that stem cells were more
effective and would uncritically accept that they should not be
used.</p><p><a name="060718106000026"></a>Consider the issue,
which is of great world importance, of the distribution of condoms in
Africa to prevent the spread of AIDS. The Pope has announced that it is
wrong, as have the evangelicals in America. The Muslims have announced
that it is wrong. I regard the policy that they advocate as a crime
against humanity, because it condemns hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of people to death from AIDS.</p><p><a name="060718106000027"></a>I do not think that we
should teach religion in our schools. The Americans have got it right.
We are essentially a secular civilisation, and Enlightenment values
have spread since the days of the Enlightenment gradually through our
society. To promote faith schools is a retreat from Enlightenment
values and is part of a current trend that I find deeply
disturbing.</p><p><a name="060718106000028"></a><b><a name="060718106000066"></a>Lord
Ahmed:</b> Before the noble Lord sits down, he said
that the founder of Islamia School said that that school teaches Islam.
The noble Lord gave the example of the rabbi who wanted children to mix
with different communities. I hope that the noble Lord is not
insinuating that Islam does not allow that. It is quite the contrary;
those who are taught in Islamic schools are very much taught to live
within a society that is multicultural and multi-religious and to
respect everyone
equally.</p><p><a name="060718106000029"></a><b><a name="060718106000067"></a>Lord
Taverne:</b> The point that I was making was that the
rabbi said that he wants his kids at school to play football with
members of a different religion,to sit beside someone of a
different religion and to go to school on a bus with someone from a
different religion, and that that will not happen in segregated
schools.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1197"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718106000030"></a><b><a name="060718106000068"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My not speaking until now gives me an
opportunity to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, who raised a
couple of points earlier in Committee. She said that all classes of
schools have failure&#151;I agree. As has been said, I chaired a
group that looked at the future of Church of England schools. That
caused me to look around and led me to the conclusion that any
justification for the expansion of Church of England schools should be
grounded in superiority of academic achievement. In a 400 to
500-paragraph report, only two paragraphs were addressed to that. In
them, we referred to a degree of failure. We mentioned two schools that
we had visited that were in special measures. We also acknowledged that
the Church schools lived in the same world as the rest of us. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Williams, rightly said, they depend very much on
getting the right leadership. We counselled the Church not to venture
into adding to the number of Church schools, especially as the policy
that we recommended was to expand, if at all possible, primarily in
areas of the greatest social and economic need. Those schools would
therefore be at the greatest risk of failure. I entirely agree with the
noble
Baroness.</p><p><a name="060718106000031"></a>Reasonable
academic performance is a necessary condition of being able
conscientiously to recommend an expansion, but that is not a
fundamental characteristic of a Church school. Rather, it is having a
certain outlook on life. Young people have the experience of living
within that community. However, we saw no evidence of any proselytising
and seeking to convert children to something that was foreign to
them.</p><p><a name="060718106000032"></a>Why then did we recommend
an expansion of Church of England schools? When I spoke about this
matter on the previous occasion, the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, shook
her head when I said that there was parental demand. We had obtained
some information on that, otherwise I might not have said it. If I
remember the figures correctly&#151;sometimes I do&#151;in 1996,
some years before we did our study, there were 1.3 applications for
every place in a sample of 80 schools, which is nearly half the total
of Church of England schools. By 2000, the figure had risen to 1.6. The
right reverend Prelate said that, while the rolls for primary schools
nationally had fallen by roughly 4.5 per cent, in Church of England
primary schools rolls had fallen by only a third of that, which is
further corroborative evidence. We should respond in education to
parents&#146; wishes. I understand that that it is a building block
of the policy of the Government and the Conservative Party. That was a
major element in the
report.</p><p><a name="060718106000033"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, or the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley,
referred to the Sutton report. The Sutton report stated that the top
schools were all characterised, whether they were faith schools or not,
by a low proportion of people having free school meals. It is true that
the faith schools were heavily represented in the top 200 schools, but
the social class question was distinctive, as it was with the other
schools. The report went on to point out that whereas the proportion of
different social classes in community schools reflected their immediate
community, it did not do so in the voluntary aided schools, even though
the overall proportions were the same. That is legitimate, 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1198"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because if the faith school is distinctive in wanting in its pupil
population a certain element, it has a wider catchment area than the
immediate community.</p><p><a name="060718106000034"></a>I would
have wished to have heard the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, before I spoke,
but as few people were speaking up for faith schools, I felt that it
was about time that we had a change of menu. I agree with the first
element of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, about
beliefs, as long as we can find a way of defining the main beliefs
rather than 1,001 beliefs. She will know what I mean. The other
amendments in the group refer to importing as a matter of statutory
requirement the use of an agreed curriculum into voluntary aided as
well as voluntary control schools. That should be an objective, but a
good deal of thinking and talking is needed beforewe move to a
statutory requirement rather than something that has been accepted by
the faiths and is gradually being adopted. We should not go about it
this week, but it is an objective that we might look forward to
meeting.</p><p><a name="060718106000035"></a>The issue of Muslim
schools has come up several times. The noble Lord, Lord Baker, referred
to the fact that Roman Catholic schools were originally exclusively for
Roman Catholics. I think that thatwas because they were
supporting an immigrant community. As time has gone by, they have
accepted a wider intake in the great majority of cases. It is not
surprising that, when there is a very small number of schools of the
faith of an immigrant community, those schools should want to serve
that community. The noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, said that there are 135
Muslim schools. That is a very small number and many of those schools
are very small. It is not surprising that immigrants should want the
same opportunity as the indigenous population to have their children
work within the framework of their parents&#146; faith. If there were
1,000 such schools, it would be a different matter, but the number is
small.</p><p><a name="060718106000036"></a>I was listening to a
lecture by Prince Hassan of Jordan a couple of months ago&#151;one or
two other Peers were perhaps present. He examined the reasons for the
world&#146;s great problems. Underpinning them all, as he said it,
was the divide in dignity. He was referring to his own people in
particular and their feeling that dignity is denied them. Similarly, in
our own community, we have to be very sensitive to the feelings of
those who have come to this country and who are often&#151;this is so
of Muslim families&#151;living on low incomes. The families contain
many more members than is normally the case. None of the adult members
of the family has a job and they live in overcrowded
conditions.</p><p><a name="060718106000037"></a>If it was the will
of Parliament in some way to block Muslim schools, that would be seen
as a profoundly unacceptable signal about their rights as members of
our civilisation and as a lack of acceptance of their right to dignity.
We should do well to ponder that. I have been into only a couple of
Muslim schools, but I have read elsewhere that many of the parents who
send their children there are not as well heeled as is typical of the
Anglo-Saxon community. They make a great sacrifice. They only pay low
fees, and that is reflected in what can be 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1199"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>offered them. If there was a bar on any more faith schools in the public
sector, the aspirations of quite a number of those schools to come into
the public sector and be properly funded with adequate and well
qualified teaching staff&#151;aspirations that have been encouraged
to some extent&#151;would be denied. The composition of the governing
body would not be widened as it otherwise would be. Even if the school
is voluntary-aided, it is always a local authority member.</p><p><a name="060718106000038"></a>For a time, the noble
Lord, Lord Baker and I had different roles in life and I knew where I
stood. He was the Minister and I was the chairman of a nationalised
industry who came and made a case to him. On the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, I am not speaking for the Church of England at all; I
am speaking for Ron Dearing. Of the hundred-odd Church of England
schools coming along, 30 per cent must be not of the faith of the
foundation. I would say, &#147;No problem, easy!&#148; I nearly
said that some might find it difficult to make up the number of the
faith. There are definitional problems, but for many long-established
faiths this would not be a problem. For the Muslims, however, it could
be. I would regret anything that would be interpreted in the Muslim
community as a rule that would bite on them but nobody
else.</p><h5><a name="060718125000080"></a>8

They would not be cheated. But if they did not get to 30 per cent, they

<p><a name="060718125000002"></a><b><a name="060718125000087"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> I understand. We have both made our
points, and I shall not pursue that matter.</p><p><a name="060718125000003"></a>I turn to divisiveness, which has been
mentioned again and again. I totally understand it. I do not think
bringing in Northern Ireland is a fair analogy. We could debate that on
another occasion; it is a rather different situation from that in
England. The more that faith schools are committed to pupils of their
own faith, the more they have a strong obligation to the whole
community to encourage respect for other faiths. They must import into
their ethos statement that the school offers active goodwill and
respect to fellow citizens of other faiths. They should seek
opportunities for joint activities with schools of other faiths, or
community schools where there are many of another faith. There is a
major responsibility to do that kind of thing, and not stay behind
closed doors.</p><p><a name="060718125000004"></a>Finally, if we
look back, although faiths say things that are unacceptable to many of
us and have made bad mistakes, a great body of good has been done. When
the state did not provided schools for the poor, who did? It was the
Churches&#151;and not just a few, but by the thousands. When the
state provided education in 1870, it had a tough job getting people to
move

done, and it would be sad if we turned our back on all that has been
achieved.</p><p><a name="060718125000005"></a><b><a name="060718125000088"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Chelmsford:</b> On Saturday, 10 days
ago, I was taking a school service in an independent school in my
diocese. The service began with contributions from Buddhist, Sikh,
Hindu, Muslim, Jewish and Christian pupils. I thought to myself,
&#147;In the context of a school with a clear Christian history and
identity, what a great experience for these pupils&#148;. I also
thought, &#147;Isn&#146;t it a pity that only those who can pay for
this education get that
experience?&#148;.</p><p><a name="060718125000006"></a>One of the
problems with this debate is that if you do not provide for what the
people want in the public sector, those who can afford it will pay for
it elsewhere. Those who cannot will find other mechanisms in their
community to make some provision for the needs of their families and
communities. We must come to terms with the fact that we are now a
multicultural, multi-faith society. Education must reflect that. We
cannot go on behaving as if a secular model will do. Understanding and
sympathising with what lies behind the amendments of the noble Lord,
Lord Baker, neither do I think that we can impose integration. We
cannot achieve it like that. Different communities are going to have
different educational needs in a multicultural society.</p><p><a name="060718125000007"></a>A crucial thing to be achieved is that
every facet of our multicultural community must have confidence in its
identity and history if it is to thrive. I live with that in my
diocese; I have the Borough of Newham, which is probably the most
multicultural borough in most of Europe. A multicultural society does
not work as a result of us all gradually becoming the same. It works as
a result of us enjoying the difference and learning to live good
neighbourly lives across the many faces of our community
life.</p><p><a name="060718125000008"></a>Education must reflect
that. While one understands, culturally, what lies behind these
amendments, some of them would have a damaging effect upon our capacity
to build that multicultural community, and build the next generation
with sufficient confidence to thrive in it. If that requires Muslim
schools, provided that educational and cultural standards are met and
the community is satisfied about that, they may be essential at this
moment in history for the flourishing of our multicultural society. We
have had it with Catholic and Church of England histories, and I can
take noble Lords to many places where the quality of those
contributions has been enormous. We should strive for every school,
whatever its character, to make a wholesome contribution to building
the welfare of the whole community. That is what it is about. If we can
understand that, we can be a little more relaxed about today&#146;s
diversification of education.</p><p><a name="060718125000009"></a><b><a name="060718125000089"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> I had better speak to my amendments in

I was enjoying listening too much rather than speaking.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1201"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718125000010"></a>To start where the right reverend Prelate
left off: yes&#151;on consideration and having listened to all the
arguments&#151;that is where I find myself. It is enormously
important that schools should make a contribution to their local
community and, where that is possible&#151;I take the arguments of
the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that that is less possible for newly
arrived communities than established ones&#151;they should open their
doors and aim to be multi-ethnic
schools.</p><p><a name="060718125000011"></a>The right reverend
Prelate will know that I have a continuing objection to the admissions
practice of some Anglican schools. As many will know, I edit <I>The
Good Schools Guide</I> so much of this passes in front of me. Frankly,
some Anglican schools are socially selective. They have set their
selection procedures so that not only do they get Anglicans but they
get middle-class Anglicans. I regard that as destructive. I think that
view is shared by most of the Bishops&#146; Benches. As I said at
Second Reading, I would be delighted to support any moves from the
Bishops&#146; Benches to give them more power to bring these schools
into line. Many more Catholic schools do the same thing or are entirely
religiously selective. It is time the Catholics joined the rest of
us.</p><p><a name="060718125000012"></a>From many Catholic friends
and relations I sense that there is a residual feeling of being apart
that comes from their Catholic education and from many centuries of
persecution. It is time that ended. The way to end it is to follow the
route that has been followed by most Catholic independent schools,
which is to admit a pretty large proportion of non-Catholics. One
thinks of the Catholic schools in the middle of London where there is a
great shortage of good education. They are incredibly selective on
grounds of religion. The London Oratory and many others effectively
exclude large parts of their local community, even the quasi Catholic
community.</p><p><a name="060718125000013"></a>I was brought up in
a religious family and on Don Camillo. The advice of the Lord to Don
Camillo that he must baptise Peppone&#146;s child, whatever
Peppone&#146;s attachment to communism, is entirely the right
attitude. Certainly, when it comes to Church schools, I would be quite
content, as would many of us&#151;I include myself as, having been
brought up on religion, I have abandoned it&#151;for my child go to a
Church school. Indeed, I would value the philosophy that goes with such
a school; I would value that being part of her life.</p><p><a name="060718125000014"></a>Looking at schools that are essentially
secular, such as Camden School for Girls, one can see how much they
benefit from large Muslim populations which lend them a very strong
moral tone. That is one reason why Camden School for Girls has
succeeded. One&#146;s child can benefit in many ways from being in a
religious atmosphere, which is why a non-religious person might wish to
have access to such a school. Therefore, I have a strong objection to
the continuance of mainstream Catholic and Anglican schools that
practice total insistence on one religion. During Report or Third
Reading, I would very much like us to adopt an amendment that would
open up those schools.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1202"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718125000015"></a>I understand that some of the newer and
smaller communities will want their own schools and they may feel that
their security is bedded in those kinds of school. Where there are only
a few, it does not hurt too much. The small collection of Jewish
schools in London is tolerable, although I have found it very difficult
to deal with the graduates of some of those schools who refuse to break
bread with me because they feel that doing so will make them unclean. I
find that a difficult attitude to have grown up with; I do not believe
that they would have grown up with that attitude if they had gone to a
more mixed school.</p><p><a name="060718125000016"></a>I believe
that such schools are tolerable in small amounts. It is difficult for
the Muslim community because it is numerous. There are difficult
relations between Muslims and Christians throughout the world and the
Government appear to be conducting a love affair with the Muslim
brotherhood which I find extremely difficult to agree with. Naturally,
we have fears about these things. But, at the end of the day, what the
noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the right reverend Prelate said is right:
we have to be trusting in these matters. We know how these things have
developed in the past&#151;that is fine&#151;so let the community
and the community relations mature, but for goodness sake let us give
them an impetus. Let us say that any school which is selective on
religious grounds has to be prepared to admit, say, 25 per cent of
children from other faiths, even though they might not apply. Beyond
that, schools should have to make a real effort to bring those children
in to integrate with the local community; they have an obligation to
interact with other schools and other children of other faiths in a way
that might make it unattractive. A school which started off as 100 per
cent Muslim or Jewish or Scientologist or whatever and is still that
way in 15 years&#146; time might be invited politely to return to the
private sector.</p><h5><a name="060718125000081"></a>8.15

enjoyed hearing from those Members who do not have amendments in this
group. I believe this debate has demonstrated your Lordships' House at
its best. It seems a pity that we have been forced to have such a mixed
group of amendments and that we have to talk to them altogether. In
some ways, the discussion has been broken up a little because of

of view, about some of the comments that have been made by other
Members. I do not often find myself in total agreement with the noble
Earl, Lord Onslow, nor with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, but I agree
with both of them when they speak of intolerance and exclusivity being
characteristics that we should not encourage in our schools. Although I
have enormous sympathy with the concerns expressed by the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey, and by my noble friend Lady Tonge and others who
supported the first amendment

expansion of any more Church schools.</p><p><a name="060718125000019"></a>I am attracted by what my noble friend
Lady Tonge hinted at in her excellent speech; that there is an
alternative to the expansion of more Church schools and the right of
Muslim groups to have their own schools. That is epitomised by the
amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, which
is a compromise. People of faith make up a large percentage of the
community in this country and they have a right to have an involvement
in education. However, I would prefer that that involvement happened as
part of maintained community nonsecular schools. If they really do not
want to do that, I believe they have a right to have something
else.</p><p><a name="060718125000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Baker of Dorking, suggested a compromise which contained the
&#147;q&#148; word&#151;quota&#151;which I know many noble
Lords do not like, but I can give the Committee an example where I have
seen it working rather well. Last summer, I went to the small country
of Fiji and had a chat with the Minister of Education there. Fiji does
two things very well. One is playing rugby, which is why I was there.
The other is that it has integrated the ethnic Fijian and Indian
communities extremely well in its schools. I asked the Minister what
was the secret and she said, &#147;Money&#148;. The state says that
if you do not integrate, you do not get the money. That is a strong
indication that we should look at something along the lines of what the
noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking,
suggested.</p><p><a name="060718125000021"></a>I share the concerns
of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, about Amendment No. 129. I also
share the concerns of my noble friend Lord Taverne and his preference
for religion to be taught in the home or a place of worship rather than
in a maintained school, but that is an
aside.</p><p><a name="060718125000022"></a>The main reason for
rising is to speak to my Amendment No. 217A, which would allow pupils
aged 16 and over to choose to exclude themselves from acts of
collective worship rather than have to rely on their parents to do it
for them, as now. The Committee may have heard that the Joint Committee
on Human Rights is minded to look at this amendment with a view to
giving its opinion. However, leading human rights lawyers have already
given their opinions and they believe that there is no justification
for forcing young people to take part in a religious service with which
they do not agree. Freedom of worship, or non-worship in this case, is
a basic part of our rights as citizens of a free country, so I would be
surprised if the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Minister did
not agree with us. </p><p><a name="060718125000023"></a>Of course,
there is a case for a slightly different amendment&#151;one that
draws a line at the point at which a young person becomes competent to
make a decision for himself, but that may differ depending on the
maturity of the individual. That would be hard to decide without a
professional assessment of the individual, their maturity and their
competence to decide, which is why we have laid our relatively simple

work, pay taxes, manage his own money, get married, have children,
fight for his country and possibly even vote but not be competent to
absent himself from an act of collective
worship.</p><p><a name="060718125000024"></a>There have been some
high profile cases recently where young people have taken the matter
into their own hands. This week's <I>Times Educational Supplement</I>
has a story on its front page about some schools trying to impose their
religious values on young people. Some 100 pupils signed a petition
protesting at the decision to invite a pro-life campaigner to lecture
in a school where 17 young people were excluded for a day after they
refused to go to Mass and then had to undergo a re-entry interview.
Those practices are self-defeating. You cannot impose a religion on
anyone and efforts to do so will probably have the opposite effect. If
we want young people to take responsibility and act maturely, surely we
should respect their rights to decide for themselves on a matter such
as this.</p><p><a name="060718125000025"></a>I apologise to the
Committee that my amendment is not about the same issue as the one
which has been debated so fascinatingly this evening, but because we
have these enormous non-homogeneous groups of amendments, this sort of
thing comes up. I really felt that it was time that I spoke to my
amendment in this group, and I hope for a positive response from the
Minister.</p><p><a name="060718125000026"></a><b><a name="060718125000091"></a>Baroness

debate.</p><p><a name="060718125000029"></a>This has been an
excellent if emotive debate giving a good deal of food for reflection
hereafter. I will start in the spirit of peace and goodwill. After much
ministerial deliberation and reflection, we accept most of the spirit
of Amendment No. 217A moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, to
which she has just spoken. Pupils aged over 16 should be able to
withdraw themselves from collective worship rather than it being a
matter for parental consent, as it is for 16 year-olds and under. We
will discuss that further with our partners in the faith communities
and beyond, but I will seek to move an appropriate amendment at
Report.</p><p><a name="060718125000030"></a>Beyond that, we do not
think it right to reopen the whole issue of collective worship on which
there is a fairly broad consensus within the educational and faith
communities. I say broad rather than universal because nothing
pertaining to faith has universal consensus, and I deeply respect the
views of my noble friend Lady Massey on this issue. However, in the
context of the right of parents to withdraw their children, the
flexibilities that schools have in respect of the diversity of their
communities and the way that they conduct collective worship, we do not
see a case for a wider change.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1205"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718125000031"></a>I can respond to Amendment No. 83, in the
name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough, in an
equally consensual spirit. We certainly agree that anyone contemplating
proposals to close schools should consider the effect on diversity in
the area concerned and in particular if there would be a reduction in
the choice of schools with a religious character. Statutory guidance
makes it clear that in deciding proposals to close schools of a
religious character, the decision maker&#151;currently the school
adjudicator but it will become the local authority, to accompany the
school organisation committee&#151;should consider the effect that
this will have on the balance of denominational provision in the area.
The guidance goes on to say that parental demand and the standards of
the school should also be taken into account. We will aim to retain
these protections in the guidance to be issued under the Bill on which
we will consult
fully.</p><p><a name="060718125000032"></a>On
faith schools, two broad propositions have been put before us. The
first is that there should be no more within the state sector, which is
in Amendment No. 81 tabled by my noble friend Lady Massey. The second
is the proposition that there should be a greater diversity in
admissions, which was broadly the proposal of the noble Lords, Lord
Baker and Lord Lucas. These are issues on which there are strongly
held, passionate views on all sides, which the Government deeply
respect. Our job is to take a position which we believe to be
consistent with the public interest. I want to set out our position as
briefly as I
can.</p><p><a name="060718125000033"></a>Taking
the right to establish faith schools first, the Government believe it
would unacceptably infringe the rights of parents in local communities
to havea ban on the establishment of new faith schools.
Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights
provides for the right for parents to have their children educated in
accordance with their religion and other
views.</p><p><a name="060718125000067"></a>Throughout
the history of state education in this country, which of course
predates the ECHR, Parliament has recognised this basic right and has
accordingly agreed to the state funding of appropriately regulated
faith schools over and above allowing private faith schools which,
apart from closure for reasons of unacceptably poor standards, could
only be closed by a fundamental breach of the
ECHR.</p><p><a name="060718125000068"></a>But our
position is not just a question of the ECHR and historical commitments,
important as they are. My party has explicitly supported the right of
parents within proper local decision-making processes to establish
state-funded state schools within the current regulatory system. Our
2005 manifesto
said:</p><ul><a name="060718125000074"></a>&#147;Britain has a
positive position of independent providers within the state system,
including church and other faith schools. Where new educational
providers can help boost standards and opportunities in a locality, we
will welcome them into the state system, subject to parental demand,
fair funding and fair
admissions&#148;.</ul><a name="060718125000069"></a>And I
should add proper local consultation and
decision-making.<p><a name="060718125000070"></a>That
was the manifesto on which we were elected and we intend to stick to
it. I could not put the arguments better than did my noble friend Lady
Morris, who was Secretary of State when amendments to the 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1206"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Education Bill 2002 were debated in another place&#151;amendments
which, like some of those moved today, would have obliged state faith
schools to change their admissions criteria to restrict faith-based
admissions. My noble friend, who I was glad to see in her place
earlier, said:</p><ul><a name="060718125000075"></a>&#147;Our
starting point is that it cannot be naturally right in a rich
multicultural, multi-faith society that only Jews and Christians have
managed to get faith-based schools. We would not look at the leadership
of the country, find that it did not include many people of
Afro-Caribbean and Asian minority faiths, then turn round and say,
&#145;They cannot have wanted it&#146;. We would say that the
structure must work effectively, and it is in that sense that the
Government have promoted the wish for more faith
schools&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 06/2/02; col.
896.]</ul><a name="060718125000071"></a>My noble friend went
on to say:<ul><a name="060718125000076"></a>&#147;I want
these schools to be in the maintained sector rather than the
independent sector. I want them to be in the framework of
accountability and their performance data to be placed in the public
domain, as happens in the maintained sector. We do not all agree about
that, but it is a strong argument. I also want faith schools to have to
make available to their pupils the equal opportunities for boys and
girls that schools in the maintained sector are obliged to
provide&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 06/2/02; col.
901.]</ul><p><a name="060718125000034"></a>I could not put those
arguments stronger myself and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, made some
very good points about the benefits. Parents want such schools to be in
the maintained sector rather than in the wholly private sector. My
noble friend Lord Ahmed made an impassioned speech on this point and I
believe that his arguments merit close
attention.</p><p><a name="060718125000035"></a>In the maintained
sector, there are no fees. In the private sector, there are fees. In
the maintained sector, schools must operate any admissions criteria
that comply with the School Admissions Code of Practice. In the
independent sector, they do have to comply with the Disability
Discrimination Act but they have much wider latitude. In the maintained
sector, faith schools must have a governing body, including parent,
teacher and community representation. In the independent sector, that
is not the case. In the maintained sector, schools must employ teachers
who have qualified teacher status and head teachers who have the
National Professional Qualification for Headship. In the independent
sector, they need do neither. In the maintained sector, schools must
employ teachers according to the state School Teachers&#146; Pay and
Conditions Document and accord them paying conditions, including
pension rights on this basis. In the private sector, they need do none
of these things, and indeed pay rates often in private Muslim schools,
which my noble friend referred to, are much lower than they are in
state schools. These are all arguments which should be weighed in the
balance when local decision-makers
decide.</p><p><a name="060718125000072"></a>It is their decisions,
not the decisions of central Government, that hold whether it is
appropriate for Muslim schools to be able to enter the state
system.</p><h5><a name="060718108000118"></a>8.30

that non-Muslims would want to send their children there? It is that
exclusivity that worries one. Will the Government make sure that those
admission policies cited by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and my
hypothesis on the veil are not allowed, because that would be extremely
exclusive and offensive to the host
community?</p><p><a name="060718108000041"></a><b><a name="060718108000131"></a>Lord

us.</p><p><a name="060718108000042"></a>We do not support the
amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, although I
understandthe concerns that led to it. It is not clear to us
how the amendment would work in practice; if he intends to bring it
back on Report, as I think that he might, it would be useful for the
House to know more about what he intends. He referred to the two
Christian faiths; I am not a theologian&#151;I leave those matters to
my right reverend friends&#151;but I understand that there is one
Christian faith. That is an issue of some importance, because the
practical effect of his amendment is that schools should be required to
admit 30 per cent of pupils
who,</p><ul><a name="060718108000113"></a>&#147;are not
practising the religion of the
school&#148;.</ul><a name="060718108000099"></a>We need to
be clear what he means by the &#147;religion of the
school&#148;&#151;the denomination or the religion.
<p><a name="060718108000043"></a>There are some big issues here. I
highlight that problem, but there will be many others; in fact, a whole
set of practical issues will emerge in seeking to have quotas of the
kind that he intends. In the course of good legislation and good
government, those problems will be difficult to resolve, and we will
point them out if the amendment comes back on Report. If it were
passed, it would apply to every faith school. If we did not have
answers to many of those acute practical issues, it would be a severe
impediment to the implementation of the
law.</p><p><a name="060718108000044"></a><b><a name="060718108000132"></a>Lord
Baker of Dorking:</b> Perhaps the Minister&#146;s
officials will give some thought to my proposals. After all, the
Government are happy to impose a system of quotas for universities,
where they define the numbers quite precisely. I will have a go myself
at how the quotas in my proposals would work, but I am sure that his
officials could design it.</p><p><a name="060718108000045"></a><b><a name="060718108000133"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> We do not have any faith quotas in
respect of universities, and I cannot for the life of me imagine how we
would start to devise
them.</p><p><a name="060718108000046"></a>There is an issue about
the practicality of what the noble Lord proposes. I noted that, in the
course of the debate, he and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, appeared to
accept that some minority faith schools might not think that their own
requirements in terms of quotas applied. If that is the case, we would
need to have that view elucidated before any proposition was before us
that we could consider
seriously.</p><p><a name="060718108000047"></a>The
fact that we do not think it appropriate to introduce legislation of
this kind does not mean that we do not share the view of the faith
communities themselves that their schools should be inclusive,
including 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1208"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being open as appropriate to other faiths and taking very seriously
their obligations to have strong community engagement with all faith
and non-faith elements of their local community. An increasing
proportion of Christian faith schools are doing that, including
allowing a greater diversity of
admissions.</p><p><a name="060718108000048"></a>I shall briefly
point out two facts. Provisional figures as at January 2006 show that
21 per cent of children attending Roman Catholic secondary schools and
17.5 per cent of pupils attending Church of England schools are from
ethnic minorities, compared with 16.2 per cent for non-faith schools.
That appears indicative of a growing diversity of admissions to the
Christian faith schools, and does not by itself support an argument
that there is a serious problem of exclusivity. The figures in respect
of free school meals show the
same.</p><p><a name="060718108000049"></a>The research by Professor
David Jesson at the University of York shows that voluntary
aided&#151;that is, predominantly church&#151;and
non-voluntary-aided secondary schools taken as a whole show almost
identical levels of eligibility for free school meals which is a proxy
for deprivation and does not seem to indicate that faith schools are
discriminating against the
poor.</p><p><a name="060718108000050"></a>These are all issues to
be weighed in a further debate if the noble Lord, Lord Baker, were to
bring back his amendment. The Government could not possibly support
unworkable propositions which would seek to impose quotas against the
wishes of the faith communities and which we do not believe could be
fairly implemented in practice.</p><p><a name="060718108000051"></a>Amendment No. 208, in
the name of my noble friend Lady Whitaker, would require every locally
agreed syllabus for religious education to take account of the teaching
and practices of the principal &#147;beliefs&#148; represented in
Great Britain, including secular beliefs.</p><p><a name="060718108000052"></a>The current situation is that locally
agreed syllabuses must reflect the fact that the religious traditions
in Great Britain are in the main Christian while taking account of the
teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in
Great Britain. The agreed syllabus conferences which draw up RE
syllabuses for schools without a religious character are already able
to reflect the study of secular beliefs as part of a syllabus. Indeed,
my department&#146;s non-statutory framework for religious education,
which has been endorsed by all the major faith communities, highlights
opportunities to study and discuss secular beliefs as well as religious
beliefs.</p><p><a name="060718108000053"></a>The second part of my
noble friend&#146;s amendment would mean that all schools with a
religious character, including voluntary-aided schools, would adopt the
locally agreed syllabus unless parents request that they provide
religious education in accordance with the trust deed or tenets of the
school. To enforce such a requirement in respect of all faith schools
would be an infringement of the legitimate autonomy of voluntary-aided
schools with a religious character. However, the Government are glad to
note that the leaders of all the major faith communities agreed earlier
this year that they would ensure
that,</p><ul><a name="060718108000114"></a>&#147;schools with a
religious designation should teach not only their own faith but also an
awareness of the tenets of other faiths&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1209"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="060718108000100"></a>That path-breaking statement by the
leaders of all the major religions in our country bears citing more
fully in order to respond to the wider issues raised in the debate. The
faith leaders agreed that religious education should enable pupils to
develop respect for and sensitivity to others and in particular those
whose faith and beliefs are different from their own. It should promote
discernment and enable pupils to combat prejudice.
<p><a name="060718108000101"></a>Those are objectives we warmly endorse.
I believe that they will commend themselves to the
House.</p><p><a name="060718108000054"></a><b><a name="060718108000134"></a>Baroness

It has been a fascinating and a most encouraging debate. I shall need
conversations with many people across the House, in particular with the
noble Lord, Lord Baker, about his
amendments.</p><p><a name="060718108000055"></a>I am confused about
one or two matters. The right reverend Prelate said that we should not
impose integration. Does that mean that we should impose segregation? I
still think that faith schools can divide communities; and that is
dangerous. We have sometimes confused religious diversity with ethnic
diversity. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, I do not think that we
do any favours to children who come into this country by segregating
them. At my school, which is a multi-ethnic, multi-faith school,
children learn language and social skills rapidly when they come into
the school from abroad.</p>

<p><a name="060718108000056"></a>The
issue of parental choice for a faith school can be a choice for a nice,
white, middle-class school. We all know the contortions some parents go
through in order to get their children into such a school. My noble
friend Lord Ahmed&#151;again, I shall need conversation with
him&#151;said that he did not want to be divisive. Two things happen.
It may be divisive to send a child to a faith school in the community.
Alternatively, some children are moved from the community in order to
go to faith schools which are miles away. Either way, I do not think
that that is good for
communities.</p><p><a name="060718108000057"></a>On collective
worship, I agree with everything the right reverend Prelate said,
except the religious bits. I am sorry the Minister cannot accept this
amendment. I am certainly not implying that young people in Muslim
schools were involved in disturbances or become terrorists, and I am
not suggesting that the closure of current faith schools should be
attempted. We need to see where we take these amendments&#151;mine
and that of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and others&#151;on the whole
issue of faith schools in a community and trying not to
segregate.</p><p><a name="060718108000058"></a>Finally, I must say

these arrangements were the offspring of a private arrangement&#151;a
compact&#151;to seal the purpose that Government made in the wake of
the 9/11 disaster? Was that compact to be denied at all costs, never to
be disclosed, perhaps the hidden key to open the gateway to the

Such assumptions can be made only if there is no other explanation. As

decide these matters&#151;reflects the cross-party support of 58
noble Lords, who made the compelling assumption that these aircraft
were used for extraordinary rendition, even though the amendment was
defective. The noble Lord said it was, which I accept for other
reasons&#151;the evil not being in the state of the law sought to be
enforced. This was revisited during consideration of the Police and
Justice Bill.</p><p><a name="060718108000083"></a>The evidence of
Lieutenant General Brims to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in open
session appeared to accept that planes landed here with people aboard
for transport, but that there was no evidence at all that the purpose
was for extradition under these arrangements. In an agreed transcript
of other evidence from 27 March, it was stated that the Foreign
Secretary had made it plain that there is
no,</p><ul><a name="060718108000115"></a>&#147;evidence to show
that there are people on board those planes which do land here who are
being transferred for the purposes of extraordinary
rendition&#148;.</ul><p><a name="060718108000084"></a>May I respectfully ask
one or two question of the Minister, a veritable master of explaining
the inexplicable? I am not certain that it will be possible for the
Minister to answer. Why was clearance given to some of these planes to
land at military airfields in the UK? I am delighted to see a Minister
from the Department for Transport in his place, because the object is
to close clearance for these planes and that lies within the aegis of
the noble Lord. Is it accepted that the Department for Transport
instructed the CAA to give clearance for aircraft identified as on
charter to the CIA to land at civil and military airfields in the UK?
Did the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so instruct the Department for
Transport and, if not, at whose behest were such

of the purpose of the arrangements? Was any attempt made over five
years to discover the purpose of 185 flights?</p><h5><a name="060718108000120"></a>8.53

Archer of Sandwell:</b> My Lords, I offer my
congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, on securing this
important debate and on his patience tonight in waiting for the
starting signal.</p><p><a name="060718108000086"></a>I confess that
I was puzzled by the wording of his Question, since I hope that no such
arrangements as he describes have been made, but he has now resolved my
puzzlement. As the noble Lord said, this is part of an ongoing series
of debates, beginning with the Civil Aviation Bill, proceeding in
Committee with the Police and Justice Bill and no doubt continuing into
the future. Our time today does not permit an exhaustive argument. The
noble Lord opened the case with his customary clarity. In any event, it
would serve no purpose for me to repeat what has been said on previous
occasions. However, the noble Lord has afforded an opportunity to
examine one issue that has arisen
repeatedly.</p><p><a name="060718108000087"></a>The Government have
not sought to deny that the airspace and airport facilities of some
European states have been used or, rather, abused to render prisoners
in the custody of the CIA to countries where they were at risk of
torture. The evidence is overwhelming, as the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell, has explained. I am sure that the Government would not be
privy to any such practice in this country, but the question is whether
they are in a position to know what is happening. The Government say
that no special legislation is necessary here, because there is already
power for the police to enter and search aircraft using United Kingdom
airport
facilities.</p><p><a name="060718108000088"></a>On
4 July, in the debate in Committee on the Police and Justice Bill, my
noble friend Lady Scotland sought to argue that case. I apologise at
once to my noble friend Lord Triesman for springing this on
him&#151;I had not appreciated that he would be responding to the
debate and I do not expect an answer to some of my questions this
evening. My noble friend Lady Scotland mentioned Sections 8, 17 and 23
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Section 23 simply states that
the word &#147;premises&#148; in the Act includes aircraft. Section
8 provides that a justice may authorise a search if there has been a
serious arrestable offence and thereis likely to be relevant
material on the premises.Section 17 authorises a constable to
enter premises for a number of purposes, the principal one being to
make an arrest. My noble friend also mentioned Part III of the Aviation
Security Act. As I read it, that does not add any new powers to those
that the police already have.</p><p><a name="060718108000089"></a>My noble friend accused me of not having
identified a gap in the existing powers. I can identify a substantial
gap. If there is reason to believe that someone has been lawfully
arrested in the jurisdiction in which he was taken aboard the aircraft
but it is now planned to take him to a destination where he is likely
to be tortured, I am not clear under which of the provisions mentioned
by my noble friend power is 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1213"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>granted to the authorities to search the aircraft. It may be that the
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has given some thought to this matter and
can perhaps
assist.</p><p><a name="060718108000090"></a>My
noble friend Lady Scotland was kind enough to respond to my suggestion
that we could analyse this matter in a private meeting. It is no
one&#146;s fault that that has not taken place. However, perhaps in
his reply my noble friend can at least assure us that if the Government
are persuaded in due course that there is a question about the
existence of adequate powers, he will press the Government to seize an
early opportunity to rectify the matter by way of legislation; and I
realise that it does not lie entirely in his gift. It would be tragic
if we permitted someone to be subjected to torture by an
oversight.</p><h5><a name="060718122000033"></a>8.57
pm</h5><p><a name="060718122000001"></a><b><a name="060718122000037"></a>Baroness
Ludford:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord,
Lord Campbell of Alloway, for introducing this debate on a particular
aspect of extraordinary rendition. My interest is that I am the
vice-chair of the European Parliament&#146;s temporary committee on
extraordinary rendition.</p><p><a name="060718122000002"></a>First, like all EU and
Council of Europe states, the UK is under an international legal
obligation to ensure that everyone within its jurisdiction enjoys
internationally agreed fundamental rights, including protection from
arbitrary detention and torture. That obligation may be violated by
acquiescence or connivance in the conduct of foreign agents. Therefore,
there exists a positive duty to investigate substantiated claims of
breaches of fundamental rights. Those claims have been substantiated by
a great volume of credible testimony from victims, by flight records
and through judicial and parliamentary as well as journalistic
inquiries.</p><p><a name="060718122000003"></a>Secondly,
Council of Europe member states are bound by various multilateral and
bilateral agreements, such as defence, international civil aviation and
military bases agreements, but the obligations arising from those
treaties do not prevent states from complying with their human rights
obligations, and those treaties must be interpreted and applied in a
manner consistent with human rights
obligations.</p><p><a name="060718122000004"></a>Civil aircraft are
entitled to transit or land in the territory of a state that is a party
to the Chicago Convention without obtaining prior permission. However,
that state can search the plane or inspect certificates or other
documents, such as a passenger list. The fear is that extraordinary
rendition planes&#151;that is, private jets leased by the
CIA&#151;have sought to have it both ways; they have pretended to be
civil aircraft so as to escape the need for authorisation but they have
sought to enjoy the immunity from search and inspection that state
planes have. Amazingly, it seems as though some European Governments
may have allowed them that special double indemnity. Our own Government
may have turned a blind eye.</p><p><a name="060718122000005"></a>In
response to the report from the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in the
other place, the Government said that they &#147;expected&#148; the
United States to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory
or airspace&#151;a curious term. One would expect an insistence or a
requirement to seek permission.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1214"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718122000006"></a>Of course, in the
leaked Foreign Office memo of last December, it was admitted that the
Government did not know how often the US had sought permission for
rendition flights. What checks have the Government made of Ministry of
Defence records of civil flights that land at military airfields? The
Government have now acknowledged that the Chicago Convention allows
searches and requirements to land, but they refuse to lift a finger,
even though there are protocol allegations, to investigate this
properly.</p><p><a name="060718122000007"></a>International
instruments against torture require states to assert jurisdiction over
torture offences committed in their territories. If states facilitate
transfer of an individual to a state where he is at risk of torture,
they could be liable for complicity. Such assistance can consist of
allowing refuelling or granting overflight or landing rights. In
circumstances of overwhelming prima facie evidence, which I suggest
exists, of extraordinary rendition having taken place in and through UK
and other EU states, even if that evidence is not of a criminal
standard of proof, it is incumbent on the UK authorities to stop being
passive or turning a blind eye and to start living up to the European
and international legal and human rights obligations that British
lawyers contributed so much to drafting.</p><p><a name="060718122000008"></a>The UK must put itself in a position
where it can ensure that it complies with the legal obligation to
investigate torture and other breach of human rights allegations. I
suggest that the Government&#146;s response to the Foreign Affairs
Select Committee in the other place is inadequate. The Government
said:</p><ul><a name="060718122000029"></a>&#147;In the absence
of evidence of any renditions through UK territory or airspace ...
we do not consider Article 12 of the Convention Against Torture
requires us to carry out a further
investigation&#148;.</ul><a name="060718122000027"></a>There
is enough evidence, as the Joint Committee on Human Rights said. I hope
that the Government will tell us that they are now going to carry out a
proactive investigation. It is not enough to be passive or to be
wilfully ignorant. I suggest that that would betray this
country&#146;s reputation for upholding human rights
obligations.<h5><a name="060718122000034"></a>9.02

D'Souza:</b> My Lords, I, too,
thank the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for his kind words. I
congratulate him on securing this debate and on persisting in trying to
deal with this difficult and unacceptable business of extraordinary
rendition. This is not an issue that suffers from a lack of concerned
attention. To date there have been at least four major reports,
including those from the joint All-Party Parliamentary Human Rights
Group, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, the Venice Commission and
the Council of Europe. There are detailed briefings from Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch, Liberty and the International Bar
Association, among other human rights organisations. There is the
All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition and there is
comprehensive documentation of all the evidence to date from the House
of Commons Library. There are at least two ongoing journalist
investigations, and questions in both Houses of Parliament and several
debates have taken place in the past year. A case is being brought in
the US courts by the American Civil 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1215"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Liberties Union. An amendment to institute a mechanism to ensure that in
the future any suspicion is immediately acted on was, as has been said,
put forward in the context of the Civil Aviation Bill and is currently
in the Police and Justice Bill. Therefore, the topic is well researched
and the ground has been well covered in this
House.</p><p><a name="060718122000010"></a>All these reports,
questions, debates and briefings suggest that the UK and other European
countries are guilty of a degree of involvement in extraordinary
rendition of foreign nationals suspected of terrorist activity.
However, the issue that emerges is the large amount of circumstantial
evidence pitted against the Government&#146;s repeated assertions
that the UK has not and would never condone the practice of
extraordinary rendition. Those assertions of course are extremely
welcome.</p><p><a name="060718122000011"></a>But is that enough to
deter other countries from using UK facilities&#151;military or
otherwise&#151;to further their own methods of pursuing suspected
terrorists? As has already been said, logically, the possibilities are
that, first, whatever happens in other parts of the world,
extraordinary rendition has not in any way involved the UK either in
the use of facilities, top-level agreements or the intelligence
services because of a comprehensive and stringent refusal on the part
of the Government to be instrumental in it; secondly, UK facilities and
perhaps the intelligence services have been involved without the direct
knowledge of the Government; and, thirdly, the Government are aware
that extraordinary rendition has on occasion taken place using UK
facilities and intelligence services, but there is no, nor is there
likely to be, direct
evidence.</p><p><a name="060718122000012"></a>At
present the first possibility is the one that is put forward by the
Government. But that is increasingly difficult to maintain due to more
evidence emerging and the admission by senior judicial personnel that
many European countries have been guilty of allowing territory to be
used for extraordinary rendition. The European Union Justice
Commissioner, for example, is calling on Governments to make clear
their role in extraordinary rendition. The Swiss senator Mr Dick Marty
asserts that collaboration with the CIA is proven. The Council of
Europe Secretary General feels that blanket denials of involvement do
not constitute an adequate response and he calls for official
investigations.</p><p><a name="060718122000013"></a>If the second
possibility has any validity, the intelligence and airport services are
operating outside the law, which would constitute culpable ignorance on
the part of the Government. The third possibility is of course an
extremely depressing one and not at the moment a road down which
thankfully any of us have to go.</p><p><a name="060718122000014"></a>However, I have to
repeat the question: is it enough for the Government to assert their
adherence to the UN Convention Against Torture? I suggest not. There is
a strong suspicion of wrongdoing and the Government could easily damp
down those suspicions with actions designed to prevent any future
possibility of involvement in extraordinary rendition, which would at
the same time reassure the public of the UK Government&#146;s legal
and moral commitments.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1216"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="060718122000035"></a>9.06

Earl of Northesk:</b> My Lords, like other noble
Lords I congratulate my noble friend on securing this important debate.
In so far as it may be of relevant interest, I remind the House that I
am a green card holder and therefore sometime resident in the United
States. Given that my life straddles both sides of the Atlantic, I
begin by stating my firm support for the fight against terrorism. But I
am equally convinced that&#151;and despite this being a statement of
the obvious, I do not believe that it can be said often
enough&#151;we diminish and demean the virtue of that fight if,
however marginally, we resort to the tools and tactics of the
terrorist.</p><p><a name="060718122000016"></a>As to my noble
friend&#146;s Question today, I make no claim for any particular
expertise in relation to extraordinary rendition. Like most of us, I
merely rely on the odd news reports that have appeared in the media.
Rather, I come to the issue in my capacity as a delegate to the
Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE. As it happens, our annual plenary
session took place in Brussels the week before last and, as the
Minister will no doubt be aware, the resulting declaration contains a
number of resolutions adopted by the assembly. One in particular,
entitled &#147;Strengthening effective parliamentary oversight of
security and intelligence agencies&#148;, has special relevance to
today&#146;s debate.</p><p><a name="060718122000017"></a>After
due consideration by the full assembly rather than just in committee,
that resolution was amended by the addition of a number of new
paragraphs. Two of those are of concern. The
first,</p><ul><a name="060718122000030"></a>&#147;Urges all
participating States to ensure that their territory and facilities are
not used to assist rendition flights or to operate secret detention
centres, and to cooperate fully in the investigations conducted by the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European
Parliament into allegations about secret detention
centres&#148;.</ul><p><a name="060718122000018"></a>The second
chimes with the numerous requests that other noble Lords have made
tonight. It
again,</p><ul><a name="060718122000031"></a>&#147;Calls upon all
participating States to investigate promptly and thoroughly allegations
that their territory has been used to assist CIA-chartered flights
secretly transporting detainees to countries where they may face
&#145;disappearance&#146;, torture or other
ill-treatment&#148;.</ul><p><a name="060718122000019"></a>I
make no judgment as to whether those represent an accurate reflection
of current Foreign Office and/or government policy. That said, it is
worth pointing out that perhaps not surprisingly only the US delegation
was opposed to the insertion of the two new paragraphs and in fact all
members of the UK delegation, irrespective of their political
allegiance, voted for them. Indeed, tacit Foreign Office acceptance of
the substance of the paragraphs could perhaps be inferred on the basis
that the FCO officials present did not seek to make us aware of any
potential policy conflicts that acceptance of the amendments may have
contained.</p><p><a name="060718122000020"></a>That therefore begs
an inevitable question. So far as I am aware, the Government have
consistently refused to contemplate any inquiry into extraordinary
rendition in the UK. As the Prime Minister put it in December last
year:</p><ul><a name="060718122000032"></a>&#147;I have
absolutely no evidence to suggest that anything illegal has been
happening here at all, and I am not going to start ordering inquiries
into this, that and the next thing, when I have got no evidence to show
whether this is right or not&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1217"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="060718122000028"></a>Perhaps the best that
can be said about that statement is that at least the line is
consistent. And yet, in this context, the text of the resolution is
unequivocal in two important respects. It requires that all
participating states ensure that their territory and facilities are not
used to assist rendition flights and that all participating states
investigate promptly and thoroughly allegations&#151;that last is an
extremely important word&#151;that their territory has been used to
assist CIA-chartered
flights.<p><a name="060718122000021"></a>At its simplest,
therefore, can the Minister confirm that the Government as
representatives of an OSCE member will take the necessary action to
deliver on the terms of the resolution? Will the Government, in so far
as it is necessary so to do, ban access of rendition flights to UK
airports and airspace, and will they issue an urgent and thorough
inquiry into the matter?</p><h5><a name="060718122000036"></a>9.10

information.</p><p><a name="060718122000023"></a>The
evidence in the Marty report and, most important, because it concerns
this country's involvement, evidence unearthed by Stephen Grey, an
investigative journalist, of the kidnapping or arrest of people by the
United States&#151;that is, by the CIA&#151;and the transporting of
them, in order that they may be tortured, to countries that are less
squeamish about torturing people, may be purely verbal and
unsubstantiated by written statements, but it is nevertheless pretty
strong evidence and should be investigated immediately by the
Government. Pending such an investigation, I am asking the Government
to take steps now to prevent this country in future from playing any
part, however small, in such a repugnant
practice.</p><p><a name="060718122000024"></a>I
am not asking for a public inquiry. Public inquiries are very expensive
and take far too long. Besides that, I appreciate that such an inquiry
could compromise security by revealing secure information and sources.
What I am asking is that the Government take steps immediately to
prevent CIA rendition flights landing at any UK airport, whether civil
or military, whether to refuel or for any other purpose, or making use
of UK airspace. I do not think that it would be very difficult to do
that. It might involve someone boarding CIA flights to check whether
there were any trussed and manacled passengers on board. The Americans
might find this unacceptable, to which I would say, &#147;Hard
cheese. If you want fuel, or whatever else, you accept our conditions
or go elsewhere&#148;. There are limits to what crimes can be
committed or connived at in the name of
friendship.</p><p><a name="060718122000025"></a>Condoleezza Rice's
protestations of virtue leave me unimpressed. If the United States is
not guilty, it should have no objection to co-operating. But I believe
that the United States is guilty, and us with it, and it is up to us,
not Condoleezza Rice, to keep our house
clean.</p><p><a name="060718122000026"></a>I have

horrible practice&#151;I hope and believe behind the Government's
back. So far the Government have not wanted to know. I am asking the

matter and, above all, to take immediate action to prevent rendition

Earl of Sandwich:</b> My Lords, as we have heard,
there is overwhelming evidence that the UK, while protesting its
continuing support for human rights, is still concealing its own part
in this illegal practice. All of us here will agree that potential
terrorists have to be subjected to rigorous interrogation within the
bounds of human rights law, but in the interests of anti-terrorism, in
the months after 9/11 the UK, as a key coalition ally, ignored much
that was going on in Bagram airport and other US bases in the
region.</p><p><a name="060718125000037"></a>Whatever
we say on our own behalf, we seem to move in tandem with the United
States. It was years before our Ministers began to comment publicly
about Guantanamo, except in the well-known cases of British citizens.
When President Bush accepted that Guantanamo was no longer a going
concern, our Prime Minister and the Attorney-General followed suit. It
was a relief to all that the Supreme Court ruled that the military
commissions were not properly constituted courts, after months of
pretence and
pussyfooting.</p><p><a name="060718125000038"></a>Ministers can
depend on information and advice from their civil servants; the rest of
us can believe only what we are told by friends and sources we trust.
Let me recall briefly the case Binyam Mohammed al Habashi, an Ethiopian
asylum seeker who came to Britain in 1994 and was granted leave to
remain. For several years he lived in north Kensington. He was picked
up in Karachi in April 2002 and then began a cycle of interrogation by
Pakistan intelligence, the FBI, MI6 and others who suspected he was an
al-Qaeda terrorist. He was taken into US custody for rendition to
Morocco where he was beaten and tortured over an 18-month period before
being taken to
Guantanamo.</p><p><a name="060718125000039"></a>During one
interview, Binyam said that the MI6 officer was nice to him and gave
him a cup of tea, saying he was innocent and that he would soon be sent
home. Yet there is strong evidence that during the time he was in
Morocco his torturers were relying on and probably conniving with
British intelligence. The torture included many known and less known
unpleasant techniques, including the cutting of his genitals with a
scalpel. It is inconceivable that MI6 was unaware of his rendition and
torture, and highly likely that its intelligence contributed to it. He
has been languishing in Guantanamo ever
since.</p><p><a name="060718125000040"></a>On
those rare occasions when governments or law enforcement agencies admit
their mistakes, they still pretend to be on the side of the angels and
do so reluctantly. The EU Justice Commissioner, as we have heard,
admitted for the first time last month that rendition takes place on
European soil, and yet the UK is still in denial. The Minister said
rather surprisingly at Question Time recently that he did not accept

that there is enough uncertainty about the UK&#146;s moral position
to require a more open debate based on better analysis and detailed
enumeration of the facts. It is helpful that the Government are now
considering their reply to the reminder of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights of the UK&#146;s obligations under the UN Convention Against
Torture, but the Foreign Affairs Select Committee has been asking these
questions for months and is always told that intelligence has all the

rendition flights, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell
of Alloway, for focusing on the military airfields in his Question
tonight.</p><p><a name="060718125000043"></a>The Government have
confirmed that RAF Brize Norton and RAF Northolt have provided services
to some 14 CIA aircraft movements. I remind your Lordships of the
special nature of RAF Northolt. It is used for VIP flights, Royal
flights and ministerial flights. It has limitations on the numbers of
movements and heightened security because of the nature of the
passengers who use it. RAF Brize Norton is also an important transport
base where security is key.</p><p><a name="060718125000044"></a>It
is some 20 years since I was a station commander of an operational
Royal Air Force airfield, but I would be surprised if the procedures
for accepting visiting aircraft have changed much since that time. As
station commander, I would learn of the expected movements for the
following 24 hours at the early morning daily briefing. The station
commanders of RAF Northolt and RAF Brize Norton will know when these
flights happen; they will know where they have come from and they will
know where they are going to. The operations wing staff will have
checked whether it is appropriate to give clearance for landing and
refuelling, which will perhaps require reference upwards to group or
command headquarters or to the Ministry of Defence. These are
international flights, which means that Customs needs to be informed.
In sum, it is not possible for the Government to say that such flights
are just part of the routine facilities provided between friendly
nations.</p><p><a name="060718125000045"></a>My concern is that
military officers might be put in the position of assisting an illegal
flight and subsequently be liable to prosecution as a result. That

developments seem relevant. In Iraq, we see military personnel being
held to account if it is thought that they might have broken
international law. In Italy, two Italian intelligence officers have
been arrested over allegations that they assisted in the rendition of
Osama Mustafa Hassan to Egypt in 2003. Putting the two elements
together, I worry how long it will be before we see a Royal Air Force
station commander being investigated for providing facilities for CIA
rendition flights.</p><p><a name="060718125000046"></a>Can the
Minister tell us whether he would support an instruction from the
Ministry of Defence calling for all international flights by foreign
aircraft that land at military airfields to be inspected to ensure that
their passenger manifests are accurate and that there is no suspicion
of illegal activity? Perhaps the best way forward on this is through
the Committee on the Armed Forces Bill. We have tried it with the Civil
Aviation Bill and with the Police and Justice Bill; perhaps we can deal
with the military airfields question through the Armed Forces Bill.
Would the Minister recommend
that?</p><h5><a name="060718125000084"></a>9.22

Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my
noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway on initiating this debate in your
Lordships&#146; House.</p><p><a name="060718125000048"></a>As
your Lordships are well aware, by virtue of Article 3 of the United
Nations Convention Against Torture and Article 3 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, we are obliged not to return anyone,
whether resident in this country or rendered through it, to another
country where there is a real risk that they will be
tortured.</p><p><a name="060718125000049"></a>After much confusion
from the Government about the effect of international civil aviation
law, the issue as to whether the Chicago Convention prevents
investigations into civilian flights that are alleged to be involved in
extraordinary rendition has now been settled. The Government clearly
have the power to do so. The key question, therefore, is whether they
are under a duty to do so.</p><p><a name="060718125000050"></a>The
argument centres on what facts initiate that duty. At present, the
Government accept, in principle, that they would be willing to
investigate where there is evidence of extraordinary rendition flights
passing through the UK; but they have repeatedly denied that there is
any such evidence.</p><p><a name="060718125000051"></a>Until
passenger lists of chartered civilian aircraft are provided to the UK
authorities, nothing can be certain. However, the report of the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, at paragraph 168, states that there is
now,</p><ul><a name="060718125000078"></a>&#147;a reasonable
suspicion that certain aircraft passing through the UK may have been
carrying suspects where they may have faced torture ... This
reasonable suspicion is in our view sufficient to trigger the duty to
investigate ... the Government should now take active steps to
ascertain more details about the flights which it is now known used UK
airports&#148;.</ul><a name="060718125000073"></a>The
Government should explain to your Lordships tonight why they do not
believe that such steps are necessary. 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1221"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="060718125000052"></a>Regardless of whether
the Joint Committee on Human Rights is correct, the Government&#146;s
continued resistance to carrying out investigations risks undermining
public confidence in their assertions that the United Kingdom will
never condone, or be complicit in, activities relating to torture. The
Government must be seen to be doing all they can to show that the
United Kingdom is an active adherent to the rule of international
law.</p><p><a name="060718125000053"></a>Reliance on assurances
from the United States is not sufficient to resolve the issue. The
United States has taken a far more restricted view on what it defines
as torture. While it has retracted its extraordinary previous assertion
that the practice has to involve excruciating and agonising pain, it is
still unclear whether the view it takes of what constitutes torture
would match the test applied by countries such as the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="060718125000054"></a>Furthermore, when
assessing the risk of torture, it should be borne in mind that the
United States applies a more-likely-than-not standard. The United
Kingdom, by contrast, applies only a real-risk standard. So the United
States could argue that it is not breaking the law by sending
individuals to countries where there is only a real risk&#151;the
test that we apply.</p><p><a name="060718125000055"></a>The Opposition have
stated that the Government must establish beyond doubt that United
Kingdom territory or airspace has not been used for extraordinary
rendition, and we maintain this position. We accept the assurances of
the Foreign Secretary that the United Kingdom would not facilitate the
transfer of an individual from or through the United Kingdom where
there are grounds to believe that that person would face a real risk of
torture; but we are asking the Government to reconsider carrying out
investigations into these
flights.</p><h5><a name="060718125000085"></a>9.26

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> My Lords, I
welcome the opportunity which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway,
has given us to debate these issues today and I acknowledge the work
that has been done by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I shall deal
with what might be regarded in the House this evening as mundane
facts&#151;just facts. I do want to deal with conspiracy, even if it
is thought to be a more colourful approach. I have noted some of the
language that has been used in the House about this country:
&#147;the probable assumption&#148;, &#147;the well grounded
concern&#148; and &#147;the real suspicion&#148;. The noble
Baroness, Lady Ludford, referred twice to the fact that &#147;we turn
a blind eye&#148;. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, referred to
&#147;concealing illegal practice&#148;. Some of that language was
used also in the debate on Amendment No. 6 on 28 March, when the noble
Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, spoke, as he has more or less done
tonight, of a private arrangement to conceal the purpose in which Her
Majesty's Government were involved in the wake of 7/7 and which should
be denied at all costs.</p><p><a name="060718125000057"></a>The allegations that I
hear and the conspiracy that is hinted at, which has been followed by
the media and in this House, do not appear to be grounded in any real
evidence whatever. I say to the noble Lady,Lady Saltoun, that
no &#147;repugnant practice&#148; is conducted 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1222"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by this country. I do not accept the allegation of misbehaviour by this
country. I reiterate in the clearest terms that the Government have not
approved, and will not approve, a policy of facilitating the transfer
of individuals through the United Kingdom to places where there are
substantial grounds to believe that they would face a real risk of
torture&#151;our definition of torture and not that of the United
States. Accordingly, I can confirm that no arrangements have been made
at military airfields&#151;I shall return to this as I seek to all
the questions that were asked&#151;to refuel civilian aircraft with
passengers allegedly &#147;destined for extraordinary
rendition&#148;. As I said in an Answer from this Dispatch Box
recently, we have not been involved in extraordinary rendition. For
those reasons, I do not accept that there is a need for an
investigation. I do not accept that there is any evidence. I do not
accept that there is any conspiracy. The Prime Minister was right to
put it in terms.</p><p><a name="060718125000058"></a>That may well
not satisfy those who ask us to prove the negative&#151;that
something has not happened. But one can never prove that. That is never
a proper test of any kind of evidence. It cannot be done. I say to the
noble Earl, Lord Northesk, that there is in that sense nothing that can
be investigated that will satisfy anybody who adheres to such a
conspiracy theory. The Government have repeatedly made it clear that
they have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the
United Kingdom or the overseas territories since 11 September 2001.
There is no evidence of detainees being rendered through the United
Kingdom or the overseas territories since 1997 where there were
substantial grounds to believe that there was a risk of torture. The
Government do not deport or extradite any person to another state where
there are substantial grounds to believe that the person would be in
danger of being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment, or where there is a real risk that the death penalty will be
applied. This position reflects our obligations under UK and
international law, including the European Convention on Human
Rights.</p><p><a name="060718125000059"></a>Since before 11
September 2001, we have worked closely with the US to achieve our
shared goal of fighting terrorism. Noble Lords have been gracious
enough to say that that is important work. As part of that close
co-operation, we have made it completely clear to the US authorities
that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK
territory and airspace on every occasion, and that we will grant
permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord
with UK law and our international obligations and how we understand
them under the UN Convention Against Torture and the European
Convention on Human Rights. We are clear that the US would not render a
detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas
territories, without our
permission.</p><p><a name="060718125000060"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Ludford, asks why we have not, in her view, investigated
adequately. We have not investigated inadequately at all. We have not
let this country down; absolutely not. We have carefully researched the
question of US rendition via the United Kingdom. Jack Straw set out in
his Written Ministerial Statement to the House of Commons on 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1223"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>20 January the results of an extensive review of all our official
records back to May 1997. There were four cases in 1998 where the US
requested permission to render one or more
detainees&#151;</p><p><a name="060718125000061"></a><b><a name="060718125000098"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, I have no right of
reply. I only wish to remind the Minister that it is totally conceded
that the Government did not know. I have made that perfectly plain. I
have given material which suggests a high level of suspicion, as
recognised by certain independent authorities. My noble friend Lord
Kingsland seeks an investigation on that basis. That is the
issue.</p><p><a name="060718125000062"></a><b><a name="060718125000099"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I do not
accept that there is a high level of probability. Noble Lords opposite
are lawyers. As it happens, I am a probabilities mathematician, and I
do not accept that this is in any sense a level of probability. It is a
number of assertions for which there is no
evidence.</p><p><a name="060718125000063"></a><b><a name="060718125000100"></a>The
Countess of Mar:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
accept Toyber&#146;s dictum,
that,</p><ul><a name="060718125000079"></a>&#147;absence of
evidence is not evidence of
absence&#148;?</ul><p><a name="060718125000064"></a><b><a name="060718125000101"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I do not even understand the
question.</p><p><a name="060718125000065"></a>The term
&#147;rendition&#148; has been used loosely. Whether any particular
rendition is lawful depends on the facts of each individual case. The
records of the four cases I have mentioned showed that the Government
granted the United States&#146; request in two cases, and refused it
in the other two. In both cases where the request was agreed, the
individuals were transferred through the United Kingdom in order to
stand trial in the United States. There is no ambiguity in what
happened on those occasions. Where we are requested to assist another
state and our assistance would be lawful, we will decide whether or not
to assist by taking the circumstances into account. We would not assist
in any case if it would put us in breach of UK law or our international
obligations.</p><p><a name="060718125000066"></a>I say to the
noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, that there is no intelligence
involvement in this either. I have no reason to believe that any
government agency has acted in a way that does not conform to those
obligations. There has been no collaboration with the CIA, and no
responsibility for anything that might be claimed to have happened in
other
countries.</p><p><a name="0607192000002"></a>I
will not comment in detail on what the United States and Secretary Rice
have said. Those are matters of record in this House. In response to
requests for information about specific aircraft allegedly linked to
the rendition operations, the Secretary of State for Transport
published flight information held by or supplied to his department in
respect of those aircraft. The Ministry of Defence did likewise in
connection with the use of those aircraft in respect of military
airfields. On military airfields, the United Kingdom has given the
United States military and state aircraft clearance to overfly the
United Kingdom and to land at military airfields in the United Kingdom
without seeking prior permission. Where aircraft transit through 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1224"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>military airfields for refuelling, for example, passengers do not leave
the airfield; the airfield is required to record the registration
number, the outward bound destination, the names of the pilots, the
aircraft owner, but it does not record details of passengers. I think
that is as true of the landings which have been referred to at Brize
Norton or RAF Northolt. The noble Lord, Lord Garden, described the
process and the routines involved in that and I do not believe I can
add anything. I do not think there is any basis for investigating those
flights either. We have clear assurances that the United States will
not move people through this country or through its airspace on the
basis of extraordinary rendition.</p><p><a name="0607192000003"></a>It may be of interest to
the House to note that there are 3.5 million takeoffs and landings in
the United Kingdom and 1.1 million of them are non-commercial flights.
I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that the provision of
passenger lists on that kind of basis, without grounds for believing
that something is actually happening other than unsubstantiated
allegations,would be an extraordinary operation and one that
Ido not believe a Government of any party would
contemplate.</p><p><a name="0607192000004"></a>We have co-operated
fully with the inquiries into rendition by the Council of Europe and
the European Parliament, but neither Dick Marty&#146;s report of the
7 June nor any other document should lead to the conclusions that have
been drawn in this House. His report was entitled, <I>Alleged secret
detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of
Europe member states</I>. The interim report of the EP&#146;s
temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA
for transportation and illegal detention has also been looked into. I
ask noble Lords to have a look at the Foreign Affairs Select
Committee&#146;s fourth report on <I>Foreign Policy Aspects of the
War against Terrorism</I>, published on 2 July. The all-party report
concluded that although there has been speculation about complicity by
this Government in unlawful rendition,</p><ul><a name="0607192000036"></a>&#147;there has been no hard evidence
of the truth of any of these
allegations&#148;.</ul><a name="0607192000034"></a>That is
hardly a basis for feeling ashamed of our nation. It is neither a
police state nor a secret state.
<p><a name="0607192000005"></a>Our position on torture is absolutely
clear. We unreservedly condemn the use of torture and we work hard with
our international partners to eradicate this abhorrent practice. We
abide by our commitments in international law in every respect. On the
specific points about Benyam Mohammed al Habashi, referred to by the
noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, he was interviewed once by the security
services in Karachi in 2002, but the security services had no role in
his capture or in his transfer to Pakistan. There is no evidence that
they drew on or passed on matter to anyone and I do not believe that
there is any significant or substantial evidence or probability that
they did
so.</p><p><a name="0607192000006"></a><b><a name="0607192000038"></a>Baroness
Ludford:</b> My Lords, I think the
Minister said earlier that there was no evidence of any involvement at
all by British intelligence agencies. Is it not the case that during
the High Court case in March, concerning Bisher al-Rawi and Jamil
al-Banna, the High Court 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1225"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>established that the Government passed on to the United States
authorities, either directly or at least indirectly, information that
led to the illegal seizure and rendition to Guantanamo Bay of those two
men and that on that basis the Government, while not accepting any
legal requirement, accepted to make representations certainly on behalf
of Bisher
al-Rawi?</p><p><a name="0607192000007"></a><b><a name="0607192000039"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I will deal with the specific
matter of Mr Al-Rawi and Mr Al-Banna who came into detention in the
Gambia. I confirm in explicit terms here tonight that the United
Kingdom did not request the detention of either of the men in the
Gambia. We played no role in their transfer to Afghanistan or
Guantanamo Bay&#151;no
role.</p><p><a name="0607192000008"></a>The noble Earl, Lord
Northesk, said that he was concerned&#151;and I am
concerned&#151;that we should not diminish or demean our democracy.
We do not and we will not. Our standards are high and, as I said, I do
not accept that we operate some sort of clandestine police estate. That
is not the United Kingdom that I know at all. The British Government
are certainly committed to protecting the British people from the
threat of terrorism, and who needs reminding of the scale of the
threat? As we were commemorating 7/7, we saw another brutal and
shameful attack; on the city of Mumbai. But we are quite clear in our
own minds that we can succeed in meeting the challenge of international
terrorism only if our own efforts are grounded in respect for, and the
continued promotion of, international law and fundamental freedoms?
That is as true in the area of rendition as in any other aspect of our
counter-terrorist effort.</p><p><a name="0607192000009"></a>Measures taken by states to combat
terrorism must be legal, proportionate and justifiable. Promoting human
rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law is, in the end,
the best guarantee of our own security, for it helps stifle the
discontent on which the terrorist recruiters
prey.</p><p><a name="0607192000010"></a>I know
that what I have said will not satisfy all noble Lords in the House. I
am afraid that I will have to remain content in my own mind that it
does not do so. In this country we do not engage in practices of the
kind that have been described. It may be impossible to prove the
negative, but that is no basis for people to assume that there has been
the kind of behaviour that gave rise to some of the adjectives used.
All noble Lords who wish to pursue this matter further should provide
far more tangible evidence than the kind of allegations that we have
heard. I myself have looked carefully at the Amnesty International
report and at the reports made when Jack Straw investigated all the
flights where we had contact with the United States, and I have looked
at their submissions as well, and I say to noble Lords that these
allegations are groundless and baseless and should not be repeated
without proper
evidence.</p><p><a name="0607192000011"></a><b><a name="0607192000040"></a>Lady

another 11 groups. Therefore, a sensible suggestion, which I hope will
meet with agreement, is that we should carry on until midnight, when I
would guess that we would have dealt with most of the 11 groups. The
objective remains for us to get to AmendmentNo. 180, which

who told them from the start that this was a highly contentious Bill,
that we were totally dissatisfied with many of the replies we had had
from Ministers in another place, and that it would require six days for
Committee stage. The Government insisted on only scheduling four and
now they are asking us to act in complete contravention of what the
House has voted for&#151;in other words, to rise at 10
o&#146;clock, which is a time at which some of us can be compos

should try to give notice to the House of everything I possibly could,
and most crucially that I should notify the House a year in advance of
recess dates. I was advised not to do that by all the wise heads
because I was told we would occasionally find ourselves in a situation
where, in order to meet the recess date, we would need to sit a little
later. And the proposal is, I emphasise to the House, a little later.
The 10 o&#146;clock rising time is an advisory rising time and can
only be met with the co-operation of the House. We are a
self-regulating House and I have no powers of authority over anyone in
the House but that rising time has been met spectacularly well this
Session. We have rarely sat long beyond 10 o&#146;clock.</p><p><a name="0607192000020"></a>I genuinely apologise to the noble Lord,
Lord Dearing, but he will understand that this is an extremely
important Bill. I worked in education myself. You cannot calculate how
long Bills will take; all we can do is estimate. We have no powers to
do anything other than estimate that the groups on this Bill on the
first two days would take an average of35 minutes per group.
Of course people involved in the Bill will say that that is an
extremely important Bill and it will take a long time. The Police and
Justice Bill, for example, took 20 minutes per group and everyone
involved would say that was dealing with extremely important issues. I
apologise to the House that this has inevitably meant that we go a
little later tonight than I would have liked. It is extremely rare for
this to happen. I stay here every night until the cat is put out so I
have a greater vested interest than anyone does in completing the
matter.</p><p><a name="0607192000021"></a><b><a name="0607192000048"></a>Baroness

strange and enormous un-homogenous groupings and to sit late on the

the Bill to be treated as Committee on Report, but I understand that
the Official Opposition would not agree to that. To ask us to sit to

obstructive to the House getting the business through; I want us to

at end insert-</ul> &#147;(g) a
reduction in the statutory proportion of elected parent governors on a
school's governing
body&#148;<p><a name="0607192000027"></a>The
noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 103, 105,
107, 108, 110 andClause 33 stand part, which are grouped with
Amendment No. 92. The amendments would prevent any alterations being
made to the governance of schools that would result in the reduction of
the statutory number of elected parent governors. Therefore, a
foundation could not remove parent governors so that it could have a
majority on the board. Far from being averse to parents having real
power in schools, as claimed on an earlier group by the noble Baroness,
Lady Buscombe, we on these Benches believe that governing bodies should
be representative of parents and the local community, no matter what
model of governance they have
otherwise.</p><p><a name="0607192000028"></a>The Minister implied
that we could not have trusts without them being given majority control
of governing bodies. Why not? I do not see why, if the trust is really
operating in the interests of the children and parents rather than in
its own interests. Surely the most important people to whom a school
should be accountable are the children and their parents. The 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1229"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision for parent councils that are purely advisory and have no teeth
is merely a sop which inadequately makes up for the removal of parents
from the organ of real power&#151;the governing body. For 30 years
the governing bodies of schools in the UK have operated on a
consensus&#151;a partnership between parents, staff, the local
authority and the wider community. The governing body of Alsager
School, on which I had the honour to serve before I came to your
Lordships' House, was a model of such a partnership. We are all aware
of the difficulties of getting people to serve on governing bodies
these days, because of the great legal burdens put on them. All the
same, the model works well and has wide
support.</p><p><a name="0607192000029"></a>Parent
governors are of particular value in creating links between the
governors and the wider body of parents, feeding in their concerns and
points of view, and representing the views of the governors to the
parents. However, it is important that those parent governors are not
just placemen. They have more credibility as independent
representatives of parents&#146; opinions when they have democratic
legitimacy, so parents appointed to the board by sponsors just will not
do.</p><p><a name="0607192000030"></a>In his response to this
amendment in another place, the Minister there said that the Bill
allowed the right level of flexibility for schools to decide for
themselves about the best model for them. He said that the necessary
safeguards are built in, including a mechanism for removing a trust or
its ability to appoint a majority of the governing body if the
governing body feels that that is best. I ask noble Lords: do turkeys
vote for Christmas? The idea of a trust school governing body voting to
abolish itself is ludicrous. No. We need better safeguards than
that.</p><p><a name="0607192000031"></a>On the
Question whether Clause 33 shall stand part of the Bill, I say that the
clause is quite unnecessary; and this is the kind of thing to which I
referred a few moments ago in response to the business statement.
Parent councils are purely advisory and no substitute for properly
elected parent governors and proper accountability through the ballot
box of their election.</p><p><a name="0607192000032"></a>I am passionately in
favour of meaningful involvement of parents in their children&#146;s
schools. I have always been a member of the PTA of my children&#146;s
schools. I believe that they give the opportunity for vital links
between parents and teachers. But parents need an adequate voice on the
decision-making body of the school and that is the board of governors.
As I said earlier, the parent council is purely advisory and any school
which really wants one can set it up now. It does not need this
legislation to allow it to do so. It is another of the many parts of
the Bill which are superfluous. We are wasting our time talking about
them. No, this is a sop since the shift from a community school to a
foundation school would entail the reduction of elected parent
governors from three to one. Others could be appointed but they would
never be regarded as being truly independent of the sponsors and no
sponsor would resist the temptation to appoint only those who he
believes concur with his point of view.</p><p><a name="0607192000033"></a>The benefits of parent councils are not
clear. Why would they be better than three elected parent governors?
Why would they be better than a good

really want to strengthen the power of parents, do they not strengthen
the role of parent governors rather than reducing their number? The
Government say one thing about parents and do the opposite. From their
deeds shall you know them. I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</p><p><a name="0607195000001"></a><b><a name="0607195000333"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Peterborough:</b>
Amendment No. 126, which stands in my name,
refers to Clause 33. Many Church schools&#151;and probably not only
Church schools&#151;already have organisations supporting the school
with all kinds of exotic and local names. I am fully supportive of the
involvement of parents; I hope that we all share that view. What these
groups have in common is that they include friends of the school and
members of the local church and community, as well as parents and staff
connected with the school. That is a good thing and it is to be
encouraged.</p><p><a name="0607195000002"></a>The
wording of Clause 33 is exclusive. Members of these parent councils are
parents and no one else. By amending that to &#147;include&#148;
parents, AmendmentNo. 126 seeks to clarify the point that
these friends&#146; organisations could perfectly well fulfil the
purpose of a parent council. For many schools, having two separate
bodies would be ridiculous and unnecessary. The clause as drafted would
have the effect, therefore, of destroying a local system that often
works well to the advantage of the school and the community. I hope
that the Government will reconsider the phrasing of the
clause.</p><p><a name="0607195000003"></a><b><a name="0607195000334"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> I support the right reverend
Prelate&#146;s amendment, which would allow non-parents to be members
of parent councils. We welcome the positive contribution to schools
from the local community, but we want to ensure that the influence of
parents of children currently at the school is not watered down. In so
far as the governing body welcomes the involvement of
&#147;friends&#148; of the parent council, we would support that
choice. The Bexley Business Academy is a good example of where the
&#147;friends&#148; of a parent council form a tier of greater
engagement, whereas other parents can just keep in touch by attending
general meetings. However, allthe members are parents. This
might provide an opportunity for greater fundraising initiatives and
more integrated community involvement. I hope that any parent council
that admitted non-parents would be established with the appropriate
safeguards.</p><p><a name="0607195000004"></a>We
cannot support the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley. As I hope I made clear at Second Reading, where the Bill
provides the opportunity for schools to have greater independence to
present parents with higher standards and a greater quality of choice,
and where those reforms promise a robust and sustainable future for our
schools, I will support those provisions. However, we believe that,
taken together, these amendments would weaken the Bill. They would
render completely unclear the determination of proposals for changing
the majority of governors to foundation governors, for a community
school to become a trust, and for referrals to the adjudicator. We do
not feel that these amendments make a constructive contribution to the
Bill.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1231"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="0607195000329"></a>10

Williams of Crosby:</b> Before we conclude this short
debate, let us be very clear that, in the Bill, we are offering parents
a far weaker alternative to that of being a parent governor. Being a
parent governor is a legal position and carries precise
responsibilities. The role has been very well carried out in this
country. Our system of governing bodies is admired in other education
systems. It has given ordinary citizens a real responsibility and
involvement in their schools. A parent council is all very
well&#151;there is nothing to prevent it from living side by side
with a governing body&#151;but at the end of the day it simply has no
real power.</p><p><a name="0607195000006"></a>There is
nothing in the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment that we would
object to. It relates to including non-parents on a parent
council&#151;that is fine. But it is nothing to do with the real
substitution of genuine power for what is, at best, an advisory
position. We should be absolutely clear that, if my noble
friend&#146;s amendments are not agreed to and the Bill goes through
as it stands, we will have removed from parents a great deal of real
power and real involvement in their schools, and I think that we will
live to regret that.</p><p><a name="0607195000007"></a><b><a name="0607195000336"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> Sometimes when the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams, for whom I have great respect, speaks, I have to pinch myself
to check that we are not doing something that is genuinely outrageous,
because the terms in which her arguments are made are very strong. But
what we are doing here is a perfectly sensible adaptation of existing
practice within the schools system. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams,
said that what we are seeking to do is a great and radical departure.
It is not. The model of governance that we propose for parents is
precisely that which currently applies in many thousands of
voluntary-aided schools, which are perfectly adequately managed within
the state system. I am aware of no representation that parents feel
that these schools are less well governed than other schools or that
they feel less engaged than parents in other schools&#151;indeed, if
parental engagement and attachment to schools is measured by the
popularity of schools and the willingness of parents to apply for their
children to go to these schools, then the opposite might be held to be
the case.</p><p><a name="0607195000008"></a>In
fact, in voluntary-aided schools there is no requirement for parent
councils&#151;none. I am not saying that the one is a trade-off
against the other. We have looked at best practice in this area. In
many trust schools, the majority of governors will not be appointed; it
is an option to appoint up to the majority. We expect that in many
trust schools a minority of the governors would be appointed by the
trust, in which case there will be a larger number of parent governors.
However, where the majority of governors are appointed by the
trust&#151;and that is done by consent with the school or through the
process of competition and choice of the best school that can be
provided, where it is a new school&#151;they will take on real
overall responsibility for governance in the way that the Churches do
in their schools. We believe that it would be good practice 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1232"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to have other mechanisms to ensure effective consultation with parents
over and above the arrangement for parent councils.</p><p><a name="0607195000009"></a>As Bagehot once famously said of
Parliament, the</p><ul><a name="0607195000320"></a>&#147;test
of a machine is the work it turns out&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000110"></a>If the evidence from those schools that
are governed on this basis is that they are well governed, popular in
their locality and have a very strong community mission, and that
parents feel well served and are willing to send their children to
them, I simply do not understand the alarmist statements made by the
two noble Baronesses as to the evil effects that this would have. This
is one option that schools and local decision makers can pursue where
they think it appropriate. They will do so in the knowledge that it
would be giving majority control to a trust whose <I>bona fides</I>
they would willingly have accepted as part of the arrangement for the
trust school to be taken forward. On that basis, and given our
experience of voluntary-aided schools, this seems a perfectly sensible
emulation of existing good practice in the schools system and not some
breach of fundamental principles. The more one looks at the state
education system, the less fundamental they appear, in any
event.<p><a name="0607195000010"></a><b><a name="0607195000337"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> I thank the Minister
for his reply. I accept what he says about voluntary-aided schools
perhaps benefiting from having more elected parent governors on their
board of governors. I emphasise that we are talking about elected, not
appointed, parent governors. The parents in those voluntary-aided
schools may feel that they are more involved with the school anyway
because of their shared faith, but we are not talking about faith
schools&#151;well, we are in some cases because some of these trust
schools will be run by faith groups, but not all of them will be, so
they will not all have that shared faith by which the parents can feel
that they are involved with the school and that the board of governors,
whoever they are, represents their point of view.</p><p><a name="0607195000011"></a>We are talking about many schools that
will not be run by faith groups, so to reduce the number of elected
parent governors on those boards to a paltry one person who is supposed
to represent perhaps up to 2,000 sets of parents is very unsatisfactory
on the part of a Government who say that they want to strengthen the
power of parents. I would have thought that the Government should be
saying, &#147;Let&#146;s have four, five or more elected parent
governors&#148;, but no. What are the Government afraid of? Do they
think that parents do not want the best for the school? Do they think
that they cannot get enough parents to become involved in the board of
governors? I cannot understand why the Government are so much against
this point of view. They are supposed to believe in democracy and real
power for parents. Yet in practice they are taking power away from
them. I simply do not understand it, but I am clearly getting nowhere,
so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="0607195000012"></a>Amendment, by leave,

authority&#148;</ul><p><a name="0607198000002"></a>The
noble Baroness said: I move AmendmentNo. 114 and speak to
Amendment No. 115. Both amendments would remove the right of the local
authority to refer proposals involving the acquisition of a trust by a
school to the school&#146;s adjudicator. We do not see why the power
is necessary, given the lack of any similar measure with regard to
foundation proposals. We believe that the guidance on the acquisition
of trusts, to which the governing body must have regard, is a
sufficient
safeguard.</p><p><a name="0607198000003"></a>I
would like to draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the
Government&#146;s draft guidance, School Organisation (Prescribed
Alterations to Maintained Schools) (England) Regulations 2006.
Paragraph 12 of Schedule 1 to the regulations sets out the
circumstances where the local authority can take advantage of its
rights under the section. The circumstances are as follows. For the
purposes of Section 21(3), a local authority may only require that such
proposals specified in sub-paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) are referred to and
adjudicated if:</p><ul><a name="0607198000102"></a>&#147;(a)
the governing body has failed to adequately fulfil the requirements set
out in&#148;</ul><a name="0607198000076"></a>the
guidance<ul><a name="0607198000103"></a>&#147;on
consultation;</ul><ul><a name="0607198000104"></a>(b) the
governing body has failed to have regard to the responses to the
consultation; or</ul><ul><a name="0607198000105"></a>(c) the
local education authority consider that the foundation will have a
negative impact on
standards&#148;.</ul><p><a name="0607198000004"></a>While these
criteria seem superficially restrictive, the terms used still leave a
great deal of power in the hands of the local authority. This sample
suggests many pitfalls. How is the local authority to demonstrate that
the governing body has failed to have regard to responses to the
consultation? Would the governing body have had to have acted extremely
unreasonably in its decision or would it be sufficient to cite a
handful of vocal opponents to the proposed trust in evidence?
Similarly, there are concerns about 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1235"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the nature of a &#147;negative impact on standards&#148;. Does this
refer to standards at the school or the standards of all schools in the
area? If all schools in the area, could a local authority not contrive
some spurious argument based on its opposition to the trust model to
justify referral to the adjudicator? It is difficult to decide what
impact a foundation will have until it actually runs the
school.</p><p><a name="0607198000005"></a>Such ambiguities risk
allowing local authorities to thwart the movement towards the system of
independent state schools that the Bill intends to create&#151;a
principle that has received support right across your Lordships&#146;
House, from the Back Benches opposite to those that cross the House and
those behind me. I believe that the statutory guidance together with
the measures in Clauses 32 and 33 offer sufficient safeguards to remove
the right of referral to the adjudicator. I remain unconvinced that the
decision to acquire a trust differs to such a degree from becoming a
foundation school that a special right of review is needed in this
case. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0607198000006"></a><b><a name="0607198000107"></a>Baroness
Sharp of Guildford:</b> I rise to speak to Amendments
Nos. 116, 116A and 116B, which are in my name and that of my noble
friend Lady Walmsley.</p><p><a name="0607198000007"></a>Amendment
No. 116 is probing, because I wondered whether the Minister could
explain a little more. We were unable to understand what the
regulations were saying on this occasion. I wondered if the Minister
could explain the regulations to us. Paragraph 3 is a lovely piece of
speak:</p><ul><a name="0607198000079"></a>&#147;Regulations under
section 20 may restrict the matters to which a local education
authority may have regard in deciding whether to require proposals to
be referred to the
adjudicator&#148;</ul><a name="0607198000077"></a>and so
forth. We would be grateful if the Minister could explain precisely
what those regulations are trying to get
at.<p><a name="0607198000008"></a>Amendments Nos. 116A and
116B we are putting forward on behalf of the Association of Colleges,
which is worried about the position of further education colleges,
particularly in relation to post-16 education and 14 through to 19
years. Clause 22 sets out the rights of interested bodies on any
proposals made under Clause 20 and the referral of these proposals to
the adjudicator in certain circumstances. Under the terms of the Bill,
any school that wanted to establish or expand the sixth form would have
to apply to the local authority for approval. We discussed a little
earlier that the school organisation committees will now be abolished
and it will be a matter for decision by the local authority itself.
Yet, post-16 education is funded not by local authorities but by the
local learning and skills councils. Therefore, local authorities would
be in a position of approving new sixth-form education and the numbers
associated with that, but with no accompanying responsibility to fund
it. Many local authorities want the majority or even all the schools in
their area to have sixth forms and the Government have made this easier
under the terms of the five-year plan. New school sixth forms should
offer to local youngsters different provision from that which is
already available. That is not always the case. The opening of 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1236"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1236</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a new school sixth form can often duplicate courses at other post-16
providers. There needs to be a stronger system than that proposed under
the terms ofClause 22, whereby the local authority will make a
decision and only then can the adjudicator be asked to make a
judgment.</p>

<p><a name="0607198000009"></a>Amendment No. 116A
would enable the Learning and Skills Council and the local dioceses to
refer any proposals to the adjudicator before the local authority takes
the decision. The Association of Colleges has concerns that it would be
much more difficult for the adjudicator to overturn an original
decision and that, when asked, he or she would be able to intervene
earlier in the process to ensure that all local views are taken into
account. He or she is an independent arbiter. Their involvement would
reduce the possibility of long running disputes that may occur when
various bodies
disagree.</p><p><a name="0607198000010"></a>Amendment
No. 116B would specifically allow not only the Learning and Skills
Council but also schools and colleges to refer a proposal to the
adjudicator where it relates to provision for 14 to 19 year-olds. That
would ensure that the Learning and Skills Council is not put in the
difficult position of trying to represent the views of the Government
as well as those of local providers. The colleges feel very strongly
that they should be able to speak for themselves. The Government
rightly want to promote choice, but it is vitally important that
colleges and schools need to be able to participate actively in the
decisions to ensure that the widest possible choice is offered locally.
After all, they are the ones on the ground who best understand the
needs of local
people.</p><p><a name="0607198000011"></a><b><a name="0607198000108"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> In respect of the noble Baroness&#146;s
last remarks, I understand the points that she makes about the post-16
provision and the need for full consultation. The Learning and Skills
Council and local colleges would be consulted about the
proposals.</p><p><a name="0607198000012"></a>With regard to the
referral of trust proposals to the adjudicator, the important
distinction that needs to be made is that a trust proposal of itself
would not make any difference to post-16 provision or the post-16
character of a school. Any school, whether a foundation school, a
non-foundation school or a trust school, that wishes to change the
post-16 character of the school would need to publish statutory
proposals under the arrangements that we debated earlier today. They
would need to go through the statutory processes, including local
decision making and, in practice, local decision makers would not be
able to make those decisions unless there was a funding agreement with
the Learning and Skills Council. Indeed, there are recent decisions by
the adjudicator in respect of that matter. The adjudicators have not
been prepared to agree to post-16 provision where no funding
arrangement agreed by the Learning and Skills Council is in
place.</p><p><a name="0607198000013"></a>I understand the noble
Baroness&#146;s point that the body providing the funding and having
overall responsibility for planning this provision must be a party to
decisions. In fact, that is the case. The key point about the local
authority as the guardian of the interests of the local community
having power to 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1237"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1237</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>refer to the adjudicator, but not the Learning and Skills Council, is
that in respect of post-16 provision a trust proposal could not also
double as a proposal to open a sixth form or change the post-16
character of a school. I hope that that reply meets the
point.</p><p><a name="0607198000014"></a>On who can refer trust
proposals to the adjudicator, or, taking the amendments tabled by the
noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, whether there should be referrals to the
adjudicator at all or whether local decision-making should not involve
the right of a local authority to refer to the adjudicator, I believe
that we have struck a fair balance. We want the local authority to have
the right to be able to refer on the basis of standards at the school,
not more general standards, or inadequate consultation. The local
authority must judge for itself whether it believes standards are at
risk by a trust proposal or that there has been inadequate
consultation. Having done that, this is then a matter for the
adjudicator to decide. We think that that is the right way to
proceed.</p><p><a name="0607198000015"></a>However, on Liberal
Democrat AmendmentsNos. 114, 115 and 116, we do not think that
it is right to have an open-ended right of appeal. The local authority
can be trusted to make sensible judgments on behalf of the community to
refer trust proposals to the adjudicator, which is the basis on which
we should act in this regard. We think that we have struck a fair
balance. We could have gone further and given wider rights of reference
to the adjudicator, but we thought that the role of the local authority
was most important. That would seek to take account of others who are
making these decisions. Equally, on something as important as the
acquisition of a trust, which could lead to the appointment by that
trust of a majority of the governing body, if there are concerns by the
local authority that this would have a prejudicial effect on standards
or that there hasbeen inadequate consultation, it is right
that this should be subject to some independent review. Local
adjudicators, who are now skilled in taking decisions of this kind
about school organisation in the best interests of education in that
community, are the appropriate people to make these
decisions.</p><p><a name="0607198000016"></a><b><a name="0607198000109"></a>Baroness

the amendment I shall speak also to AmendmentsNos. 130, 131,
132 and 137 in my name. They relate to technical matters relating to
ownership of sites. We understand that new foundation schools will be
owned not by the local authority but by one or more foundations. When
such schools close or are moved to new premises, the public interest in
the land needs to be preserved. However, the Bill needs to recognise
that the provisions intended to protect the public interest might also
catch existing schools, owned not by the local authority but by
trustees, principally among some Church schools where there is already
a strong existing body of law and practice.</p><p><a name="0607198000053"></a>Amendment No. 128
relates to reverter of sites. It makes a tentative proposal, broadly
worded, to limit the circumstances in which the premises of closed
schools revert to the original landowner. The amendment would have the
effect of placing some small limits on reverter in the case of the
discontinuance of certain schools. Amendment No. 130 to Schedule 4
recognises

the use of land following the closure of a school, and on the other
hand the right of the trustees to compensation for costs and expenses
they have incurred in waiting for a decision. These costs are likely to
be those of boarding up, providing security for the premises to avoid
vandalism and depredation of a closed school building.</p><p><a name="0607198000054"></a>Amendment No. 131 to Schedule 4 would have
the effect of ensuring that two obligations working in opposite
directions did not make it impossible for the trustees of a closed
school to do the right thing. The terms of their trust might make it
impossible to pass proceeds of sale to a third party even though that
was the decision of the local authority supported by the adjudicator.
The amendment would have the effect of overriding the limitations
imposed by the trust.</p><p><a name="0607198000055"></a>Amendment No. 132 would
require a public hearing where the adjudicator is to determine the
destiny of proceeds of sale. That would seem to be best practice and
indeed the adjudicator might hold a public hearing in any case. That
would simply require that such a hearing was held. The final amendment
in this grouping in my name is Amendment No. 137, which concerns the
disposal of hard play areas attached to closed school premises. The
Government and Sport England are committed not to dispose of playing
fields unless that can be avoided. Hard play areas around a closed
school could, we understand, attract the interest of those seeking to
prevent their disposal. The most obvious problem for us would be in
relation to the disposal of former school premises in an urban area
without playing fields, as generally understood, with a playground and
a tennis court. If the Secretary of State were to rule that the hard
play areas in such cases were to be retained for educational purposes,
which although it might be illogical is not inconceivable, that could
blight the premises and render it virtually or actually impossible for
the trustees to dispose of the land or gain any benefit from its
disposal. In those perhaps unlikely circumstances, we propose that the
Secretary of State would have to acquire land that he had blighted from
the trustees. I beg to

arrangements with local authorities because in the past the carrot for
the private sector has been to carry out all the future
work&#151;maintenance, refurbishment, cleaning and so on&#151;over
the whole local authority&#146;s school estate. But if over the
course of time eight out an estate of 20 schools become trust schools,
for example, the business opportunities are significantly cut because
you can no longer have the exclusivity arrangements. So it is possible
that private contractors might respond to that new business risk by
increasing the cost of schemes during their initial phases, which would
cost the taxpayer more.</p><p><a name="0607195000044"></a>An
alternative solution that the department might favour is to make
building schools for the future the only option for capital investment,
forcing all schools to take part. I wonder whether that is the case.
Claudia Wood from the Social Market Foundation has
said:</p><ul><a name="0607195000138"></a>&#147;The guidelines for
BSF are quite stringent and the LEA has a huge role in approving
schemes. So if the trust school wanted to do something that was
slightly out of the guidelines, it would still have to negotiate that
with the LEA, which detracts greatly from their so-called
independence&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000111"></a>It is
clear that the limited freedom implied by Building Schools for the
Future raises questions about the need to transfer school assets to
trusts in the first place. Will the Minister tell me whether the
assumptions that I have made are true and how Building Schools for the
Future might affect the situation for
business?
<p><a name="0607195000045"></a><b><a name="0607195000343"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> I hope that the noble Baroness does not
feel that she has reached her vocation as a Labour rebel but, if she
does, she is very welcome to join us on this side of the
House.</p><p><a name="0607195000046"></a>My understanding of
Amendment No. 132E, to which she spoke and which as she said was moved
in another place, is that it would enlarge the scope for local
authorities in seeking transfers so that land could be sold, for
example, for housing or to provide a facility such as a transport depot
or a refuse site. What a local authority might seek to get a transfer
order in respect of a school site for is left much more to the
discretion of the authority. Our concern on this amendment is to
protect the educational interest, which local authorities should be
seeking to safeguard over the transfer of educational
sites.</p><p><a name="0607195000047"></a>I should
make it clear that the requirements on trusts are that they should
operate for educational purposes and in the best interests of the
educational community they serve, not to engage in property
transactions of a kind for which there are plenty of regulations laid
down to prevent them if they do not remain true to their purpose. That
is why we have said 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1242"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the stated purpose for which a local authority may seek a transfer
order should relate to the purposes of the school, to another
educational use or to the delivery of children&#146;s services, and
not beyond that purpose. We seek simply to safeguard educational
interests in the case of an authority which might seek to take the
opportunity of a transfer to trust status to try to transfer land right
out of educational purpose. Earlier in our debates the noble Baroness,
Lady Williams, referred to the important issue of playing fields. Let
us be clear on what will happen if local authorities are given wider
rights. It would not be the essential core buildings of a school which
local authorities not having regard to the educational interest might
seek to transfer to other purposes, it will be ancillary sites. The
most obvious of those sites will be playing fields or vacant land. Our
concern is to safeguard the educational
interest.</p><p><a name="0607195000048"></a>In respect of the PFI
deal issue raised by the noble Baroness, I am advised that even though
the local authority remains the signatory to the PFI deal, the
governing body would have to pay the unitary charge. However, it could
not unilaterally break any agreement made by the predecessor governing
body. It would inherit the obligations that were made before, so there
would be no change in that
respect.</p><p><a name="0607195000049"></a>I turn now to the five
amendments in this group spoken to by the right reverend Prelate.
Amendments Nos. 128 and 131 concerns the details of trusts and trustee
rights which have consequences in charity law as well as in education
law. I have requested my officials to work further with the
Church&#146;s lawyers, and if necessary with the Charity Commission,
to explore these highly technical matters. I will keep him informed of
progress with a view to reaching an agreed position before we come to
the Report stage. Amendments Nos. 130 and 132 impose duties on the
adjudicator in respect of compensation to trustees for costs while the
adjudicator considers referrals, and a duty to hold a public hearing.
Neither of these provisions, we believe, are required in the Bill, but
are better dealt with in guidance to which the adjudicator has a
statutory duty to have regard. We have made guidance available to the
House which sets out our position on these matters and it is our
intention that this guidance will be further developed in the light of
experience.</p><p><a name="0607195000050"></a>Amendment No. 137
would require the Secretary of State to purchase playing fields and
adjacent land from trustees when he refuses consent for playing field
disposals under the provisions of Section 77 of the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998, which has been referred to several times in our
debates. This section covers protections for school playing fields to
prevent them being sold off to the detriment of the sporting facilities
available to the school and the local community. The provisions of
Schedule 4 bring the trustees of foundation and voluntary schools in
line with other categories of school in having to seek the consent of
the Secretary of State when disposing of any playing field land which
has been provided or enhanced at public expense. We have considered
representations made by Church lawyers in this area, but we believe
that the extension of protection to playing field land in these
respects is right. There is 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1243"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rightly no requirement in existing legislation, the 1998 Act, for the
Secretary of State to purchase land when he refuses consent to
disposal. In some cases that could be a hugely expensive undertaking
and we do not believe it would be right to introduce such a provision
for some categories of owners of publicly funded land rather than
others.</p><p><a name="0607195000051"></a>We
understand that the concern behind the amendment relates to hard play
areas, playgrounds directly attached to school buildings which come
under the provision of the Act. Should the Secretary of State refuse an
application for disposal, it could blight the sale of a discontinued
school owned by trustees, including Church trustees. However, a general
consent for disposal of such land already exists from the Secretary of
State, provided that the land is not needed by another school. The
amendment is therefore
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="0607195000052"></a>Finally,
the provisions of Schedule 4 allow a local authority to seek the
transfer to it of surplus publicly-funded school land that is owned by
governing bodies, foundation bodies, or trustees. We have deliberately
restricted the purposes for which such a transfer can be sought, so
that school land continues to be used for the benefit of the children
and young people in the
area.</p><p><a name="0607195000053"></a>The great
majority of the government amendments to Schedule 4 in the group are
technical, consequential and repetitive, and I have written to noble
Lords about them. School land can be owned in a number of ways by
different categories of bodies, reflecting the extremely complex
history of the development of school sites. It has been acquired and
funded through a number of routes. It is necessary for legislation
relating to school land to include all those possibilities, and the
amendments seek to tie up loose ends.</p><p><a name="0607195000054"></a>The provisions in
Schedule 4 mean that where there is not local agreement to disposal or
reinvestment proposals, or a claim by a local authority for a share of
the proceeds relating to public funding, the schools adjudicator will
determine. The amendments, which have been discussed in detail with the
Churches that are principally affected, make clear that provisions
apply only to land that is acquired or has been enhanced by public
funding and to that share of proceeds that can be attributed to public
funding and not that share that could be attributed to trustees in
respect of that land. They also define public finding more clearly, and
they make procedures simpler and clearer.</p><p><a name="0607195000055"></a>They provide that where
a local authority successfully objects to a proposed land sale or
deployment on the grounds of local need, the land should be transferred
to the local authority expeditiously for proper consideration, which
meets one of the major concerns that the Churches had. They also
replace a complete moratorium on disposal until any matters referred to
the schools adjudicator are determined, with a moratorium only where
the authority has objected to the disposal itself in question, which we
think is a more sensible way of proceeding. I hope that has given the
right reverend Prelate some
comfort.</p><p><a name="0607195000056"></a><b><a name="0607195000344"></a>Baroness

undertake the agreement that it already had on PFI, and it is liable
for the costs. Is there any mechanism for preventing the upward
pressure on costs that might result from this break-up of the school
system, so that PFI private sector partners no longer have an
opportunity for an exclusivity arrangement with the local authority? Is
there any way in which the school can resist upward pressure on the PFI
costs?</p><p><a name="0607195000057"></a><b><a name="0607195000345"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My understanding is
that the nature of PFI contracts and the relationship between schools
and local authorities under PFI contracts is not affected in any way by
a move to trust status. I will happily write to the noble Baroness
about that if my understanding is in any way incorrect. They are still
maintained schools. The local authority under Building Schools for the
Future, for example, where the obligations are undertaken, maintains
the same responsibilities as it does for other maintained schools. My
understanding is that it makes no difference at all, but I will write
to the noble Baroness if I am incorrect on any
point.</p><p><a name="0607195000058"></a><b><a name="0607195000346"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> I have a quick question.
The local authority appears to be the only body that can intercept the
land in this way to use for educational or similar purposes. If the
land is required by the proposer of the new school who is not the local
education authority, does the LEA have any obligation to act on its
behalf to make sure that the land stays in educational use? Or is it
possible that the LEA could frustrate the new school by denying it
access to old premises?</p><p><a name="0607195000059"></a><b><a name="0607195000347"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> The local authority can
act only in very specific circumstances relating to other education or
children&#146;s services&#146; uses for the lands. The noble Lord
asked whether that other use could include the creation of a completely
new school, fulfilling the local authority&#146;s duties to permit
diversity and choice. My understanding is that where the local
authority formed the view that such a new provision was in the local
public interest, it would be a legitimate reason for it to seek to act.
Could others seek to oblige it to do so? The could do so indirectly
through the provisions in the opening clauses of the Bill, which
require local authorities to have regard to the promotion of choice,
diversity and to take full account of parental demands, but they could
not refer proposals to the adjudicator. It is important to understand
why. We are talking about school sites. There has to be some overriding
public interest for the rights of trustees or the governors of schools
to be overridden in the decisions that they wish to take about the
disposal of sites which are legitimately
theirs.</p><h5><a name="0607195000331"></a>10.45

OF POLICY WITH RESPECT TO YOUNG CARERS</ul><ul><a name="0607195000314"></a>(1) The governing body of a maintained

<p><a name="0607195000087"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing
amendment. We would like to see the Government further considering
young carers&#146; welfare. Like looked after children, children who
take on a caring role in the family are pupils who are at particular
risk of not receiving sufficient support from the education system.
About 3 million children in the UK are affected by disability in their
families and 175,000 of them become young carers. It is estimated that
the majority of young carers remain unidentified. We must ensure that
these children are identified and offered the best support so that they
can achieve their
potential.</p><p><a name="0607195000088"></a>Amendment
No. 142&#151;proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and
supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;which attempts to
address the issue, is unsatisfactory. It is far too prescriptive and
would unnecessarily restrict the freedom and autonomy of our schools.
Our amendment will enable each school to develop a policy suited to its
circumstances, ensuring that young carers are identified and their
welfare promoted. It is drafted along the same lines as the discipline
provisions. There is no substantive relation, but it seemed appropriate
that a governing body would take a special interest in the welfare of
young carers, and develop a policy suited to their particular school.
That can be achieved without hindering the school&#146;s powers and
freedoms to run their own affairs, and would offer each school the
opportunity to safeguard the welfare of their own pupils.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1255"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0607195000089"></a>I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response on this important matter. I am sure that many schools already
take an interest in young carers, but it is important to emphasise that
the amendment is not intended to create an index of young carers for
all to see. I am well aware that many young carers may not wish to be
identified in front of their classmates, or share their home situation.
Their privacy should be respected. That message is terribly important.
The aim of the amendment is to improve the support given to young
carers, not to expose their personal lives to unwanted scrutiny. I beg
to move.</p><p><a name="0607195000090"></a><b><a name="0607195000358"></a>Baroness
Massey of Darwen:</b> I shall speak to Amendment No.
142. I am not sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and I are
all that far apart. I welcome the desire to help and support children
in care in the Bill. I tabled Amendment No. 142 because young carers
also deserve a better deal.</p><p><a name="0607195000091"></a>I
have recently met many young carers and listened to their problems. I
am grateful to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and other support
groups for supplying me with further information. A huge and recurring
issue is that of schools not knowing that they have young carers, and
having no policy or person in charge to cope with their needs. There is
no need to identify them in front of their classmates, but people need
to know that there is a problem, just like any other welfare
problem.</p><p><a name="0607195000092"></a>Some young carers are
caring for a parent with a physical or mental disability, or for a
sibling. In both cases, they may find themselves late for school,
unable to do homework on time or, sadly, missing school. I shall
briefly illustrate my points. As the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe,
said, there are around 175,000 carers in the UK. Of these, 13,000 care
for people for more than 50 hours a week. That is surely enough young
people to mean that every local authority should have a young carer
strategy as part of their children and young people&#146;s plan.
Young people&#146;s health is often badly affected by caring through
the night, having to lift a heavy adult and feeling isolated. These
young people are often going through adolescence, and have the same
emotional needs as others. Many suffer the additional trauma of
bereavement, family break-up, loss of income or housing, and seeing the
effects of illness or substance misuse in the family.</p><p><a name="0607195000093"></a>I am focusing on educational needs, but
these needs go beyond education; a good reason for children&#146;s
services which link together to support the young person. Education is
a big concern when we are looking at people missing school altogether.
One child said:</p><ul><a name="0607195000316"></a>&#147;I missed
a lot of school because he wasn&#146;t well. I didn&#146;t like
leaving him in case he fell over and he couldn&#146;t reach a phone
or pull the cords ... I went to school twice a week, and that was
it&#148;. </ul><p><a name="0607195000094"></a>The DfES guidance
and advice for schools and local authorities states:</p><ul><a name="0607195000317"></a>&#147;Young carers should not be
expected to carry inappropriate levels of caring which have an adverse
impact on their development and life chances. However, there are
children and young people who undertake caring roles ... there may
be up to 30 young carers in a secondary school&#148;.</ul>

that: <ul><a name="0607195000318"></a>&#147;Schools should
consider designating a member of staff to have responsibility for young
carers. They can also contribute to schemes that support them, working
with local authorities and voluntary agencies&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000113"></a>This is not simply a problem for
schools, but across many services.
<p><a name="0607195000095"></a>Only some schools identify and support
young carers. There are stories of real success; for example, allowing
young carers access to telephones in school so that they can contact
their home in case of emergency, as well as real care on homework
issues and links to other services.</p><p><a name="0607195000096"></a>If we are, insistent that <I>Every Child
Matters</I> principles go right through the Bill&#151;I think that we
are&#151;the rights of young carers should also be supported. Every
school should have a lead professional who co-ordinates young
carers&#146; support. Links between school and family are absolutely
vital. Local authorities should provide free transport for young
carers, and schools should work with young carers&#146; services as
part of the extended schools and healthy schools programmes. I hope
that the Minister will be sympathetic to my amendment. On behalf of
young carers, I do not think it is too much to
ask.</p><p><a name="0607195000097"></a><b><a name="0607195000359"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> I wish to speak to Amendments Nos.
139A, 139B, 139C, 140A and 140B in this group. First, I shall mention
Amendment No. 139 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of
Breckland, who is unable to be with us. This is another place in the
Bill where we believe the well being of the child should be added. The
noble Baroness has placed it right up there with the duties of the
governing bodies, where it should be&#151;at the basis of the
activity of the school alongside the achievement of educational
potential.</p><p><a name="0607195000098"></a>I have added my name
to Amendment No. 142 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, to
which she has just spoken so effectively. The reason why I prefer her
amendment to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is that it
seeks to replicate the situation that applies to looked-after children,
in that the school should have a dedicated teacher who is responsible
for supporting that other particular group of very needy children who
need particular support from the school. The fact that she has
paralleled that situation which already exists for looked-after
children with this other group of young carers who have different
needs, but none the less very important needs, is what makes her
amendment particularly attractive to
me.</p><p><a name="0607195000099"></a>I shall not
speak to Amendment No. 184B, as we have changed it and put it in a
different place in the Bill. It belongs in the discipline section and
the bullying section. We shall come to it later in our
debates.</p><p><a name="0607195000100"></a>Amendment No. 139A adds
academies, city technology colleges, and city colleges for the
technology of the arts to the list of schools that must have regard to
the relevant children and young people&#146;s plan. The Minister is
always telling us that those schools, although they are independent,
are actually community schools. If that is so, there is no case for
them to be excluded from the duty to have

regard to that plan would be a recipe for chaos and discrimination in
the area and the children who would suffer would, as usual, be the most
vulnerable.</p><p><a name="0607195000101"></a>Amendments
Nos. 139B and 140B have been suggested to us by the LGA. They would
ensure that the Bill strengthens the contribution of schools to the
improvement of all of the five well being outcomes for children, as set
out in the Children Act 2004, and not just educational attainment.
Local authorities have, of course, embraced the provision of that Act.
As a key plank of the Children Act 2004, local authorities are
required, in conjunction with their local partners, and in
consultation&#151;this is most important&#151;with children and
young people themselves, to produce the children and young people's
plan. Government guidance describes the document
as,</p><ul><a name="0607195000321"></a>&#147;a single strategic
overarching plan for all local services for children and young
people&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000114"></a>Both in the
SI and in government guidance there is a clear onus on local
authorities to ensure that the schools are consulted and have full
input into the process. That onus is only in one direction at present.
Schools are not currently required to act within the provisions of the
plan once agreed. Given the obvious importance of schools in delivering
the educational fulfilment and wider elements of the well-being of
children, and given that the Government have described the children and
young people's plan as an overarching plan for all services affecting
children and young people, we believe that the onus on governing bodies
to comply with local partners&#146; plans must be strengthened to
ensure coherent and effective local delivery of the well being of
children and young people. <h5><a name="0607195000332"></a>11
pm</h5><p><a name="0607195000102"></a>Amendment No. 139C is from the
NSPCC, which welcomes the new duty that schools must have regard to any
relevant children and young people's plan, but would like to see an
amendment to this clause which makes it clear that the school, parents
of registered pupils and the registered pupils themselves must be
involved in the development of the plan from the outset. That would
ensure that the plan is both relevant and applicable to all schools,
parents and children in the local authority. Of course, noble Lords
will realise that the inclusion of pupils in the development of the
children and young people's plan is in line with Article 12 of the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><p><a name="0607195000103"></a>The NSPCC also suggested
AmendmentNo. 140A. It believes that the duty to improve the
well-being of children should be included alongside the general duties
of a governing body of a maintained school to direct the conduct of a
school. That would complement the duties in the Children Act 2004
placed on local authorities and other institutions and bodies with
responsibilities for children's welfare. In that way, it is very
similar to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady
Howarth.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1258"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0607195000104"></a><b><a name="0607195000360"></a>Baroness

that there should be some mention of young carers in the Bill. Twenty
years ago, when Carers UK started campaigning for the rights of young
carers, nobody believed that there was such a thing as a young carer.
It was simply not in our consciousness. We must acknowledge what huge
progress we have made, perhaps particularly since this Government have
been in power, in recognising the needs of young carers. A great deal
of progress has been made in providing services appropriate to the
needs of young carers.</p><p><a name="0607195000105"></a>However,
time and again, when you meet young carers&#151;as I do and as the
noble Baroness,Lady Massey, has mentioned&#151;they say,
&#147;If only we had more recognition in schools. If only our
teachers understood what it was that we&#146;re doing&#148;. That
is not to say that they are requiring too much attention, legitimacy or
freedom, but that they want, as young carers frequently say, an
ordinary life. I hope that we can include a provision in the Bill that
will move us further on in the education area towards helping young
carers have just
that.</p><p><a name="0607195000106"></a><b><a name="0607195000361"></a>The

Children's Rights Director at the Commission for Social Care

help&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000115"></a>Young
carers,<ul><a name="0607195000323"></a>&#147;did not get
much support for themselves from organisations like social
services&#148;,</ul><a name="0607195000116"></a>and
stressed the need for,
<ul><a name="0607195000324"></a>&#147;having the same social worker
for a continuous
time&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000117"></a>We know that,
because of the shortage of social workers in many areas, we have a long
way to go in securing that steady support. It makes it all the more
important that schools can supply that support where it is lacking
elsewhere.<p><a name="0607195000108"></a>On schools, young
people said that,</p><ul><a name="0607195000325"></a>&#147;it
feels like I've got to explain myself so many
times&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000118"></a>The
consultation concluded that,
<ul><a name="0607195000326"></a>&#147;if you have been doing caring
tasks for someone at home, sometimes during the night, you are simply
tired and can't concentrate at
school&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000119"></a>Young carers
need one, <ul><a name="0607195000327"></a>&#147;person on
the staff they could talk to at any time about their caring
pressures&#148;,</ul><a name="0607195000120"></a>so the
role of designated teacher is very important indeed.

children said,</p><ul><a name="0607195000328"></a>&#147;there
is a fine line between helping and intruding&#148;.</ul><a name="0607195000121"></a>That sensitivity is all-important and
again schools need to be equipped to deliver it. What struck me most in
the meeting was what young people said about their friends. They
said: <ul><a name="0607195000319"></a>&#147;Staff also need
to know how being a young carer can make a difference to how you get on
with other children or young people. It can make it difficult to make
friends, and you can come across as having emotional problems yourself.
Friends you do make sometimes don&#146;t stick around when things get
tough. Practical things like going out with friends and going on
sleepovers can be very difficult for a young carer to do, and this does
make a difference to how you get on with other people your own
age&#148;.</ul><p><a name="0607198000056"></a>The
charity YoungMinds has often expressed the concern that mental health
services, when they are dealing with parents, do not identify the
children and the need for those children to get support. I welcome the
strengthened duty on schools to identify these children and ensure that
they get the support and services that they need. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</p><p><a name="0607198000057"></a><b><a name="0607198000116"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> I support my noble friend&#146;s
amendment. These young carers are enormously important to us. Those who
are capable of taking on these responsibilities at that age often go on
to great things afterwards. I can think of one who became a postman and
may go even further yet.</p><p><a name="0607198000058"></a><b><a name="0607198000117"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> All the amendments seem to
follow the same sort of line, certainly as far as young carers are
concerned. Again, having seen and heard some of their views over time,
I think that the whole purpose of having some form of teacher support
is going to be important.</p><p><a name="0607198000059"></a>The
other thing is that fine line between intrusion and helping, and there
is room here surely not just for a designated teacher but for a lot
more voluntary support, a mentor in the community. In earlier
discussion, we were able to identify some degree of bullying that often
arose in such situations.</p><p><a name="0607198000060"></a>So
there is a lot of need for attention to this very special, very
important group who often have a huge role in keeping the family
together. On the other side, I would very much support the well-being
amendments that have been suggested. It is important that they go in in
their more general capacity for the educational side of the
work.</p><p><a name="0607198000061"></a><b><a name="0607198000118"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> We absolutely accept the important issues
relating to young carers that the noble Baroness has raised, supported
by my noble friends, by the noble Baronesses, Lady Howe and Lady
Walmsley, and by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. Anyone who has looked
at this and spoken to young carers and to schools as they seek to
provide assistance to them realises the gravity of the
issue.</p><p><a name="0607198000062"></a>The estimates of numbers
vary widely. The 2001 census recorded a total of almost 150,000 young
carers in England and Wales&#151;a substantial increase on the
figures collected by ONS in 1996, which 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1260"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suggested between 19,000 and 51,000. Whichever figures we look at, the
numbers are very large. There are even suggestions that the figures may
be an underestimate, as they do not include young carers whose parents
have drug or alcohol problems, which is often a significant issue. It
is also striking that some very young children are recorded as
providing significant hours of
care.</p><p><a name="0607198000063"></a>The issue
is how we provide better assistance for young carers without labelling
and possibly stigmatising them, which would of course be a concern that
we would all share and which we particularly think might apply to a
requirement on schools to identify young carers in some formal way. We
are happy to look at this further before Report, in particular to see
whether my department could provide non-statutory guidance to schools,
consulting local authorities and relevant representative organisations
to help them in their efforts to engage sensitively with young carers
and to promote the fulfilment of their educational potential, with
particular reference to proposed new subsection (2)(b) in the noble
Baroness&#146;s amendment. We will seek to engage noble Lords in
further discussions on this before
Report.</p><p><a name="0607198000064"></a>With respect to Amendment
No. 139A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, we recognise
that academies should have regard to the children and young
people&#146;s plan in each locality. We intend this to be taken
forward through amendments to the model funding agreement for new
academies, and my officials will also enter into negotiations with
existing academies following the passage of the Bill to see that this
is reflected in their funding agreements too. I hope that we can bring
about that result.</p><p><a name="0607198000065"></a>I am told that the
objective that the noble Baroness is seeking to achieve through
Amendment No. 139C has been met. We entirely share the view that there
should be full consultation with children and people in families during
the development of children and young people&#146;s plans. That need
is met by the Children and Young People&#146;s Plan (England)
Regulations 2005, which make provision to ensure that the views of
children, young people, families and their representatives are heard
during the development of the CYPP. It may help if I send those
regulations to the noble Baroness to see whether that satisfies her in
this regard. Obviously, it would be pointless to have a children and
young people&#146;s plan without consulting children and young people
in its preparation and ensuring that they played a full part in that
process.</p><p><a name="0607198000066"></a>On the issues covered by
Amendments Nos. 138, 139, 139C, 140, 140A, 140B, 142 and 184B, we of
course share the objectives entirely. Our concern is not to put in
statutory duties where we believe that the purposes can be achieved in
less regulatory ways. They can be, because of the centrality of
<I>Every Child Matters</I> to what schools now seek to achieve. Should
encouragement be necessary to ensure schools&#146; participation,
sufficient levers already exist. Ofsted already inspects schools using
a framework that requires consideration of the delivery of the five
outcomes in <I>Every Child Matters</I>. The framework for
schools&#146; self-evaluation fully reflects <I>Every Child
Matters</I>, and we recently issued guidance on that, 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1261"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which I would be happy to circulate to the Committee. School improvement
partners, which we debated earlier in our consideration of the Bill,
will support and challenge schools on their contribution to the five
outcomes. School profiles will give parents information about the
support that schools provide for pupils&#146; well-being and any
extended services that the school
offers.</p><p><a name="0607198000067"></a>Looking at how schools
already engage with <I>Every Child Matters</I>, we believe that
progress on extended schools is one proxy for overall progress and note
that 2,500 schools will make the core offer of extended services by
September 2006. Over 8,000 schools are now engaged with their local
authority and the Training and Development Agency in developing plans
to become extended schools. The indications that we have of engagement
by schools in this agenda are highly positive, and we do not seek to
legislate further at this
stage.</p><p><a name="0607198000068"></a><b><a name="0607198000119"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> I thank the Minister for his
reassurances and look forward to receiving the regulations that he
mentioned. I am pleased that the aim of Amendment No. 139A will be
achieved by amendments to the model funding

142, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey. As the noble Baroness
said, we are not far apart at all. We want to make sure that what we
propose can be as discreet and flexible as possible, being careful to
ensure that the individual young carer is not in any way stigmatised
and is at the same time recognised. It is difficult. The Minister
appreciates what we are trying to achieve, but at the same time I
appreciate that we have to be careful about how we identify these young
people. As the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, said&#151;I wrote it
down just as she was saying it&#151;they do not have ordinary life
experiences in some ways, and it is difficult for their peer group to
appreciate what they are going through, so they must often feel in many
ways isolated and traumatised through their experiences. In other ways,
of course, they have grown far beyond their years. My noble friend, in
supporting my amendment, suggested that in many ways they could do
great things in later life through their difficult and challenging
experiences in early life.</p><p><a name="0607198000070"></a>I am
grateful to the Minister. I am glad that he has agreed to think more
about this, and non-statutory guidance is a great start. We all clearly
feel that the area is hugely important. We have come a long way. I am

of an alleged criminal offence, where the teacher or member of staff is

in other cases, when at the completion of investigation and
consideration of the allegation it has been determined that the
allegation is
proved.&#148;<p><a name="06071913000005"></a>The
noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 143 would place a duty on those
investigating allegations against teachers to safeguard the identities
of those involved. I am grateful that the Minister has organised a
meeting with a Member in another place, Mr Jim Knight, to discuss these
matters further. The amendment would ensure the confidentiality of
information that could identify the alleged offender until the
allegation had been proven. It would also place a duty on the governing
body of a maintained school to ensure that it had a policy that would
impose disciplinary action on any member of staff who disclosed that
confidential information.</p><p><a name="06071913000006"></a>As my
honourable friend in another place, David Willetts, noted, the
amendment is drafted so that it comes within the remit of the Bill. It
might have been simpler to provide full anonymity backed up by criminal
penalty but, as that is a criminal justice measure, we understood that
it would be outside the remit of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071913000007"></a>We are not wedded to the wording of the
amendment. We would be all too willing to alter its wording in order to
get this extremely important provision on the face of the Bill. This is
an issue that we must get right, and this is our opportunity to do so.
We have generated an ever-watchful society, rightly so in many cases,
but it is hugely important to ensure that the web of legislation and
guidance that affects schools but does not directly deal with them does
not place school staff in a vulnerable position. I am reminded of the
provisions of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill that impose a
duty on schools to keep a watchful eye out for potentially dangerous
characters.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1263"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071913000008"></a>Teachers now teach in a
culture where discipline is by necessity on the statute book. The
teachers now need legal assent to discipline children. The same goes
for all other staff in schools, especially support staff and those
assisting in the care of children. The inclusion of that in the Bill is
an implicit acknowledgement that teachers come under ever more
unreasonable accusation and that they need protection from that. But
the legalisation of discipline measures will not protect teachers from
the socially and professionally debilitating effects of wrongful
accusation.</p><p><a name="06071913000009"></a>What is more, the
culture of accusation and blame is a major deterrent to our teaching
system. We face an exodus of male teachers from the system, while the
statistics of male teachers accused of abuse&#151;70 per cent of all
allegations are made against male teachers&#151;make a worrying
correspondence. The number of allegations made against teachers has
doubled in the past five years. Whereas, in 2001, 220 teachers had
previous allegations in conjunction with new allegations, that figure
has risen to 440 today. Of those with allegations made against them in
2005, under 4 per cent resulted in conviction. I will not deny that it
is notoriously hard to obtain a conviction for abuse, but the figures
for allegations investigated are illuminating. Seventy per cent of
allegations were not taken forward to criminal investigation. All
figures used here come from the DfES audit of allegations against
teachers and other staff in the education
service.</p><p><a name="06071913000010"></a>I
know that other noble Lords will have known or heard of individuals
whose careers have been ruined humiliatingly in public as a result of
unfounded or mistaken accusation. Since addressing this issue at Second
Reading, I have discovered that the NASUWT logs show that, between 1995
and 2002, there were only 86 convictions from the 2,016 cases
investigated.</p><p><a name="06071913000011"></a>We accept that
the measures to allow teachers to work while allegations of abuse are
investigated, introduced in 2005 by the then Secretary of State, Ruth
Kelly, were a step in the right direction, as was the pledge in the
DfES five-year plan of 2004 to defend teachers from false allegations
and to ensure that teachers are not subjected to damaging delays to
clear their name. But almost two years on from that original pledge,
nothing has happened that seeks to redress the situation. We supported
the Government&#146;s guidance on safeguarding children in education
and dealing with allegations of abuse against teachers and other staff,
so I look forward to meeting the Minister in this place and in another
place next Tuesday to discuss what may be achieved on the matter if we
have an unsatisfactory outcome tonight. For now, we hope that the
Government can put their money where their mouth is and commit to
providing modern safeguards for teachers working in a very modern
culture. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06071913000012"></a><b><a name="06071913000080"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> I commend
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for moving this amendment on an
extremely difficult and not very popular subject. I declare an interest
as one of those involved in setting up the body known as
FACT&#151;Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers&#151;with the noble
Earl, Lord Howe, in this place and Claire Curtis-Thomas in another
place.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1264"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071913000013"></a>There is no doubt that it has become
something of an industry for some people to make allegations of a kind
that have no substance against parents and teachers. We came across a
number of examples over the past couple of years of people who had
reasons, not any justified claim, that led them to make allegations
against teachers that were simply false&#151;in some cases because
they believed that they had been wrongly graded, in other cases because
they believed that their references had gone against them, and matters
of that kind.</p><p><a name="06071913000014"></a>All this was made worse
in the instances that I know most about, which related to the
investigations conducted by the North Wales Police and the Merseyside
Police into cases involving child carers and teachers, by a method
known as trawling, whereby all those involved in a particular school or
childcare home were approached and asked whether they wished to make
any allegations. That, to say the least, was unfortunate, because in
some cases it encouraged those who had no particular allegations to
make to give evidence against teachers and carers, possibly with a
cohort of their fellows from the same class.</p><p><a name="06071913000015"></a>This is an extraordinarily difficult
issue. Justified claims of harassment, misbehaviour and so on against
teachers are among the most sensitive and difficult cases that
Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills or, for that
matter, the Home Office ever have to deal with. It is an
extraordinarily difficult balance to strike. Wherever one strikes it,
one is likely to create a huge industry and a huge loss of reputation.
Nevertheless, the crucial thing&#151;and I believe that the noble
Baroness has got it right&#151;is to protect the teacher against whom
allegations are made until there has been a proper opportunity to
investigate. That protection has been breached in the past where such
allegations and rumours have been spread about, which has led, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, to people losing their entire
careers as schoolmasters or schoolmistresses, and in some cases to
their families being wrecked by the community picking up false
allegations against the person concerned.</p><p><a name="06071913000016"></a>So, speaking simply from the background
of what knowledge I have of this, which is obviously limited but which
shows the acute agony of these kinds of cases, I would certainly
commend the effort by the noble Baroness to try to limit the damage
caused. I commend the amendment, which may contain purely technical
difficulties, but which seems to me to try to address a very difficult
and not particularly popular issue.</p><p><a name="06071913000017"></a><b><a name="06071913000081"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> We on these Benches
have considerable sympathy with the amendment, as my noble friend Lady
Williams of Crosby has just said. I can think of little worse for
somebody who is so committed to children that they take up a profession
looking after them&#151;teaching and caring for them in some
capacity&#151;than to be falsely accused of malpractice or abusing
them in some way. That must be agonising. However, the meeting with the
Minister is timed for next Tuesday. We will attend this cross-party
meeting with him alongside the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1265"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and we will reserve our judgment on whether the amendment is necessary
pending what we hear from him. The Minister may well propose something
to deal with this very important issue, but, if not, I am sure that we
will come back to it on
Report.</p><p><a name="06071913000018"></a><b><a name="06071913000082"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> I, too, congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, on the amendment, and very much support what
the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has said in support of it. It is
very worrying that the number of cases has doubled and that the number
of allegations seems to be growing. Clearly, certain steps have been
taken that have helped. It is important to try to reduce the waiting
time between when an offence allegedly occurs and when the case is
heard. But I have also attended the All-Party Group for Abuse
Investigations&#151;or APGAI, as we call it&#151;for some time,
perhaps almost to counter my view that a lot of offences are, and have
been, committed against children. Again, the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams, has played an extremely useful role in nailing these
allegations so far as is humanly possible. I very much support what has
been
said.</p><p><a name="06071913000019"></a><b><a name="06071913000083"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> We regard this as a
serious issue and we look forward to further discussions, which my
honourable friend will lead next week, on this difficult issue. Our
concern is to ensure that allegations are investigated and dealt with
speedily and confidentially. These are the two prime requirements that
teachers and carers can legitimately expect from a system when their
whole livelihood and future are at stake in the consideration of
allegations.</p><p><a name="06071913000020"></a>We have sought to
improve guidance and materials to schools on how to deal with cases.
Last November, we issued new guidance on this issue to schools and to
further education institutions in England. This April, the revised
version of <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I> provided
overarching guidance on allegations against anyone working with
children in any setting. Our guidance states that every effort should
be made to maintain confidentiality while an allegation is being
investigated, unless and until a person is charged with an offence. It
also seeks to promote expeditious investigations. The aim is for at
least 80 per cent of cases to be resolved in less than one
month&#151;this would be an increase on our latest figures, for
2003-04, which show that 55 per cent of allegations were resolved in
less than one month&#151;and for all but the most complicated cases
and cases that must go to court to be dealt with in less than three
months. At present, the latest figures, for 2003-04, show that 22 per
cent of cases took up to three months to complete and that 10 per cent
of cases took up to a year, which we regard as an excessively long
time.</p><p><a name="06071913000021"></a>We have also put in place
a network of 15 allegation management advisers, who are based in
government offices in England and who work with local safeguarding
children boards to ensure that effective arrangements are in place for
dealing with allegations of abuse against everyone who works with
children&#151;that is, not only teachers but other staff 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1266"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and volunteers in schools and further education institutions. Part of
the work of the advisers will be to help organisations to prevent
allegations from arising in the first place, particularly in the
circumstances mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, through
safe recruitment processes and advice on staff behaviour when working
with
children.</p>

are keen to explore next week the question of whether we can go
further, but I shall not disguise the fact that we have encountered
difficulties on further statutory protection, not least in the
read-across to other public servants and others who quite legitimately
expect similar protection. We are wrestling with these issues, and I

that, although I hear what the Minister is saying about guidance and
arrangements, sadly I do not believe that those arrangements would and
could be effective in today&#146;s culture. I am afraid that we have
gone too far down the road of blame and accusation. Human nature is now
such that, sadly, we need a stronger deterrent to deflect this growth
in the culture of accusation and
blame.</p><p><a name="06071913000024"></a>I speak as a lawyer. I am
always loath to legislate in these areas unless absolutely necessary,
but we have to think about the numbers. The numbers speak for
themselves. Teachers, particularly male teachers, are genuinely being
put off the profession by this culture of blame. That is hugely
unfortunate. I never thought that I would find myself saying
this&#151;maybe it is because of the late hour&#151;but perhaps it
is something to do with the media. Whatever is going on out there,
people are finding themselves deterred from doing a hugely important
job as a teacher because of this
culture.</p><p><a name="06071913000025"></a>I urge the Minister to
ensure that, when we meet next Tuesday with his colleague from another
place, their thoughts and proposals will extend much further than
guidance and arrangements. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071913000026"></a>Amendment, by leave,

noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to
AmendmentsNos. 143B, 143C, 145, 145A and 166A. This is part of
a large portfolio of amendments that cover selection procedures of one
sort or another in relation to 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1267"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>admissions. Amendments Nos. 143A, 143B, 143C and 145 relate to Clauses
37 and 38. Clause 37 deals with selection by ability and Clause 38 with
the code of admissions. On selection by ability, we on these Benches
support the government policy of restricting selection by ability. The
aim of the amendments is to strengthen the provisions of Clause 37 in
this
respect.</p><p><a name="06071910000004"></a>Amendment
No. 143A adds to the schools that come within the bounds of these
restrictions academies, city technology colleges and city colleges for
the technology of the arts, which at present fall outside the
restrictions suggested by Clause 37. The Government will tell us that
academies and city technology colleges are required by their funding
agreements to select broadly from across the local community. We accept
that this may be the case&#151;it is written into their funding
agreements&#151;but we would argue that if this is so and that means
that they will not select by ability, then why can that not be in the
Bill? Why can they not be added to the maintained schools in the Bill?
Why should they always fall outside the general provisions that apply
to other schools?</p><p><a name="06071910000005"></a>Amendment No.
143B adds no selection by aptitude to no selection by ability. This
issue takes us back to the old arguments about the difference between
aptitude and ability. In general, our Benches are sceptical about
selection by aptitude, with perhaps two exceptions: sport and music.
Otherwise we can see little case for any element of selection by
aptitude where secondary schools have various specialisms. How many of
these specialist schools select by aptitude? How many have needed to
have these provisions? Is it a necessary provision for them to retain
in the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06071910000006"></a>Amendment
No. 143C takes us forward toClause 49 and the issue of pupil
banding. In effect, it reinforces Amendment No. 143B&#151;on
selection by aptitude&#151;by suggesting that selection should be
permitted only for the purposes of pupil banding. At this stage, I ask
the Minister a question that might be better asked when we reach Clause
49: how feasible is it to apply banding systems to just one school?
Surely, if banding is to be applied, it has to run across all the
schools within a community served by those schools. Does banding
applied to a single school make any sense at
all?</p><p><a name="06071910000007"></a>Amendment No. 145 relates
to an issue that we on these Benches feel rather strongly about. If we
are to try to get to a needs-blind application system for places at
popular secondary schools, just as with examinations, applications
should be anonymous, judged on their own merits, the names being
attached only after the decisions have been made. That was one of the
suggestions put forward by the Select Committee when it considered the
White Paper that preceded the Bill. We would have liked to have seen
the Select Committee&#146;s suggestion incorporated in the Bill. The
purpose of the amendment is to achieve precisely
that.</p><p><a name="06071910000008"></a>I turn to Amendment No.
145A, which relates to Clause 38 and the code of practice for
admissions. The main purpose of this amendment is very similar to that
of Amendment No. 146; namely, that the code 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1268"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of practice for admissions should be subject to positive resolution by
both Houses of Parliament. In its briefing for the Second Reading
debate, the Association of School and College Leaders argued that if
the code is to become mandatory, it is reasonable to require it to pass
through proper parliamentary scrutiny. We are very sympathetic to that
point and have therefore tabled this amendment. The difference between
our amendment and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is that
under the procedures that we propose, if the code is not approved, it
is open to the Secretary of State to amend and re-table it before both
Houses; whereas our reading of the Conservative amendment is that once
the code has been rejected, the Secretary of State can never lay a
further proposed
code.</p><p><a name="06071910000009"></a>Finally,
I turn to Amendment No. 166A, yet another amendment that seeks to
extend the application of the admissions code not just to maintained
schools, which are defined in the Bill as community, voluntary aided,
voluntary controlled and foundation schools and, in future, trust
schools)&#151;but also to academies, city technology colleges and
city colleges for technology for the arts. In this case, it is a
question of banning interviews. In our view, if interviews are regarded
as bad practice for one kind of school, the code should be applied
equally to all other schools funded from the public purse, whether
so-called independent state schools or not. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071910000010"></a><b><a name="06071910000044"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> I rise to speak to Amendment No. 144,
regarding the use of home school agreements and admissions, and to
AmendmentNo. 146. I also give notice of my intention to oppose
the Question that Clause 38, regarding the admissions code, stand part
of the Bill. I will also speak to Amendment No. 169, regarding
interviews allowed for children over compulsory school age and
Amendments Nos. 176 to 178, regarding
banding.</p><p><a name="06071910000011"></a>Amendment No. 144
introduces home-school contracts as part of the admissions code. It
offers an incentive and a positive relationship between the family and
the school from the outset of a child&#146;s education. We agree with
the Government&#146;s sentiments outlined in the White Paper
regarding the reinforcement of parental responsibility for discipline.
At Second Reading, I voiced my concerns about parenting orders. They
are reactive measures to poor discipline, offering little more than
enforcement, and they fail to create overall results.</p><p><a name="06071910000012"></a>The child impact statement issued by the
All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children points
out:</p><ul><a name="06071910000030"></a>&#147;The extension of
parenting orders raises questions about due process in terms of
resorting to enforcement measures where no offence has been
committed&#148;.</ul><a name="06071910000021"></a>Ultimately,
this measure is counterproductive and creates a barrier between parent
and school.
<p><a name="06071910000013"></a>A constructive approach
is required. By introducing a contract at the start of a child&#146;s
education, schools and parents will work in a constructive partnership
by actively practising an ethos of discipline. Agreeing to an informal
contract between school and home, both teachers and parents send a
message to children that behaviour in the home and at school are
considered to 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1269"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be of the same or similar importance, with the same or similar
acceptable standards expected. This amendment is not intended to be a
mechanism to enable teachers to tell parents how to parent and it will
not enable parents to tell teachers how to use discipline. It is a
simple agreement between parents and schools intended to ensure that
they both have an effective tool to help them to tackle serious
problems of truancy and attendance, and discipline in the
classroom.</p><p><a name="06071910000014"></a>I turn to Amendment
No. 146 and the Question whether Clause 38 should stand part of the
Bill. These concern the admissions code. Amendment No. 146 would ensure
that the code for school admissions would have to be approved by both
Houses of Parliament before it could come into force. That reflects the
change in the nature of the new code for school admissions compared to
its predecessor, the code of practice for school admissions. The code
of practice is made under Section 94 of the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998, which Clause 38 amends. It required bodies and
persons exercising functions under that chapter of the 1998 Act
only,</p><ul><a name="06071910000037"></a>&#147;to have regard
to any relevant provisions of the
code&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071910000015"></a>The new code is
far more prescriptive. As envisaged under Clause 38, the code for
school admissions
will,</p><ul><a name="06071910000038"></a>&#147;impose
requirements, and may include guidelines setting out aims, objectives
and other
matters&#148;,</ul><a name="06071910000022"></a>rather
than the less constricting Clause 84(2) of the old arrangement
whereby:<ul><a name="06071910000031"></a>&#147;The code may
include guidelines setting out aims, objectives and other matters in
relation to the discharge of their functions under this Chapter by
local education authorities and such governing
bodies&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071910000016"></a>Bodies and
persons exercising functions under the relevant chapter of the 1998 Act
will be expected to &#147;act in accordance&#148; with the code
rather than &#147;have regard to it&#148;. The skeleton admissions
code makes clear at paragraph 2 that
it,</p><ul><a name="06071910000039"></a>&#147;sets out
statutory (i.e. imposed by primary or secondary legislation) and other
mandatory requirements imposed by this
Code&#148;.</ul><a name="06071910000023"></a>According to
that paragraph, chapter 1 of the skeleton code sets
out,<ul><a name="06071910000040"></a>&#147;admission
practices and oversubscription criteria that must not be used in the
allocation of school places and provides guidelines and requirements
for fair admission arrangements&#148;.</ul><a name="06071910000024"></a>It is clear that this code is much
stronger than the one made under existing legislation. It is also clear
that the change in the status of the code was made to win the support
of various rebel groups within the Labour Party.
<p><a name="06071910000017"></a>It was not a proposal contained within
the White Paper. Paragraph 3.22 on page 46 of the White Paper
states:</p><ul><a name="06071910000032"></a>&#147;No
one approach towards admissions will work in all circumstances. This is
why we want to ensure that all self-governing schools ... are free
to use the approach to fair admissions that they think will best meet
their local circumstances, as long as it is compatible with the
Admissions Code&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1270"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071910000018"></a>The
public face of government was consistent with the White Paper. All
radio, television and newspaper interviews given by the Prime Minister
and the Secretary of State between the publication of the White Paper
in October 2005 and the concession letter of 6 February this year
categorically ruled out the code of practice having any more statutory
compulsion than it had already. On 24 November, the Secretary of State,
Ruth Kelly, said in another place
that:</p><ul><a name="06071910000033"></a>&#147;The code is
established on a statutory basis, but there is discretion and
flexibility in it to adapt admissions to meet the specific ends of a
school and the pupils in the
area&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071910000019"></a>Asked
by the then shadow Education Secretary, David Cameron, if she would
rule out making the code of practice a statutory code, the Secretary of
State replied:</p><ul><a name="06071910000034"></a>&#147;I can
tell the hon. Gentleman that the code achieves its ends of ruling out
selection by ability on its current statutory basis. He is
confused&#151;the code already operates on a statutory basis. Schools
take it into account, and then the adjudicator, which is also
statutory, can use its discretion to say whether the school has
interpreted it correctly. Interpretation of the code, however, is very
important for schools that want to create their own distinctive
ethos&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons,
24/11/05;col.
1644.]</ul><a name="06071910000025"></a>That was said by the
then Secretary of State for
Education.<p><a name="06071910000020"></a>The Prime Minister
said at his press conference on 23
January:</p><ul><a name="06071910000041"></a>&#147;I
can&#146;t agree, for the reasons we have given on many occasions,
that this code becomes
statutory&#148;.</ul><a name="06071910000026"></a>The
Government retreated in their 6 February letter to the Education and
Skills Committee in which the then Minister
said:<ul><a name="06071910000035"></a>&#147;As you know it
has always been our intention that the Code of Practice on admissions
should have real force&#148;.</ul><a name="06071910000027"></a>The wording in Mr
Justice Jackson&#146;s judgment in the London Oratory School case,
which involved the governing body of that school and the schools
adjudicator, shows how prescriptive the code can be. He
said:<ul><a name="06071910000036"></a>&#147;Let me first
consider the statutory effect of the Code. Section 84(3) of the 1998
Act imposes an obligation, first on the Governors of the Oratory School
and then on the Adjudicator &#145;to have regard to any relevant
provisions of the Code&#146;. The phrase &#145;to have regard
to&#146; means to take into account. It does not connote slavish
obedience or deference on every
occasion&#148;,</ul><a name="06071910000028"></a>which I
suspect could reflect the new
provisions.<p><a name="06071913000027"></a>The
code could evidently be incredibly restrictive. Indeed, the
Bill&#146;s powers could be used to impose a single admissions
criterion across the country. That is why we feel that if there must be
a strengthened code, accompanying it should be a high level of
parliamentary control embodied in the affirmative resolution procedure.
However, our preferred solution would be to remove Clause 38
altogether. It is
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06071913000028"></a>First,
to impose the code with that additional strength requires us to
anticipate all the varied decisions in which a school might find
itself. We need to ensure that schools have sufficient flexibility to
respond to local needs when setting up their arrangements. In relation
to guidance for Clause 3 the Minister in another place
stated:</p><ul><a name="06071913000073"></a>&#147;When we are
recommending good practice, it goes into guidance and it is for local
bodies to take it into account sensibly in their local
situations.&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons Standing
Committee E, 30/3/06; cols. 152-153.]</ul><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1271"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071913000029"></a>Why should schools not
have the power to tailor their admissions arrangements to local
circumstances? I suspect that the furore surrounding admissions
reflects a left-wing preoccupation with admissions rather than with
standards. The Government rationale for the alteration has not been
consistent. The letter of6 February to the Education and
Skills Select Committee stated that the change was prompted by
&#147;recent legal judgments&#148;
that,</p><ul><a name="06071913000076"></a>&#147;may have
weakened the perceived force of the
Code&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071913000030"></a>But that legal
judgment had occurred before the publication of the White Paper. In
fact, the London Oratory School case was decided in December 2004, some
10 months before the publication of the White Paper. Had the Government
truly intended to strengthen the code, they had months in which to make
their intentions clear. The fact that they did so only when threatened
with a rebellion inside their own party is extremely telling. The words
in the White Paper belie the Government&#146;s real
stance:</p><ul><a name="06071913000074"></a>&#147;We recognise
that no form of admissions arrangements can increase the number of
places at an oversubscribed school. This is why we are continuing to
increase the number of good schools and the number of places in good
schools&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071913000031"></a>Our
preoccupation should be with the creation of more good school places,
not the shifting of one set of children out of a good school and
replacing them with another. That merely substitutes one injustice with
another. The disparity in our education system is caused by a lack of
good school places, not in the fact that one school might have slightly
different admissions policies.</p><p><a name="06071913000032"></a>I turn to the skeleton code. It is a pity
that we were not presented with a more detailed example. However, we
are satisfied that it goes no further than the draft code that was
withdrawn last year. The code recognises that first preference first is
poor practice. That is welcome, as first preference first schemes often
lead to parents choosing schools tactically rather than on the basis of
genuine preference, particularly where there are grammar schools in an
area. If specialist schools decide to select 10 per cent of their
intake by aptitude, it will be even more important that the decision is
taken on the basis of the fairer equal preferences system.</p><p><a name="06071913000033"></a>I have concerns with some aspects of the
code. It continues to outlaw making admission conditional on signing a
home school contract, an issue on which I hope to speak later. I am
concerned also about the less technical wording of the part of the
skeleton code concerning social fairness. The code states at paragraph
1.27:</p><ul><a name="06071913000075"></a>&#147;Admission
authorities should analyse information about their intakes, and where
possible their applicants, to find out whether they attract a wide
range of families or whether their school fails to attract all sections
of local communities&#148;.</ul><a name="06071913000066"></a>I should like the Minister to reassure
me that that will not impose a bureaucratic burden on schools. It is
important that schools do not discriminate in their admissions on
irrelevant grounds. However, since schools are legally forbidden from
selecting on the basis of social background or income, there is a risk
that schools might make great efforts to ensure a fair intake without
any assurance that they will be 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1272"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>successful. I am grateful to have been able to place these matters on
record. Our amendment would ensure that the new code of admissions was
subject to parliamentary scrutiny. We on these Benches consider that to
be a necessary process for ensuring that schools are not subject to
undue burdens. <p><a name="06071913000034"></a>I turn to
Amendments Nos. 176, 177 and 178 on banding. I will return briefly to
an issue raised by my honourable friend Nick Gibb MP in another place.
I will not go into it again in great detail as I hope that having
returned with a slightly altered amendment the Government will be
minded to accept this one in your Lordships' House, having been
sympathetic to the principle in another
place.</p><p><a name="06071913000035"></a>I set out the position
from these Benches at Second Reading. I firmly believe that banding is
nothing more than streaming outside the school gates. I believe that in
its purest form it leads to social engineering and can seriously fetter
parents&#146; choice of schools. As such, it goes in principle
against the driving forces of this Bill. However, that is the principle
of banding in its purest form. While in principle it poses serious
problems, in practice it can be shown to work. CTCs, especially the
Thomas Telford school, benefit hugely from using banding in conjunction
and, as such, I would not wish to fetter the choice of schools to use
banding as a method of
selection.</p><p><a name="06071913000036"></a>These amendments make
it necessary for local education authorities that are admission
authorities to get the consent of governing bodies when introducing all
forms of banding. As currently drafted, Clause 49 provides for
governing body consent only to the new form of banding that is
introduced by new Section 101(1A) of the School Standards and Framework
Act 1998. Amendment No. 176 is a technical amendment that ensures that
banding can be introduced only with the consent of governing bodies
when they are not their own admissions authorities. Amendment No. 177
is a clarificatory amendment to ensure that consent to banding is
necessary only when first introduced rather than every year that the
admission arrangements are determined. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071913000037"></a><b><a name="06071913000085"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> I begin on a consensual note, as I always
seek to do. We are happy to accept Amendments Nos. 176 to 178 moved by
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. I am glad that she has moved
somewhat in her analysis of banding to see that it can be a beneficial
system over subscription criteria in certain circumstances when schools
want to ensure a genuinely comprehensive intake. We agree that it
should be done with the consent of governing bodies and the amendments
that she moved would give it that effect, and we are happy to accept
them.</p><p><a name="06071913000038"></a>Amendments Nos. 175 and
263 stand in my name and relate to partial selection. We do not think
that we can go so far as the Liberal Democrat amendments, which would
ban partial selection entirely without a process of adjudication, but
we believe that when the adjudicator has already decided to reduce the
proportion of people selected or to remove selective arrangements, it
should not be 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1273"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>possible for schools to seek to restore the original level of selection
in the following period. It was not our intention that schools should
be able to seek to restore original selections or partial selection.
Our amendments would mean that if the adjudicator or the National
Assembly for Wales made a decision to reduce the proportion of children
selected by a school with pre-existing selection, that school could not
later return to 1997-98 levels of partial selection. The same
restriction would apply if an admission authority voluntarily decided
to reduce the proportion of children
selected.</p><p><a name="06071913000039"></a>On Amendment No. 143A
proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, we do not believe that it
is necessary to amend legislation to prevent academies or CTCs from
introducing selection by ability. Academies are already required to be
fully inclusive schools and to comply with the school admissions code
and admissions law, which is a more stringent set of obligations than
currently apply to maintained schools. They are obliged to do so by the
funding agreements that are approved by the Secretary of State. CTCs
were established on the basis that they must admit children of all
abilities, and they achieve that by pupil banding. Similarly, academies
are not allowed to conduct interviews and the remaining CTCs, most of
which are moving to academy status, will comply with that requirement
by consensual change to their funding
agreements.</p><p><a name="06071913000040"></a>On the vexed issue
of selection by aptitude, which the amendments of the noble Baroness,
Lady Sharp, would also affect, I shall answer in two parts. At the
moment, the prescribed subjects for selection of up to 10 per cent of
intake by aptitude are PE or sports, the performing arts, visual arts,
modern foreign languages, design and technology and information
technology. When the Select Committee looked at that issue, it
recommended that we removed design and technology and information
technology from that list. We have agreed that we will do so on the
grounds that we now believe that these subjects are areas of expertise
which ought to be available in all schools. It is crucial to understand
that the reason why we permit selection by aptitude is not simply
because it is possible to do so&#151;one could select by aptitude in
a wide range of subjects&#151;but also because of the access this
gives to a wide range of provision in schools that will be particularly
tailored or enhanced for that area. The three areas in which we still
intend to allow it&#151;PE and sport, performing and visual arts and
modern foreign languages&#151;are those where specialist schools are
expected to make enhanced provision as a part of being a specialist
institution. For example, modern foreign language specialist schools
will typically offer a wider range of languages, including minority
languages and sometimes Mandarin Chinese and Russian. These are
languages which, with the best will in the world, are not going to be
generally available. To have a truly comprehensive system, it is right
that where schools can offer an enhanced provision which could not be
part of the normal expectation of what a school can provide, parents
and pupils should have access to it where the school thinks it is
desirable.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1274"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071913000041"></a>The noble Baroness asked me for the number
of schools using the 10 per cent selection provision. While I do not
have the precise figure because I am not sure that we are aware of it,
it is not a large number. But it is of immense value to some schools
for the reasons I have given. Again, we intend that design and
technology and information technology should not be included in the
list for schools seeking to use the 10 per cent selection in the
future, and we will consult on and revise the regulations in respect of
aptitude selection at the same time as we consult on the school
admissions code.</p><p><a name="06071913000042"></a>Turning to
interviews for entry into sixth forms and to assess religious
commitment covered by Amendments Nos. 169 and 170 spoken to by the
noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I think that we have rehearsed our
position on interviews so often that I hesitate to go through it again
at just before midnight. Perhaps I may make two brief points. First, I
should stress that the faith communities themselves&#151;the last
area in which interviewing was allowed&#151;had reached a position
where they wished to end interviewing as an admissions criterion. Only
a very small number of schools were still doing it by the time we
announced that we would seek to end this practice in primary
legislation, and the faith communities have supported us. Secondly, we
do not believe it should be any more necessary for schools to interview
prospective candidates for entry to the sixth form than it is for entry
into any other form. The use of, for example, minimum attainment
requirements at GCSE level, as many schools now providing sixth form
education currently use, or of other over-subscription criteria should
be more than adequate to offer year 12 places in an objective and
impartial way rather than relying on subjective
interviewing.</p><p><a name="06071913000043"></a>In response to
Amendments Nos. 144 and 145A moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp,
requiring an affirmative resolution of each House rather than the more
usual negative procedure, we have already laid a skeleton school
admissions code before your Lordships and we will publish a draft of
the full code in September, allowing for full consultation and debate
in the education community and with noble
Lords.</p><p><a name="06071913000044"></a>Home-school agreements
are specifically prohibited from being linked to school admissions
processes and we do not believe it is right to change that, even though
we think that the agreements can have value. Given that, we do not
support Amendment No. 144. We believe that admission to a school should
not be contingent on promises of good behaviour or any other judgments
about past behaviour, and while we encourage schools to meet with
parents to discuss home-school agreements, this must not be an
interview to determine whether a child should be admitted to a school,
but an opportunity to discuss the school&#146;s policies and the role
of parents in supporting their child as a member of the
school.</p><p><a name="06071913000045"></a>Finally, on the
interesting point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, about the
anonymisation of admission applications covered by
AmendmentNo. 145, we believe that over time the issues around
this should be considered. Looking at IT systems in 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1275"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 1275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their current state and the obligations this would impose, it would be a
step too far to take immediately. There is also the practical issue of
how to deal with siblings under anonymised systems which we have not
yet been able to get our mind around. While we do not think this is
something that can be done now, if we want to get to a system where it
is truly criteria and no other factor weighing in the allocation of
places to children, clearly there is something to be said for those
arrangements. I know that this links with an amendment dear to the
heart of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, which he will move at what I hope
is a better hour of the day, in respect of over-subscription criteria
which use random allocation rather than proximity or banding. That is
an oversubscription criterion that the new school admissions code will
make permissible. In fact, only a tiny number of schools use it at the
moment. It is widely used, for example, in the United States for
charter schools. There is something to be said for it since it is
manifestly fair, but it would involve quite a big departure from
existing admissions practices in this country, which are largely
governed by proximity. While we wish to make it possible, we do not
think that it can be done against the wishes of schools. It would
obviously impact on provision in a particular area, so it would have to
be done in some form of geographical community, and it would need to be
considered very
carefully.</p><h5><a name="06071913000078"></a>Midnight</h5><p><a name="06071913000046"></a><b><a name="06071913000086"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> I hope from what the noble Lord said that
we are about to be showered with some good news that this might be the
sort of time that we are heading home. Before that, I ask him for some
further good news, that it will also under the school admissions code
become illegal for a school to take into account the position in the
ranking of parental preferences in which that school has been placed.
As he knows, I very much feel that schools that say, &#147;We will
not let you in unless you place us first on the list&#148;, are
causing a serious problem. My noble friend referred to that. I do not
see it in the existing draft of the code; perhaps I am just missing it.
Secondly, will the criteria in paragraph 133 of the draft code apply to
Church schools? They are the main offenders under the criteria for
socially selective systems. I would be delighted if they were no longer
able to operate as they have
been.</p>

are three sets of draft regulations that will give effect to the

Lords will recall that the Criminal Defence Service Bill completed its
passage in March this year. The finished product benefited from the
constructive debate in your Lordships' House and another place. Since
then, officials in my department have been working closely with
stakeholders to ensure that the draft regulations deliver a system
which will be easy to understand and quick to administer. The
regulations will also achieve the underlying aim of helping to control
spending on criminal legal aid to ensure that legal aid resources are
balanced and refocused to where they are needed most.</p><p><a name="06071893000021"></a>The draft regulations
were first published during the passage of the Bill. A further version
reflecting many of the points raised during the helpful debates was
published and circulated to key stakeholders in April. Those include

General Council of the Bar, the Legal Aid Practitioners’ Group,
the London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association, the Criminal
Bar Association, the Magistrates’ Association, senior

Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Justices’ Clerks Society. As a
result, we have made some changes, and will keep the working of the new
scheme under active
review.</p><p><a name="06071893000022"></a>Noble
Lords will recall that the Criminal Defence Service Act provides for
the introduction of a financial eligibility test for the grant of
criminal legal aid and transfers the power to grant legal aid to the
Legal Services Commission. The granting of legal aid will cease to be a
wholly judicial function administered by court staff. That will allow
the Legal Services Commission to exercise greater control over
expenditure and ensure consistency. Court staff will remain responsible
for the scheme’s day-to-day operation, governed by a
service-level agreement between the Legal Services Commission and Her
Majesty’s Courts Service.</p><p><a name="06071893000023"></a>The Act includes powers to introduce
means-testing in the Crown Court, and we are currently considering what
that detail of the scheme should look like. We will publish detailed
proposals for consultation shortly, with a view to implementing the
system in Crown Courts by the end of 2007. The main body of the new
scheme for the magistrates’ court is set out in the draft
financial eligibility regulations. Those provide for the financial
eligibility criteria which defendants must meet in order to receive
publicly funded representation.</p><p><a name="06071893000024"></a>The transfer of
responsibility for the grant of legal aid from the court to the Legal
Services Commission is provided for in the representation orders and
consequential amendments regulations. The procedure for appeals about
the interests of justice test is set out in the appeals
regulations.</p><p><a name="06071893000025"></a>Under the new
system, to qualify for legal aid an applicant will need to satisfy the
existing interests of justice test as well as the new means test. There
will be an upper threshold above which no representation order will be
granted, and a lower threshold under which a representation order will
be granted. For those who fall between the two, there will be a more
detailed assessment of their financial circumstances. Individuals in
receipt of certain qualifying benefits, such as income support and the
income-based jobseeker’s allowance, are automatically eligible,
as are those under 16, or under 18 and in full-time
education.</p><p><a name="06071893000026"></a>The means test will
measure affordability by weighting an applicant’s income to
reflect individual family circumstances and household composition. An
individual will be eligible for a representation order if his gross
annual income, adjusted to take account of partner or children, is
£11,590 or less, and ineligible if it is £20,740 or more.
Where it falls between these amounts there will be a more detailed
assessment. The individual’s annual disposable income will be
calculated, making deductions in respect of any income tax, national
insurance, council tax, housing expenses, childcare costs, maintenance
and cost of living expenses from the applicant’s adjusted
income. If his annual disposable income does not exceed £3,156,
the individual is financially eligible.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_47"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000027"></a>One of the concerns
noble Lords will recall was raised during the passage of the Bill was
about the need to avoid introducing delay. It is essential that
measures to control and refocus legal aid expenditure all support our
objective of making the criminal justice as speedy and efficient as
possible. There are therefore a number of elements built in to the new
system to militate against the risk of delay. For example, the old
system required applicants to provide substantial supporting
documentary evidence of means before legal aid could be granted, and
that led to adjournments. Now, in most cases, applications will need to
be accompanied only by the most recent monthly wage slip. Where an
applicant is in receipt of benefits, their national insurance number
will be sufficient, as court staff will have a dedicated real-time link
to the Department for Work and Pensions database to check it.</p><p><a name="06071893000028"></a>It is anticipated that correctly
completed forms will be processed well ahead of the first hearing, so
that in the majority of cases a defence solicitor knows from an early
stage whether or not his client is eligible. Solicitors will also be
under a duty to advise their client to apply for a representation order
immediately after charges are brought. However, where there is a delay
in reaching a determination of eligibility, the early-cover scheme will
apply. That will allow for a fixed-fee payment to defence solicitors to
cover initial preparatory work and representation at their
client’s first hearing, where an application is received within
two working days of charge, no decision on that application has been
made before 9 am on the day of the first hearing and the eventual
decision is that the case passes the merits test but the defendant does
not pass the means test. If the defendant arrives at court for the
first hearing unrepresented, representation can be provided through the
duty solicitors’ scheme. The early-cover scheme will also be
extended to cover cases where the client has been remanded in custody
pending appearance.</p><p><a name="06071893000029"></a>During the passage of
the Bill, noble Lords argued that there was a need for an appeal to the
court on financial eligibility. The Government accepted an amendment in
another place to enable regulations to provide for the Legal Services
Commission to refer a question to the High Court for its decision. We
have provided for that in the financial eligibility regulations, which
also set out that, where an applicant believes there has been an
administrative error or miscalculation in determining his financial
eligibility, he may apply to the Legal Services Commission for an
administrative review of the determining officer’s decision. The
appeals regulations also provide that, in circumstances where it is
alleged that the interests of justice have been applied incorrectly,
there will be a right of appeal to the court. In cases where the court
overturns a decision reached in respect of the interests of justice,
any application will still have to be referred back to the grant teams
for a formal determination of financial eligibility.</p><p><a name="06071893000030"></a>The draft regulations
recognise that while the means-testing scheme is sensitive to
individuals’ circumstances, there will be occasions where
applicants may fail the means test and yet may genuinely be unable to
pay for their defence costs. That may be because of unusually 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_48"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>high outgoings, or because they are involved in an unusually costly
case. Therefore, defendants will be able to apply for a review by a
dedicated hardship unit in the Legal Services Commission, either
alongside their initial application or following a decision that they
will not be eligible. The review will assess both the
applicant’s disposable income and the ability to meet the likely
costs of the case from that disposable income. It will require more
detailed information and fuller evidence on the applicant’s
financial circumstances as well as an estimate provided by the
solicitor as to the likely costs of the case. Where the estimate of
costs is unusually high, the solicitor will be required to provide
additional justification to support
that.</p><p><a name="06071893000031"></a>Throughout the development
of the Criminal Defence Service Act and the supporting regulations, we
have listened to stakeholders and are confident that, in doing so, we
have struck the right balance between fairness and efficiency. We
believe that the new system will be easy for defendants, solicitors and
court staff to use. I therefore commend the regulations to the
Committee.</p><p><a name="06071893000032"></a>Moved, That the Grand
Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal

Kingsland:</b> First, I thank the Minister, the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, for giving us such a clear exposition of three
rather complex orders. During the progress of the Bill, she kindly
provided us with some insight of what was likely to be in these
measures; and, to that extent, the comments that I am about to make can
be reasonably moderate, if not largely
complimentary.</p><p><a name="06071893000034"></a>One
of the big issues that has, rightly or wrongly, been decided and which
lies behind these orders, is whether or not decisions about financial
eligibility should in future be made judicially or administratively.
That battle has already been fought and lost by the Opposition; and I
do not intend to re-open it again. However, I have an observation about
the timing of these orders.</p><p><a name="06071893000035"></a>We
are now in the foothills of the implementation of the Carter report,
which is taking an overview of all legal aid matters. If the noble and
learned Lord the Lord Chancellor takes up even 50 per cent of what is
in the report, it looks as if we are in for dramatic changes. Would it
not have been better for the Government to have held their hand on the
question of costs in magistrates’ courts until the key decisions
on Carter had been made? I ask that not only in relation to the detail,
but with respect to the overall financial
envelope.</p><p><a name="06071893000036"></a>We know that, in Crown
Court cases, 50 per cent of the money is spent on 1 per cent of the
cases. We fervently hope that the noble and learned Lord will introduce
a system that dramatically cuts that amount. If that is the case, can
the noble Baroness assure us that, if big savings are made, these
eligibility figures will be reviewed? I would not like the lower and
upper limits contained in the financial eligibility order to be set in
stone for any longer than it takes the 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_49"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government to implement the Carter measures. I would like to think that
the noble Baroness or, perish the thought, any of her successors might
come to your Lordships’ House at an appropriate moment to review
them.</p><p><a name="06071893000037"></a>In addition to those
general comments, I have one or two questions of detail, none of which
will surprise the noble Baroness. She is well aware of an issue that
formed the background to the discussions on Carter, and which was the
subject of several speeches made during the progress of the Bill. It
will come as no surprise to her that one of our concerns is with regard
to the geographical distribution of solicitors, in particular, and,
more generally, that of other legal advisers, implied by the financial
eligibility test. We do not know what impact it will have on the
business viability of legal advisers and we would like to think that
the department will keep this matter under constant
review.</p><p><a name="06071893000038"></a>Sometimes, for example,
we may find that someone qualifies under the financial eligibility
criteria and yet, because they are a long way away from a solicitor,
they are unable in reality to take advantage of it, or they will be
penalised despite the fact that they qualify. I know that the citizens
advice bureaux often provide a useful stand in but they themselves are
under great strain at the
moment.</p><h5><a name="06071893000247"></a>3.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06071893000039"></a>In the
other place, the Minister, Mrs Vera Baird, suggested that the telephone
line system which operates at the moment may provide a viable
substitute—and that may well be true in certain
cases—but, in my submission, someone who appears as a defendant
at a magistrates’ court, particularly if it is for the first
time, would probably not feel that they had had the kind of
comprehensive legal advice they would have liked to have had just
through a telephone call. I say that simply as an observation on an
issue that the noble Baroness should keep under
review.</p><p><a name="06071893000040"></a>One of the costs of not
being legally represented, and therefore having to represent oneself,
is that, as a consequence of one’s unfamiliarity with the law
and procedure, cases tend to go on longer. If, as a result of this, the
percentage of unrepresented defendants increases in magistrates’
courts, and consequently the length of trial extends, we may find that
all the savings we had hoped to make by these measures are lost because
of the extra costs of running the courts. So that is another factor
that I hope the noble Baroness will keep under
review.</p><p><a name="06071893000041"></a>I do
not know whether this is a fair question to put to the noble Baroness
in conclusion, but I am going to put it anyway. She indicated in her
closing observations that we were a few months away from a similar
system being brought to your Lordships’ House to deal with Crown
Court matters. Plainly, the department has already been looking at that
in some detail and will already have taken a view about the extent to
which what is going to be proposed is similar to the
magistrates’ court system and the extent to which it is
different. I hope the noble Baroness, in her concluding remarks, will
be able to say something about that.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_50"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000042"></a>I expect that the key difficulty, the sand
in the machinery, of the financial eligibility order—if, indeed,
there is to be some sand in the machinery—will occur in relation
to Regulation 14. Plainly the system is at its most vulnerable where
there is a proceeding in a magistrates’ court which is likely to
go on for a long time. You may find that someone does not qualify for a
representation order because their disposable income is above
£20,000 a year and yet they are faced with a very long case in
the magistrates’ court. Paragraph 14 provides for that
situation; but it seems to me to be quite a stiff hurdle for an
applicant to negotiate. I would like the noble Baroness’s
assurance that she is aware of that and will be particularly concerned
to keep that matter under
review.</p><p><a name="06071893000043"></a>Having said all that, I
thank the noble Baroness for bringing these matters to the Committee
and, with no more ado, sit
down.</p><p><a name="06071893000044"></a><b><a name="06071893000259"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> I, too, thank the noble
Baroness for her exposition of these three sets of regulations relating
to the Criminal Defence Service. When the state-funded Criminal Defence
Service was started up some years ago, I opposed it and the passage of
the legislation through the House. I subsequently discovered that it
was in fact providing a spirited and independent service in the few
centres where it had been set up—in Birmingham, Liverpool,
Cheltenham and elsewhere. I was very impressed with the work it was
doing, not least because I was instructed by it to appear in the
divisional court in certain cases, where I thought a very independent
line was being taken. I have since addressed its annual conference and
a quote from me appears in its annual report. So I hope the noble
Baroness appreciates my point of view.</p><p><a name="06071893000045"></a>In my early years as a solicitor, I spent
my time in the magistrates’ court learning my trade. It did not
pay in the early 1960s and it certainly does not pay now. One reason
why I moved from one side of the profession to the other was that I was
the one partner in the firm who was not making any money. I got fed up
with my brother and others making a lot of money, so I decided that it
was time to
go.</p><p><a name="06071893000046"></a>One of the
problems arising here has been touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland—the coming together of this approach in these orders
with the Carter report. The report, for the first time, seems to
address the very important issue of how you build into the legal aid
system incentives to do cases quickly and efficiently. One of the
problems causing the expenditure to which the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, referred—50 per cent of legal aid
expenditure goes on 1 per cent of cases—is the culture whereby a
case can run on and on, with various applications being made, some of
little worth, because the way in which people were paid encouraged
time-wasting. That has been addressed by the Carter report, but I do
not think that these orders deal with that sort of problem.</p><p><a name="06071893000047"></a>One difficulty is in the eligibility
rules: £20,740 is not a very high income. If you earn more than
that, you get no legal aid at all. It says in the accompanying notes
that only 1 per cent of those who appear in 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_51"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>magistrates’ courts—and there are 2 million of
them—earn more than £20,740 a year. I find that a very
hard statistic to believe and I would like to know what the basis of it
is. It seems to me that people with incomes that are barely average and
those with incomes above that are frequent attenders in the
magistrates’ court.</p><p><a name="06071893000048"></a>The
area between £11,000 and £20,000 is where the problem
lies. Means-tested legal aid has been tried before and, as the noble
Baroness knows, it was a failure. It cost so much to deal with the
bureaucracy involved in proving income, and so on, that it did not save
any money. The proposal now is that a person’s wage slip for one
month will be sufficient, or their national insurance number if they
are in receipt of benefits. I do not see that system lasting for very
long because it is open to all sorts of
abuse.</p><p><a name="06071893000049"></a>I think it is likely that
less legal aid will be available. That is the purpose of the
order—to cut down on costs. That means that it will become even
more unprofitable to do cases in the magistrates’ court than it
was in my early years. What follows from that and from the Carter
report is that firms simply will not undertake legal aid. Something
like 2,700 firms of solicitors take legal aid cases at the moment, but
I can see that figure dropping rapidly. Solicitors do not provide a
public service for nothing; obviously they have to make a reasonable
income out of what they do. Undoubtedly there will be deserts in the
country where representation will not be readily available because a
solicitor is sometimes needed at very short notice. I fear that this
will be an enormous disincentive to the legal profession to be involved
in legal aid work and that it will therefore lead to a lack of
representation.</p><p><a name="06071893000050"></a>I make this
point. A defendant who is represented and whose case is put, one hopes,
succinctly and well by professionals to a court saves money. A person
who represents himself will go on for ever. Your Lordships will know
that from the fact that the professional lawyers in this House talk at
much shorter length than
others.</p><p><a name="06071893000051"></a><b><a name="06071893000260"></a>Noble
Lords:</b>
Oh!</p><p><a name="06071893000052"></a><b><a name="06071893000261"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> I may as
well say that—we all know what interests I have to declare. My
point is that a case well put will be put without delay and money will
be saved. The appeal system, which was put in after some pressure
following consultation, will enable appeals to be made only on the
ground of the interest of justice and not on financial grounds. But, of
course, constant applications and appeals cost money and cause delay,
and what is gained by reducing legal aid may be lost by the greater
time spent in court dealing with cases where people are appealing or
where, alternatively, there is no representation at
all.</p><p><a name="06071893000053"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, said, setting these arbitrary financial limits may cause an
imbalance. Average incomes are higher in London than they are, for
example, in Wales, and one can see that we will have an imbalance in
that people whose standard of living is no higher in metropolitan areas

<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_52"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will nevertheless be above the threshold of the financial limit because
their incomes will appear to be higher. So I do not think that this
across-the-board financial limit, which takes no account of the costs
of metropolitan living and the incomes that are gained here, is
necessarily a very good one. I hope that the noble Baroness can tell me
either that I am wrong in my assessment and that the limit will not be
across the board or that, in the future, some account will be taken of
that as the scheme comes into
operation.</p><p><a name="06071893000054"></a>I
understand that a national agency is to be set up. National agencies
have been a disaster. The Criminal Assets Recovery Agency, of which I
have some experience, has cost taxpayers around £60 million
since 2003 and has recovered £8 million. It is easy to farm
these things out to agencies but is it cost-effective? The difference
there of something like £70 million or £74 million would,
in any event, pay for a fair amount of magistrates’ court
representation over a year. So setting up an agency and taking this
work away from the magistrates’ court or from government
departments generally is not necessarily the best way to
proceed.</p><p><a name="06071893000055"></a>My verdict on these
orders is: wait and see—the traditional Asquithian view. I
strongly suspect that there will be unforeseen consequences and that
the scheme will have to be revised, just as the abolition of
means-testing was revised by these orders. It is the ongoing problems
that I am sure will come before us again in the not-too-distant
future.</p><h5><a name="06071893000248"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06071893000056"></a><b><a name="06071893000262"></a>Baroness
Ashton of Upholland:</b> I thank the noble Lords,
Lord Kingsland and Lord Thomas of Gresford, for the spirit in which
they have debated these regulations. I accept that noble Lords have
indicated a number of areas where they want to make sure the department
and Ministers involved keep an eye on what happens. In my closing
remarks I will tackle some of the questions they have raised.</p><p><a name="06071893000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, talked about the fact that there was no appeal. However, we
introduced, as a Liberal Democrat amendment in another place, the
ability of the LSC to refer questions to the High Court. We have also
made sure there is an administrative review, because we want people who
feel they have been incorrectly assessed to be able to go back to the
LSC and say, “I want this looked at again”. That is very
important. There is also the ability to go back and talk about
particular concerns about hardship. We think we have the elements
there. I know this is not as far as noble Lords originally wanted us to
go, but we believe we have created a system—which we will keep
under review—that will enable us to ensure that we assess people
properly.</p><p><a name="06071893000058"></a>I
accept too that in the foothills of Carter, as the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, described it, we need to ensure that this all fits together.
We see what the noble Lord, Lord Carter, has said, in his comprehensive
consideration of the legal system, as part and parcel of a number of
changes we are seeking to make. As noble Lords will know, the
consultation takes place over the next three months. The noble
Lord’s proposals are one part of our consideration of the
criminal justice system and the reform programme, and these regulations

<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_53"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>represent another part of that. We do not see them in contradiction with
each other, however, but as complementary. The noble Lord was fully
aware of that situation when carrying out his review.</p><p><a name="06071893000059"></a>I
take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about keeping the
figures under review as we implement the Carter proposals, however the
consultation turns out. I accept that we should do that, and commit
that we will, to ensure that the eligibility criteria are assessed from
time to time to make sure we have got them about right.</p><p><a name="06071893000060"></a>As for concern about the coverage of
legal aid practitioners, noble Lords will know that the LSC has been
piloting the telephone helpline, CDS Direct. I take the point about the
citizens advice bureaux being an important partner, but also recognise
that it does a huge amount of work, for which I pay tribute to
it.</p><p><a name="06071893000061"></a>As we
have said, the court duty solicitor will remain. In his report, the
noble Lord, Lord Carter, acknowledges, with regard to geographical
distribution, that one size does not fit all. There will be regional
consultation from the Legal Services Commission to ensure that we have
coverage in each locality as appropriate. I agree with noble Lords that
that is an important part of what we need to do.</p><p><a name="06071893000062"></a>Then, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland,
said, there is the business viability of solicitors. The noble Lord,
Lord Thomas of Gresford, described his own experiences in that regard.
We must ensure that we have thriving businesses for solicitors who are
able to do this work. There is no desire on our part to do anything
other than ensure that, but we need to do so in a way that addresses
our concerns about legal aid spending. As I indicated in these
regulations, one of the issues is the rebalancing of legal aid in the
context of the civil and family courts.</p><p><a name="06071893000063"></a>The noble Lord also
asked me about unrepresented defendants. We have figures for the 12
months to December 2003. I do not have more recent figures with me, but
if we have any I will let noble Lords have them. The number of
defendants in magistrates’ courts was over 1.8 million, but only
630,000 representation orders were granted for the same period; so
about two-thirds were represented by the court duty solicitor, paid
privately or were unrepresented. I do not have a breakdown of those
figures, but the numbers are significant. I accept that there are
issues about those who are unrepresented perhaps taking more time
within the court system, and that there are consequences of that in
terms of cost. However, things are running pretty smoothly in most
magistrates’ courts, and we will monitor the situation to ensure
that remains the case.</p><p><a name="06071893000064"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was concerned about real incomes,
costs and regional differences, particularly in south-east London. The
means assessment provides for housing costs to be taken into
consideration. The noble Lord knows well that housing costs are one of
the main considerations and drivers behind regional differences in
income, so we should be able to militate against unfairness. But if
regional factors prove to be decisive, we will look more closely at
them—we are alive to regional issues. We think that we have
covered them and we are alive to the fact that housing is an important
issue.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_54"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000065"></a>We have debated the £20,740
threshold. Of course, that is adjusted to reflect family circumstances.
Defendants may earn in excess of that but, if they have children, they
may qualify. That is the threshold where we introduce issues such as
family needs and so on, so there is not necessarily a cut-off at
£20,740.</p><p><a name="06071893000066"></a>We have not set
up a new national agency. In fact, the Courts Service will carry out
the means test on behalf of the Legal Services Commission under a
contract between them. In part, that reflects our desire to ensure that
we have consistency across the country, but we will also have within
the Legal Services Commission dedicated staff to tackle complex and
high-risk cases, as well as those who will look at hardship. We have
deliberately not gone down the route of setting up a new national
agency for the reasons that the noble Lord
gave.</p><p><a name="06071893000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, asked me to say what the Crown Court scheme might look like.
Your Lordships will be kept in touch regarding the development of the
scheme. At the moment, the proposed features are that financial
eligibility will be subject to the same test that is adopted in the
magistrates’ court but, where a defendant is financially
ineligible, he will be asked to make an income-based contribution to
the costs of the case. Frankly, few defendants will be able to afford
to pay the entire costs of a Crown Court defence. The scheme might
include a capital contribution based on liquid capital assets held in
banks and building societies. As noble Lords know, we will be looking
potentially to pilot any such scheme in a prescribed area, as provided
for in Section 3(3) of the Criminal Defence Service Act 2006, for a
specified period not exceeding 12 months. That may enable us to look at
the matter in more detail.</p></body></html><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60718-gc0155.htm"/>
<p><a name="06071893000068"></a>Those
are the elements of the scheme thus far and, as I have indicated, I
will make sure that we keep noble Lords in touch with any other issues
that arise. I think that I have answered most, if not all, of the
questions raised, except for one, which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas,
asked concerning adequate remuneration for
solicitors.</p><p><a name="06071893000069"></a>I remind noble Lords
that the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, is talking about a new
procurement and payment scheme for legal aid. The Legal Services
Commission proposes to move to fixed and graduated fees from April 2007
for a wide variety of civil and family work and for most immigration
work. That will enable us to promote and reward effective working by
suppliers and will restructure funding in family disputes more towards
early and amicable resolution wherever possible and away from contested
court litigation. That will enable us to promote efficiency, to which
the noble Lord referred, and we hope that that will contribute towards
ensuring that the costs are used to the best effect. I hope that I have
answered all the questions that noble Lords have
asked.</p><p><a name="06071893000070"></a>On Question, Motion

Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Data
Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order
2006.</p><p><a name="06071893000078"></a>The noble Baroness said:
The order facilitates payment card issuers—that is, banks and
building societies—in processing sensitive personal data,
provided by law enforcement agencies, on customers who have received
convictions or cautions for crimes in relation to child abuse images
where their payment card was used to commit the offence.</p><p><a name="06071893000079"></a>Card issuers’ contracts usually
allow removal of a payment card or the closure of an account when it
has been used to make an illegal purchase. However, card issuers need
access to accurate information on illegal purchases and on whether
their customers have been cautioned or convicted of an offence. Without
that information, it is difficult for the card issuers to exercise
their contractual rights and to remove the cards or close the accounts
if they wish to do so. While some card issuers can already process
these data based on the explicit consent of customers, others do not
have adequate terms and conditions in their contracts. The order
provides the necessary safeguards to permit the processing of data
passed by law enforcement authorities to card issuers. The data on the
offender will go directly to the card issuer who may, if they wish, act
on the information. The processing of the data will be supported by a
memorandum of understanding.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_56"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000080"></a>The background legislation is set out in
the Data Protection Act 1998. As noble Lords will know better than I
do, the Act sets out how organisations use the personal information
they hold on individuals. The data include how they acquire, store,
process, share or dispose of information. Specific measures within the
Act ensure that individuals’ sensitive personal data are
processed in a manner that provides them with an appropriate level of
protection. Under the power in Schedule 3(10), the Secretary of State
may make an order setting out further circumstances where processing of
sensitive personal data can take place.</p><p><a name="06071893000081"></a>The order marks the completion of
collaboration between my department, the Association for Payment
Clearing Services, known as APACS, the UK trade association for
payments and institutions that delivers payment services to customers
and represents large numbers of card issuers, along with the Child
Exploitation and Online Protection Centre—known as CEOP, a
national resource that brings together law enforcement officers,
specialist children’s charities and industry, all seeking to
tackle the growing problem of child abuse. We are also, of course,
working closely with our colleagues in the Home Office.</p><p><a name="06071893000082"></a>APACS and the Child Exploitation and
Online Protection Centre approached my department seeking a way forward
to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place to facilitate the
appropriate processing by card issuers of convictions and cautions data
from law enforcement authorities. Both organisations were very keen to
act, and my department and the Home Office are very keen to support
them.</p><p><a name="06071893000083"></a>When
making such an order, my department is required to consult the
Information Commissioner’s Office, whose role, as noble Lords
will know, is to ensure that personal information is properly protected
and to prosecute those who commit offences under the Data Protection
Act. The Information Commissioner’s Office was broadly content
with the order but had some reservations regarding closure of accounts.
We do not agree with the reservations. If the order did not allow for
the closure of accounts and the debit card was used, the card issuer
could cancel the card but would then have to keep open the account of
an individual whom they knew had broken the terms and conditions of the
card and the
account.</p><p><a name="06071893000084"></a>We
feel that it is appropriate to allow card issuers, if they see fit, to
process data on the closing of accounts based on a breach of terms and
conditions—in other words, the contract between the customer and
the supplier of the card. We do not wish to permit them to process this
information for one purpose and then to turn a blind eye to conviction
for other
purposes.</p><p><a name="06071893000085"></a>The
order does not set up a list of those who have had their cards removed
on this basis. The information on convictions and cautions, if passed
to the card issuers, is purely to allow them to decide whether the card
in commission has been used for an offence that constitutes a breach of
contract. While processing the data, card issuers must comply with the
principles of the Data Protection Act; they must not keep the data
longer than necessary. The details of the offences will not be passed
to credit reference agencies or to other card issuers unconnected with
that particular card.

further or second punishment. These are not criminal
sanctions.</p><p><a name="06071893000086"></a>The processing of the
data allows the card issuers to exercise their contractual rights. When
individuals use the card for illegal purposes, they contravene their
contractual agreement with the card issuer and, as a result, their
contract may be
terminated.</p><p><a name="06071893000087"></a>When
the card involved belongs to joint accounts, the innocent party will be
told that the card has been removed or the account closed due to a
breach of terms and conditions. They will not be given any further
details. Any outstanding monies will be returned to the parties as
appropriate and the innocent person in this context will not suffer any
detriment.</p><p><a name="06071893000088"></a>Noble Lords will be
as aware, as I am, that the viewing of child abuse images is not a

Kingsland:</b> I am most grateful to the noble
Baroness for her clear exposition of the order. It seems to me that
there are three issues arising from its contents. First, would the
innocent joint cardholder be told why the card was withdrawn? The noble
Baroness effectively covered that point in her opening remarks, and the
answer is, satisfactorily, no. Plainly, the innocent party would be
told that his or her partner had breached the terms and conditions of
the contract; but there would be no obligation to go any further than
that—indeed, it is prohibited to go any further than that. That
is an entirely satisfactory response from the Government.</p><p><a name="06071893000091"></a>Secondly, does the order guarantee that
there would be no prejudice to the innocent partner taking out a new
account on his or her behalf? It seems to me that, once again, the
noble Baroness has answered that question satisfactorily. If there was
any doubt that the innocent party would be prejudiced, I am in no doubt
whatever that the Government would take steps to ensure that that could
not happen.</p><p><a name="06071893000092"></a>The final issue
relates to the criminal data that form the basis of the knowledge for
the bank or financial institution to remove the card. Once the contract
had been cancelled and the card removed, would that criminal
documentation remain on the files of the bank or the finance firm? Once
again, I understand that the answer to that question is no; that would
serve no useful function and it would, in my view, be inappropriate for
a number of reasons for it to
remain.</p><p><a name="06071893000093"></a>Those three questions

the data to cases where there have been cautions and not only to cases
where there have been convictions. We know that cautions are given only
in first offence cases and where a case is so minor that it does not
justify the imposition of a sentence by the court. Given that the loss
of the card and the possible closing of the account may cause
considerable practical difficulties, both immediately and in the
future, to any person to whom it happens, is the noble Baroness
satisfied that this is necessarily wholly proportionate? I assume that
if this information is provided there will be no opportunity to look at
the merits of any individual case in order to decide whether or not
withdrawal is appropriate.</p><p><a name="06071893000096"></a>I
recognise, of course, that what is happening here is, in a sense,
merely the giving of information of a breach of contract, but I do not
think that that in itself is sufficient to justify it. This contains
very much a protection-of-the-children element and I would be
interested to hear why the noble Baroness feels it is necessary to
extend this to cases of cautions and not merely to
convictions.</p><p><a name="06071893000097"></a><b><a name="06071893000268"></a>Baroness
Ashton of Upholland:</b> I am grateful for the
comments of both noble Lords. I am delighted that I had answered the
three questions of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Indeed, everything
that the noble Lord said about the answers to the questions was
absolutely correct. I am grateful to him for his support and for
recognising that the order is
justified.</p><p><a name="06071893000098"></a>The
current position is that the police send information to the credit card
companies when someone is cautioned, convicted or reprimanded. The
issue has been that under the Data Protection Act they could not use
that information without the permission of the individual. We have
simply removed that prohibition for this very particular set of
circumstances. This is about the prevention of re-offending. I hope
that if we and the credit card companies publicise this measure it may
act as a deterrent, which would be a good
thing.</p><p><a name="06071893000099"></a>When someone is
cautioned, it is an acceptance of guilt. It will be up to the credit
card companies if they wish to differentiate. The question for them
will be whether they consider that the breach of contract which has
taken place is sufficient for them to close the account and/or to
remove the card. Whether or not they choose to do so is entirely a
matter for them; it is not for us to say. It is for them to weigh up
the situation, and we do not wish to be involved in the relationship
between them and their customers and how they choose to
act.</p><p><a name="06071893000100"></a>It states
on my note that we consider these to be serious crimes. I cannot put it
any better. We need to do everything we can to disrupt and curtail the
activities of those involved in downloading abusive images of children.
As I have already indicated, these are children 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_59"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who have been abused in order for the image to exist at all. It is not
disproportionate to say that in these particular circumstances, where
the credit card companies have said that they would prefer to be able
to consider whether someone should hold a credit card if it has been
used for that purpose, we should give them access to the information.
While I understand that the noble Lord may feel that there are varying
degrees of offence, if someone is cautioned there is no question that
they have committed the offence. It is then for the credit card
companies to determine what action they wish to
take.</p><p><a name="06071893000101"></a>We think that this is a
very small but important step. The industry came to us to discuss the
matter and we have been pleased to respond. We are working closely with
the industry and, where we can act, we should act. In this case, we
think we should. I commend the order to the
Committee.</p><p><a name="06071893000102"></a>On Question, Motion

Reform (Registered Designs) Order
2006</h3><h5><a name="06071893000250"></a>4.25
pm</h5><p><a name="06071893000103"></a><b><a name="06071893000269"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and
Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):</b> rose to
move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has
considered the Regulatory Reform (Registered Designs) Order
2006.</p><p><a name="06071893000104"></a>The noble Lord said: This
order is all about providing the public with a designs registration
system that is as quick, accessible and easy to use as possible. It
will make it possible to administer the Registered Designs Act 1949 far
more in tune with modern trading conditions and also in a manner
consistent with the registered Community design system offered by the
Community trade marks and designs office in Alicante, which grants a
single unitary right across all 25 member states.</p><p><a name="06071893000105"></a>Prior to the registered Community design
system becoming operational in April 2003, the UK received around
two-thirds of its design applications through intellectual property
agents, the remainder being received directly from individual designers
or small businesses. However, the situation now is that 95 per cent of
newly registered designs, which are effective in the UK, are registered
at Community level. As a result, the user base of the national designs
registry has reversed, with about two-thirds of the total number of
applications coming from small businesses without any legal
representation. There are, therefore, still recognised benefits to the
businesses that do not need, or cannot afford, to register their
designs at Community level in being able to register their designs in
the UK alone. This is partly because prior disclosure in any member
state, especially through registration, will put a designer in a strong
position to resist and, if necessary, to invalidate any Community or
national design registration gained by a competitor at a later date.
These proposals will therefore be of considerable interest to designs
applicants and to the intellectual property profession.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_60"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000106"></a>The procedure of applying for the
registration of new designs will be simplified. Unnecessary burdens
will be removed, yet care has been taken to ensure that these new
measures do not undermine the interests of the public in general. In
particular, the introduction of a multiple design application system
will offer savings in terms of the time taken to complete an
application to register a number of designs at the same time and also
savings with a new fee structure to reduce the cost of registering such
multiple designs.</p><p><a name="06071893000107"></a>My department has
consulted widely and has met with a cross-section of individual
designers, as well as with representatives of the legal profession who
specialise in intellectual property. I am satisfied that these
proposals are accepted as sound and that they reduce processing
complexity without unduly affecting the balance between rights holders
and third parties. As such, they have been welcomed by those who
represent the interests of small and larger businesses alike.</p><p><a name="06071893000108"></a>Articles 3 to 5 of the
draft order seek to remove burdens from the examination process by
stopping the requirement on the registrar to satisfy himself that the
design passes the tests of novelty and individual character. At
present, only a minority of designs in the marketplace is registered.
That had made examination of these grounds very problematic, as such
designs are not available to be searched in the registers maintained by
the national and Community authorities. This matter was compounded by
the new criterion for novelty introduced when the designs directive was
implemented in the United Kingdom in 2001, as practically every earlier
design in any marketplace in the world must be considered. This makes
it impossible for an examiner to carry out a conclusive search in all
the relevant overseas territories in order to satisfy himself that a
design is indeed a new one.</p><p><a name="06071893000109"></a>These problems led the Patent Office to
take the decision in 1999 to limit the number of applications it
examined to cases where a particular examiner was aware of relevant
early designs. The uncertain and somewhat arbitrary nature of this
process will be abandoned when these changes take effect because the
registrar will no longer be able to refuse to register a design on the
grounds of lack of novelty or individual character. This will thus
remove the current uncertainty as to whether, and to what extent, any
particular design was searched and determined to be new before it was
registered.</p><p><a name="06071893000110"></a>Articles 11 to 14 of
the draft order seek to introduce a multiple design application system
so that applicants or their professional representatives may file as
many designs under the cover of one application as they wish and
without any administrative restrictions. This new system will largely
align us with other national systems as well as with the registered
Community design
system.</p><p><a name="06071893000111"></a>Article
15 of the draft order deletes the prohibition on the public inspection
of certain classes of registered designs contained in Sections 22(2)
and 22(3) of the 1949 Act. This prohibition means that some classes of
registered designs cannot be inspected by the general public for a
period of two or three years after registration, even though they may
be enforced against third parties 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_61"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>during that period. It is proposed that new rules made under the
Registered Designs Act will require an applicant to provide his consent
for the publication of any new design filed at the registry. Such
consent may be withheld for up to 12 months, but the designs will not
be registered until consent has been given. Once it is given, the
designs will be published immediately after registration. This new
provision will also give applicants a degree of control over the timing
of the publication and consequent registration of their designs to
coincide with launching a new product on to the
market.</p><p><a name="06071893000112"></a>Article 17 of the draft
order is designed to make it easier for a proprietor to restore a
registration that he has allowed to lapse due to non-payment of the
renewal fee. It will have no impact on the general public other than to
ensure that the proprietors of registered designs are able to reinstate
their legitimate rights in a greater number of
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06071893000113"></a>I
thank the Members of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee for finding that the present proposals are appropriate to be
made under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 and for recommending them to
the House. The Committee in another place has also considered the
proposals. It concluded that they remove burdens within the meaning of
the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 without removing any necessary
protections or preventing the exercise of any existing rights or
freedoms. Both committees have now unanimously recommended that the
order be approved. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06071893000114"></a>Moved, That the Grand
Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft
Regulatory Reform (Registered Designs) Order 2006 [<I>23rd Report from
the Regulatory Reform Committee</I>].—(<I>Lord Sainsbury of
Turville</I>.)</p><h5><a name="06071893000251"></a>4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06071893000115"></a><b><a name="06071893000270"></a>Lord
De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining
this draft order in some detail. The regulatory impact assessment
states that the aims of the order are:</p><ul><a name="06071893000241"></a>“to encourage more businesses
to seek registration; encourage UK businesses to innovate; reduce the
level of copying of new designs in the UK; make the system fairer for
all applicants”.</ul><a name="06071893000234"></a>These are laudable aims.
<p><a name="06071893000116"></a>We notice that this system runs in
parallel with the Community design system that was brought about by the
designs directive. Can the Minister tell the Committee whether it is
possible for a UK company to have an approved design under the UK Act
and for another company to have an identical, or very similar, design
approved under the EC system? If so, what happens when the other
company starts to sell its product in the UK in competition with the
product of the UK company? Which one is protected from the
other?</p><p><a name="06071893000117"></a>We welcome the proposal
to reduce the standard of care required for restoration of lapsed
design registrations to match the standards in other forms of
intellectual property protection.</p><p><a name="06071893000118"></a>On the proposal to end
substantive examination for novelty, the order would remove a burden
and would introduce some procedural clarity, albeit that there 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_62"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be slightly greater legal uncertainty, because a few more invalid
applications would be granted than hitherto. I have a concern that the
ending of substantive examination prior to grant of approval might lead
to an increase in costs for those—we hope very few— who
end up in court. Have the Government considered an optional substantive
examination, which could be offered at the cost of the applicant, the
results of which would be binding and would therefore remove the need
for subsequent litigation? It would give applicants confidence that,
having made an application, they need not worry that they might yet
have to contest their right to it in
court.</p><p><a name="06071893000119"></a>I also note that the
report of the Regulatory Reform Committee of the House of Commons
indicated its support for the draft order, as the Minister mentioned,
subject to slight revision to ensure consistency in the references in
Articles 8 and 9 to “sections of this Act”. That revision
seems to be appropriate, and was accepted by the Patent Office. We have
no objection to the proposal to allow multiple applications, although
we have no evidence on which to judge the savings that would accrue.
There is potential for lower costs, but that depends on the level of
the fees for
applications.</p><p><a name="06071893000120"></a>We
support the proposal to make all designs open to public inspection.
Indeed, we think that the proposal could go further. The Patents Act
1977 changed patent law to open most of the Patent Office
correspondence files of published patents to third-party inspection.
The same measure was enacted for trade marks by the Trade Marks Act
1994. The files of Community designs are open to public inspection.
There is therefore no reason to keep the correspondence files of
published registered designs secret. To do so also appears contrary to
the spirit of open government. We do not see why the files of designs,
unlike any other UK form of intellectual property and unlike Community
designs, should be kept secret. Indeed, the files should be opened to
allow third parties more effectively to do the job of challenging bad
registrations from which the registry proposes to resign. For example,
where priority is claimed, the public should have access to the
priority document and any translation thereof. Can the Minister make
any commitments in this
regard?</p><p><a name="06071893000121"></a><b><a name="06071893000271"></a>Lord
Razzall:</b> I join the noble Lord,
Lord de Mauley, in thanking the Minister for the way in which he has
explained quite a complicated issue. The Minister will know that I have
consistently in this Room and on the Floor of the House congratulated
the department on how it conducts its consultation exercises. That has
not yet persuaded me that my party should abandon our policy of
abolishing the Department of Trade and Industry, but it will be
important that the culture of consultation survives the transfer of
functions as they go to other
departments.</p><p><a name="06071893000122"></a>There
is only one point that concerns me about the consultation. I certainly
welcome the proposition that the novelty test should be abandoned. I am
slightly concerned that in the public consultation exercise the
Chartered Institute of Patent Agents suggested that the registry should
consider alternative approaches to the registration process, such as
the Australia model, 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_63"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where applications are never examined unless the validity of the design
is challenged in litigation proceedings. I am not certain why the
Government have simply rejected that proposal, which goes slightly
further than what they are suggesting. There is a slightly strange
sentence in the regulatory impact assessment, which states
that,</p><ul><a name="06071893000242"></a>“despite some
concern over the exact process of examination,
they”</ul><a name="06071893000235"></a>the
CIPA—<ul><a name="06071893000243"></a>“agreed
that the Registry should either ‘search or not search’
and that the present situation should be
clarified”.</ul><a name="06071893000236"></a>That
does not seem to me to answer the question of why the CIPA
recommendation has been rejected. I should be grateful if the Minister
could explain that.<p><a name="06071893000123"></a>In
general, we support the order and think that it is a very important
reform.</p><p><a name="06071893000124"></a><b><a name="06071893000272"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> I am grateful to both
speakers for making those points. I think that the first is relatively
easy to answer. Obviously, it is possible for the same design to be
registered at a national and a Community level. In those circumstances,
the latter design registration would be liable to be declared invalid
and registering the earlier design will make it easier to enforce and
protect it. If you later register a design in the Community which
covers the UK but someone can point to an earlier design in the UK, it
is clear that that is the one that is declared
valid.</p><p><a name="06071893000125"></a>On searches, it is
possible for a person to ask the Patent Office Search and Advisory
Service to search prior art. That is a commercial service charged at
commercial rates. However, the search extends only to registered
designs, not to designs in the market place that may have anticipated
the demands. So, in this particular case, there is a commercial service
but it applies only to the registered designs. I think that the
Australian model could not be effected without requiring primary
legislation, but I will write to the noble Lord on that point. I
commend the order to the Committee.</p><p><a name="06071893000126"></a>On Question, Motion agreed

(Consequential Amendment to Statutory Adoption Pay) Order
2006.</p><p><a name="06071893000128"></a>The
noble Lord said: As Members of the Committee will be aware, the Work
and Families Act 2006 achieved Royal Assent last month. The Act seeks
to deliver a number of the Government’s commitments set out in
the Pre-Budget Report of 2004 and in the Government’s response
to the work and families consultation in 2005.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000129"></a>The regulations on
maternity and adoption leave represent the next step in that ongoing
process. Before turning to the detail of these regulations, I would
like to say a little about the work and families package in general.
This is a significant programme, designed to offer practical and very
real support for working families, while bringing forward a number of
measures which employers have told us would be helpful for
them.</p><p><a name="06071893000130"></a>We all recognise that
families today face increasing challenges in balancing their home and
working responsibilities. It has to be right to offer children the best
start in life, but this also has to be achieved against the demands of
creating an increasingly competitive economy. The result is that many
families struggle to find this balance. This problem will become more
acute as we are likely to see more and more of our workforce needing to
take time out of the labour market during their careers to care for
children or elderly relatives, or both.</p><p><a name="06071893000131"></a>Business knows that to succeed it needs
to employ the most talented workforce it can. Many employers now
realise that an integral part of any strategy aimed at achieving this
includes giving employees the opportunity to strike the right balance
between work and family life. This gives employers access to a wider
pool of talent to recruit from in the first place, and there is
increasing evidence showing that a healthy work-life balance reduces
staff turnover, reduces absenteeism and raises morale.</p><p><a name="06071893000132"></a>The regulations before us today respond
to these changing patterns of employment and seek to provide genuine
choices about balancing work and family life in the crucial first
months, and genuine support for employers in ensuring that the balance
works for them too.</p><p><a name="06071893000133"></a>I am very
proud of the Government’s track record in introducing measures
to support working families. We have already created more than 1
million additional childcare places; guaranteed all three and four
year-olds a free part-time nursery place; and improved financial
support through increased child benefit and working tax credits.
Working families have benefited from improved maternity leave and pay,
new rights to paternity and adoption leave and the right to request
flexible working.</p><p><a name="06071893000134"></a>These regulations
deliver a number of measures which will benefit both working families
and their employers. They result from the close consultation with
stakeholders, including parents’ groups, trade unions,
businesses and their representative organisations, and
individuals.</p><p><a name="06071893000135"></a>The Government also
worked closely with an advisory group of human resource experts, set up
to look at how we could introduce these changes whilst minimising any
additional burden on employers. A clear objective throughout the
planning of the work and families legislation has been to establish a
framework of rights and responsibilities for both employers and
employees, consistent with the Government’s better regulation
agenda.</p><p><a name="06071893000136"></a>Some elements of the
regulations derive from powers in the Work and Families Act, while
others depend on prior primary legislation. The regulations are due to
come into force in October this year, in line 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_65"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with our commitment to common commencement dates for new employment
legislation, and will apply to women whose babies are due on or after 1
April 2007 and to adopters whose children are expected to be placed
with them on or after that
date.</p><p><a name="06071893000137"></a>Turning
to the detail, the new regulations will mean that all pregnant
employees can take up 52 weeks’ maternity leave. At present, all
pregnant employees are entitled to 26 weeks’ ordinary maternity
leave, and most to a further 26 weeks’ additional maternity
leave. However, around 20,000 women per year are excluded from
additional maternity leave because they have not worked for their
employer for long enough to qualify.</p><h5><a name="06071893000253"></a>4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06071893000138"></a>This means
that if the Government took no action to remedy the situation, when
maternity pay is extended to nine months from April 2007 those women
would be entitled to the extended pay but not the leave that would
allow them to benefit from it. These regulations remove this
inconsistency by removing the existing qualifying criteria for
additional maternity leave so that all women will be able to take up to
52 weeks, if they wish, and to make full use of the 39 weeks’
maternity allowance. The extension of maternity and adoption pay from
26 to 39 weeks will be achieved via a separate set of maternity and
adoption pay regulations. The pay regulations are subject to negative
resolution and will be laid before the House shortly.</p><p><a name="06071893000139"></a>With the introduction of these new
regulations, more employees are likely to choose to spend longer
periods away from work on maternity or adoption leave. This should be
of very significant benefit to working families, but in making these
changes we also recognise that employers will need to
managethose periods of time. Taking that into account, the new
regulations introduce a number of measures specifically aimed at
benefiting employers. Prior to 2003, a woman was required to give only
21 days’ notice to her employer before starting her maternity
leave. When we talked to employers about this issue, they told us that
that was too little and that it caused real difficulties in arranging
and managing cover.To counter this, we extended the notice
period to15 weeks before the baby was due.</p><p><a name="06071893000140"></a>In the same way, during the work and
families consultation in 2005, employers told us that the28
days’ notice an employee needed to give when changing her date
of return from maternity or adoption leave was simply not long enough
to allow them to plan ahead properly, particularly given the proposed
extension to the pay period. We have listened to that concern, and
these new regulations will extend the period of notice that the
employee must give to eight weeks if she wishes to return to work
earlier or later than previously
agreed.</p><p><a name="06071893000141"></a>During the consultation,
we also heard from some employers that they sometimes felt unable to
make contact with employees on maternity leave and that there was a
need for a stronger framework to support communication between parents
and their employers during leave periods. The regulations are therefore
introducing the so-called “keeping in touch days”. These
are designed to allow employers and employees 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_66"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to agree that up to 10 days’ work may be done under the contract
of service during the maternity leave period. Keeping in touch days
will be entirely voluntary and will only take place by mutual
agreement. They are essentially a mechanism to allow employers and
employees to arrive at their own decisions on how best to prepare for
the return to work. The corresponding pay regulations will also allow
up to ten of these days to be worked without the employee losing a
week’s statutory maternity pay, as would be the case under the
current rules. In consultation discussions, we heard that keeping in
touch days are likely to be of particular use for things such as
training events and important annual
conferences.</p><p><a name="06071893000142"></a>We
recognise that keeping in touch days will not be everyone’s
preferred option. Employers and employees may simply wish to make
contact with one another without the employee actually doing any work;
for example, to talk about the woman’s plans for returning to
work or simply for an update on developments at work while she has been
away. The regulations clarify that this type of reasonable contact
during maternity leave also continues not only to be allowable but also
encouraged.</p><p><a name="06071893000143"></a>Additional measures
to help employers, particularly with regard to the administration of
statutory maternity and adoption pay, will be delivered by the pay
regulations I referred to
earlier.</p><p><a name="06071893000144"></a>It is
obviously crucial that new legislation is accompanied by clear and
helpful guidance. With that in mind, I am grateful to the Equal
Opportunities Commission for its helpful recommendation that we should
produce a written statement of maternity rights and responsibilities
for employers and employees. We are taking that idea forward, and it
will help to underpin the legislative changes we are
introducing.</p><p><a name="06071893000145"></a>The regulations
before us today also remove the small employers’ exemption. This
move clarifies the rules on the right of return after additional
maternity leave, making it clear that a woman cannot be selected for
redundancy or dismissed simply because she is pregnant or on maternity
leave, regardless of the size of the organisation.</p><p><a name="06071893000146"></a>I would like now to speak very briefly on
the other statutory instrument before us today. The order makes a
technical amendment to the statutory adoption pay legislation, bringing
the provisions for unmarried couples jointly adopting a child into line
with the existing provisions for married couples and civil partners.
The effect will be to ensure that only one member of an unmarried
adopting couple is able to receive statutory adoption pay.</p><p><a name="06071893000147"></a>The order applies to adopters whose child
is expected to be placed with them for adoption on or after 1 October
2006. We expect the number of adopters and employers affected to be
very small. In total, about 4,000 adoptions are eligible for statutory
adoption pay each year. Only a very small number of those will be
affected by this
order.</p><p><a name="06071893000148"></a>Although
the order is not part of the work and families package, we have laid it
before the Committee alongside the regulations simply in order to make

small number of people and employers potentially affected.</p><p><a name="06071893000149"></a>I commend both the
regulations and the order to the Committee. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071893000150"></a>Moved,
That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered
the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (Consequential Amendment to
Statutory Adoption Pay) Order 2006.—(<I>Lord Sainsbury of
Turville</I>.)</p><p><a name="06071893000151"></a><b><a name="06071893000274"></a>Baroness
Morris of Bolton:</b> I am most grateful to the
Minister for his detailed introduction to the regulations and the
order. The Explanatory Notes to the adoption and children order
highlight that the change will close a potential loophole which could
have allowed both members of an unmarried couple to receive statutory
adoption pay. The order makes provision for unmarried and married
adopters to be brought into line and, as such, will make life easier
for employers. This is an order of little controversy to which we have
no objection.</p><p><a name="06071893000152"></a>The maternity and
parental leave regulations essentially make welcome changes to the
maternity and adoption provisions of the 1999 and 2002 regulations
respectively which, as the Minister said, will apply to parents of
children expected to be born or placed for adoption on or after 1 April
2007. Among other things, the regulations extend the period of notice
that the employee is required to give the employer of her intention to
return to work earlier than the end of her additional maternity leave
from 28 days to eight weeks. They also increase flexibility by allowing
an employee to work for up to 10 days during the statutory maternity
leave period without bringing that period to an end as a result of
carrying out that work. That is most
welcome.</p><p><a name="06071893000153"></a>I will not rehearse the
debates that we had so recently during the passage of the Working
Families Bill. Suffice it to say that, welcome though these measures
are—we genuinely welcome them—we had and still have some
concerns regarding the administration and working of the new
arrangements, especially with regard to small
businesses.</p><p><a name="06071893000154"></a>During the passage
of the Bill, my noble friend Lady Miller questioned the Government as
to why they had seen fit seemingly to back away from agreed proposals
with the CBI that, in order to reduce the administrative burden on
employers, that function would be returned to the Inland Revenue. I
should be most grateful if the Minister could comment on
that.</p><p><a name="06071893000155"></a>My noble friend also
pointed out that 95 per cent of small employers have five employees or
fewer. They do not have personnel departments or HR resources and the
more regulation we put on them, the more difficult their position
becomes. We also raised concerns about the complexity of additional
paternity leave that we feel could be open to fraud. Therefore, can the
Minister tell us what further discussion the Government have held or
what representations they have received on the changes following the
passage of the Work and Families Bill and whether they are satisfied
that they have addressed any concerns raised?</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_68"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000156"></a>As I said, we welcome
the changes, but we are conscious of the concerns of various
organisations and will take care to keep an eye on the development of
these proposals. I very much agree with the Minister that it is
essential that we provide families, parents and carers with genuine
choice and flexibility, so that they can balance their family life and
work commitments as best they possibly can, and, as the Minister said,
in a way that allows employers access to the widest pool of talent. But
we also need to provide business with legislation that does not tie it
up in acres of red tape and does not cost it its competitive
edge.</p><p><a name="06071893000157"></a><b><a name="06071893000275"></a>Lord
Cotter:</b> I welcome the clear explanation given by
the Minister on these new orders. I was supportive in the other place,
as my party is and has been, of the importance of giving people in the
workplace the opportunity to meet their need for maternity and
paternity leave, so it is to be welcomed that that is going forward. I
hope it will justify what we on these Benches feel is the importance of
work-life balance, which the Minister has referred to. That can only be
good.</p><p><a name="06071893000158"></a>In the past, I have
always referred—as did the noble Baroness a moment ago—to
the importance of small businesses. It is important that the guidance
is good. The Minister has referred to the fact that there is good
guidance to support these regulations. I urge him again to ensure that
it is good and clear, because there many small firms that have such a
burden to deal with in terms of bureaucracy and red tape, as it is
called, that anything that can be done to help them understand the
regulations is to be welcomed. It is satisfactory that the Government
have listened to the people who asked, during consultation, to ensure
that the time for notice be amended.</p><p><a name="06071893000159"></a>I support the order. It is extremely
importantthat there is clarity and agreement, and I think that
that will be the result of this regulation, provided that the
information given to all firms is clear and to the
point.</p><p><a name="06071893000160"></a><b><a name="06071893000276"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> I thank noble Lords for
their general support. I shall deal with the specific points
raised.</p><p><a name="06071893000161"></a>We dealt in great
detail with the question of whether we could pass some of the
administrative costs back to the Inland Revenue. We discovered that
there were no very significant savings to the employer, and that there
would be enormously heavy costs to the Revenue and Customs. We reckoned
that that would take up to £75 million in set-up costs
and£50 million in annual running costs. That makes
perfect sense, because effectively all the information would have to be
passed backwards and forwards between the Revenue and the company,
which would add a lot of cost to the system and save very little for
the individual business.</p><p><a name="06071893000162"></a>Regarding further discussions with the
industry, we have listened to the concerns of business. We have
recently completed a public consultation on the details of the scheme.
A Government response to that will be issued in due course, which will
lead to the development of further regulations. The regulations 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_69"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>show that we have carefully consulted industry throughout on the easiest
way to do this, and we will continue to do
so.</p><p><a name="06071893000163"></a>I agree with the noble Lord
that guidance and clarity are essential. We will ensure that small
businesses have all the information and guidance they need so there is
a clear statement of what maternity rights, and so on, are. We have
always sought to balance the giving of further rights with spending a
lot of time thinking how we can reduce the cost of that to business.
You can see from the notification periods that we have taken that very
seriously. On that basis, I commend these regulations.</p><p><a name="06071893000164"></a>On Question, Motion agreed

Licensable Content Services Order

Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand
Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Television
Licensable Content Services Order
2006.</p><p><a name="06071893000169"></a>The noble Lord said: The
world of broadcasting is changing at a rapid pace. Over the past few
years, the growth of the creative industries has been meteoric. The
opportunities brought about by technological advances have
revolutionised the way we look at, listen to
and—crucially—interact with broadcast content. We need to
keep adapting our rules to enable these opportunities to be realised,
both for the growth of the industry and for the UK economy in general.
If we want the UK to continue to be at the forefront of creativity, we
need to ensure that the frameworks we rightly put in place can be
flexible enough to adapt to these
changes.</p><p><a name="06071893000170"></a>Currently, a radio
multiplex is distinguished by two key restrictions. It can carry only
digital radio and use no more than 20 per cent of its total capacity
for data services. It cannot carry television. The aim is to ensure
that capacity is reserved for radio and not sacrificed for
television.</p><p><a name="06071893000171"></a>The
orders amend both these key characteristics. First, the draft
Television Licensable Content Services Order 2006 proposes to redefine
the type of content that digital radio multiplexes can carry. This
change 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_70"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will permit TV, as well as radio, to be carried. Secondly, the draft
Radio Multiplex Services (Required Percentage of Digital Capacity)
Order 2006 will increase the existing limit on data services from 20
per cent to30 per cent. Taken together, the orders will enable
digital radio multiplex operators to offer consumers a combined package
of television and DAB radio, making best use of valuable spectrum and
utilising the most recent technology developments.</p><p><a name="06071893000172"></a>Historically,
legislation has sought to protect digital radio by preventing TV from
being carried on radio multiplexes. This has protected the spectrum for
digital radio that could otherwise have been sacrificed for TV
services. However, we do not now believe that it is in the
consumers’ interest that this limitation should continue.
Technological advances in compression techniques and a reduction in the
amount of capacity that is needed to carry a service have meant that TV
can co-exist with, rather than replace, radio. We believe that rather
than protecting spectrum for digital radio, the legislation is now
preventing the development of innovative new services which will make
digital radio more accessible and appealing by allowing it to combine
with other services.</p><p><a name="06071893000173"></a>The
potential of a mobile TV and DAB package will further increase the
attractiveness and demand for digital radio; this was tested in last
year’s pilot by BT Movio, a subsidiary of BT. The pilot allowed
more than 1,000 mobile phone users with specially designed phones to
access three live television services and more than 50 digital radio
stations. The trial, which was the largest of its kind in Europe,
showed that even with the additional services, consumers listened to
more DAB radio than they watched television. Additionally, more than 73
per cent of users said they would be prepared to pay for the service on
their network.</p><p><a name="06071893000174"></a>Evidence from
the BT Movio pilot showed that only 11 per cent of users would be happy
with fewer than five TV services. Consequently, BT Movio has stated
that it cannot sustain a business model with fewer than five services.
That is why we propose to increase the maximum data limit to 30 per
cent. That will allow for five TV stations in addition to the existing
DAB radio
services.</p><p><a name="06071893000175"></a>There
may be anxiety that this represents an unfair advantage for BT when
others will have to pay for valuable spectrum for this purpose.
However, I emphasise that there is nothing to prevent other people from
developing similar services on local multiplexes or on the proposed new
national multiplex. It is important to note that the BT Movio proposals
are as a wholesale content provider and that its services will be open
to other phone
operators.</p><p><a name="06071893000176"></a>We
all know that the pace of technological change is increasing. Both the
Broadcasting Act 1996 and the Communications Act 2003 recognised this
and anticipated that the technological changes in broadcasting would
need us to revisit the regulatory regime. We believe that these orders
will make possible innovative, converged services which can increase
the take-up and listening to of DAB services. Not only will more people
listen to DAB on new devices but, having got used to these services,
they may want all their listening to be on

decide. That is why we are introducing these orders. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071893000177"></a>Moved,
That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered
the Television Licensable Content Services Order 2006.—(<I>Lord
Davies of
Oldham</I>.)</p><p><a name="06071893000178"></a><b><a name="06071893000279"></a>Viscount
Astor:</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation
of the order. This is a somewhat complex area but we agree with the
order because it makes sense that the radio multiplexes are also used
to carry television and other data services. This seems to be a
sensible use of multiplex as there are a limited number for both radio
and television. It will allow both radio and data to be loaded on to
people’s mobile telephones and so on. A new technology is coming
in and we support the order.</p><p><a name="06071893000179"></a>I
have one question: what impact will this have on analogue switch-off
and the move to digital? I presume that it will help further that
process. If the Minister could explain, I would be
grateful.</p><p><a name="06071893000180"></a><b><a name="06071893000280"></a>Lord
Clement-Jones:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for his
demonstration of speech compression. It was not perhaps digital but it
certainly worked for me. I am grateful for the care with which both
Ofcom and the Government have analysed this problem and for the way in
which they consulted with considerable care.</p><p><a name="06071893000181"></a>I am a great fan of DAB
radio—I think the way it has added to the quality of listening
is fantastic—and, therefore, anything which would affect that
adversely would be a retrograde step. It is quite clear that the
multiplexes can be shared and, as we know, convergence is taking place
at a rapid rate. On our mobile telephones we will soon have mp3, mobile
television and DAB radio—quite apart from telephony services. I
think this is a positive step. It may not be all the way to mobile
television but it certainly will enable providers to assess the demand
for elements of mobile television, and to that extent it is extremely
useful.</p><p><a name="06071893000182"></a>A key
point made in the regulatory impact assessment concerned the benefits
to UK technology. If we are ahead of the game, that gives our
technology manufacturers a head start, which is highly
desirable.</p><p><a name="06071893000183"></a>My questions relate
to the issue of charging. I assume that the current multiplexes will
provide this as part of, if you like, a free addition to their
services; that there will not be additional charges for the commercial
multiplex and the BBC multiplex; and that the licensing of the third
national multiplex will simply take place in the normal way—that
there will not be a notional additional expense as a result of the
multiplex being able to be used for mobile television and so on. I am
not entirely sure about that.</p><p><a name="06071893000184"></a>We welcome the proposal
to have a further commercial multiplex. That can only be a
demonstration of the success of DAB and of a kind of mobile television.
Frankly, neither I nor my party is particularly concerned about the BT
Movio issue. It is to be welcomed that it had the sense to take the
risk and develop a new service which will be available to service
providers on a wholesale basis. It is a pioneering service which is
leading the way. We unreservedly welcome these two
orders.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_72"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000185"></a><b><a name="06071893000281"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the two noble
Lords who have contributed so positively to the debate. Unanimity
between us is a rare experience and all the more to be welcomed for
that.</p><p><a name="06071893000186"></a>I
should emphasise that although we regard DAB in the UK as a success
story, it is not a runaway success; take-up rates are good but not
exceptional. I share the enthusiasm of the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, for DAB radio, although whenever the time signal comes
through a fraction late I think of the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, who
makes my life a misery in the Chamber by constantly challenging me on
the BBC time signal.</p><p><a name="06071893000187"></a>However, having said
that, like the noble Lord I appreciate the virtues of DAB radio. We
share that appreciation with 3 million of our fellow citizens—or
perhaps I should say there are 3 million sets in use. That compares
with between 110 million and120 million analogue radio sets in
the UK, so we still have a considerable way to go before full
enhancement occurs. The industry, of course, is looking at ways of
making DAB a more compelling proposition, and these orders will help to
do that.</p><p><a name="06071893000188"></a>The noble Viscount,
Lord Astor, expressed anxieties about analogue switch-off. Analogue
switch-off, of course, applies to television; there is no proposal to
switch off the analogue signal for radio. As the noble Viscount said,
the digital service for television fits in with the new
developments.</p><p><a name="06071893000189"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Clement-Jones, emphasised the advantages that we have in being
ahead of the game at present. We need to stay there to maintain the
advantages that have accrued to all of us. The noble Lord asked about
charges. There will be an optional cost for the TV service. It will not
affect DAB radio listeners, but if people wish to take up the enhanced
service they will have to pay for it. The providers will, of course,
have to invest in the necessary technology. I have ascertained so far
that, although no one will be asked to carry around a telephone quite
as large as either of these Dispatch Boxes, the machine which will
needed to receive the television service will be somewhat larger than
the extraordinarily neat versions of the latest mobile phones. For
obvious reasons, there will be a change in that regard once a picture
is introduced.</p><p><a name="06071893000190"></a>Through the
removal of these legal restrictions, operators will, for the first
time, be able to offer a package of TV and DAB radio to mobile phones.
This will give customers, for the first time, the opportunity to
experience DAB services via devices which will be both popular and
portable. The mobile telephone demonstrated an extraordinary rate of
development. Obviously these devices will be more expensive and we do
not expect them to produce growth at quite that rate but, nevertheless,
one can readily see the advantages to the consumer of these enhanced
services. However, the important thing is that it is for consumers to
decide whether to avail themselves of the technology once it is made
available to them. That is what these orders seek to do. I commend them
to the Committee.</p><p><a name="06071893000191"></a>On Question,

Lord McKenzie of Luton. I am commending to the Grand Committee the
change needed to the Financial Services and MarketsAct 2000
(Regulated Activities) Order 2006 to introduce a new FSA-regulated
activity related to pensions. This change specifically relates the
issue of the regulation of personal pensions by the FSA.</p><p><a name="06071893000197"></a>Members of the Committee may be
interested to hear that this measure was so uncontroversial that when
debated in the other House, it lasted barely one-third of its allotted
time. That is not intended as a challenge to the noble Baroness, Lady
Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. It probably reflected the
overwhelming support for this measure expressed during consultation
last
year.</p><p><a name="06071893000198"></a>Sweeping
away the old rules surrounding personal pensions is very much an
extension of pension tax simplification and is wholly in line with the
deregulation agenda. I should make clear that these changes do not
impact on occupational pension schemes, for which there is a separate
regulatory framework.</p><p><a name="06071893000199"></a>Let me
start by saying something about the background to the changes. The
pensions market has changed over time and will continue to do so in the
future, not least for demographic reasons. Around5 million
individuals now contribute to personal or stakeholder pensions. At the
same time, the legislative changes the Government have made are
reshaping the personal pensions landscape.</p><p><a name="06071893000200"></a>While we have changed
the pensions tax framework in the face of a fast-changing pensions
market, we recognised that the prescribed rules surrounding who can run
personal pension schemes have confined it to a small group that
potentially limited competition. In the face of such a changing
pensions market, we also recognised that elements of personal pensions
are beginning to fall outside Financial Service Authority consumer
protection.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000201"></a>A formal consultation was held between
September and December last year to explore these issues. It sought
views on four proposed options for rule changes on who could run a
personal pension scheme, including a “do nothing” option
as well as the Government’s preferred option of proposing to
create a new regulated activity, overseen by the Financial Services
Authority, related to,</p><ul><a name="06071893000244"></a>“establishing, operating or
winding up a personal pension scheme”</ul><a name="06071893000237"></a>from April 2007.
<p><a name="06071893000202"></a>We fully considered all
25 responses in detail and published a formal response on 23 March this
year. It set out industry views in detail and announced the proposed
policy change; namely, that the Government were proposing to create a
new regulated activity related to personal pensions. Financial Services
Authority permission would then replace the restricted list of those
who could run tax-privileged personal pension schemes.</p><p><a name="06071893000203"></a>The consultation gave overwhelming
support for change with three-quarters of respondents favouring
introducing the Government’s preferred option that I am
commending. Let me quote some examples from a variety of sources
illustrating the extent of that support. The Association of British
Insurers, whose members provide most personal pensions in the UK, said
that this
package,</p><ul><a name="06071893000245"></a>“offers
customers the greatest protection, while maintaining wide
choice”.</ul><p><a name="06071893000204"></a>The
Association of Investment Trust Companies said that the
package,</p><ul><a name="06071893000246"></a>“will provide
maximum flexibility for future development of the sector over the long
term. At the same time, it will maintain the FSA’s strong

industry”.</ul><p><a name="06071893000205"></a>This
overwhelming support was not surprising given that we had worked in
partnership with the pension industry from the outset to make these
proposed changes. As well as a formal consultation in late 2005, there
have been informal discussions between the Government and a number of
bodies in the financial services
industry.</p><p><a name="06071893000206"></a>Let me turn to exactly
what this change will deliver. While the Financial Services Authority
already regulates bodies such as insurance companies and banks that
provide personal schemes, a very small number of schemes and activities
remain outside FSA supervision, and those elements are expected to grow
in future as the pension market evolves. For example, personal pension
schemes investing in commercial property would currently fall outside
FSA regulation. Similarly, some persons administering pension schemes
may also fall outside FSA supervision. It is only right that all
aspects of personal pensions in future should be regulated by the FSA.
Likewise, all elements involved in consumers choosing a personal
pension, including administration, should be
covered.</p><p><a name="06071893000207"></a>This
change will build on the FSA’s existing role of regulating
stakeholder pension schemes. It will also provide transparency and
improve consumer confidence. 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_75"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>As well as providing benefits and protection for all consumers, the
change I am commending today is part of a wider package of related
changes that will help new providers enter into the market, as it will
become the basis for eligibility to establish tax-privileged personal
pension schemes. We are not debating that particular finance measure
today, but noble Lords should note that the two are inextricably
linked. Overall, this package will increase competition and choice, as
well as give added consumer
protection.</p><p><a name="06071893000208"></a>The FSA already
regulates many aspects of personal pensions, and it is only right that
all aspects should come under FSA regulation as they develop in the
future. As pension investments become more diverse, an increasing range
of pension activity may fall outside the scope of FSA supervision.
Without the changes I am commending there is a risk that consumer
protection may fall below the current very high levels.</p><p><a name="06071893000209"></a>The order will also
enable the FSA to open its doors this autumn to applicants seeking
permission to carry out the new activity from April 2007. This will
give maximum time for firms to prepare to become registered. The FSA
and the Government have worked closely together to ensure a smooth
transition for firms to the new regime. This has included waiving
Financial Services Authority application fees for firms that are
existing personal pension
providers.</p><p><a name="06071893000210"></a>Not only do we want
consumers to enjoy maximum protection, but we want them to have a
choice of pension provider. As I have already explained, eligibility to
establish a registered pension scheme that qualifies for tax privileges
will from next April be based on having permission from the FSA to
carry out this new activity. This element of the package will require a
separate legislative change in the Finance Act 2004 and one to the
Pension Schemes Act 1993. I can advise noble Lords that this
legislative change will be made in the Finance Bill 2007, the next
guarantee vehicle available, but it will have effect from 6 April 2007
to coincide with the coming into effect of the new activity.</p><p><a name="06071893000211"></a>To keep interested
parties fully updated, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the
other House announced details of the legislative timetable for making
the necessary amendments. It was published on the websites of the
Treasury and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs on 12 July. A
draft Finance Bill 2007 clause and explanatory note was published on
the websites of the Treasury and Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs at the same time. I commend the order to the
House.</p><p><a name="06071893000212"></a>Moved,
That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered

Noakes:</b> This order is basically
uncontroversial and I can be brief. I say that because I know that the
noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, is standing in for my normal
opposite number. We can rest assured that by now he will have wilted in
the heat of the gardens of Buckingham Palace.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_76"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000214"></a>I have two questions for
the Minister that cover issues that were covered in another place by my
honourable friend Mark Hoban, and I trust that my request for further
clarification will not prove too onerous for the Minister. My first
question relates to the costs of regulation and its impact on
competition. The Economic Secretary in another place talked about this
order being pro-consumer, pro-competition and benefiting the industry.
The Minister said as much this afternoon.</p><p><a name="06071893000215"></a>These Benches are
passionate about the benefits of competition, so we instinctively find
this line attractive, but we have an equal passion for minimising
regulations and are concerned at the costs involved. I understand from
the regulatory impact assessment that the costs for an entrant who is
new to regulation will be £100,000 in the first year and
£50,000 thereafter. Those are reasonably significant costs that
could well deter some forms of new entrant, thus defeating the
objective of increasing competition. How many new entrants to the
personal pension provision industry do the Government anticipate? In
the context of this order, competition can come only from new entrants,
because I assume the order will have no impact on existing players in
the
market.</p><p><a name="06071893000216"></a>Secondly,
I would like clarification about the gap between now and the order
coming into effect. The order does not come into effect until 1 April
next year when personal pension provision becomes a regulated activity.
The Minister will be aware that there has been increasing activity in
setting up SIPPs, not just because of A-day, but in the run up to it.
Will the Minister explain what level of protection is currently
available to people who set up SIPPs? Having set up a SIPP earlier this
year, I should know the answer, but I have to confess that I made no
inquiries at the time, so it is good that the Minister is here to
enlighten me about the level of protection in place for consumers who
wish to enter into personal pension arrangements between now and 1
April
next.</p><p><a name="06071893000217"></a><b><a name="06071893000285"></a>Lord
Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I should probably
declare a more formal interest than the noble Baroness, as I have been
a pension fund investment manager for the past 30 years and I am an
active investor in commercial property and a participant in a small,
self-administered pension scheme.</p><p><a name="06071893000218"></a>The noble Lord said that this order took
only a third of its allotted time in the other place, but it still took
half an hour. It covers seven pages and, as one would expect, the
Minister’s introductory remarks were similar to those of the
Economic Secretary in another place.</p><p><a name="06071893000219"></a>I was not able to give
notice of this question, as I was not aware that the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, would not be in this Committee so perhaps the Minister will
write to me. Arising out of the Chancellor’s humiliating
climb-down in the Autumn Statement about what is to be allowed in
SIPPs, there is still uncertainty about what will be allowed on a
tax-privilege basis in SIPPs. I have two questions in particular.
First, will it still be possible for people to invest in residential
property through SIPPs on a tax-privilege basis if, as 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_77"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been reported in the press, they form a club of at least 10 people?
It would be very helpful if that could be
clarified.</p><p><a name="06071893000220"></a>As
we know, widespread concern was expressed about all of this. In the
other place, Mr Balls described it as a “clarification”.
Well, at least he got the first two letters of that right—in
fact, under sustained and heavy pressure from the Liberal Democrats, it
was a monumental climb-down, rather than a
clarification.</p><p><a name="06071893000221"></a>My
other question is, given that what we are really talking about is
commercial property, what protection will people have after this
measure comes into force against some of the fly-by-night companies
promoting investment in rather exotic locations? Bulgaria is a case in
point, where commercial property investment is actively being
promoted—a new twist in the “fly to let”
investment craze—and some people in the City are concerned that
abuses will continue.</p><p><a name="06071893000222"></a>I
associate myself with the noble Baroness’ sensible questions
about costs and coverage. I look forward to the Minister’s
reply.</p><p><a name="06071893000223"></a><b><a name="06071893000286"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Thank you. I am grateful
to both noble Lords for their general welcome, and I shall attempt to
answer the questions that were asked. As my noble friend Lord McKenzie
wilts in Buckingham
Palace—</p><p><a name="06071893000224"></a><b><a name="06071893000287"></a>Lord

Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I am wilting under the
pressure—my noble friend has
arrived.</p><p><a name="06071893000226"></a>The
first question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was regarding
the cost of implementation. Additional costs will be minimal for
existing pension providers. It was generally recognised in the
regulatory impact assessment and consultation responses that some new
providers would face additional costs, to the extent that they would
have to become regulated and thus pay FSA fees for the first time.
While the RIA made a number of assumptions about possible regulatory
fees, those could only be illustrative. FSA fees are reviewed annually,
together with the levies for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
and the Financial Ombudsman Service. The FSA consults each year in
January or February on regulatory fees and levies that are finalised in
May for the fee period of 1 April to 31 March.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_78"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column 78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071893000227"></a>The FSA will be required to demonstrate
that its fee-raising arrangements are compatible with better regulation
principles; fees are expected to be proportionate and not to pose a
barrier to entry into the market. For existing members there will be no
impact and, under the new rules, new firms will not have to go through
third parties. Obviously there will be a saving compared with the
current
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06071893000228"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, also asked about new entrants.
Consultation respondents identified various categories of persons who
should be eligible to establish registered pension schemes. Those
included firms already eligible to provide ISA and child trust fund
accounts, as well as SIPP providers having to operate through eligible
intermediaries.</p><p><a name="06071893000229"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was also concerned about protection for
consumers now, before this order takes effect. Under the Financial
Services and Markets Act, introduced by the Government in 2000, most
aspects of personal pensions are already under FSA supervision. For
example, insurance companies and banks that are active in personal
pensions are FSA-regulated. However, a small number of pension schemes
investing in commercial property since 2006 are currently outside
regulation, as I stated in my opening remarks. Those schemes are
expected to grow. A very small number of activities in the pensions
chain, such as advice, may be outside supervision also, as that
presently depends on whether the underlying investment in the fund is
regulated. This activity is also expected to grow. We are creating this
new provision so that all aspects of personal pensions come under FSA
supervision.</p><p><a name="06071893000230"></a>I think that those
points answer the questions put by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. If
not, as both noble Lords have kindly suggested, my noble friend Lord
McKenzie will write to them.</p><p><a name="06071893000231"></a>I
will write to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, as he suggested, about
his first question. The changes today will absolutely maximise consumer
protection. These changes will ensure that everyone advising on
pensions will be under FSA supervision. The noble Lord also asked about
investing in residential property through clubs. That is a Finance Bill
matter, but, again, I shall write to the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="06071893000232"></a>I am grateful to both
noble Lords for being so gentle with me in the absence of my noble
friend.</p><p><a name="06071893000233"></a>On Question, Motion
agreed to.</p><ul><ul><ul>The Committee
adjourned at twenty-four minutes before six
o’clock.</ul></ul></ul></body></html><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60718-wms0164.htm"/>

Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06071882000015"></a>I
can announce that the contract for full production of 12 Nimrod MRA4
aircraft has been placed with BAE Systems. This is the culmination of
many years of hard work by BAE Systems and its supply chain and builds
upon the considerable investment already made by the Ministry of
Defence and BAE Systems. Nimrod MRA4 has had a troubled and well
publicised history of time delays and cost overruns. The contract
restructuring introduced since early 2003 has been successful in
stabilising costs and with three aircraft participating in the flight
trials programme, the design has now reached a level of maturity which
permits a commitment to full
production.</p><p><a name="06071882000016"></a>The greater
transparency offered by the revised contracting arrangements and the
development of an effective partnering relationship between MoD and BAE
Systems and its supply chain have been essential to restoring
confidence in the programme. These are key elements of the Defence
Industrial Strategy (DIS) and progress on Nimrod MRA4 demonstrates the
benefits that will accrue to MoD and industry as these and other
features of the DIS are put into effect across the defence industrial
base.</p><p><a name="06071882000017"></a>The programme will provide
the RAF with a maritime patrol aircraft capability second to none.
Nimrod MRA4 will offer greater capability and improved availability
when compared with the current MR2 maritime patrol aircraft which it
replaces.</p><p><a name="06071882000018"></a>This contract will
secure some 1,000 jobs at BAE Systems sites in the north-west of
England, including around 700 at the Woodford site where the aircraft
is manufactured. A further 300 or so jobs associated with production
will also be secured at other BAE Systems&#146;

cancelled 100 per cent of the debt stock held by 19 countries
(including 17 HIPCs, 13 of which were African) and has cancelled 100
per cent of the debt stock of two other HIPCs&#151;Cameroon and
Mauritania&#151;since. Twenty-one countries have now therefore
received 100 per cent debt stock cancellation at the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My
honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the
following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06071882000022"></a>I am today setting
out further details of the Government&#146;s implementation strategy
and dry run for home information packs
(HIPs).</p><p><a name="06071882000023"></a><I>The aims of the HIPs
programme</I></p><p><a name="06071882000024"></a>The aims of the
Government&#146;s reforms to the home buying and selling process are
threefold:</p>To provide home
owners with important energy efficiency information about their homes
to help them cut fuel bills and carbon emissions. This is vital as
homes account for 27 per cent of Britain&#146;s carbon emissions.
Energy performance certificates will provide clear information about
the energy efficiency of homes and how that can be improved. The Energy
Saving Trust estimates that following the advice in energy performance
certificates could save the average home owner up to &#163;300 a year
on their fuel bills The Government believe it is important to implement
these as early as possible given the importance of reducing carbon
emissions.To benefit
consumers by cutting waste and duplication, speeding up home sales and
reducing the number of failed transactions, which at present cost
consumers around &#163;350 million a year in wasted
costs.To encourage and
support long-term transformation of the home buying and selling
industry by introducing greater transparency and competition to drive
down costs and incentivise better service and clearer redress for
consumers.<p><a name="06071882000025"></a><I>Testing</I></p><p><a name="06071882000026"></a>There
are three main components to home information packs: searches and other
legal documents; energy performance certificates; and the home
condition surveys that make up the other component of a full home
condition report. It is essential that all aspects of home information
packs are properly tested before full implementation. We need to be
sure that consumers understand, value and can utilise the information
that HIPs provide; that the assumed benefits will be realised; and that
the different operating systems underpinning HIPs will work
effectively.</p><p><a name="06071882000027"></a>As
part of our ongoing programme of implementation, we have already
successfully tested more than 14,000 HIPs with searches, but largely
without home condition reports, in the dry run so far. Over the course
of the summer we propose to undertake further consumer research on home
condition reports; to study in greater detail the 250 HIPs that have
been produced to date with some kind of survey; and to look to see what
more we can learn from experience in other countries where HIPs have
been introduced successfully or are currently being proposed. From the
autumn the emphasis of our implementation programme will switch to the
testing of energy performance certificates and home condition reports.
Working with the industry and with consumers, we are proposing to
support a series of 
<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS81"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column WS81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>area-based trials and we will test proposals such as allowing sellers to
start marketing their homes if they have already commissioned their HIP
rather than having to wait up to 14 days. There will be independent
assessment and monitoring of all aspects of the dry
run.</p><p><a name="06071882000028"></a><I>Roll
out</I></p><p><a name="06071882000029"></a>It is
also important that reforms are introduced on a timetable and as part
of a programme that maximises the benefits for consumers and the
environment. As part of the development of the dry run, we have engaged
in detailed consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and have
gathered substantial information on the progress of implementation so
far. As a result, we have concluded that there would be significant
risks and potential disadvantages to consumers from a mandatory
&#147;big bang&#148; introduction of full home condition reports on
1 June 2007. In particular:</p> Further testing is
needed to ensure that home condition reports deliver the assumed
benefits for consumers and that the operating systems that support them
work smoothly. Design work on the dry run has made it clear that this
cannot be completed in time for the results to be taken into account in
by 1 June.A recent report from the Council
of Mortgage Lenders identified the real possibility that some lenders
might not be fully geared up to use HCRs until 2008-09. In particular
the industry&#146;s plans for bringing in automated valuation models
means that many lenders will not have them in place by June 2007 and so
will continue to seek separate mortgage valuation surveys where they
could have relied on a home condition
report.There are concerns about the number
of inspectors that will be in place in time for June next
year.<p><a name="06071882000030"></a>Moreover,
because of our commitment to addressing climate change we do not want
to jeopardise the successful introduction of energy performance
certificates at the earliest possible opportunity by pursuing the
&#147;big bang&#148; mandatory introduction of full home condition
reports at the same time.</p><p><a name="06071882000031"></a>We
believe that progressive market-led take-up of full HCRs could strongly
benefit consumers. Bearing in mind our commitment to the early
introduction of energy performance certificates, combining an energy
performance certificate and a full home condition report at the same
time is likely to offer significant additional benefits to buyers and
sellers. In particular, sellers offering full home condition reports
should be more likely to benefit from swifter sales and suffer fewer
transaction failures, as accepted offers are much less likely to be
re-opened as a result of new information coming to light. In addition,
once automated valuation models are in place, home condition reports
should mean buyers get cheaper and swifter valuations and mortgage
offers. We therefore believe that there will be a significant incentive
for consumers to top up their HIPs voluntarily to include full home
condition reports and that this is a product that the market can and
should deliver.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS82"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column WS82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071882000032"></a>Therefore we have
concluded that:</p>HIPs will be introduced with
searches and other key documents from 1 June
2007.Energy performance certificates will be
included in HIPs on a mandatory basis from 1 June
2007.We will work with the industry to
facilitate market-led take-up of full HCRs. As part of this approach,
we will explore with the sector a wide range of options to enable a
successful and innovative market for HCRs, including options for
supporting the provision of necessary systems, effective demonstration
projects for HCRs, and will consider the case for pump-priming funding.
This market-led approach has the added benefit of giving industry more
flexibility to innovate and adapt to consumer
preferences. This means that the remaining
aspects of home condition reports will not be made mandatory from June
next year, but HCRs will be authorised documents that sellers will be
able to include in their packs.Mandatory
HCRs will remain on the table if the industry fails to make a success
of the roll out of HCRs.<p><a name="06071882000033"></a>As
part of the next phase of reform of we will also be setting out our
plans for an ombudsman scheme for estate agents to strengthen consumer
protection as well as further proposals to review competition and
transparency in the industry to the benefit of
consumers.</p><p><a name="06071882000034"></a>We believe that these
arrangements will ensure that home information packs are implemented in
a way that maximises benefits for consumers and the environment and
successfully enables the long-term transformation of the home buying
and selling market.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071882000005"></a>Immigration:

his report on the Review of HMRC Online Services, published at the
Budget in March 2006, Lord Carter of Coles recommended that, for
2007-08 and subsequent returns, the income tax self-assessment filing
deadline should be brought forward from31 January to 30
September for paper returns and to 30 November for returns filed over
the internet. Lord Carter has since reviewed the responses to the
partial regulatory impact assessment published with his report and has
received further representations from tax practitioners. Having
reviewed his earlier findings, he has now recommended that, for 2007-08
and subsequent returns, the filing period for paper returns should be
reduced to seven months&#151;the new deadline should be 31
October&#151;and the filing period for online returns should remain
at 10 months&#151;with a deadline of 31 January. He has also
suggested that HM Revenue and Customs officials should work with
practitioners to explore how in future the practical difficulties in
collecting data earlier might be overcome so that taxpayers can
complete their returns sooner if they wish. The Government have
accepted Lord Carter's revised recommendation. This updating of the
self-assessment system takes account of both the views of tax
professionals and the operational requirements of HM Revenue and
Customs.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS87"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column WS87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

our cities is key to their economic growth and success. It is therefore
important that local authorities take responsibility for addressing the
problem of road congestion and the impact on journey times caused by
the increasing numbers of journeys being
made.</p><p><a name="06071882000089"></a>Each of the 10 largest
urban areas in England, therefore, has a target to limit the increase
in person journey time per mile, given the expected increase in travel
over the next five years. The target relates to the overall average
journey time on a representative set of the busiest roads in each of
their major urban centres. The 10 are: London, Greater Manchester, West

Bristol, Nottingham and
Leicester.</p><p><a name="06071882000090"></a>While
ownership of these local targets, and implementing measures to deliver
them, is the responsibility of the local authorities involved, we have
weighted (according to traffic volumes) and averaged the journey times

no more than 1.5 per cent;in Manchester,
accommodate an increase in travel of 1.5 per cent with no increase in

authority is responsible for finding a balance between economic
development, safety and journey times consistent with local

each authority to encourage and support them in

(Lord Rooker):</b> An EU import ban on captive birds
(including wild-caught birds) from third countries has been in place
since October 2005 as a result of the worldwide avian influenza
situation. It does not affect trade from other member states and there
are limited exceptions for pet and zoo birds. On 4 July, the EU
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH), with
the support of the UK, voted to extend the ban until 31 December
2006.</p><p><a name="06071883000022"></a>This takes account of the
fact that the European Commission has requested the European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA) to carry out a review of the animal health and
welfare risks associated with the import of captive wild birds. We are
awaiting this report with interest and the UK will play an active and
constructive part in EU
discussions.</p><p><a name="06071883000023"></a>Without clear
scientific evidence, a long-term ban, whether a unilateral UK ban or an
EU ban, is unlikely to be justifiable on the animal and public health
permitted ground in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, or
on any another permitted ground. In order to comply with the WTO
agreements, it is also necessary to ensure that any ban is not, in
effect, a disguised restriction on trade or arbitrary discrimination
between countries.</p><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA172"></a><b>18 July 2006 : Column WA172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071883000024"></a>With EU legislation
already in place to address both conservation and animal health issues,
any departure from an EU-wide position could be held to be in breach of
trade rules under European Community law and result in infraction
proceedings. In view of this, we believe that any decisions on a
permanent ban should be addressed at EU
level.</p><p><a name="06071883000025"></a>The Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species does allow countries to
impose stricter, unilateral measures regarding the trade in specific
convention-listed species.. However, as mentioned above, with the
convention implemented at a Community level, any UK ban would need to
be compatible with EC Regulation 338/97/EC and in accordance with
Article 176 of the EC treaty. In view of this, it would be very
difficult for the UK unilaterally to ban the trade in all wild

reply by the Lord Triesman on 6 June (HL Deb, col. 1131)
&#147;that there has been a certain ebb and flow between decisions
taken in the legal fora of Europe and those taken here&#148;, which
decisions now taken in the legal fora of the United Kingdom were
formerly taken in the legal fora of the European

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> While there are no decisions now
taken in the legal fora of the UK which were formerly taken in the
legal fora of the EU, the principle of subsidiarity ensures
that:</p><ul><a name="06071883000074"></a>&#147;In areas which do
not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take
action ... only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed
action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can
therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be
better achieved by the
Community&#148;.</ul><a name="06071883000073"></a>The
principle of subsidiarity, now well recognised in Union law, was first
enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and elaborated in the
interinstitutional agreement of 1993 and later in the Treaty of
Amsterdam in 1997. The Government believe that the institutions are
actively applying the principle in practice as part of the
policy-making and legislative process and in that context welcomes the
Commission's recent commitment to make all new proposals and
consultation papers directly available to national parliaments so as to
improve the process of policy formulation. The June 2006 European
Council conclusions also ask the Commission duly to consider comments
by national parliaments&#151;in particular with regard to the
subsidiarity and proportionality
principles.

the amount of legislation agreed by member states in Brussels and

regulatory reform in Europe, during our own and subsequent
presidencies. We have encouraged the European Commission's continued
commitment to the better regulation agenda, in particular its rolling
programme of simplification of existing legislation and the withdrawal
so far of around 70 pending proposals. The Government also welcome the

live in extreme poverty in Eastern Sudan, and in some cases
humanitarian indicators are worse than those of
Darfur.</p><p><a name="06071883000048"></a>As
identified in the letter, access restrictions imposed on humanitarian
agencies by the Government of Sudan continue to hamper the ability of

begin in Asmara on 17 July will aid this

are devolved matters, so I will confine my reply to England and Wales,
which use the same regulatory frameworks. The Urban Wastewater
Treatment Directive was adopted by the Council of the European
Communities in May 1991; its implementation would not have incurred any
expenditure prior to this
date.</p><p><a name="06071883000071"></a>Since privatisation the
water industry has invested more than &#163;55 billion (between 1990
and 2004-05) in water and wastewater services, asset maintenance,
environmental improvements, and securing supply and service
improvements. This is an average annual capital investment in the water
industry of more than &#163;3.7 billion over the past 15 years.
During the 1980s, the equivalent investment figure was &#163;2
billion per year.</p><p><a name="06071883000072"></a>Around
&#163;26.5 billion of the investment which has taken place since
privatisation is directly related to sewerage service and water quality
improvements. Because expenditure often meets multiple objectives,
however, it is not possible separately to distinguish the expenditure
needed to meet individual European
directives.</p>
