Through maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, the Government have achieved an environment conducive to manufacturers planning ahead and investing for the long term. The Manufacturing Advisory Service, established by the Government in 2002, provides companies with practical advice to help them in improving productivity and increasing global competitiveness.</p>

However, am I not right in thinking that the manufacturing trade deficit, at &#163;59 billion, is a record high and that only the surplus on services is keeping the overall trade deficit at a tolerable level? Should we not be trying much harder to extend our manufacturing base and to close the productivity gap between ourselves and the United States, France and Germany&#151;or are the Government content to rely on the continuing success of the service sector, mainly financial services, and the City?</p>

However, we recognise the significance of the service sector to the British economy. The noble Lord will recognise that there have been significant improvements in manufacturing output, which grew by 1.3 per cent in 2006 and, in the first couple of months of this year, is again showing an increase in growth. He is right that productivity is the key. The Government are directing their energies to improving productivity, not least with the skills agenda which very importantly relates to this issue. The Government are not content with manufacturing performance. On the whole, however, services play a roughly comparable role in the British economy to that which they play in many other advanced economies.</p>

It is certainly an important growth sector in the British economy and, as noble Lords will recognise, has to play its part in the evolution of an economy that, in the 21st century, looks somewhat different from the way that it looked 50 years ago.</p>

But the manufactured content of a new British hotel is around two-thirds. Given the complementary nature of manufacturing and service, is it not somewhat outdated just to focus on the narrow definition of manufacturing statistics?</p>

It is a very important part of the economy and employs a very large number of people. However, the noble Lord is right that we have to look at the issues in the round. The House will delight in the fact that, the year before last, the UK was the number one country in the world in foreign direct investment flows&#151;which shows that our economy is being built upon strength.</p>

The noble Baroness will appreciate that there has been continuous economic growth under this Government, reflecting the fact that the former Chancellor has ensured&#151;and his successor will of course continue this excellent work&#151;that the economy of Britain has been in good hands and has prospered.</p>

To do this we will revise and relaunch guidance to the NHS, setting out its responsibilities for promoting the scheme locally to eligible patients. We will update and improve the HTCS information and claim forms to reflect changes to the scheme. We will also include information on HTCS on both the Department of Health and NHS websites.</p>

She will be aware of last year&#146;s report by Macmillan Cancer Support which found that two-thirds of cancer patients who pay travel costs do not know about the current hospital travel costs scheme. Only 4 per cent of cancer patients actually receive financial help, and only one in five hospitals follow the current guidance. Given that, can the Minister be a bit more specific about the mechanisms being considered by the department to encourage compliance with the new guidance when it is published, so that awareness and take-up of the scheme by patients on low income is significantly improved?</p>

The NHS will be providing guidance to its staff to ensure that they are aware of the HTCS so that they can make information about it known to patients. We will also be working with the Prescription Pricing Agency to ensure that the leaflets which it is responsible for producing are in doctors&#146; surgeries and primary care trust facilities so that information is widely available. In addition, it behoves us, as members of society to ensure that our own doctor&#146;s surgery displays information about the HTCS schemes.</p>

Is she aware that within the past few days representatives of Mugabe have failed to attend a negotiation meeting with the opposition, arranged by President Mbeki? Is she also aware that the students of the university have been expelled from their residences in the past few days; that inflation is now above 10,000 per cent according to the best estimates; that the Government are printing money; that they have issued an edict halving the prices to be charged in shops; that business leaders are being arrested; and that businesses are being nationalised? That looks like a pretty terminal condition to me, and apparently, it looks like that to the Archbishop of Bulawayo. If SADC continues to do very little to rescue the situation, apart from the rather ineffective activities of President Mbeki, and the situation in Zimbabwe collapses into total ruin, is it not likely that the SADC economies will suffer and that aid which had been intended for SADC countries will have to be diverted to Zimbabwe?</p>

On the meetings which President Mbeki is engaged in, I understand that this is not the first time that Zanu-PF has failed to turn up, but it is understood that the meetings will still take place. We hope that progress will be made and that President Mbeki will report to the SADC meeting in August.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="07071266000085"></a>The inflation is quite extraordinary. When last month my noble friend Lord Triesman answered a question from the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, he said that inflation would possibly reach 11,000 per cent this year. We now understand that any old figure might do, and are expecting perhaps 100,000 per cent inflation by the end of the year. The situation is quite extraordinary and, yes, it looks as though the country is in terminal decline. We will certainly do whatever we can to assist in rebuilding it.</p>

Is thought really being given to rescue plans for the economy without political reforms, which would include the departure of President Mugabe and the restoration of freedoms guaranteed by international law? If Zanu-PF continues to delay and obstruct the mediation efforts of SADC, is there a fallback plan?</p>

This is just a South African initiative, not an international one. We firmly believe that good governance and restoring law and order in Zimbabwe are of the utmost priority. It is good that South Africa is now thinking in these terms and things are finally being aired in public. Perhaps it is an indication of the level of concern in South Africa. That is an important step forward.</p>

<a name="70712-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07071266000117"></a>First, the order reflects the fact that the United Kingdom and Algeria signed a bilateral extradition treaty on 11 July 2006 and exchanged instruments of ratification on 25 February 2007. Designation of Algeria as a category 2 territory will bring this treaty into force in the United Kingdom. The extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and Algeria, signed by my right honourable friend, the then Home Secretary, Dr John Reid and the Algerian Justice Minister on 11 July 2006, is one of a package of measures, including a treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, a treaty on judicial co-operation in civil and commercial matters, an agreement on the circulation of persons and readmission, and an exchange of letters between the former Prime Minister and the President of Algeria which forms the basis of the deportation and assurances procedure.</p>

<a name="70712-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07071266000118"></a>These measures are designed to increase co-operation between our two countries. The extradition treaty allows extradition to be requested for any offence that attracts a maximum penalty of at least 12 months in

The evidential requirements set out in the treaty mean that both the United Kingdom and Algeria must provide a prima facie evidential case against any person whom they wish to extradite.</p>
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="70712-0002.htm_time3"></a><h5><a name="07071266000776"></a>11.45 am</h5>

<a name="70712-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07071266000119"></a>There are currently no formal extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and Algeria outside a number of international conventions to which we are both parties and which deal with a limited number of specific offences mostly associated with terrorism. The introduction of a formal basis for extradition for conduct covered by the United Kingdom-Algeria treaty will lead to a more efficient and effective process for extradition between the two countries. This will be preferable to relying on the ad hoc provisions in domestic extradition law for the many offences, such as murder or rape, that do not fall under the international conventions to which I referred. Indeed, one of the advantages of the new arrangements is that we will improve our ability to achieve justice for British victims of serious crimes. For clarity, I should add that, although deportation and extradition procedures are distinct, the principle of relying on credible assurances should be as applicable to extradition as it has been to deportation. We have already successfully deported individuals to Algeria. The human rights requirements applied by the UK courts that approve deportation are the same requirements that will be applied by the courts in future extradition cases.</p>

<a name="70712-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07071266000120"></a>Secondly, the order also designates Gibraltar as a category 1 territory, as Gibraltar has implemented its own legislation giving effect in Gibraltar to the streamlined and simplified European arrest warrant. Although Gibraltar is not an EU member state, Article 299.4 of the Treaty on European Union 1993 provides that the treaty applies to,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000753"></a>&#147;the European territories for whose external relations a Member State is responsible&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000696"></a>In addition, Article 33 of the Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant confirms that these arrangements apply to Gibraltar. Gibraltar has designated the United Kingdom as a state for the purposes of the European arrest warrant, and has incorporated the European arrest warrant into its own legislation. Likewise, the United Kingdom needs to designate Gibraltar as a part 1 territory so that extradition between the UK and Gibraltar can be effected by the European arrest warrant procedure. The order amends the relevant part of the Act accordingly, and ensures that the United Kingdom continues to comply with our obligations under the framework decision. Gibraltar will thus become the 27th territory to which European arrest warrant procedures will apply to extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70712-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07071266000121"></a>Thirdly, the House will be aware that the 2006 Statutory Instrument No. 3451 designated Bosnia-Herzegovina as an extradition partner under the European Convention on Extradition. The order reflects that, under that convention, the time limit for requesting a state to submit full extradition papers in support of a request for a provisional arrest is now 40 days as opposed to 60 days. That longer time limit of 60 days was contained in the old United Kingdom-Yugoslavia

<a name="70712-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07071266000122"></a>The amendments are necessary to ensure that the United Kingdom can comply with its obligations under the relevant international extradition agreements. I hope that, given my explanation, the House will approve the order. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07071266000125"></a>He has had a glittering career, as I am sure your Lordships are all aware. Following Dartmouth, the noble Lord has served in one capacity or another in no fewer than 14 ships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07071266000126"></a>Most memorably for the noble Lord, and for all of your Lordships, the noble Lord was commanding the frigate &#147;Ardent&#148; on 21 May 1982 in the South Atlantic when she was mortally struck. The noble Lord was the last to abandon his doomed ship, subsequently receiving the Distinguished Service Cross for his gallant conduct and exemplary leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07071266000127"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s career as a staff officer proved as distinguished as it had in battle. He became Commander-in-Chief Fleet in November 2000 and in September 2002, as your Lordships well know, he was appointed First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff. In 2004, already an admiral, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07071266000128"></a>We are so fortunate to have among us a man of the stature of the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead. Your Lordships&#146; House is immensely enriched by his arrival.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07071266000129"></a>I assure the noble Lord that he will find that Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition are rather more urbane than his opponents in the South Atlantic. Metaphorically speaking, the noble Lord may, from time to time, detect the rattle of small arms fire; but missiles are rarely launched.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07071266000130"></a>The choice of extradition as the subject of the noble Lord&#146;s first speech could not better exhibit the noble Lord&#146;s reputation for courage. A little while ago the Government sought the agreement of your Lordships&#146; House, under Article 3 of the Extradition Act 2003 (Designation of Part 2 Territories) Order 2003, to remove the obligation of the United States of America to establish a prima facie case in our courts against someone for whom it requested extradition. For motives that your Lordships have never been able to fathom, the right honourable gentleman Mr Blunkett, then Home Secretary, had made this astonishing unilateral concession in a treaty negotiated and signed in private. Not even his Minister of State knew of these events. That was one of those occasions when missiles were fired in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07071266000131"></a>Happily, we are not faced with a similar situation today. Only one of the three treaties merits some words of caution and that concerns Algeria. The part 2 designation here retains the obligation on the Algerian authorities to make out a prima facie case. However, even if such a case is satisfactorily made out, our obligations under both the European Convention on

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07071266000132"></a>I am aware that the Government have signed a memorandum of understanding with Algeria about the treatment of deportees and that, previously, in 2004 their Government promulgated a charter for peace and national reconciliation. However, until then Algeria was indisputably engaged in the systematic abuse of human rights. Are the Government carefully monitoring the human rights situation in Algeria and in particular the fate of deportees? Can the noble Lord assure us that no one will be extradited to Algeria if, in the Government&#146;s view, there is a discernibly real risk of torture, and that if they and the individual concerned disagree about the nature of the risk, it will be open to the individual to argue his case in the courts of this country?</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07071266000133"></a>It is worth reminding ourselves in this context that the Government&#146;s obligations go beyond the merely diplomatic. Any citizen of this country involved in the enforced return of an individual to a foreign country, whether he knows or ought to know that that person is in real risk of torture, is complicit in the conduct of the delinquent state by virtue of the International Convention on Torture. He is therefore committing an international crime for which he can be prosecuted in his domestic courts or in the International Criminal Court.</p>

He joins a very select band in this House of those who have been born into a police family. He should know that I spent my first five years in a police station in north Wales&#151;living there I hasten to say. When the noble Lord described his interest in small boats, I pricked up my ears as the captain of the Lords eight, which lost by one length along the river here a week ago. I see that some members of the team are with us today and I trust that the noble Lord will put himself forward for competition for a place in our boat next year, with a view to gaining our revenge on the Commons.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07071266000135"></a>I have nothing to say on the order regarding Gibraltar and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but I have a great deal to say about extradition to Algeria. We regard the order as hopelessly premature. Existing at the moment is a case in the Court of Appeal involving Mustapha Taleb and others. It was argued in June and the judgment is awaited. The whole point of that judgment is to investigate dangers to people who are either deported or extradited to Algeria. For the Government to bring forward this order at a time when the judgment has not been received is extremely unfortunate.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07071266000136"></a>I also draw attention to the latest Amnesty International report published in May of this year about the conditions in Algeria. It is true that Britain entered into a memorandum of understanding in 2006 and received assurances from the Algerian authorities that returnees would not be tortured or ill-treated. But a sine qua non of that understanding was that there would be  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1512"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independent monitoring of that return, which has not happened. Algeria continues to refuse to accept independent monitoring of what goes on in its jails. I should like to know the Government&#146;s response to that.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07071266000137"></a>In its recent report, Amnesty International says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07071266000733"></a>&#147;Torture continued to be used with impunity. There were persistent reports of torture and other ill-treatment in the custody of the Department for Information and Security (D&#233;partement du renseignement et de la s&#233;curit&#233;, DRS), a military intelligence agency which carries out terrorism-related arrests and investigations. Detainees held in DRS custody said they were beaten, tortured with electric shocks, suspended from the ceiling, and forced to swallow large amounts of dirty water, urine or chemicals. They were held by the DRS in secret locations for up to several months, during which they were denied contact with the outside world, in violation of the law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000697"></a>That is the position on torture. On enforced disappearances, thousands of people disappeared between 1993 and 2002. Dozens of court cases have been brought to investigate what has happened to them, but there has been no response from the Algerian Government.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07071266000138"></a>In February 2004, the Algerian Government criminalised free speech about the conduct of the security forces, which means that anybody criticising those forces faces a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years. Victims of human rights abuses and their families, defenders, journalists and trade unionists face a range of other forms of harassment and intimidation. Twenty journalists have been prosecuted for defamation after complaints by police officers. Last September, trumped-up charges were brought against two lawyers, Hassiba Boumerdesi and Amine Sidhoum. Fortunately, in April 2007, that was resolved in their favour. It was an attempt to intimidate and deter them from carrying out human rights work.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07071266000139"></a>The noble Lord referred to a treaty of mutual legal assistance. I was talking this morning with that very well known human rights lawyer, Gareth Peirce, who told me that she has been consistently denied a visa and accreditation by the Bar in Algeria, which would allow her to go to that country. She wants to go because seven or eight people voluntarily returned to Algeria in January, resting their confidence on the agreement reached last year to which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred. Her information is that at least two of them have been tortured in the way that I described. The rest have been subject to arrest and imprisonment for varying periods by the DRS, the military intelligence agency to which I alluded earlier. </p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07071266000140"></a>The position is in no way satisfactory. It should be proper to bring forward an order of this kind only when we can be absolutely confident that assurances given by the Algerian Government will be carried out. To do it within months as opposed to years is, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, very premature indeed.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07071266000141"></a>I have brought all these matters forward for your Lordships&#146; consideration so that it is on the record when, in future cases, applications are made to the courts under human rights legislation to prevent the deportation or extradition of people under the powers which your Lordships are being asked to grant today and those powers are being challenged. This is not the moment to bring forward a measure of this kind.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for his kind remarks. I was rather embarrassed by them all, but I thank him very much indeed. I shall try to address all the points; if I do not, I will answer them later in writing.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07071266000143"></a>One has to look at Algeria in a very broad context. In the 1990s, it experienced an unpleasant&#151;almost civil&#151;war. President Bouteflika has tried hard to make major changes. As the noble Lord mentioned, he implemented a charter for peace and national reconciliation in 2004, and it is taken very seriously. There has been a revision of the family code, and torture is now explicitly a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07071266000144"></a>As Algeria has become what I would call a proper member of the world community, it is under threat from extremists, and the al-Qaeda Maghreb branch left over from the terrorist period of the 1990s is conducting attacks. There was a very unpleasant attack in Algeria only yesterday in which eight people were killed by that al-Qaeda group&#151;a splinter group of the group that is threatening stability around the world and our own country. It is also of interest that the Special Immigration Appeals Commission has looked at conditions in Algeria and been content to allow people to be extradited.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07071266000145"></a>Specifically on the extradition issue, extradition is of course prohibited by the express provisions of the Human Rights Act as they apply to the Extradition Act. If there is a real risk of torture, the courts will refuse to grant extradition. I am content that that is in place. Indeed, as I mentioned in my opening speech, we have returned people to Algeria. Safety mechanisms are in place there in terms of consular access and access to our embassy, which means that we can monitor the position to that extent.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07071266000146"></a>On the US/UK extradition treaty of 2003, this was negotiated under exactly the same rules and according to the normal procedures as all other treaties. The treaty was ratified in 2007 and entered into force on the same day. I believe that there is broad reciprocity, and what is really important is that these steps are in the interests of justice. Given that, I think that it was a good thing to do.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07071266000147"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his kind remarks. I am not sure whether I would be that good in an eight, but I am willing to have a go at it. I did do some pulling at Dartmouth&#151;we call it that in the Navy rather than rowing&#151;and I would try my best. Regarding his questions on Mustapha Taleb, the Government&#146;s position remains unchanged: in principle, it is safe to return people to Algeria. The Government believe the same in regard to extradition. It is important to flag up that the extradition legislation contains strong safeguards to prevent abuse of the process. It is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases currently before our courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07071266000148"></a>I hope that I have satisfactorily addressed some of the probing and interesting questions put to me. If there are any questions that I have not been able to answer during my inaugural debate, I hope that noble Lords will understand if I write to them in response afterwards.</p>

I am deeply thankful for the warmth of the welcome I have received from everyone.

I am conscious of the great wealth of expertise and experience concentrated in your Lordships&#146; House and I look forward to benefiting from it. I am fortunate enough to know many noble Lords from other walks of life. I have admired and respected them for their work and the experience they acquired individually before they, too, entered this House. Even more, I respect and admire the wisdom and understanding of the important issues that noble Lords display every day, and from which this great nation of ours can only benefit. It is in equal measure exhilarating and daunting to join the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07071266000153"></a>I have so much to learn, not just the &#147;Red Flag&#148;, as the gentlemen of the press have been quick to point out, but also the art of brevity, to which I am often informed I am a total stranger. Especially, I really do have to learn the distinction between travelling the world for my country, and eating and drinking for it. It is a particular privilege to make my maiden speech in your Lordships&#146; House on a subject of such national and international importance and which for a long time has been of great personal interest; that is, energy policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07071266000154"></a>The energy White Paper, which we published in May, made it clear that we face two big challenges in the arena of energy policy: first, the need, with other countries, to tackle climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions; and, secondly, the need to ensure that we have secure and affordable energy supplies. The White Paper also made it clear that, despite some good progress, projections for the future, based on current policies, frankly, do not make for positive reading. Greenhouse gas emissions will keep rising as world energy demand is expected to be 50 per cent higher by 2030 than it is today. That demand is likely to be met largely by fossil fuels for some time to come. Greater competition for energy resources and the UK's increasing reliance on imported energy will also have implications for security of supply and we must act now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07071266000156"></a>Beyond the United Kingdom, we must be an active part of the emerging European Union energy and climate change policy that was agreed at the March Spring Council. This included commitments to competitive markets, cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, more renewable energy and a central role for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as the potential basis for a global carbon market. We must use our influence as a united EU voice to work with the wider international community, notably in getting a consensus on the post-2012 Kyoto framework for reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07071266000157"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will have seen for themselves&#151;the energy White Paper is a significant piece of work&#151;that these issues require a wide range of actions in response. There is no one answer. Anyone who insists that there is just one solution to addressing these challenges has failed to grasp their scale, their complexity and the way they interrelate. The White Paper sets out a long-term framework for international and domestic action to address these challenges, recognising that we need to tackle climate change and energy security as two sides of the same coin. We cannot address one at the expense of the other.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07071266000158"></a>Our first priority is to find ways of using less energy. The cleanest power station is the one that you do not have to build. The White Paper sets out a range of measures to help us to become more energy efficient and to cut energy use; that includes ensuring that any householder who asks for them can get free visual real-time displays of how much electricity they are using. We are also working with industry to provide better and clearer energy bills, to introduce smart meters and, crucially, to improve the efficiency of domestic appliances, phasing out inefficient goods and limiting the amount of standby energy that we all waste.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07071266000159"></a>The White Paper also proposes that from next year, energy suppliers double their current efforts to increase energy efficiency among their customers, and from 2011 we aim to transform their relationship with their customers, shifting the focus to the provision of energy services, increasing energy efficiency and saving carbon in the home.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07071266000160"></a>It is important that we also consider how vulnerable consumers are treated. The measures in the White Paper will help us to reach out to the most vulnerable and will take a further 200,000 households out of fuel poverty by 2010&#151;that is around 10 per cent of the total number of households that we need to reach. This is progress, but it is clear that we have a lot more to do in that area. We will also require big organisations such as supermarkets, banks, hotel chains and large public sector organisations to limit their emissions through a new trading scheme. We are setting tougher energy efficiency standards for the new homes that we build and the products that we all buy.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07071266000161"></a>But we cannot reach our reduction targets through energy saving alone. It is clear that we need more low-carbon generation of electricity; and more low-carbon

We also want to encourage more local energy production. We have brought forward a range of measures to support this approach, including removing barriers for small-scale generators and simplifying some of the processes they need to do in order to participate in the energy market.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07071266000162"></a>In order to meet energy demand, we shall still need investment in large-scale electricity generation over the next 20 to 30 years. We will need new generating capacity equivalent to over a third of our existing capacity. It is vital that companies have a wide range of options available to invest in, so that we can retain a diverse energy mix and move to an increasingly low-carbon economy.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07071266000163"></a>The White Paper made clear our commitment to a central role for renewables such as wind, biomass, wave and tidal power in this energy mix. Through our reforms of the renewables obligation we expect that by 2015 around 15 per cent of our electricity supplies will come from renewables. That is triple the amount that we have today. And biofuels have a key role to play in transport. The road transport fuel obligation will require suppliers to ensure that 5 per cent of total fuel sales are from a renewable source by 2010-11. That represents around 2.5 billion litres of fuel and we estimate that it will save a million tonnes of carbon a year.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07071266000164"></a>It will be important that new low-carbon technologies are developed. We have set up the Energy Technologies Institute, which brings public and private investment together, and now has a minimum budget of &#163;600 million. We are launching a competition for the demonstration of carbon capture and storage, which has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel power stations by as much as 90 per cent.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07071266000165"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, alongside the White Paper we published a consultation document on nuclear power. I know that I do not need to stand here today and tell your Lordships that tackling climate change is possibly the greatest challenge of our age. And I am sure you do not need to be reminded how important energy security is to the health of our economy and to the health and well-being of our communities and the people of this island. We all know that these things are important and we all recognise the scale and complexity of the challenge we face.  </p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07071266000166"></a>About a third of the United Kingdom&#146;s electricity generation is due to be retired over the next two decades. That includes almost all our nuclear power stations, which currently provide around 18 per cent of our electricity. In addition, the UK's indigenous supplies of gas from the North Sea are running out and we are becoming increasingly dependent upon imports. </p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07071266000167"></a>In the UK, we are used to being largely self-sufficient in terms of our electricity generation: the people are used to it. But times are changing, and they are changing at a time of rising demand and prices and at a time when energy supplies are becoming increasingly politicised. This is not a position anyone in this country will be comfortable with. So the challenge is not just how to ensure that we can generate the base-load  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1517"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>electricity that we need to underpin our renewable electricity generators: it is how we do so in a way that does not contribute towards climate change.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07071266000168"></a>So, what are the available solutions? Clearly, renewable energy will have an increasingly important role to play. Carbon capture and storage also has the potential to play a key role, and we are launching a competition for a full-scale demonstrator. But it is a relatively unproven technology. We can rely on gas, but the big reserves of gas are concentrated in a relatively small number of countries, and I do not need to spell out the challenges that that situation puts us in.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07071266000169"></a>Nuclear has played an important role in providing this country with low-carbon, base-load electricity for half a century. It is a mature technology with a proven track record in providing very low-carbon, baseload power.</p>

<a name="70712-0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07071266000170"></a>I believe that the best way to meet the low-carbon, secure energy challenge is by doing everything we can, from encouraging responsible energy use to making sure that energy companies have access to all the available low-carbon technologies. That is why we have taken a preliminary view that energy companies should have the option of investing in new nuclear power stations. However, we are currently consulting on this view and will fully consider the responses we receive before making any final decision later this year once full consultation has closed. But we do not have the luxury of time. We have been clear that one way or another we need to make a decision on nuclear power stations this year.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07071266000171"></a>We recognise that there are important specific issues to consider in respect of nuclear power, including the question of waste and we are making progress on this. We initiated a review of nuclear waste policy and appointed the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management in 2003 to assess and recommend the best options for dealing with higher activity solid waste. CoRWM concluded that geological disposal was the best available approach, coupled with safe and secure interim storage in the mean time. We accepted its recommendations and have begun the process of developing an implementation framework for providing a geological disposal facility. We are currently consulting on a framework for implementing geological disposal.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07071266000172"></a>If nuclear is not available to the energy market as an option, it is likely that in its place much of the new investment will be in gas or coal generation, which, of course, emits higher levels of carbon and leaves us increasingly dependent upon imports for this nation&#146;s electricity generation. Even with nuclear power stations as an option, over the next 10 years or so most new investment will be in renewables and fossil-fuel plant. However, over the longer term we need to ensure that we can provide the low-carbon, baseload electricity that this nation needs.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07071266000173"></a>I know that nuclear power is a controversial issue, but we must not lose sight of the significant challenge that faces this country; a challenge which we must all confront, not avoid, and work together to solve for the benefit of everyone in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07071266000174"></a>The measures to address climate change, including those in the White Paper, put us on track to make savings of carbon emissions of between 23 million to  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1518"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>33 million tonnes by 2020&#151;putting us on track to meet our 2050 goal of a 60 per cent reduction from 1990 levels. By saving energy, encouraging new timely investment in gas import and storage infrastructure and by maximising recovery of UK reserves of oil, gas and coal, our measures will also help the security of supply.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07071266000175"></a>The White Paper sets the policies. We now need to get on with delivery. We are in the process now of implementing the measures. Some we can do without the need for further regulation or consultation, such as providing the energy markets outlook, which we will do this autumn. Others rightly require consultation, and some, indeed, will require primary legislation. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced our proposals for legislation in the next Session. These include Bills on planning, energy and climate change. All three are crucial to meeting the energy challenge; not the least planning reform. I speak from personal experience on this one; our businesses, wealth creation and our whole economy and infrastructure are crying out for a streamlined planning system.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07071266000176"></a>Of course, no one document&#151;not even as comprehensive a White Paper as this one&#151;can be the final answer to the long-term challenges that this nation faces. Becoming a low-carbon economy will mean a series of changes and developments over decades to come. Further measures will be needed if we are to achieve our long-term goals, in the light of further international agreements, or as new technologies emerge. While further refining of our policies over the long term is inevitable, the framework for action is set out in the White Paper. It is based on the principles of competitive energy markets, energy efficiency and a diverse energy mix, with more low-carbon sources of energy. That will not change, and it enables us to make real progress now towards tackling climate change and ensuring secure and affordable energy supplies in the most effective and cost-efficient way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07071266000177"></a>Much has been made of my appointment as a Minister. There is a big job to be done for the country, for the Government and for the Prime Minister in emphasising every day, everywhere, the importance of UK trade and investment for jobs and for the capacity of this great nation of ours to pay its way in the world. It should be clear enough to everyone that this is above the conflicts&#151;understandably so&#151;of party politics. From value-added innovative manufacturing&#151;which I remind the House very much thrives in 21st-century Britain&#151;to the creative industries, from financial services to retail and oil and gas, from our world-class universities to our tourism, I intend to bang the drum for Britain wherever I go in the world. I hope that your Lordships will all be as proud of me as I do this job as I am so very proud to speak to you today. Thank you. I beg to move.</p>

Some things in this House are done by custom, but I do so with conviction, given the quality of the speech that we have just heard. I have followed the noble Lord&#146;s distinguished career over many years, and I have thought it likely that we would see him here one day, although his particular place in the House was not quite so easy to forecast.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07071266000180"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s maiden speech was in the line of a long tradition in this House of being uncontroversial, which is quite difficult on this topic. I am sure that his new noble friends will be as relieved about that duty to be non-controversial as I am, given some of his past observations on the policies of Governments. After today, in becoming a Minister, he shares collective responsibility for defending all Labour Government policies, past and present. The House will look forward with great interest to hearing him do that as robustly and controversially as he likes. I congratulate the noble Lord, and we on these Benches all wish him well. The House will eagerly anticipate hearing from him on many occasions in the future.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07071266000181"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, said that this is a subject close to his heart, and I have no doubt that he will enjoy this first exchange. As the Stern review made clear, climate change&#151;and the steps that we can take to protect ourselves from it&#151;is one of the most important issues facing our generation. On these Benches, we are very glad that the Government are starting to listen to the Conservative Party about the critical importance of reducing the environmental impact of our energy industry.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07071266000182"></a>It is unfortunate, however, that the Government are apparently still unable to take the necessary steps to ensure that anything significant will happen. This White Paper was an opportunity for the Government to give a clear indication of their policies and commitments that will be needed to meet the energy challenge. Instead, we again have a list of possibilities and half-hearted or unclear statements. Indeed, the Government have created a great deal of confusion over one of the most controversial aspects of energy policy&#151;whether nuclear power stations that are going to be decommissioned in the near future will be replaced. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Jones, can clarify the position. Do the Government intend to stick to their line in the energy review in 2006, which stated that nuclear power,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000754"></a>&#147;has a role to play&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000698"></a>or is the question still open to debate, even given what the noble Lord has said this morning?</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07071266000183"></a>The Prime Minister has suggested that his mind is already made up. At Prime Minster&#146;s Questions on 4 July, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07071266000734"></a>&#147;We have made a decision to continue with nuclear power&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/7/07; c.955.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70712-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07071266000184"></a>Yet, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, is on record as saying that the debate has just started. The noble Lord&#146;s understanding of the necessary process is supported by the findings of a judicial review, which confirmed in February this year that no decision on nuclear power could be taken until a full public consultation  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1520"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had been completed. This White Paper appears to agree. It says nothing more than that the Government believe that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000755"></a>&#147;new nuclear power stations could make a significant contribution&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000699"></a>and consultations will not close until October.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07071266000185"></a>Can the Minister confirm once and for all not only for the benefit of noble Lords but also for the benefit of the many interested lobby groups what is the Government&#146;s line on nuclear power? Does he agree that failing to consult fully has already led to a legal challenge, which delayed the Government&#146;s White Paper? Further confusion about the status of the consultation will not only make it difficult for those groups who have engaged in the consultation in good faith, but will make it much harder for companies hoping to build and run any eventual power stations, to cost and tender their bids if there is a risk that the consultation process will be undermined. How can the Government expect such a controversial issue, with so many stakeholders, to be resolved effectively if Ministers say different things and no one knows the real situation?</p>

Unlikely though it may be, that party has the potential to be a successor Government and, in the interests of continuity of policy, it is not unreasonable for us to ask what the policies of the Conservative Party are. In every television studio in the country, there appears to be degrees of division.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07071266000188"></a>As it is, any decision that is finally made seems likely to be based on uncertain estimations and unclear risks. How is the industry expected to calculate whether it will be feasible to invest in new power stations if the Government refuse to lay out what would be expected from them? For example, the Government have not yet made it clear how clean-up or waste disposal costs will be calculated, or what steps they will take to ensure that the taxpayer does not end up carrying the cost. Such clarification will not prejudice the consultation that is currently going on, but will inform it, and raise the debate from one of sentiment and prejudice to one of practical concerns and necessary safeguards.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07071266000189"></a>Nuclear power has both benefits, such as a relatively low carbon footprint and the potential to improve UK energy capacity significantly, and risks, such as dangerous waste and expensive decommissioning. Those risks cannot be accurately calculated without more information on the Government&#146;s intention.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07071266000190"></a>Turning to the other aspects of the White Paper, I must admit that I am rather disappointed by the lack of clear decision on many issues that we would like to see moved forward. In particular, the Government&#146;s proposals on renewable energy are not adequate. It is going to be very hard as it is to reach the EU target of 20 per cent of energy from renewable sources by 2020, especially as we are starting from such a low point compared with other countries in western Europe.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07071266000191"></a>Government delay and confusion have already caused a promising carbon capture scheme to suffer. BP has had to pull out of the Peterhead scheme after the Government decided to delay the competition until November this year. The waste of the resources already invested is a disgrace. I wonder whether the Minister can explain how this was allowed to happen.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07071266000192"></a>We are very glad that the renewables obligation is to be reformed. After criticism by Ofgem earlier this year, it would have been worrying if it was not to be. However, the Government are still pursuing the idea of banding and many of Ofgem&#146;s criticism are still applicable. In particular, Ofgem and the National Audit Office have pointed out that the current scheme is still very costly, with customers paying, even if the renewable generator is not built.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07071266000193"></a>Is the Minister not also worried that the Government are continuing the policy that Dr Dieter Helm called, &#147;picking winners&#148;? In October last year he warned of the inability of governments to predict costs and returns from specific technologies. Will the Minister explain why he thinks that the &#147;man in Whitehall&#148; knows best when it comes to choosing between competing renewable technologies? Does he not agree that under a banding scheme the potential is still there for directing funding away from one source to another for reasons that have nothing to do with cost-effectiveness? Why are the Government continuing to interfere at this level? If they were to ensure a level playing field, the market would make the decision on which renewable is supported, and costs and risks would accurately be taken into account, resulting in a more efficient apportionment of subsidy.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07071266000194"></a>The level playing field should also apply to other methods of improving our environmental record. I hope that the Government will eventually accept the Conservative policy of focusing on carbon emissions rather than selecting favoured industries. With a uniform price of carbon, set by a long-term cap and trade regime, the industry will establish the best method to improve its output itself, whether that be by encouraging energy efficiency, low-carbon energy production or renewable energy sources.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07071266000195"></a>There is disappointingly little of substance in this paper about many of those methods. The EU emissions trading scheme has the potential to provide the necessary incentives to encourage their development, but only extends to 2012. The Government must start looking at ways of not only improving the method of assigning credits, but also extending this to the long term as soon as possible. I ask the Minister to explain to the House what the Government are doing to achieve a firm EU-wide commitment to a strong carbon price for the long term.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07071266000196"></a>Climate change is a very real and present danger. The long-term consequences will affect both rich and poor across the world. Decisive action needs to be taken now. The alternative is a future of rising energy bills, increasingly uncertain energy supplies and continuing environmental damage. Yet the Government appear able to talk only about what might be done in the future. The Energy Bill that we have been promised in the next Session must show what will be done. I shall

It was much longer than many of us are allowed in our maiden speech but was delivered very well indeed. It was not entirely uncontentious&#151;as he suggested, any speech on nuclear power will divide not only the House but each of the groups here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07071266000199"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, I live in Cornwall. Although the Minister probably will not remember, I met him at a Liberal Democrat conference where he was a guest. I mentioned to him that I come from Cornwall and he efficiently and knowledgeably came out with a number of major economic and business players in Cornwall whom he knew. It was most impressive. I am sure that during his tenure in the Government he will continue to keep that connection with the far south-west which is so important. This morning I was also impressed because it looked like there had been regime change on the government Benches. However, the noble Lord, Lord Evans, quickly came in to make sure that order was restored and the ancien r&#233;gime was there for a little longer.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07071266000200"></a>It is good to have a little history on subjects of this sort. I went to a school in Essex, although it is now in London as a result of the boundary changes in the 1970s. I remember that during the days of smog I used to come back towards London and that in the winter we were concerned about energy cuts. The big question on energy was how many days out we would have during cold snaps when we would have no energy supply whatever. That changed very soon, and in the 1970s the question was not capacity but the three-day week and the battles between the electricity suppliers and the unions that disrupted our electricity supplies. In the 1980s, during the regime of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, we had privatisation and the depoliticisation of energy. The Department of Energy disappeared into the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;I think the noble Lord, Lord Parkinson, was the last Secretary of State for Energy&#151;and energy was more or less forgotten about by the political class and Parliament. There were no more issues because the private sector dealt with it.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07071266000201"></a>As a result of privatisation we had major decreases in energy prices in the 1990s and a good outcome was that fuel poverty decreased. I give the Government credit for their work in reducing that further. As the statistics show, electricity prices in real terms decreased by 30 per cent from the beginning of 1990 to at least 2004. Although they have risen substantially, electricity prices in real terms are 20 per cent less today than they were in the early 1990s. However, in the past couple of years&#151;indeed, in the past 12 months&#151;energy has

Not only are climate change and energy security big news; every time we read scientific papers or have further meetings of the climate change committee, the predictions about the problem get worse. No doubt the same will be true of the Bali conference later this year. The issues are greater than we expected. The International Energy Agency has predicted that there will be an oil crunch in the next five years. As the Minister said, this is not only a live and important issue&#151;it is becoming an increasingly dangerous global issue.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07071266000202"></a>I was pleased that the Minister specifically mentioned energy savings, which is dealt with in the first major chapter of the White Paper. Compared with the marvellous new renewable technologies, nuclear power and the array of things in the White Paper, energy savings is one of the less sexy areas&#151;but it is a key area of energy policy. Far greater savings are possible than we sometimes credit. A number of studies, particularly in Scandinavia, show that energy saving is not only good in itself, it has a negative cost. Energy saving gives a positive payback. As it does not involve major investment or real cost, we have to concentrate on it. However, the White Paper does not say how that is to be delivered.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07071266000203"></a>From my economics background I know that demand for electricity and power generally is very inelastic, partly because of the current abundance of power and its ease of use. Even if we change prices through cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes or whatever, households will be slow to change how they work. It is therefore very important to change regulation and standards and that whole approach. Many of the product standards which the White Paper talks about are not decided here in Whitehall but are single market issues to be decided by the 27 member states in the European Parliament and the Commission. I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s view on what solidarity he expects among business department Ministers regarding how the agenda can be moved forward relatively quickly, in contrast to the sometimes slow decision-making in Brussels.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07071266000204"></a>One area really concerns me. Although one would never want to say that a government document is naïve, one paragraph in it&#151;and in the Minister&#146;s Statement&#151;says that energy supply companies will have to become energy services companies and that we must persuade them that, rather than wanting to sell energy, they must want to balance energy sales with energy savings. The White Paper says that we will need an innovative policy for that. I read that as a euphemism for, &#147;We need something but we haven&#146;t worked out what the heck it could be. Somehow we need to persuade energy companies to de-sell their products&#148;. As energy is important for security, that is rather like putting al-Qaeda in charge of homeland security. It is trying to persuade some of the largest global corporations to do exactly what they are trying not to do.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07071266000205"></a>From my business and industrial experience I know that, during the 1980s and 1990s, we learnt to concentrate on our core products. Energy companies are about delivering energy to consumers as effectively as they  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1524"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can with the least number of interruptions and at the lowest cost. I cannot see how a change in the legislative regime would, as the White Paper suggests, make them become a major part of the solution. We have to make sure that they are efficient and competitive suppliers, but at the household end&#151;the demand side&#151;we need to bridge the gap between initial capital expenditure on energy saving and the downstream benefits once that investment has taken place. It must be far easier to square that circle by financial engineering&#151;loans or whatever&#151;than by trying to persuade big global corporations to be what they are not. Let them concentrate on what they are good at.</p>

<a name="70712-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07071266000206"></a>The Minister mentioned renewables, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. This is clearly a key area for all sides of the House. The latest available figures, from 2006, show that we are now 26th out of 27 EU member states in terms of the proportion of our energy that is renewable&#151;it is 1.7 per cent. The only country which is behind us is Malta, where the proportion of energy generated from renewable sources was zero in 2006. Like the noble Baroness, I ask the Minister how we will practically reach a position where we play our full part in meeting the European Union&#146;s objective for 2020, which is a mere 13 years away, of generating 20 per cent not just of electricity but all energy from renewable sources. The UK will clearly have its own allocation as part of meeting that target. While I applaud the target, I fail to see how we are going to do it. The White Paper does not mention it.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70712-0005.htm"/>


<a name="70712-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07071266000207"></a>One aspect of consumer power in this area is smart meters. The White Paper gives a detailed explanation of its approach to smart meters, but the two-stage approach that it suggests, initially involving making available cheap, clip-on smart meters&#151;which are not really smart meters at all&#151;seems more a gimmick than something that is useful. They will be introduced and they will be expensive, but they measure only electricity; they cannot measure gas, which is more important in households; they will not convert consumption into a monetary value; and their readings are not easy to display on a TV or a computer in the household. I strongly urge the Government, therefore, not to worry about that aspect, but to take the slightly longer-term view and move on to real smart meters, where the technology already exists. We are obliged by the electrical services directive to start to implement real changes in this area by May 2008. I humbly suggest to the Minister that the easiest approach is for the Government to mandate any meter changes from May 2008, thereby tying in with the European legislation, to be proper smart meters that can measure all forms of energy used in the household, show pricing and can be displayed on a screen that people can see and use every day. That would bring power back to households to make sensible decisions about energy.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07071266000208"></a>I again congratulate the Minister on his speech. As I said, he mentioned Cornwall, to which I might perhaps give one plug. We have a renewable technology of our own, hot dry rocks, which is geothermal power. It has not been very popular with the Government, but it could offer that bedrock of electricity generation that we all desire from renewables. I would like at some point to speak to him further about that. I hope that it

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07071266000210"></a>I hope that his appointment signals a real change in the new Administration&#146;s approach to changes in climate and, in particular, to a related subject in which I can declare an interest; namely, daylight saving. I am the founder chairman of LEAP, the Lighter Evenings All-Party Group, which will, incidentally, meet again on Monday 16 July. All noble Lords are of course cordially invited.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07071266000211"></a>I hope also that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition and the Liberal Democrats will take the opportunity provided by the change in administration to look again at their own response to daylight saving as a means of &#147;meeting the energy challenge&#148;, which is the title of this debate, as well at the other benefits that it will bring to our society.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07071266000212"></a>However, before I embark on the energy-saving aspect of the debate, it should be worth while my questioning what statistics the Government and the opposition parties have to back up their continued insistence on GMT for the winter months. Where is the data to demonstrate that this policy makes any contribution towards meeting the country&#146;s energy challenge?</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07071266000213"></a>I have been fortunate enough to have had sight of a detailed study in draft of Dr Elizabeth Garnsey and Brendan Cronin from the University of Cambridge&#146;s Centre for Technology Management in the Department of Engineering and Judge Business School. It is entitled, <I>Re-evaluating Daylight Saving in the United Kingdom</I>. Their considered conclusions recognise the differences of opinion on the relative advantages and disadvantages of darker mornings or darker evenings, when the total hours of daylight are constrained. However, no factual evidence in favour of a return to GMT in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom is to be found anywhere in the study. In fact, research estimates show that a greater loss of life and a greater number of casualties occur as a result of the annual return to GMT on the last Sunday of October throughout the UK, including Scotland. It is clear that since 1971, at least 5,000 deaths have occurred on the road that are directly attributable to switching to GMT during the winter months.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07071266000214"></a>I shall come to saving energy in a moment, but I first want to hear from the Government and the opposition Front Benches statistics which can justify the current situation. I want to hear also statistics showing that maintaining GMT, with darker afternoons and evenings during the winter months, can be of benefit to the tourist industry, with which I believe the  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1526"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister is well acquainted. Was he not until a few days ago the chairman of Tourism Alliance, which represents most, if not all, of our tourist businesses? Was he not also a director of VisitBritain? Therefore, how can he justify his Government&#146;s apparent continued resistance to changing the time-scale for the winter months, which is seriously damaging all businesses connected with the tourist industry and about which we have received many representations during the past two years? Will he not take advantage of his new position and influence and use his specialised knowledge to change the situation regarding GMT, or has he been given new statistics, unbeknown to us, which can justify the status quo? If so, perhaps he will be good enough to let us have them.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07071266000215"></a>I have referred to the position paper from Cambridge University on electricity generation. Can the Minister show what economies in electricity consumption are brought about by returning to GMT for the winter months? Does he dispute the facts recently given by the National Grid Company, which stated that shifting from GMT+1 in summer to GMT in winter has caused an average increase in electricity consumption of 1.2 per cent during the past six years? This is the equivalent of putting an additional 47,000 cars on the road in terms of carbon emissions. Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the increased peaking of electricity usage during the week after the autumn clock change to GMT on the last Sunday of October increased the cost of electricity generation by an average of &#163;18 million during 2004-06?</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07071266000216"></a>I can find no mention of daylight saving in the Stern review, which is 576 pages long, or in the <I>Economics of Climate Change</I>, volumes 1 and 2, which is 393 pages long, or in the draft Climate Change Bill, which is a mere 63 pages long, or in the White Paper before us today, <I>Meeting the Energy Challenge</I>, which is 342 pages long. That is a total of 1,374 pages of printed matter, weighing just over six kilograms on my scales, and there is not a squeak on the subject.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07071266000217"></a>That is strange. If the Government and the opposition parties do not support daylight saving, they must surely have a good reason for maintaining GMT during the winter months. If so, what is it? By their omitting to mention it in the glut of government papers referred to, one is given an uncomfortable impression that something fishy may be going on, such as a political stitch-up between the parties. I hope that I am wrong.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07071266000218"></a>I will therefore, if I am permitted to do so, bring before the House another Lighter Evenings (Experiment) Bill, but with one big difference from the original. Instead of switching to GMT+2 during summer months, under the new Bill the country would remain on GMT+1&#151;summer time&#151;throughout the year. My reason for this is that new evidence has been put before me which has convinced me that the existing switchover from summer time to GMT, quite apart from wasting electricity, puts an unnecessarily large strain on the country's present generating capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07071266000219"></a>The extra load is currently taken up by the ageing peak stand-by generators, and, as the old nuclear power stations are shut down, as noble Lords have mentioned, this problem will be further aggravated in

Daylight saving by maintaining GMT+1 throughout the year would greatly reduce this problem and deliver lighter afternoons and evenings throughout the winter month, which should satisfy the interests most critical of the status quo.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07071266000220"></a>The only advantage it would not deliver is to harmonise the United Kingdom's time-scale with Central European Time. However, I wonder if this change of heart might persuade the doubters on the Conservative Benches to look again with more enthusiasm at a new Bill on the subject.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07071266000221"></a>The question I must put to the Minister in the sphere of this debate is: where are his department's statistics to justify the maintenance of GMT during the winter months? None has been forthcoming from his predecessors, or the Opposition Benches to date, in spite of the passage of the Lighter Evenings (Experiment) Bill through this House, which was without their help; while the Energy Saving (Daylight) Bill, introduced by Tim Yeo MP, chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee in the other place was disgracefully filibustered out of time by the Government with the connivance of the opposition parties.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07071266000222"></a>The Minister must surely be aware that the United States, Australia and Canada have recently introduced daylight saving procedures, in spite of the different time zones within their countries, in order to save energy and carbon emission Therefore, can he give any reason why there is a delay in this country in following suit?</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07071266000223"></a>The US Department of Transportation claims that energy use across the country has been cut by 1 per cent each day of daylight saving time. Has the Minister's department produced any figures, which could either prove or disprove benefits occurring here if British Summer Time, GMT+1, was maintained throughout the year, thus requiring no clock change on the last Sunday of October?</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07071266000224"></a>Hardly a week goes by when members of my All-Party Group do not receive representations on lighter evenings from varying interests, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the tourism industries, school teachers and sporting and leisure organisations to ask what is happening about daylight saving.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07071266000225"></a>Therefore, I looked with hope, but without success, at the forthcoming Bills in the Queen's Speech, released by the Prime Minister yesterday, to see if the Government have changed their mind on the subject. I have also looked through again before this debate at the plethora of papers which surround the subject of climate change to see if I had overlooked mention of this important subject. Again I had no luck in finding anything.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07071266000226"></a>Will the Minister, with his long experience with the CBI, comment on the desirability of the United Kingdom harmonising its time-scale with Europe, a provision which could be added at some other time?

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07071266000228"></a>The argument I put on daylight saving is entirely based on energy efficiency and a reduction of pollution. The question of atmospheric carbon is another question altogether, which I will come to when I have a few moments.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07071266000229"></a>I want to take noble Lords back 30 years. I tabled an Unstarred Question on atmospheric changes and weather patterns as long ago as 30 November 1978. It is a perfectly respectable speech which is relevant today. Absolutely nothing has happened for the past 30 years in gripping this problem. I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07071266000736"></a>&#147;In conclusion, my Question raises the far wider issues of communication between the scientific community, Government agencies and the general public. Scientists work within an entirely different framework from that of us in Parliament. Their statements have to be more restrained and are based on proven scientific fact, and often because of that their conclusions are not necessarily unanimous. That is particularly the case with questions of weather and climate&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/11/78; col. 1447.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000700"></a>I said that 30 years ago. It is absolutely relevant today. </p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07071266000230"></a>The jury is still out about atmospheric carbon. I am sure that the Minister has stacks of papers on the subject. Will he say that carbon and methane emissions occur after the increase in global temperature? The ice cores clearly show that they do. Therefore, if they come after, how on Earth can we reduce global warming by reducing atmospheric carbon or methane? I am not a scientist; I am reliant on the distinguished scientist Dr Michael Cole for making some of these things simple for me. This situation must be addressed by the scientists. They have not made it clear and are still arguing about it.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07071266000231"></a>There is a further question on methane. There has been a lot of talk of biodiesel. In each of the past 20 years, I have spent two months in the Far East. I have driven from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on the highway. When I first went there it was wall-to-wall rainforest. I drove along it last year and it was wall-to-wall palm oil. Perfectly good forest areas have been cut down. Forest peoples have been displaced, as in Sarawak and Borneo. Indeed, rice plains are being replaced with palm oil plantations. It is very simple to grow, requires little maintenance and offers high profitability. Indeed, Europe gives grants for it.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07071266000232"></a>I met a man who told me that if he was given six men with six cans of diesel, he could clear 1,000 hectares of rainforest in 30 days. He was paid to do this by the plantation company. The more Europe buys biodiesel from the Far East, the more forests will be destroyed and the more people will be displaced from their houses, and now the greater encroachment will be that people will be tempted to sell their land which at the moment produces rice. This is absolutely crazy and totally unnecessary. I also question the doubt expressed by one speaker that oil reserves will last only five years. I have no doubt that that is completely wrong and that they will last a good 40 years.</p>

That is the problem with a democratic government of which we are all part, one way or the other. No one can make long-term decisions without them being changed. The situation has been set out by a whole number of Peers so far. It has to stop. We all have to get together and come to a considered conclusion with the help of the scientists to do something sensible about meeting the energy challenge.</p>

It is not an area in which I have any great expertise or, indeed, experience. Before starting, I would like to declare an interest which I do not think is as yet recorded. I am the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, which is the trade association for the civil nuclear industry. It is only reasonable that I make that point at this stage.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07071266000235"></a>First, I pay tribute to my new noble friend&#146;s maiden speech. I say &#147;new noble friend&#148; because he is an old personal friend with whom I have had many disagreements. Much has been made of his capacity to disagree with people. I would say to him that on this side of the House, at least, one of the preconditions of membership of the Labour ranks is the ability to get on with people and to agree to disagree on most issues of a political character. It will not be a novel experience for him. I wish him well and his speech this morning was a thoughtful tour d&#146;horizon of the energy area. He obviously took the advice that Lyndon Johnson gave when once asked what you need to do to get elected. Johnson&#146;s reply was just as applicable to energy policy as it was to getting elected&#151;you have got to do everything.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07071266000236"></a>The compendium which is the White Paper has pretty well everything in it. Others might disagree&#151;only time will tell. Yet I do not have a great deal of sympathy with the view that by putting and considering all of the options, the Government are not allowing themselves to have a proper sense of priority. At the same time as having a sense of priority, there has also been a degree of caution, particularly on the nuclear situation post the judicial review. Some might say that the Prime Minister evinces less of this, but Ministers are walking on eggs on this issue. Yet many of the remarks that I made in my maiden speech some two years ago on nuclear power are even more valid today. This is not simply because the case remains equally strong, but because over the past two years we have become increasingly aware of the volatility of the international energy market and the fact that prices are far less dependable. In the past, we could anticipate periods of rise, of comparative fall and of stability. Nobody today is putting their faith in the hydro-carbon markets being particularly stable in the months and years that lie ahead, not least because in the past two years we have become properly aware of the impact of the Indian and Chinese economies on the international energy scene. It could be argued that not just oil and gas but coal, too, is increasingly subject to the massive demands being made by these countries.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07071266000237"></a>As a consequence, we have to look at the energy mix, the balance we are going to have to work towards. It is inevitable that in the foreseeable future we will have a sizeable dependency on gas. We still have the advantage of an indigenous supply&#151;on a limited level, but still there. We now have LNG capabilities which will enable us to have storage and transportation facilities within the UK. The point has to be made that we would not wish to be over-dependent on this form of generation. If the lessons of the 1990s were to be anything, they are that we probably were over-dependent. When other countries were investing in renewable technology, we felt there was no need for Britain to do so. You could argue that in some respects the old Nye Bevan quote, of Britain being an island surrounded by fish and built on coal, and the idea of self-sufficiency, has been one of our problems. In the past, it has blinded us to the need to have a wider canvas on which to draw our plans.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07071266000238"></a>We have no coal industry to speak of in the UK now. It is increasingly difficult to get open casting, there are only a small number of collieries and there are virtually just a handful of colliers. There is certainly no longer the cultural tradition of fathers and sons going down the mine as there was in my old constituency until two or three years ago. So the idea that we can be over-dependent on imported coal is a dangerous one. We have to recognise that coal has to have a place because of its flexibility.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07071266000239"></a>We also have to guard against the over-optimism often endowed in carbon capture and storage. This is a nascent technology, and the Government are to be commended for their competition. I am not wholly sympathetic to the view that somehow we could have left it all to BP; that had they had a big wodge of money from the Government, they would have solved all the problems. I am not antagonistic to British Petroleum&#151;it is an outstanding world company led by the most capable people&#151;but to have given that opportunity to one company and one technology alone would have been regrettable. At the same time, we have to persevere with carbon capture and storage, because we are going to require it for some of our gas stations.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07071266000240"></a>It is equally dangerous to place too much faith in the coal industry. Many of us have received a paper from Drax, which quite correctly claimed credit for important work in flue gas desulphurisation. But FGD technology does nothing for CO2 emissions. I am only guessing, but I imagine that the likely lifetime of the Drax power stations will be insufficient to justify the kind of investment that carbon capture and storage would require. There would not be the CAPX payback within a reasonable time. We are talking about virtually brand new stations which will accommodate various kinds of coal and probably take a bio-element as well. They will have super-critical boilers, flue gas desulphurisation and carbon capture and storage when the technology is sufficiently mature. Yet this will be some time and at some considerable expense. It is wrong to place undue emphasis on that kind of option because it is almost beyond the horizon. It is not quite blue skies thinking. Coal in the short term has a place; it is flexible and can generate and fill holes quickly. We may need payments to keep these stations turning over  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1531"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1531</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when they are not required. We have gone through that kind of system in the past and it has not worked, but we need a flexible enough market arrangement to enable coal to be accommodated.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07071266000241"></a>For baseload generation, only one other option deserves consideration: nuclear. The concept of a replacement build of 20 per cent of our generating capacity has to be addressed. As you would imagine from my declaration of interest, I have no great anxiety about a number of the fears that some people express. Yet it is a sensitive issue. The previous consultation process which the Government entered into was insufficiently rigorous and did not involve the degree of public participation that it merited. A second chance should be given to it, and the terms of the judicial review should be given clear and careful adherence.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07071266000242"></a>If we can get through this consultation process, and the arguments for and acceptance of the case for nuclear is sufficiently strong, the market should be allowed to deal with it; that is, if the market believes that in the United Kingdom we can get a reasonable choice at an early stage between the varying technologies available. I understand that some four are under consideration. Three of them might be regarded as more likely, and one of the three might even drop out&#151;we might end up with only two. Whatever happens, we have embarked on a programme of pre-licensing which will require the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to have far more staff to undertake the taxing work that will be required.</p>

<a name="70712-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07071266000701"></a>It will equally require staff for the clean-up and decommissioning work, so we are talking about a sizeable programme of recruitment. As I understand it, the money is in the Treasury, but there is a dispute with the DTI&#151;sorry, DEBRR, as we now have to call it. There is something of a stand-off. There is a recognition that those people are needed and an amount of money available to pay them, but there is a disagreement between the Treasury and the department concerning how the money should be spent so that it can be kept within the public sector pay guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07071266000243"></a>Frankly, the money is there, so we do not need creative accounting. We just need some inventive personnel or human resource management techniques to be applied. In another capacity, I am the director of a football club. I know that in the football industry, no shortage of imagination is exercised when it comes to paying people. Usually, it involves paying them too much, but in this instance, there are very strong grounds for encouraging highly skilled, highly qualified people to come into the government service in the NII. Regardless of whether we build another power station, those people are required. They are required for waste clean-up and for decommissioning. People forget the skills needed in that industry. It may not be very sexy or attractive to come to clear up the legacy of an industry that has been notoriously pollutant&#151;although I think that the new technologies will be far less so and the problem will be far easier to manage&#151;but we must make it attractive. One obvious way to do that is by making employment attractive through the rates of pay and conditions offered to very important people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07071266000244"></a>There is always the danger in these debates that because they are not time-limited, you self-indulge, and I have probably done that already. We have moved, or we are moving, certainly on these Benches, towards a balanced energy policy in which various elements will play their part. The renewables lobby will make strong claims&#151;rightly so, because there are cases for localised generation&#151;but let us not forget that if the renewables industry is to succeed, it will require subsidy. Call it ROCs, renewables obligation certificates, if you like, but it is state subsidy in the first instance, subsidy that is subsequently paid for by consumers. Therefore, we must be rigorous in our examination of the scheme. Someone has to do that. It may well be that we can appoint independent agencies, which means that civil servants do not do the work, but someone has to come to a judgment in the first instance, and then see whether the market will take over. The argument for subsidy is based on the premise that the market is not functioning properly at this stage. We must be careful about spending too much money for too long on some failed renewable technologies.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07071266000245"></a>Lastly, I have laid great stress on the baseload capability of nuclear power. One of the strengths of nuclear power is that it has a very low import dependence. About 10 or 12 per cent of the costs of nuclear generation arise from uranium. It is not open to the vagaries of the international market in the way that other generating technologies are. If we can build up a substantial, but not massive, element of new nuclear generating capability, that baseload should be able to enable us to have a degree of price stability in our market that will go a long way to help the Government&#146;s credible work, already referred to, in assisting the fuel poor.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07071266000246"></a>It is sometimes not fashionable to link forms of generation with social objectives. I am not saying that nuclear power is too cheap to meter; that argument was very dangerous as well as being fundamentally wrong, but I think that the Government are beginning to get the emphasis correct. The White Paper is a very encouraging document. I am greatly pleased that my new noble friend has been able to introduce it in such an effective way today. This debate will go on and on. We seem to have had almost as many White Papers and discussion papers as we have had Secretaries of State in recent years, but it is an important debate. I commend the Government on taking another step forward and hope that the consultative process will enable us to move to the next phase for nuclear power as soon as possible, as soon as it is reasonable and as soon as people feel that they have at least had a chance to speak and to make their case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07071266000458"></a>The paper is a very good review of the situation that we face on the energy front. If I have a conclusion, it is that the Government&#146;s strategy is not to have a strategy; it is to work by a series of ad hoc decisions in the light of an evolving situation. I am bound to say that that has a great deal of merit, but a White Paper it is not.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07071266000459"></a>One of the things that I regret in the changes that the Government have brought about in the past couple of weeks&#151;for which the Minister has no responsibility, of course&#151;is that they have failed to resolve the dilemma that we all face in dealing with energy matters and global warming. They are still the responsibility of two separate government departments. Energy is with DBERR&#151;the trouble is that if I use the acronym, I am inclined to use the word &#147;defer&#148;, which is perhaps rather less than fortunate&#151;and Defra. Can the Minister indicate whether the Government intend to resolve that dichotomy, where one department is, as you might say, responsible for making a mess and another department is responsible for clearing it up? The technical question is: what mechanism do the Government have in place to deal with matters should there be a disagreement between the two departments?</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07071266000460"></a>I intend to speak largely about global warming; in one or two aspects, I may cover points that have already been made. One thing that especially worries me from the perspective of global warming is the immense reliance that is being placed on energy efficiency and economy as a means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In July 2005, the Science and Technology Committee published a paper on energy efficiency which contained a very interesting graph revealing the performance of the economy over the previous 30 years. The graph shows gross domestic product rising, which is very welcome. It also shows energy units per unit of GDP falling. The business of energy efficiency is not something thought up recently as a consequence of global warming; increased energy efficiency has been happening for a very long time. However, the really interesting line in the graph showed energy consumption rising slowly over that whole period.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07071266000461"></a>The one thing that we cannot afford to do is to stop the development of the economy. We must keep the economy growing for everybody&#146;s sake. In that, we need to ensure that the action we take in the developed world does not prejudice the opportunities for development in the third world. Food miles&#151;distasteful to some&#151;and tourism, which increase aviation, of course represent for us an increase in our carbon footprint, but they are economic drivers in the third world. We must be careful not to take action which might inhibit or stop their possibilities for development.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07071266000462"></a>The Minister mentioned the problem of the growth of energy consumption in the future. I have a graph from the Institute of Economic Affairs, and if I translate the acronym correctly, the present energy demand globally is roughly 12 billion tonnes per annum of oil equivalent. That is predicted to rise to 17 billion tonnes per annum by 2030. This paper is published in  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1534"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the light of all the global warming information. That energy demand will have to be met. While energy economy is going to be important, we should not be relying on it to make a major contribution, partly because of the international aspects and partly because of the sheer reality of a growing economy where things are always changing. Energy demand is likely to increase in this country in any event to some degree.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07071266000463"></a>I was fortunate to get into discussions with people from General Motors a month ago on this subject. Transport is another prominent source of carbon dioxide. Their expectation for the future is that at best the improvements in vehicle efficiency will roughly match the increase in vehicle volume, so there is no easy economy to be achieved there. We need to take these factors seriously into account because the Government&#146;s policy of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent from the 1990 figure by 2050 is going to be difficult to achieve. My own party has gone for 80 per cent. However, it is a valid objective because in the end we should be aiming for a society that does not emit carbon dioxide at all.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07071266000464"></a>There are a number of other difficulties. It is quite clear that the Government&#146;s policy is to rely very much, particularly for big business and heavy industry, on cap-and-trade systems for reducing carbon emissions. There are a number of problems related to this but the main one has been the abysmal failure of both the European Commission and Europe&#146;s national Governments to arrive at a sufficiently robust system of caps. Emissions trading is easy if there are too many certificates. The result is that a tonne of carbon, even in phase 2 of the system, is presently estimated to cost only &#163;17 to &#163;18. There is a difficulty there because for most people the cost of getting rid of a tonne of carbon dioxide emissions is much higher than that.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07071266000465"></a>Another problem that the Government have failed to address is the fact that the renewables obligations certificates referred to by the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, are charged on the nuclear industry, which does not emit carbon dioxide. As long as we have that situation, we will effectively have not a tax on carbon dioxide emissions but a tax on energy. That is not what we should have, so we clearly need some change there.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07071266000466"></a>We are going to have a policy that we hope will speed up the construction of major infrastructure, but as yet we have no policy on what is to be built. I accept that the Government should not try to pick a winning technology&#151;Governments have an abysmal record in that&#151;but they should make one policy in principle: from now on, if at all possible, they should construct nothing that emits carbon dioxide as a result of fossil fuel consumption. However, I understand that that is not technically possible. The run-down in generating capacity is likely to occur more rapidly than we are able to build new plant, and certainly before we might be able to bring forward new green energy sources.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07071266000467"></a>That has two consequences. The first is that if we are to put in generating capacity which we hope will be only short-term to emit the fewest possible tonnes of carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced, that, as has already been pointed out, would mean gas. The  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1535"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other problem which we have anyway with the electricity-generating industry is that it is being given responsibility for driving the efficient use of energy by its customers with no obligation to become an efficient energy user itself. Because of the price of a tonne of carbon, it does not look as though the market at the moment is likely to be effective. In answer to a Question of mine in 2005, the Government in effect said that for every kilowatt hour of electricity supplied to the customer in this country, more than a kilowatt hour of energy is released to the atmosphere in the form of waste heat. Heat is a saleable commodity and that waste is not acceptable now or in the future. There has to be a use for it. There may be planning implications but something seriously needs to be done. There are three uses for it, three Hs, and they are heat, hydrogen and horticulture&#151;heat for district heating which would predicate smaller power stations built on the urban periphery; hydrogen because we are going to need it in the long term to resolve transport problems related to going green; and horticulture because, if all else fails, you can surround a power station with acres of glass and produce tropical crops on waste heat.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07071266000468"></a>Another important point touched on by the Minister is the question of biofuels. They can make a significant contribution. I am a farmer and I welcome what is happening. The price of wheat, which I grow, has virtually doubled in the last nine months. The price of a tortilla in Mexico has also doubled causing political problems there. This is largely the result not particularly of bad weather and short commodity production, but of the conversion of grains into bioethanol, and that will continue.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07071266000469"></a>There is another problem. We are now burning off natural carbon sinks in addition to the geological carbon sinks that we use as fossil fuel. That has also been touched on this afternoon, and it is not particularly acceptable. The final problem with this is that there is not enough land to enable us to fuel our transport industry from crops. It simply will not be possible to do that; we would need another planet. It is one of the few things on which I agree with WWF. There is plenty of energy. It will&#151;indeed, it must&#151;come from other sources. We will need the land that we have to feed our population.</p>

It faces up to the uncertainties about which he spoke: the uncertainties due to the need to tackle climate change; the uncertainty about energy security, about which my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill spoke; and the uncertain sources of our future fuel and the growing international competition to acquire it. As the Minister said, the pursuit of new sources of oil and gas is now central to the foreign policies of all the world&#146;s major powers. In the face of these uncertainties, the Government are absolutely right to reduce our dependence on imported energy and to encourage the use of a diverse energy mix. It is ridiculous to characterise new nuclear power stations

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07071266000471"></a>The Government must encourage the efficient use of all sources of energy to encourage the saving of energy, to reduce our carbon footprint, and to encourage renewables and, of course, nuclear power. The only sensible course is to encourage this diversity and variety while becoming more economical. The White Paper provides a good framework for addressing the technical challenges and risks in energy. However, I am not sure whether it provides a political framework&#151;a political context&#151;in which all this will be done because, without this, not much will happen. The context is important because, in reality, we cannot go it alone. The Minister himself made this point. The framework within which the action will take place must be the single market. How could it be otherwise? Most agree that we have benefited enormously from our membership of the single market, and our commitment and involvement are so deep that surely much of our energy policy must be framed within its context. The White Paper agrees. On page 20, it says:</p>

<ul><a name="07071266000759"></a>&#147;the European Council agreed in March 2007 to a common European strategy for energy security and tackling climate change. This includes further steps to complete the internal market in gas and electricity&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000711"></a>and supports &#147;strong action&#148; by the Commission to enforce this internal market. It also says quite a lot about meeting targets in Europe.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07071266000472"></a>The carbon trading scheme in which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, puts so much faith is based on the single market. However, efforts to liberalise the European electricity and gas markets have continued to be made for 10 years. The best way in which to ensure competition is to break up the large companies in France, Germany and Italy that dominate their markets. We are told that this can be done by unbundling, but some member states have strongly opposed these proposals for years. Certainly, people in Europe are free to choose their energy suppliers. In Britain, the percentage of households switching suppliers has been nearly 50 per cent. Elsewhere in the single market, however, the percentage of households switching their energy supplier is only in single figures or in the low teens, because the regulatory barriers in many member states as well as the problems of unbundling hinder the ability to switch suppliers. In some member states, price tariffs are regulated usually below market price, which makes it almost impossible for new suppliers to enter the market. This has gone on for years.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07071266000473"></a>There is a trend towards liberalisation, and there will be movement towards it. The movement will be slow, however, because the single market has become an accepted fact of business life. It may be grumbled about but it is rarely questioned, and its benefits and barriers are taken for granted. Now that its original ideals have become part of our way of life, economic development through the single market is becoming

This is what happens when ideals become an accepted part of everyday life. If we are to achieve our energy security and energy sustainability in the context of the single market, we must decide between several alternatives. Should we give more power to the Commission? If the Commission already has enough power, can we find more and better ways in which it can use it? Is there a halfway house? Is functional separation the answer? This, after all, is how we liberalised the impact of BT in the telecoms market. Or is the answer to change the focus of the single market&#151;a new vision that will inspire faster and more urgent growth? </p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07071266000474"></a>I believe that the way forward is through a new vision of what the single market is all about. We now take for granted the free movement of goods and services, people and capital. We accept that there are problems but, when reminded of that, we assume that things are moving in the right direction. With a new vision, progress, instead of tentative and piecemeal, will speed up and become more urgent. I am not alone in thinking this. In February, the Commission issued a communication called <I>A Single Market for Citizens</I>. Its vision is that the single market should be that of the consumer citizen. In January, the Treasury and the then DTI gave us their vision, which looks to business and industry to become more competitive, skilled and innovative in the face of globalisation, and that this more dynamic and competitive single market will promote jobs, growth and prosperity for the citizen. There seems to be a growing view that the vision for the single market should be inspired more by the citizen than by the market. And why not? Europe has an extraordinarily well educated population, and user-driven innovation is being recognised as good for politics and good for economics. It could certainly play a useful role in energy networks. Indeed, our own NESTA is funding research into this.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07071266000475"></a>The White Paper strongly makes the point that we will achieve greater security of supply and sustainability if we operate within the framework of the single market than if we go it alone. I agree. Yet energy is now probably the most important and divisive issue facing the European Union. Perhaps a new way of looking at the single market will help to resolve this paradox. Does the Minister agree? Is he happy to continue as we are in the hope that eventually we will liberalise the single market and so achieve our objectives in this excellent White Paper, or does he think that we should speed the whole thing up by featuring the interests and concerns of the European citizen consumer? The success of the White Paper within a reasonable time depends on this.</p>

The Government deserve to be congratulated on that, and I join other noble Lords in congratulating the Minister on his maiden speech from the Dispatch Box. However, there are a number of technologies to which the  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1538"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government have not given proper consideration; I shall come on to these a little later. I believe that we owe Al Gore a debt of gratitude for his efforts to alert the world to the absolute necessity to reduce our carbon emissions. His film, &#147;An Inconvenient Truth&#148;, left me in no doubt that we need to act now. The fact that the public are increasingly coming to this view is encouraging.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07071266000477"></a>To those who say, &#147;It&#146;s all very well reducing our carbon footprint, but what about China or India?&#148;, I say that we should lead by example. I know that this brings with it issues of competitiveness, but the importance of this issue is such that it transcends even those arguments. As the Minister said, energy saving is where our efforts should begin. That is why I am a little surprised that low-energy light bulbs still seem to cost 400 per cent more than conventional ones. I wonder whether the Government might investigate that. If the manufacturing process dictates such a high price, perhaps they could consider subsidising responsible companies and individuals who wish to make the changeover.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07071266000478"></a>The fact that 8 per cent of all our electricity consumption is used up by machines on standby is appalling. More emphasis needs to be given by manufacturers to cutting that out altogether, and any assistance that the Government can give in that regard will be welcome. The national grid is a wasteful way of distributing electricity, as the White Paper&#146;s executive summary acknowledges. Almost 65 per cent of energy is lost through inefficient generation, transmission and distribution. The provision of electricity generating plants, be they CHP, biomass, solar and so on, should be sited near conurbations, as the White Paper again acknowledges. That would greatly reduce wastage.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07071266000479"></a>I turn to three methods of electricity generation that have zero carbon emissions. The first is CSP, which stands for concentrating solar power. This is a mature and proven technology, which has been operating in California since 1985. A new plant went on stream in Spain two months ago and another one is planned for Sicily. CSP is the technique of concentrating sunlight using mirrors to create heat and using that heat to create steam, which then drives turbines and generators, just as a conventional power station does. Solar heat can also be stored in melted salts, enabling electricity to continue to be generated during the hours of darkness.</p>

<a name="70712-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07071266000480"></a>I hear siren voices asking of what relevance that is to us, particularly given the summer that we are having, but it has great relevance because of the recent development of highly efficient transmission lines, called HVDC, which have transmission losses of only 3 per cent per 1,000 kilometres. That would mean that we could receive electricity from the Sahara Desert with only 10 per cent loss of power. The amazing thing is that, if a CSP farm measuring 80 square miles was established in the desert, it could produce enough electricity to satisfy the entire needs of the whole of Europe. The Germans were sufficiently interested to commission a report, the TRANS-CSP study, which estimated that electricity imported from north Africa and the Middle East could become one of the cheapest sources of electricity for European countries, allowing

My question to the Minister is whether the Government have given proper consideration to this technology and whether there has been any exchange of views with the German Government.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70712-0007.htm"/>


<a name="70712-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07071266000481"></a>Secondly, I turn to tidal power. I understand that the Sustainable Development Commission is carrying out a study into the various ways of harnessing tidal power and that it will report in September this year. The report is eagerly awaited by those with an interest in this technology. I hope that proper and unbiased consideration will be given to tidal lagoons. These lagoons are offshore and actually encourage marine habitats; they do not cause silting problems, unlike the Severn barrage, which I do not advocate. Since becoming interested in tidal power, I have noticed that the Government are encouraging and indeed subsidising tidal stream technology and are inclined to support the Severn barrage, which will require public funding. However, there remains a distinct lack of support for lagoons.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07071266000482"></a>My second question to the Minister is why this is so. Tidal Electric, the company seeking to construct such a lagoon in Swansea Bay, is not seeking any public funding and the research shows that it would be three times cheaper to produce electricity from lagoons as opposed to tidal streams. This fact was confirmed in Ofgem&#146;s report in 2005. Interested investors have been impressed by the detailed analysis and costings carried out on behalf of the company by WS Atkins and AEA Technology plc, but when they approach the DTI they receive a negative response, which seems to be based on an incorrect assumption that construction costs will be as high as those for building the Severn barrage. The potential investors are well known businessmen who understand the risks involved, but the killer punch for them is finding that the DTI does not support the project.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07071266000483"></a>Surely every means of harnessing the power of our tides&#151;we have the second highest tidal range in the world&#151;should be given the chance to prove its capability. I find this negative attitude incomprehensible. I understand that the Minister has hardly had time to get his feet under his desk at DBERR and so an answer today is a big request, but I hope that he will be able to look at the matter and write to me in due course.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07071266000484"></a>Thirdly, and lastly, I would like to touch on matters nuclear. As I said when we debated the energy review report last year, I am against nuclear fission but strongly support nuclear fusion. As noble Lords will know, this type of nuclear power generation offers the potential to provide a major new source of energy using basic non-toxic fuels that are widely available, with no greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07071266000485"></a>The international fusion research programme, which we support, aims to build and demonstrate full-scale power generation in a prototype power plant within 30 to 35 years. If such a prototype is successful, we will have discovered the Holy Grail for our future energy needs. With this in mind, and given the other carbon-neutral schemes that I have mentioned, is it not a great mistake to embark on building more nuclear power stations remotely sited and therefore grid inefficient,  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1540"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which will be hugely costly to build and will leave a lethal legacy of toxic waste with a life of up to 500,000 years?</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07071266000486"></a>We still have 2 million cubic metres of nuclear waste to deal with from our existing nuclear power stations. Although dealing with it in geological shafts may be a solution, I do not believe that we have yet arrived at a conclusion. Would it not be far better to try to speed up the nuclear fission research? Meeting the energy challenge provides us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to think outside the box, which I have tried to do today. I hope that when future generations look back on our efforts and our decisions we will not be found wanting.</p>

I also welcome the opening speech by the Minister, with whom I have a connection: I declare my interest as a professor at University College, a college that he has been very active in supporting. I began my career in energy physics and technology with the old Central Electricity Generating Board in the 1960s as it installed many of the nuclear and fossil-fuel power stations that are still operating, as the Minister reminded us. I am also on the advisory board of EDF Energy.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07071266000488"></a>I have had various discussions about nuclear energy issues with officials and colleagues in several countries, with very different perspectives. I very much hope that as the Minister travels around the world selling UK products and ideas he will also bring back many of the ideas from other countries, which I feel are rather lacking in both the documents that we have seen today.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07071266000489"></a>It seems to me that our role in this House is to consider, as well as short-term issues, very long-term issues affecting the UK. My first debate in this House was on whether the UK would last at all as the North Sea rose and parts of East Anglia were flooded and disappeared. Today, we have to consider our very long-term energy requirements. For example, in one document, reference is made to the possibility of uranium running out after 85 years. My colleagues in the United States have been talking about energy policy for the next 1,000 years and are considering all the options. I believe that we need this wider and longer-term perspective. I pay tribute to the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, for thinking over the long term.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07071266000490"></a>The policies that the White Paper advocates on energy conservation, renewable energy and increased efficiency of existing plant are all commendable. We should consider not only energy conservation, but also not increasing our energy use. The Japanese Parliament and its ministries are now allowing the temperature to rise to 27 degrees Celsius in their buildings. They are taking off their ties and are wearing a new style of clothes. If we were having a really hot summer and were sitting in here in our ties with the air conditioning running, that would not be a very good role model. The GLA is extremely concerned about the increasing use of air conditioning in London. In fact, far from saving energy, many buildings in Britain now use more energy than before.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07071266000491"></a>The total energy reduction required&#151;as the Stern report and, earlier, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution concluded&#151;is of the order of 60 per cent. In some estimates it is more. This will require a wide range of options, as was emphasised by the Socolow report of Princeton. All over the world, scientists and engineers are increasing and improving new technologies; for example, conventional fossil-fuel power stations, to which we referred, are now running sometimes at 52 per cent, which is a great improvement. Even in China some of the most advanced power stations are being used, as well as, regrettably, large numbers of very inefficient power stations. As the report emphasises, improving fossil-fuel technology is vital.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07071266000492"></a>The Minister remarked on the important role of individuals and local communities. Local communities have been very pioneering in exploring ways of introducing energy saving, using new technologies and galvanising people. I hope that the Minister will talk to his colleagues in Defra, as they steer the Climate Change Bill through this House, to remind them that local authorities have a big role. Currently, local authorities are not mentioned in that Bill. I have heard from little spies in Defra that that was a bit of a mistake, so I hope that he will rectify that.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07071266000493"></a>On long-term energy, it is widely believed that the world will run out of oil and gas in perhaps 30 years. We may run out of coal in 300 years. As I mentioned, US Department of Energy colleagues are thinking on those timescales and longer. India, China and Russia are also thinking on these very long times. They are thinking not only of conventional nuclear, but of more advanced systems using, for example, fusion and fission, reprocessing uranium and using the vast reserves of thorium, which could also be used in more advanced nuclear technologies.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07071266000494"></a>I disagree slightly with my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan, who implied that nuclear issues, including safety, may be rather dull and that we need to employ people. I think, far from that, that this is one of the most exciting areas of physics. Advanced physics, on which we have had debates in this House previously, may be able to clean up nuclear waste and to reprocess and transmute the elements. We may end up not having to store material in the ground for 10,000 or 500,000 years; it may be dealt with in 100 years. Study groups in which I have participated at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have illustrated that. I regret that these have not been explained to politicians in this country. There is a high level of ignorance about the possible technologies that could be available.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07071266000495"></a>As other speakers have commented, nuclear power could well be an important part of the energy security of this country, but it is essential that UK politicians, the public and the scientific community are encouraged to understand and to look into these wider possible technologies and sciences. The White Paper and the nuclear paper are not as broad as they should be, so I very much hope that, as we move forward during this year, more documentation and decisions and a wider international context will be given to us. For example,  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1542"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1542</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the American Institute of Physics has much longer and wider-ranging debates than anything we have had in this country.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07071266000496"></a>The Minister mentioned that nuclear power accounts for 18 per cent of our electricity, although the figure is 80 per cent in France. I hope that he and other Ministers will meet groups around the UK to consult on and explain about nuclear power. I addressed a packed meeting on climate change near Hartlepool, where we have a nuclear power station, and many officials and local leaders were in the audience. It was interesting that, in this area familiar with the practical benefits of nuclear power, there was unanimous support for nuclear. The same has been found in France. Wherever there are nuclear power stations, there is great support from the communities in those areas. Provided that the Minister moves out of NW1 or NW3, I am sure that he will find a sensible view.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07071266000497"></a>The Minister may also need to go beyond that and proselytise in the sensible party opposite, the Conservative Party, because the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru seem to be completely fixed in their antagonistic view towards nuclear power. By combining forces, we may get some sensible decisions, which are vital for this country.</p>

My noble friend Lady Wilcox said rather firmly that the Government need to become much clearer on how they are going to achieve their objectives. We all welcome to the House the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham. I should like to add to the congratulations that have already been offered on what was, by any standards, an excellent maiden speech. I would add only one thing. The most encouraging statement that the noble Lord made during the course of his tour d&#146;horizon was that decisions must be made this year. He nods vigorously. That is absolutely crucial and what we need.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07071266000502"></a>A few weeks ago at the Foundation for Science and Technology&#151;I declare an interest as its president&#151;we held a discussion on the energy White Paper. It was attended by a wide range of people from government public bodies, universities and industry. The Minister will be interested to know that we had a presentation from his senior civil servant, Mr. Willy Rickett, the director-general of the Energy Group&#151;in what was then the DTI and is now, I think, the DBERR, which sounds like a sort of French aristocrat. There were also other energy experts.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07071266000503"></a>I will mention one or two of the points that arose during that discussion. Referring to the White Paper, one speaker asked whether the policy is market-oriented or government-oriented. He quoted the <I>Financial Times</I> aphorism, &#147;Is it Gosplan or Greenplan?&#148; The answer is that it is a bit of both. The Government stress that investment decisions&#151;as has been said, over the next two decades billions of pounds will need to be invested in this country to keep the lights on&#151;must be made by the market, by energy companies and by the financial markets from which the investment funds will flow. However, the Government can and do use a variety of fiscal and other instruments to steer markets in the directions which they want. An obvious example, mentioned several times today, is the renewable obligations certificates to subsidise renewable energy.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07071266000504"></a>Ministers often boast about the ROCs and the modest expansion in renewable energy that they imply. There is always the implication that this is financed by a government subsidy. It is not. The subsidy comes directly on to consumers&#146; bills. Ofgem has estimated that cost as &#163;15 per year on every electricity bill.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07071266000505"></a>The other aspect of what I might call the Gosplan features is this huge list of other organisations, bodies, principles and policies which represent the Government&#146;s view. If I may, I am just going to take a moment or two to recite what they are. We have had mention of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and I will come back to that in a moment. We also have the carbon reduction commitment, the energy performance certificate, the carbon emissions reduction target, the carbon capture and storage initiative, the distributed generation package, the biomass strategy, the energy efficiency commitment, the renewable transport fuel obligation&#151;my Lords, I am half way through the list&#151;the low-carbon transport innovation strategy, the environmental transformation fund, the Energy Technologies Institute, the climate change levy, climate change agreements, the Coal Forum, national policy statements, Warm Front, the UK fuel poverty strategy, the Sector Skills Council, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07071266000506"></a>That is not an exhaustive list. On top of that, there is the new Planning Bill and the Climate Change Bill. If the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, could do something to rationalise and bring coherence to this vast tangle of government-sponsored initiatives, he would make a huge contribution to an excellent energy policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07071266000507"></a>Many of the contributors to our debate at the FST laid stress on the overriding need for an effective and realistic mechanism for pricing carbon. That is essential if these investment markets are going to work properly.  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1544"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1544</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is an issue which, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, may have been warned, I have raised on several occasions in this House and on which I have had lengthy correspondence with his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, notably last February.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07071266000508"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, acknowledged that the EU ETS, the chosen mechanism for pricing carbon, was not working properly in phase 1. It was hoped that the review, then in progress, would bring about improvements. He promised that the White Paper would set out the Government&#146;s view in more detail. Well, my Lords, it does. I draw attention&#151;one has to hunt for it, but it is there&#151;to Annex C, at the back of the White Paper. I am not going to quote it all as that would be inappropriate. However, four perfectly valid bullet points are set out on page 334. First, the EU ETS,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000760"></a>&#147;should ... set safe, predictable and affordable limits on emissions, which tighten over time&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70712-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07071266000509"></a>That is quite right. Secondly, it should,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000761"></a>&#147;be improved such that it is more efficient with fewer distortions&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70712-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07071266000510"></a>Thirdl, it should,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000762"></a>&#147;cover the right emitters&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000712"></a>which it most emphatically does not do at present. The carbon capture and storage is not yet in it. Fourthly, it should,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000763"></a>&#147;form the hub of a global carbon market&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000511"></a>We are a long way from that.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07071266000512"></a>Where does that take us? How are the Government getting on with this? What is being done to make these thoroughly desirable objectives happen?</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07071266000513"></a>In the debate on 8 February on the electricity industry, I asked the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, about the so-called carbon hedge proposal advanced by EDF Energy and others. Put briefly, it is a market mechanism for establishing a floor price for carbon. That would be a valuable start. In his letter to me written after the debate, on 19 February, the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, commented generally, but he did add the words, in italics, in the final paragraph, that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000764"></a>&#147;we committed in the Energy Review to <I>&#145;keep open the option of further measures to reinforce the operation of the EU ETS in the UK should this be necessary to provide greater certainty to investors</I>&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70712-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07071266000514"></a>EDF Energy briefed me this week to the effect that nothing whatever is being done about the carbon hedge proposals. Can the Minister now tell us what other options, what further measures as promised by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, are being pursued to attempt to deal with the question of trying to get a clearer price for carbon.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07071266000515"></a>The future of nuclear policy was raised by a number of noble Lords. This had a very bad start from the risible 2003 White Paper. That was followed by what has been described in the courts as &#147;the deeply flawed consultation&#148;, following the Greenpeace action. Therefore, Ministers had to start again. In May, they issued <I>The Future of Nuclear Power</I>, a consultation document with the closing date of 10 October. I am quick to give credit where credit is due. I think that is a very splendid consultation document. They have asked all the right questions and learnt the lessons of the court case. It is very well written, but the botched consultation of the previous year has cost us a year.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1545"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1545</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70712-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07071266000516"></a>The new consultation makes it very clear that no decisions have yet been made. This is a consultation paper. I have seen reports of meetings held by some of the noble Lord&#146;s officials, including one excellent meeting held in the north-west by his senior man, Mark Higson. It is clear that Mr Higson and others have been bending over backwards to make it absolutely clear that no decisions have been taken: this is a consultation document. If he said &#147;we are consulting&#148; once, he said it 10 times. So I come to the point raised by my noble friend on the Front Bench. What are we to make of the question and response made at Question Time in the other place on 4 July? Sir Menzies Campbell asked:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07071266000744"></a>&#147;Will the Government now abandon their headlong rush towards a new generation of nuclear power stations?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000713"></a>In a long answer that also covered other things, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07071266000745"></a>&#147;That is why we have made the decision to continue with nuclear power&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/7/07; col. 954.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000714"></a>It is interesting to note that, absolutely right on cue, a letter has come from Greenpeace addressed to the Prime Minister. It states that this makes the consultation a nonsense, it will need to start all over again, and that although the Government would be prepared to consult widely, they will have to embark on yet a third round of consultation.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07071266000517"></a>We must have an answer from the Minister this afternoon to the question: what do the Government intend to do about that? If we are simply told, &#147;I am sorry. The Prime Minister got it wrong and he shouldn&#146;t have said that&#148;, we will understand. Although he had been in his job for more than the five days that he said, nevertheless it was clear that he had not been properly briefed on the issue. Many people would accept that, although I doubt whether Greenpeace will. The noble Lord may find that there will be another case and we need to be told this afternoon what the Government are going to do about it.</p>

<a name="70712-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07071266000518"></a>Finally, I return to the issue I raised at Question Time on 28 June about the siting of new nuclear power stations. I should make it perfectly clear that I am not asking where these should be, and I accept entirely the thrust of the answer given by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, in which he made it clear that the Jackson Consulting report was one of several policy documents being fed into the system. Rather, I want to ask about the process that the Government have in mind for deciding these issues. Both last year and this year the Government have made some important announcements about the siting process, and I have a few questions based on statements which have been made. The first appeared in the Energy Review Report of July last year at page 124. The Government promised that they would,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000765"></a>&#147;monitor whether an appropriate market in nuclear sites is developing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000715"></a>I am aware that Ofgem is worried that somehow it is going to be drawn into the process because there will be arguments about whether there is free and fair competition, and whether those who sit on the present sites, such as the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and British Energy, will give proper access to them. If there is a conflict of interest, what role will the Government play in helping to resolve it?</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1546"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1546</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70712-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07071266000519"></a>Then there is the question that arises in the nuclear power consultation document published in May this year, when the Government proposed that they would,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000766"></a>&#147;invite nominations for possible sites for new nuclear power stations&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000716"></a>and on,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000767"></a>&#147;restricting build to the vicinity of the existing sites&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000717"></a>Who will be invited to nominate the sites? Would the nominations be limited to the current owners or could another energy company, perhaps a speculative developer, nominate a preferred site? Which other bodies might be able to do that&#151;the local authority or the regional development agency? Again, I think that the Minister could answer that without in any way anticipating where these sites will be.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70712-0008.htm"/>


<a name="70712-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07071266000520"></a>Thirdly, in the Energy Review Report last year the Government noted that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07071266000746"></a>&#147;There might be other attractive sites, for example, sites with retiring fossil fuel generators&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000718"></a>Many of those are power stations that are going to have to close because of the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive. Will&#151;or perhaps I should ask, could&#151;retiring coal power station sites be nominated for new nuclear development under the Government&#146;s siting consultation process?</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07071266000521"></a>All these questions are based on statements that the Government have already made. I hope that I can get some answers. When the noble Lord comes to wind up the debate, he will recognise that I do not expect him to give me detailed answers to my questions, but I would very much welcome a general response and perhaps an undertaking to write to me in greater detail.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07071266000522"></a>The Government have embarked on what seems to me at last to be the right road towards what might become a viable energy policy. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is very welcome that we can expect decisions before the end of this year. We shall want to hold Ministers firmly to account as the decisions which must be taken, are taken.</p>

<a name="07071266000523"></a><b><a name="70712-0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071266000977"></a>Lord Chorley:</b> My Lords, as is customary, I start by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, on his maiden speech. He has made it on an important subject: energy policy and the recent White Paper. This is the third White Paper in four years, and I am bound to say that the previous two rated, in my book, as perhaps only beta minors. This one is much better; it is more comprehensive and begins to give us a well argued way forward. But, as many noble Lords have said in the debate, we need to see some action now, and therefore we all welcome what the noble Lord said this morning without any prompting, shall we say. I say this in the main from the rather narrow fronts of, first, electricity supply and, secondly, climate change.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07071266000524"></a>In previous debates I have talked about carbon emissions in transport, particularly aviation. They are important and quite topical subjects, but today I will confine myself solely to electricity supply. I do so for several reasons. First, as the Minister said, it is our biggest single CO2 emissions source, at about one-third. Secondly, it is probably the easiest one to deal with.  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1547"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1547</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Thirdly, as the White Paper acknowledges, it so happens that the next dozen years will present a unique opportunity to do something significant and make a major contribution to CO2 reductions, and to do so in a manner which is or could be near economic. The caveat of &#147;near economic&#148; is of great importance. We can do things which are pretty expensive&#151;offshore wind power is the obvious example&#151;but there are limits in terms of security of supply and of cost. The opportunity is derived from the fact that, between now and 2020, about a third of our generating system needs to be renewed. All this is well argued and set out in chapter 5 of the White Paper.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07071266000525"></a>I am not going to speak at length about renewables but will make three brief points. First, they are in my view a red herring, a sop to the &#147;hair shirts and sandals&#148; people. They would be lucky to achieve 20 per cent, which is just as well as they are expensive, which is my second point. A new renewable obligation of 20 per cent is just about affordable in terms of subsidy, but the figures are beginning to get pretty big and it is increasingly worrying. Thirdly, the environmental damage to our countryside is factored in only when the planning aspect is brought into play. In that connection, the thought of a Severn barrage horrifies me. The damage it will do to wildlife and the estuarine countryside&#151;that is, the birdlife&#151;is difficult to contemplate. Whether a tidal flow scheme, as compared with a barrage, is a possibility may be worth examining. Nor do I wish to say anything about nuclear. The Government are still treading gingerly in this area. I can understand why, and I hope that under the new leadership we can move forward. A new consultation document&#151;here I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding&#151;has much to commend it. There is no question, either on basic economic grounds or on CO2 grounds, that the new generation of nuclear power stations is pretty good. Surely by now we can put to bed the decommissioning issues. We have had countless reports on this, including some from House of Lords Select Committees. Surely we can move on now, following the consultation. I encourage the Government to grasp this nettle. In the interests of diversity of supply&#151;not too many eggs in one basket, that is&#151;I would like to see around 25 or 30 per cent of our supply from nuclear.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07071266000526"></a>I come finally to fossil fuels&#151;about 50 to 60 per cent of future supply. Gas and coal are highly economic, excluding the carbon footprint. There are big question marks, of course, over gas supplies from Russia, but we can thank President Putin for alerting us to that danger. The other big question is surely the economics and the technical question of carbon capture and sequestration&#151;CCS. How well are we&#151;not just Great Britain&#151;progressing with this technology? What is the timescale? When do decisions have to be made? What do the electricity supply companies think? In my notes I wrote, &#147;Where have we got to on the important and imaginative scheme of BP at Peterhead?&#148;. I got the answer from the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. BP has had to abandon it because the Government were incapable of coming to a decision. I am appalled by that. Now that we have a businessman in charge, perhaps these sort of disasters will be prevented.  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1548"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1548</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I understand that decisions are required from Government, but where have we got to? I go on about this because grinding away at the technology of CCS, carbon capture and storage, seems to be the key to the future of the electricity supply industry. I suspect that CCS, combined with other technical improvements in electricity generation, is not that far off from being economic. Does the Minister agree? What price does his department put on carbon that would equate with the extra cost of CCS? In addition, if he agrees with this line of thought, do we have enough regulatory powers to push the electricity companies in this direction? The White Paper suggests, in rather general terms, that Ofgem has these powers. Can the Minister confirm that Ofgem has the power to ensure that the generating companies make timely and appropriate investments with low carbon footprints? I am referring here to box 5.1.1 of the White Paper.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07071266000527"></a>I conclude with a few observations on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which has been referred to by a number of noble Lords. I am sure that the Government are right to seek agreement to strengthen and reinforce the ETS to provide firms with greater long-term carbon market certainty. In particular, we surely need a much higher carbon price&#151;other noble Lords mentioned this&#151;and a much more stable price, if CCS is to become an economic reality. Moreover, ETS is surely the way forward to international carbon trading, with all the benefits of classical economic efficiency. It is a large and hugely complex subject, but the objectives are clear. I leave it at that.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07071266000528"></a>Finally, if there is one conclusion that comes through from this debate, it is that we have had enough talk about White Papers. We now need decisions and actions.</p>
<a name="time_17"></a>

He is well equipped, from his experience and abilities, to deal with a very complex problem. He will remember Harold Macmillan giving advice to colleagues, when dealing with something very complex that takes a long time: he said that the balance between delivering a clich&#233; or making a terrible mistake is a state of delicate equipoise. We are confident that he will avoid both.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07071266000530"></a>I want to concentrate on chapter 1 of the White Paper, which deals with energy security, and in particular security of supply. The word &#147;security&#148; in this context is used in its traditional rather than its intelligence sense. So where in this context we speak of &#147;national security&#148;, we mean it in a most compendious way&#151;it includes government, business, industry, finance, the people and the way we live economically in this country. Security of supply of energy requirements that will sustain our national security is absolutely vital. All the other parts of this White Paper are equally important. But in the shorter term&#151;the next 10 to 20 years&#151;we cannot afford to neglect our critical dependence on traditional energy supplies. Their security is therefore something we must work for. We should work for it in our national interest, in the expectation that that would usually coincide with the international interest.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1549"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1549</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70712-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07071266000531"></a>What are the essential factors that affect our national interest at the moment? Most of our energy requirements will have to be met by imported supplies for the foreseeable future. We remain a trading nation, right down to energy. Secondly, the chief executive of Shell said recently that by 2050 the world&#146;s use of energy will double from its present volume. Thirdly, the International Energy Agency this week predicted a period of five years plus of what it called a supply crunch&#151;an extremely tight market. Higher oil and gas prices will remain. Of course the economist and the financier will tell us that most of the time that can be accommodated. But it cannot readily be accommodated at the personal level. Higher oil and gas prices, persisting over time, mean more expensive petrol, more expensive utilities and more expensive food, so that every citizen is affected economically.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07071266000532"></a>My fourth point involves resource nationalism. It is here to stay in some countries, and, because they have such massive resources, the rest of us will accommodate the nationalisation of their products. But this resource nationalism means that, in a period of higher prices, there will be a restricted supply and little inclination to spend lots of money on discovery and exploration&#151;a circular system that maintains a high price level, if that is possible.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07071266000533"></a>The last point about these external factors concerns resources. Anyone who has been to an energy conference will remember the bar charts for gas and oil that show us, each time, which entities supply the most and have the greatest reserves. For gas, it is Gazprom; for oil, it is Saudi Aramco. Those bars on the chart literally go off the page compared with any other similar entity. In effect, two entities are in seriously important positions of control of world energy supplies.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07071266000534"></a>What do those five factors mean? They mean that we as a country need energy at an expensive price, which is likely to continue, from limited sources, some of which may be unstable, with little prospect in the foreseeable future of big new reserves being found. That state of affairs requires of our Government and our country some really serious thinking about security of supply. I propose some suggestions under three headings.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07071266000535"></a>The first is that we adopt a more aggressive search for energy supplies. One of the least publicised but most important achievements of the last Government towards their end was the agreement with Norway for long-term supplies of energy&#151;an ally, a neighbour and geopolitically secure. What about Qatar? I imagine that our ambassador there is treated as one of the more important people to speak to on the phone occasionally. What about Libya? It is opening up into the market. Algeria presently wants to feed gas into Spain, France and probably beyond.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07071266000536"></a>What of our gas infrastructure, which is designed to meet these new sources? That means going out into the market and getting it. How do we do that? First, I suggest an advisory group; not a talking shop, but one which consists of energy experts, financiers and geopolitical planners, who meet the Government from time to time to talk it through, as would any big business if it had the capacity to deal with such a problem. No civil servant reading the White Paper

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07071266000537"></a>Next, why do not we appoint &#147;energy ambassadors&#148;? I refer not to diplomats but to people who cross the energy, political, business and government divides, and who spend their time, within reason, looking for our markets, preserving those we have and seeking to make our supplies secure, being on top of the issue. This is geopolitics of a serious kind. May Kaldor&#146;s recent book, <I>Oil Wars</I>, makes plain to us that which we should have known historically: that the present panorama in many ways repeats that which existed towards the beginning of the 20th century&#151;the oil wars of that time where Baku was the Riyadh of its epoch. So I suggest a more aggressive policy built on skill, experience and determination.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07071266000538"></a>Next, we must look for a more reliable market. The governance of the countries upon whom we are dependent in this regard is unreliable. It is amazing that we should be conducting the world economy without anyone really knowing how much oil reserves there are or what the future gas capacity will be. For 15 consecutive years, Saudi Arabia has declared that its reserves are 280 billion barrels, even though in the same number of years it has consumed 100 billion barrels. The absurdity of that state of affairs should worry us if, as I pointed out, Saudi Aramco is the key supplier. Where is it all going? So I suggest better governance and more transparency. At 1.29 of chapter 1, the Government say that the UN should work for that transparency in the interests of us all.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07071266000539"></a>Next, under the heading of the more reliable market, we have an energy charter. It exists to preserve a system for energy usage around the world, based in Brussels. As my noble friend Lord Haskel indicated, why do we not have a European energy security charter to which we sign up as allies and supporters of a single market, not to divide the supply of energy into Europe but to unite it in the most productive way? If one looks at a map showing gas and oil supplies into Europe, it is all from the east&#151;not the Middle East. One can see the lines for gas and oil criss-crossing pretty well every European country. Has anyone planned it, negotiated it, or thought it through? Of course not. It has happened coincidentally with one national interest meeting another. So the Russo-German gas pipeline under the Baltic could create the supply alliance between two very powerful countries. What about the remainder of Europe? Again the word &#147;Russian&#148; is not coincidental here. Its proposal for an oil pipeline&#151;Bulgaria, Greece and Italy&#151;completes the circle of supply and potential market control. That requires European action.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07071266000540"></a>Lastly, I refer to a market with security of supply that remembers the developing world. I start with national interest, not charitable sentiment. If by next year, or the year after, we as a nation will be the first in the G8 to reach 0.7 per cent in our commitment to development aid, do we want it wasted because it will go to countries which do not have proper energy supplies or systems which will be necessary to make our development aid more beneficial to them? At 1.50 of chapter 1, the Government have some really serious proposals: an energy research programme for Africa; an infrastructure consortium; and the involvement of the development banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07071266000541"></a>I have spent a considerable time on security of supply because it can be forgotten. I am talking about today and the tomorrows of the near future. They are vital to us. This is an extraordinarily complex problem. It will benefit from the following: informed debate; evidence-based decisions; financial prudence; and all of us in Parliament and Government being geopolitically astute, as I am sure our new Minister will be.</p>

I say that because, when I came to the House 16 years ago, I was given one piece of advice by noble Lords. They said, &#147;On your maiden speech you can say anything you like because everyone will be nice to you. On your second speech the knives are out; you had better watch your back&#148;. So basically I am making my speech to his second speech while saying what a wonderful first speech he made.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07071266000543"></a>I remind the noble Lord that we have met on one occasion previously, when we were both in teams on &#147;University Challenge&#148;. I represented the House of Lords; the noble Lord represented the CBI. It goes to show the degree of aspiration to which this House is held by those outside that we were put up against the Oxford University Press while the CBI was against the English National Opera. I believe that we had a slightly harder challenge.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07071266000544"></a>I wish immediately to ask one important question, because many noble Lords have raised the issue. What is the noble Lord&#146;s department called? As I passed down Victoria Street, I noticed that there was no D before the letters BERR, so does that make it? If you add the D, there is a slightly more interesting connotation, because it sounds like debris. I wondered whether that was a hangover from somebody in the DTI leaving this as a rather amusing aside for the new department. I am sure that the Minister can give us a conclusive analysis of how we should refer to the department in future.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07071266000545"></a>This debate has been held on a number of occasions. As many noble Lords realise, a small but happy band in this House comes back to the issue. As we have had three White Papers, all of which were startlingly similar in the conclusion that they wanted to reach, the arguments have become somewhat calcified. These Benches are obviously of the hair-shirt and open-sandal brigade mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, because of our view on nuclear energy. However, as was said from these Benches, that view is not held by everybody in the party and might well change if situations change.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07071266000546"></a>If we moved to thorium reactors, which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, mentioned, I would be the first to say that nuclear energy would be a very positive step forward. However, our position is based on the cost of nuclear power and the amount of energy that it produces. We should look at the reality and not put ourselves in the position of the French, who get 80 per cent of their energy from nuclear power. We are talking about 14 per cent of our energy being produced by nuclear power in the next few years, going down to under   


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1552"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>10 per cent unless new nuclear power comes on stream. The figure will probably go below 10 per cent; the recent results from the Hinckley Point reactors, and the state of the carbon rods in them, give the impression that they might have to come offline far sooner than we thought, given that we were hoping for an extended life.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07071266000547"></a>So in the next 10 or 20 years we are looking at not relying on nuclear to provide a massive proportion of our energy. Obviously, if the planning regime is changed under the White Paper we could bring nuclear power online far quicker than at present. However, we are still looking at between five and 10 years to bring nuclear power stations online. It will depend how many nuclear stations are brought online. If we are looking to meet a significant proportion of our energy needs from nuclear, we are talking about a very large number of reactors being built. It would be interesting to know the cost of that. By going down the nuclear power route, we will lock ourselves into a power system that is 30 years old. We will lock ourselves into the national grid and therefore close the door on distributed energy, which is another policy that the Government are looking at.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07071266000548"></a>Nuclear power is seen by many, especially those involved in the environmental field, as a silver bullet against climate change. I have a separate issue with that, because no carbon audit of the life cycle of a nuclear power station has ever been undertaken. Although we have talked about waste and waste management, there has never been an assessment of the carbon footprint of deep geological storage.</p>

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="07071266000549"></a><b><a name="70712-0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071266000980"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Could I suggest that he gets in contact with British Energy, which did exactly that with regard to the life cycle of the nuclear power station at Torness?</p>

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="07071266000550"></a><b><a name="70712-0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071266000981"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> My Lords, that is interesting. British Energy might have done that, but I should have thought that the Government, who are meant to be procuring energy, would have done it themselves. In response to the multiple Questions that I have tabled over a couple of years, the Government have said that they have never undertaken a life-cycle carbon footprint assessment, and they have never shown any knowledge of that carbon footprint. Of course, we are also talking about the legacy costs of nuclear power, which will have a long carbon tail in the management of waste. However, if technology moves on and nuclear power is shown to be far more reliable and to have a far lower carbon footprint and an acceptable cost, I am sure that my party will look again at this issue.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07071266000551"></a>I congratulate the Government most wholeheartedly on the recent commitment to 20 per cent renewables by 2020. That is visionary and should be recommended. I believe that it is also achievable. The Severn barrage has been noted. If we are to meet that 20 per cent target, the Severn barrage must be considered, because 5 per cent of the country&#146;s renewable energy coming from one source is not something that can be written out of the mix. However, I note that a report is soon to be published on this. The environmental impact has to be looked at. The environmental report considered the  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1553"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1553</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>impact on the birdlife. We should not forget that global warming has resulted in the temperature in the Severn estuary rising by 1.5 degrees in the past 10 years. Whatever the cause of that&#151;many people attribute it to global warming&#151;it has displaced one of the bird species that was at risk from temperature rises, because it is has made the Severn estuary uncomfortable for that species as a breeding area. This should be taken into account.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07071266000552"></a>If we are looking at global impact, we cannot just say, &#147;We shall not have wind because it would destroy the view&#148;. I live in a national park in Northumberland and I am very aware of the view and of the impact that wind energy has. However, I am also very aware that when we had very dry summers there was a massive risk of fire, and many of the native species in the national park were under threat due to lack of water. Global warming will increase periods of drought and will fundamentally change the view in national parks and their flora and fauna.</p>

<a name="70712-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07071266000553"></a>On the underpinning of the White Paper, there is a slight problem, especially with the 20 per cent renewables target. The White Paper is based on the assumption of a high carbon price of around 30 ecus a tonne under the European trading scheme. If that is not realised, some of the underlying philosophy is at risk. There will also be a slight challenge for renewables, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, were receiving ROCs. If the 30 ecus a tonne is not achieved, that would fundamentally challenge the concept of whether nuclear makes sense. I refer to the low-carbon generation offset of nuclear. Has any work been undertaken in the department? Is it looking at this problem? Does it believe that the price will remain high? If the carbon price collapsed, it would have a fundamental impact on the underlying precepts of the White Paper.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07071266000554"></a>The White Paper mentions a number of other issues. When I first read it, I thought that it had only one aim in mind&#151;not whether but when we should have nuclear. I am not asking the Minister to say exactly when the first foundation stone is to be laid and whose name will be on it, because Greenpeace will write a letter&#151;I shall happily send it a copy of <I>Hansard</I> to help it to write that letter. The problem with the White Paper is that it focuses on nuclear, whereas there are other extremely important aspects, energy efficiency being one of the main ones. I very much hope that the Minister will consider social tariffs and get Ofgem to look at them. There is an issue of fuel poverty in this country. You cannot just raise fuel prices and expect people not to suffer. However, if you use the Scandinavian model of social tariffs, whereby a set amount of energy is charged at a lower tariff, any higher energy user has to pay far higher charges for the excess energy that they use. That would be a good social indicator of how people could reduce energy use.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07071266000555"></a>This is not an insignificant issue. I recently had a meeting with the Nappy Alliance, which is for reusable nappies. A report came out on whether reusable nappies were better than disposable nappies. In energy terms, if you wash and dry the nappies, reusable nappies are not as good, according to the report. But if you hang out the reusable nappies on a clothes horse, suddenly the figures change around. We must look at social  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1554"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1554</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>changes, because it is not difficult to use reusable nappies. I speak from the experience of having changed at least two this morning. I have an eight month-old baby, and I had just changed the nappy when I had to change it again, although perhaps that is more information than is worth while on a Thursday afternoon. Such changes can have a massive effect. People do not realise how much energy tumble driers use. Each bill is bolstered by an estimated &#163;100 in those households that use tumble driers as opposed to those that do not. It is not a difficult situation to remedy; I think that you can buy a clothes horse for &#163;12.99 in John Lewis.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07071266000556"></a>Another indicator is smart meters. The Government really must firmly grasp this issue. There is a conflict between those in the industry and those producing the meters over which type of meters should be put in. If you put in a basic meter, which are estimated to cost between &#163;40 and &#163;60, it will show very little information of value to the consumer. It will show quite a lot of information that is valuable to the generator, but not to the consumer. If you put in the meters that cost between &#163;90 and &#163;140, you could have information that is valuable to the consumer. For example, it could direct your washing machine or dishwasher to turn on in the middle of the night when energy is at its cheapest. That has a massive impact on the use of energy. It would also tell you how to switch energy suppliers. However, the nub of the problem is who pays for that. At the moment, the supplier pays for the meter. It is not a great indicator if you are supplying a meter that gives information on how to change to another supplier the minute that its energy is cheaper. The Government need to look at that issue, because an opportunity is being lost to introduce energy information that could save an estimated 10 per cent of domestic users&#146; energy supply.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07071266000557"></a>Another small issue is EPCs, or energy performance certificates. The two things that you can change to raise the energy rating of your house are your insulation and your boiler. If energy efficiency credits were used by companies to offset the cost of a new boiler, using the information from EPCs, that would have a massive impact on the use of gas by domestic suppliers, and it would help gas suppliers, who have an obligation to reduce the amount of gas that they use.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07071266000558"></a>I am fast running out of time, but I end on the cautionary note of carbon storage and capture. I commend the Government for having their competition for the first plant for carbon storage and capture. The unfortunate aspect is that two carbon storage and capture plants that were being built and were ready to operate have now gone offline, and their operation has been suspended because money is no longer available. Earlier, the Minister said that the Government did not want to put all their eggs in one basket, but we are going for one project and we have lost two, which is very unfortunate.</p>

We therefore welcome the Minister, who we believe is someone with whose views we have much in common. He so rightly referred to the need for efforts in the international world, because we are a relatively small part of the overall problem. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, referred to China and India. The Minister also mentioned the need to work on our European colleagues towards achieving a common approach and, importantly, liberalised markets. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, also spoke of his concerns in this area. However, my noble friend Lord Liverpool, speaking on China and India, referred to the need for us none the less to set an example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07071266000560"></a>I am grateful to all noble Lords for their contributions. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, spoke about the challenge of incentivising electricity suppliers to reduce power usage and about &#147;hot rocks&#148;, a subject on which he has spoken before. The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, raised his special subject of daylight saving, and I reassure him that the Official Opposition&#146;s position has not changed since we last debated the matter, when we gave very good reasons why we opposed precipitate change. The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, also made a good point about the dangers of pursuing biodiesel at all costs and the huge danger of the unintended consequences of that, which already include massive deforestation not only in south-east Asia, especially Malaysia&#151;which he mentioned and is a country I know well&#151;but in South America and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07071266000561"></a>My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith spoke about the conflict between certain growth in the use of energy, especially in the developing world, and the vital need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and other by-products that are so damaging to the environment, and about the huge difficulties which we acknowledge in squaring the circle. He spoke about his three Hs&#151;heat, hydrogen and horticulture&#151;and about the dangers of overemphasis on biofuels. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, spoke chillingly about his concerns for the very survival of the United Kingdom and of the need to think for the longer term and about lessons that can be learnt from overseas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07071266000562"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin spoke of a continued need for clarity, and he asked the Minister to confirm the Government&#146;s commitment to the market. He congratulated the Minister on his acknowledgement of the need for a decision this year on the nuclear question. The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, was of a similar mind to my noble friend on this issue. My noble friend Lord Jenkin mentioned the proliferation of strategies, incentives, levies, agreements, policies and proposed legislation and the pressing need for rationalisation and clarification. He also referred to the potential of the &#147;carbon hedge&#148; mechanism and his frustration that it and other measures are not being progressed to help to achieve a proper and consistent price for carbon. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, also referred to his concerns in this area. My noble friend Lord Jenkin went on to raise a number of very important questions for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07071266000563"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, reminded us of the vital importance of security of energy supply. He referred to five areas of threat to our country and he made three interesting recommendations. We look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to those recommendations. My noble friend Lady Wilcox spoke about the importance of improving the environmental credentials of our energy industry. Like her, I am glad that the White Paper refers to the need for this to be taken into consideration. The White Paper has also mirrored the Opposition&#146;s interim findings last year by emphasising the crucial importance of energy security.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07071266000564"></a>The statistics are enough to show how much of a priority this must be. As the Minister said, 30 per cent of Britain&#146;s current generating capacity will be retired in the next 20 years, and electricity demand continues to rise. The laws of demand and supply are inexorably leading us, as the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, said, to becoming more dependent on imported energy from a very limited number of reliable sources. In November 2005, the Minister, in a previous role, warned us about an energy crisis that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000768"></a>&#147;could see factories and offices having to shut down for all but three days a week&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000719"></a>We were all fortunate that his worst fears were not realised, but the underlying problems, especially the longer-term ones, have not gone away.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07071266000565"></a>Significant increases in the price of oil on the international market have also combined with a squeeze on imports from less liberalised European markets to push up prices, so new gas interconnector and LNG facilities have come too late to prevent domestic bills rising by 35 per cent in real terms over the past seven years. Bills for medium-sized businesses have risen by 50 per cent in the past two years. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has set a target to eliminate fuel poverty&#151;the Minister referred to that&#151;in vulnerable households. The Government have been forced to admit that, largely due to oil price rises, the total number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty rose by around 1 million between 2003 and 2006. Perhaps the Minister can expand on the Government&#146;s plans to tackle that.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07071266000566"></a>While there is scope for conflict in the short term between reducing carbon emissions on the one hand and energy security on the other, in the longer term this could, with skill and a certain amount of luck, be turned to synergy. We cannot leave it to luck. Policies that diversify supply across renewable sources and improve efficiency and the use of energy could reduce our reliance on imported energy from less reliable sources. As the White Paper recognises, improving the energy efficiency of businesses and households is the cheapest and easiest way of reducing carbon emissions, and that would also help to restrain our dependence on imported energy. The subject has been well aired today.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07071266000567"></a>Government guidance is, arguably, rather light, but the noble Lord&#146;s arrival in his new post provides an encouraging message that there will be improvement. In their proposals on smart metering to which the Minister referred, the Government appear to fudge the distinction&#151;as the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Redesdale, rightly said&#151;between proper  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1557"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1557</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>smart meters which send information between appliances and suppliers and much simpler real-time electricity displays which provide information in real time but do not result in any of the efficiencies associated with smart meters, such as accurate billing, early warnings for vulnerable customers and an end to expensive pre-pay meters. This differentiation may seem trivial, but there is enough doubt among the general public about the dangers of climate change and scepticism about suggested solutions that care must be taken to ensure that government statements are as accurate, clear and consistent as possible. Energywatch research suggests that smart meters, as opposed to real-time displays, can make substantial savings to customers&#146; energy bills. Such positive results must not be undermined by an attempt to gain green credentials on the cheap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07071266000568"></a>There is much more to energy efficiency than is mentioned in the White Paper. I join several other noble Lords who would be grateful if the Minister could give us more information about what the Government are doing, for example, to achieve an improvement in international manufacturing standards and to ensure that household appliances are made with energy efficiency increasingly in mind. The Government&#146;s energy efficiency policy gives the Minister scope to bring his considerable experience to bear. Greenpeace has referred to the inadequacy of the White Paper&#146;s focus on combined heat and power technology, which is already being employed effectively elsewhere in Europe. CHP can help reduce carbon emissions by using fuels more efficiently. Why are the Government not fully exploring this process which could drastically improve our energy efficiency?</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07071266000569"></a>Of course it would be hard for effective CHP infrastructure to be established without considerable decentralisation of the power grid. In their energy policy statement last July, the Government proposed a range of consultations, reviews, strategies and feasibility studies to help the development of decentralised energy. Yet, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, said, the White Paper adds little except for another consultation and some vague promises that barriers will be removed. I am sure that that was not the intention, but can the Minister tell us when the Government will be able to produce a policy that will create the conditions in which decentralisation will happen?</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07071266000570"></a>We are unlikely ever to be completely self-sufficient in energy as a country. International trade in energy will always be necessary. Unfortunately, the lack of clarity in the Government&#146;s energy policy has delayed the much-needed investment in new plant. These delays are undeniably leading to narrower plant margins and an ever-increasing risk of supply interruptions. Clarity is needed on the future of the carbon pricing mechanism, the support that will be available for renewables and a framework under which nuclear new build will have to operate. Without that, the investment&#151;the importance of which the Minister referred to in some detail&#151;will naturally be focused towards the default option of gas turbine power stations, instead of towards alternative power generation. Our dependence on imported gas will be increased, and high carbon emissions will be locked in for the life of the new plant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07071266000571"></a>Diversity of supply is important and, again, government delays are not helping to ensure that energy production is grounded in a variety of technologies&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, explained in some detail. My noble friend Lady Wilcox has mentioned the danger of the banded renewables obligation focusing excessively on one or two technologies rather than sharing subsidies appropriately among all feasible renewable technologies. It is equally important not needlessly to rule out any non-renewable energy sources, and many different types have been mentioned today from all sides of the House.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07071266000572"></a>Carbon capture technology, desulphurisation plants and other mechanisms for reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuel generators were referred to by my noble friend Lord Jenkin and the noble Lords, Lord Chorley and Lord O&#146;Neill. These are all a necessary part of the future to ensure effective diversification and a continuing ability to exploit resources, such as coal, without undue adverse environmental consequences. The Minister&#146;s words on government action here are encouraging.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07071266000573"></a>The importance of energy security is clear and it will only increase as time goes on. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to the important points raised by noble Lords in this debate. I echo the hope of my noble friend Lady Wilcox that he will reassure us that the Government intend to introduce firmer and clearer guidance very soon.</p>

I am learning all the time. I have never before listened to a full debate, and I found it eloquent and informed; and I have learnt so much. Please forgive me if in the next few moments, I forget to do the complete tour d&#146;horizon. If I miss anything out, please contact me, and I shall do my best to give a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07071266000575"></a>I shall now attempt what my noble friend Lord Brennan said was a cautionary tale from Macmillan about steering the difficult path between the clich&#233; and the massive mistake. Before dealing with the excellent points raised by your Lordships, I start by saying something that is very dear to my heart. It deals with a couple of the issues raised by the noble Lords, Lord Redesdale and Lord Dixon-Smith. Without wealth creation or making a profit, you get no tax in this country. With that profit, you reward the people who took the risk&#151;the shareholders&#151;and they pay tax on it; or you keep it in the business and you pay tax; or you employ people and they pay tax on it. Some of it goes to good, decent, hard-working people in the public sector, and they pay tax on it. Without the tax, there would be no schools, hospitals, armies, airports, railways, prisons or the rest of it. If it were not for the wealth creation of this nation, there would be no tax.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07071266000576"></a>If it were not for the energy supply produced in as low-carbon a way as possible with as safe and secure a supply as possible, there would be no wealth creation because the lights would go out. Energy drives factories, workshops and offices up and down the country. It is the tool with which jobs are created,  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1559"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1559</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hospitals are kept open and schools work. Energy is literally the power behind all economic development. As my noble friend Lord Brennan said in the speech that he devoted to this subject, security of supply is vital. The one sure way of achieving that is by having diverse sources of supply, but we need to bear in mind that the people of this great nation worry every day when they see other nations using energy as a way of flexing diplomatic and political power. We will not keep the lights on in our hospitals or our offices, or help with the insecurities of our people, if we do not keep security of supply at the top of our agenda.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07071266000577"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and one or two other noble Lords mentioned the consultation on nuclear power. I can do no more than reassure the House that the Government have not made up their mind. The Government&#146;s position is clear: we have formed a preliminary view, which can be seen in the White Paper, that energy companies should be given the option of investing in new nuclear power stations, but we are consulting on that view. No decision has been taken, and we will actively consider all the consultation responses. I can do no more than refer noble Lords to the Prime Minister&#146;s statement in another place yesterday:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07071266000747"></a>&#147;My honourable friend knows that we put our nuclear proposals out to public consultation on 23 May. The Government&#146;s preliminary view is that nuclear has a future role in providing our homes and businesses with the low-carbon energy that we need. Let me emphasise that the Government will make their decision in the autumn, after, and in the light of, the consultation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/0/07; col. 1444.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000720"></a>That was the Prime Minister yesterday, and nothing has changed.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07071266000578"></a>When talking about renewables, the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked whether we are making adequate progress, whether we are going far enough and whether there is adequate investment. Of course we could always do more. It is very important that we get a mix, stimulate investment in renewables and that renewables do not suffer because of investment in other technologies. Our proposals for improving the renewables obligation will help the greater deployment of a wider range of renewables, and that includes marine technology. The changes will incentivise 40 per cent more renewables between 2009 and 2015 than if we had not changed the schemes. However, for it to work, we also need additional research and development. We need further, adequate funding of universities to make sure that they can play their part in that research and development and, probably above all, we need a planning regime fit for purpose in the 21st century to enable these schemes to happen and happen quickly.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07071266000579"></a>The noble Baroness also talked about choosing between technologies and criticised the renewables obligation banding. Renewables is a market-based approach that intervened to enable renewables to compete against established technologies. I assure noble Lords that that will increase support for renewables and will improve efficiency in the system. It will support technologies more in need and increase deployment by about 15 per cent by 2015. That is something of which business should rightly be proud because it will happen due to the investment from it. The noble Baroness  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1560"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>then expressed concern about the BP plant at Peterhead and the Government&#146;s handling of it. Prior to the publication of the White Paper, there were seven interested companies. Of those seven, only BP indicated that it no longer wishes to participate. Others may come forward; we do not know. The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, also raised this point. We would have preferred BP to have taken part in the competition because it is a fabulous global business, but we cannot design a competition to suite the interests of just one participant. That is not how we should behave. If BP feels that the timetable does not suit its project, that is a commercial matter for it. Welcome to the market.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07071266000580"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, then asked how the Government would ensure that the cost of any nuclear decommissioning would not fall on the taxpayer. The consultation document makes it clear that we would put arrangements in place through legislation to ensure that owners and operators of new nuclear power stations set aside funds in a secure way to cover their full decommissioning costs and their full share of waste management costs. That would be in legislation and would minimise the risk of taxpayers later being called on to cover the costs of decommissioning and waste management. It is important that, in consultation, which is a two-way process, others stated the facts in that regard while not alarming the public.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07071266000581"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, perhaps I may mention that it was a delight to come down to Cornwall in my former life. I am committed to visiting a region of England or a nation of the United Kingdom at least once a month to understand the issues around inward investment. I look forward to going back to Cornwall as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07071266000582"></a>The noble Lord, too, mentioned BP. It is interesting that one of the advertising slogans it has always used is &#147;beyond petroleum&#148;. It would be naïve of us to think that the major corporations in this field would stand still and not form views on where they can invest in tomorrow&#146;s returns. One of those areas will be renewables; another may be&#151;I do not know&#151;nuclear power. What I do know is that energy supply companies definitely hedge their bets for a long-term future.</p>

<a name="70712-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07071266000583"></a>I also assure the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that the policies in the White Paper will help us to maximise UK energy resources&#151;that is, oil, gas or coal&#151;and to use our energy more efficiently. For example, gas consumption could be 13 per cent lower in 2020 if we implement our demand-reduction measures. The Government are committed also to energy saving. Full implementation of our measures could reduce CO2 by 7 million to 11.7 million tonnes of carbon, which is up to 36 per cent of all savings. We are not standing still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07071266000584"></a>I hope that the noble Lord was speaking with tongue in cheek when he asked how we can expect energy sellers to take responsibility for our using less energy when they are making money out of selling it. Energy sellers succeed in a voluntary, democratically engaged society because they are seen to be responsible. This House, another place, the general public and the media respond very quickly to companies that abuse that position. However, to make it happen, both the customers of energy suppliers and citizens of the country more generally must feel that they have some  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1561"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1561</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>skin in the game. Culturally, we need a shift in this nation, so that people approach the use of energy from an understanding of what a diminishing resource it really is. The energy suppliers cannot do that on their own; nor can politicians and media. Perhaps we should all do more to make sure that people feel better engaged.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07071266000585"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, mentioned also the example that we need to set for other major polluting nations. The noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, mentioned it, too. We rightly talk of China and India, but if we want to take the true moral high ground as we desperately try to ensure that this, our only planet, is saved, let us think also about the United States. It has 5 per cent of the world&#146;s population, but is responsible for 25 per cent of the world&#146;s pollution. We will not persuade India and China to change if they do not see the biggest economy on Earth changing. To pull that off, the European Union needs to set an example. The critics are correct in saying that Britain alone cannot change the whole of the world&#146;s pollution, but we do not have a prayer of getting countries such as India, China, Brazil and the United States to do it unless we do it ourselves. I am proud to belong to a Government who put that very high on their agenda.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07071266000586"></a>I turn to the often reiterated point of the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, about daylight saving. There are potential advantages and disadvantages to a change to the summer-time arrangements. It would have an impact in many different ways on different sectors. Financial services, trade and tourism are all major sectors in this, the most successfully reconstructed economy in Europe. The present situation is a satisfactory compromise between those who prefer lighter mornings and those who prefer lighter evenings&#151;those of us who work in both do not care. We are not convinced that a change to the current arrangements would be in the best interests of this country.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07071266000587"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, for his kind words. We worked together some years ago when I was at the CBI and he was at the then DTI. He mentioned King Coal&#151;that is my phrase, not his&#151;of many years ago. Coal plays a part in the future without a doubt. Obviously, clean-coal technology and carbon capture is very relevant. I do not apologise for the fact that this nation does not send men underground in very dangerous, dirty conditions, which at the end of the day is not where we should be putting an advanced economy&#146;s population.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07071266000588"></a>One of the dangers of losing these industries&#151;in Birmingham we have seen it happen with motor car factories, and it can happen with shipyards and steelworks as well as coalmines&#151;is that those centres of communities had a cohesive effect on our society. It is important that as they go away we bear in mind the debilitating effect it has on the cohesion of a society struggling to deal with a changing world and the frightening aspects and challenges of globalisation.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07071266000589"></a>I can assure my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill that carbon capture and storage offers the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90 per cent. Because of its relevance to developing countries, it is estimated to  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1562"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have the potential to contribute up to 28 per cent of CO2 mitigation. That is why we are supporting a competition for a carbon capture and storage demonstration. That has never been done before. It is on an industrial scale with electricity generation. We think that a competition is the best way to encourage innovation both in the design and its operation. We await its results with great interest.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07071266000590"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Dixon-Smith, Lord Redesdale and Lord Chorley, asked whether the department is called BERR, DBERR or anything else? It is not DBERR because the &#147;Lady in Red&#148; who Chris de Burgh wrote about would be mightily dischuffed, and the department does not like being known as &#147;Chris&#148;. It is called BERR&#151;Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. I am thrilled that at last we have a department whose name has &#147;business&#148; right at the start. I applaud the Prime Minister in taking the very brave step of bringing in some specialists in various fields. But, I would say that, wouldn&#146;t I?&#151;I am one of them. I hope that at last we can raise some of these major issues above factionalisation of party politics, and get on with the job.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07071266000591"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked where responsibility for energy would lie, and where was the juxtaposition between BERR and Defra. It is not the only one; there are transport, planning and low-carbon buildings. We have to be reminded of the crucial role the Treasury plays in this. The Foreign Office and the Department for International Development have a huge role to play in climate change, energy and, of course, trade negotiations. At what point do we say that the way other countries make things should be a barrier to entry and a barrier to trade, which is a protectionist&#146;s last refuge? At what point do we actually acknowledge the issue? Different government departments have energy somewhere on their brief. Putting it in BERR, where business is so key to providing market solutions in so many ways, is, I submit, the best place for it.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07071266000592"></a>The noble Lord mentioned food miles. We have to be very careful when we listen to those in the developed world who tell us that we should not expect fresh fruit to be flown in on Christmas Day, with a huge carbon footprint from aircraft, as we are messing around with the livelihoods of many people in the developing world who need this speedy access to wealthy economies, simply to have clean water, better healthcare and the chance of a better life. A compromise has to be struck on this. It is important that people understand what they are playing with.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07071266000593"></a>The noble Lord spoke about efficiency being achieved at the expense of economic growth. Our economy will continue to grow, while our demand for energy will remain constant and could possibly fall if we get this right. Figures in the White Paper show that we have effectively decoupled economic growth and growth in energy consumption. This Government should be very proud of that because they have shown the rest of western Europe that it can be done. We obviously all need to do more. The chapter in the White Paper entitled &#147;Saving energy&#148; deals comprehensively with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07071266000594"></a>On the point concerning tidal power raised by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, given my lengthy time in the job, I cannot comment on individual projects&#151;I hope your Lordships would not expect me to. But I can reassure the noble Earl that the Sustainable Development Commission is looking at a broad range of issues and options, as well as the Severn Barrage in isolation. Tidal lagoons are being looked at, as he mentioned. The commission is expected to report by September this year. Linking that to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, talking about getting on with it, it is important that, whatever happens, we reach decisions this year. I am pleased that the commission will also be reporting on that particular point in September.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07071266000595"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked what is actually happening on the European Union&#146;s emission trading scheme and the carbon price. As the White Paper says, we are active in shaping the future of this&#151;in many ways, it is a British invention and something of which we should be proud. We are and have always been good traders, and this is just another way we can bring that expertise as a nation to a 21st-century issue. As a nation, we are actively engaged in Brussels and elsewhere across the European Union in making the UK&#146;s case, and we are confident that progress is being made. The noble Lord will share with me the absolute frustration at the speed, or lack of it, in which progress seems to be made in various things in Brussels, and this is no exception. All I can assure the House of is that I and my colleagues will do absolutely everything possible to ensure this is given the level of importance and acknowledgement in Brussels that noble Lords clearly give it here.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07071266000596"></a>The noble Lord also raised site selection. It will be for the private sector to propose sites for new nuclear power stations, just like any other. In May, we launched a technical consultation on how to run a strategic siting assessment. The noble Lord raises just the issues that we are considering, and we welcome views from everybody&#151;stakeholders and the public. We do not have a monopoly on wisdom, so enable us to bring up some definitive answers in the future.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07071266000597"></a>In conclusion, the United Kingdom has been fortunate up till now because we have been able to meet most of our energy needs from domestic sources. We started with our coalfields two centuries ago, and more recently used our North Sea oil and our gas. The trouble is that we have got used to the fact, and it is no longer the case. We are soon going to be very dependent on imports. While we can say that that is like other developed countries, it does not sit well with this island nation. As we all know, the big supplies of oil and gas are concentrated in some of the more volatile regions of the world. That does not give anybody in this country the sense of security that enables them to take risks. Business does not like volatile pricing in anything, it does not like unpredictability. If we do not have a secure source of supply, business will face that unpredictability and instability of pricing for a long time to come. The average man and woman in the street will then feel seriously insecure, which does not make for a happy country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07071266000598"></a>Meanwhile, global demand for energy is increasing massively as economies such as China have boomed. China has now overtaken France and the United Kingdom. She is the fourth-largest economy and has Germany in her sights. China is already the world&#146;s second-largest consumer of energy. Her demand for energy is increasing at a rate of 15 per cent every year and new power stations are being built every week. World prices for fossil fuels have increased by more than 50 per cent in the past three years. High prices impact on the vulnerable in this country as well as business and other users. Not only does that make the vulnerable even more so, the whole dimension feeds through to overall inflation, which impacts on the cost of money, which impacts on everybody.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07071266000599"></a>As if that were not enough, on top of that there is the need to decarbonise the world&#146;s economies. Not one nation on this, the only planet that we have, can in any way exclude itself from that project. The need to wean ourselves off fossil fuels or find a way of storing the carbon emissions that they cause is of paramount importance. It is vital. Temperatures are rising. Sea levels are rising. Extreme and dangerous weather is becoming more common around the world. The way that we currently produce and use energy is, frankly, largely responsible.</p>

I regard it as a privilege to be able to move the Second Reading of this Bill, which was taken through another place with such determination and skill by my honourable friend Nick Hurd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07071266000603"></a>I start by congratulating all those who have worked together to get the Bill this far. First, its main architect was Ron Bailey of the campaigning organisation Local Works. Secondly, it had widespread cross-party support, with more than 400 Members of Parliament, including more than half of the Parliamentary Labour Party, signing Early-Day Motions in favour of such action. Many national organisations have already spoken out in support. Let me quickly mention just a few: the Local Government Association, nearly 1,000 parish councillors and their umbrella organisation, NALCO, the Countryside Alliance, the CLA, NCVO, Age Concern, Help the Aged, the Scouts and the British Youth Council.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07071266000604"></a>Perhaps I should first declare my interest as the chairman of Marlesford Parish Council, president of the Suffolk Preservation Society and a vice-president of CPRE. I have been concerned with the sustainability of rural England and Wales for many years, having served during the 1980s and 1990s on the Countryside Commission for 12 years and the Rural Development Commission for eight years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07071266000605"></a>The campaign started as a result of <I>Ghost Town Britain</I>, a study by the New Economics Foundation which charted the decline of local shops, post offices,  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1565"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pubs, services and communities. The report demonstrates social exclusion, in particular. Many other reports have backed it up: <I>High Street Britain 2015</I>, published by the All-Party Parliamentary Small Shops Group and <I>Stamped Out</I>, by Age Concern, to name but two.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07071266000606"></a>I am sorry to say that during the past 10 years, rural areas in this country have felt neglected and ignored. There were real signs that that was changing with the arrival of Mr Miliband at Defra, and especially with the arrival of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who is so very respected in this House. I am reasonably confident that Mr Hilary Benn, who has taken over from Mr Miliband, will continue the new tradition.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07071266000607"></a>The Bill offers the Government the chance of a real shift of influence from the centre to the grass roots, so I am very glad that the Government are endorsing the Bill. That was the starting point. Then the campaign had to take a view on what we were seeking to achieve in place of ghost town Britain. The answer must be sustainable communities. Bearing in mind our starting point, that clearly meant the reversal of the decline in local economies, services and communities highlighted in the reports that I mentioned. But sustainable, healthy communities should also be environmentally sustainable. They should be inclusive and encourage citizen participation; otherwise they will not be sustainable as communities. Hence, the four limbs were: promoting local economic activity, the environment, social inclusion, and citizen involvement. What is certain is that this problem will continue unless action is taken to stop it.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07071266000608"></a>Let me give a real example: supermarkets in rural areas. There have been individual campaigns against supermarkets and their effects on communities and some have been successful. By way of illustration I will tell your Lordships about a campaign in Suffolk to prevent Tesco from opening another superstore in rural countryside near Saxmundham only 12 miles from the Tesco superstore which already existed at Martlesham. It was led by Caroline Cranbrook who has done so much nationally to encourage the sale of locally produced food. Lady Cranbrook interviewed 81 local shops, most of which would have closed if the supermarket had been built. The Suffolk Coastal District Council looked at the retailing need and refused Tesco planning permission. The company appealed and then withdrew in the middle of the appeal. Meanwhile, Paul Thomas, who previously ran a pub in London, opened a farm caf&#233; in Marlesford entirely based on local food, including fish from the local coastal waters, which has won national acclaim for some of the best meals in such establishments. I hope some of your Lordships may visit it.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07071266000609"></a>The overall picture, however, is of the trends of ghost town Britain increasing and that evidence is overwhelming. Local authorities and local communities can and should play an important role in promoting the sustainability of local communities but the problem is so serious that government cannot leave it to individuals, communities or even local authorities. There are ways in which government can help&#151;I emphasise the word &#147;help&#148;, not &#147;dictate&#148;&#151;to stop and reverse the problems. There are things that only government can do, as well as things they should do, as well as ways in which

Those government actions must not be ad hoc or done on a whim; they must be properly thought out and co-ordinated.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07071266000610"></a>So do we act top-down or bottom-up? The campaign&#146;s oft-stated view is that councils and communities are the experts in their own problems and the solutions are for them and not for Whitehall. The Prime Minister and the previous Prime Minister seem to agree. Mr Blair said in his party conference speech last year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07071266000748"></a>&#147;People want power in their own hands ... and won&#146;t accept a service handed down from on high. They want to shape it to their needs, and the reality of their lives&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000721"></a>As our present Prime Minister said just a year ago:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07071266000749"></a>&#147;Just as in the last century governments had to take power from vested interests in the interests of communities, in the new century people and communities should now take power from the state and that means ... I want a radical shift of power from the centre&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000722"></a>Mr Phil Woolas, the Minister who took the Bill through the Commons, said in his brief to the PLP on 26 March this year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07071266000750"></a>&#147;We firmly believe that it is for local people and their elected representatives to determine how best to ensure that their community is sustainable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000723"></a>If the Government believe that, they will trust local people and their councils who must now get into the driving seat.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07071266000611"></a>Let me explain clause by clause how the Bill will work. Clause 1 concerns the sustainability of local communities. It defines the principal aim of the Bill, which is to promote that sustainability. Promoting the sustainability of local communities is defined as encouraging the improvement of the economic, social and environmental well-being of a local authority, or part of its area. Subsection (4) clearly states that it is the duty of Government to assist local authorities to achieve this. It recognises that local authorities need help in achieving local sustainability but do not want more imposed duties from central government.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07071266000612"></a>Clause 2 requires the Government to approach all local councils and invite them to put forward suggestions on how to improve the sustainability of their communities. In making suggestions, local authorities must have regard to 13 different matters in the schedule to the Bill that have been selected by tens of thousands of people as important for local sustainability. In the Bill, local councils mean county councils, district councils and London borough councils. In some ways, I regret that they do not mean parish councils, which are the real grass roots of local government. However, I recognise that already more than 400 councils would be consulted, and good local authorities do in general consult parish councils on many matters, particularly planning applications. I am therefore confident that, under the terms of the Bill, parish councils will be able to make effective representations on matters that affect their communities.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07071266000613"></a>Clause 2(2) and (3) enable local councils to request a transfer of functions from one person or body to another to promote local sustainability. This will allow local authorities to identify existing sources of money for local matters, to propose how that money  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1567"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1567</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be spent differently, and, if they so choose, how it could be used to switch resources to what local people find more important. If a particular road in a local authority area is managed by the Highways Agency and the local authority believes, on the ground of improved sustainability as laid out in the schedule, that it could manage it better, it could request from the Secretary of State a transfer function from the Highways Agency to the local authority.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07071266000614"></a>Clause 3 deals with how local authorities&#146; proposals will be dealt with and presented to government, and with the process by which government decide which proposals to action. It requires the Secretary of State to appoint a person known as the selector, who will act as a representative on behalf of local authorities. The selector&#146;s role will be to consider all the proposals made by the various local authorities under Clause 2, and to work in co-operation with the Secretary of State to put them into a shortlist. Having someone to act on behalf of local authorities is clearly simpler than the Government themselves having to co-operate with 400-plus local authorities on a case-by-case basis. There was general agreement in another place that the selector would be the Local Government Association. Once the shortlist is presented to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State must decide which proposals to implement from the shortlist and, in so doing, must work with the selector to try to reach agreement. The presumption here is on the implementation of local community and council proposals.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07071266000615"></a>The duty to co-operate in subsection (1) and the necessity not only to consult but to try to reach agreement is a new and vital part of legislation. Its purpose is to ensure that there are genuine attempts to reach agreement. That goes much further than consultation often does when the consulter has to show only that suggestions were considered. The selector must represent the interests of local authorities. As I said, it is envisaged that this will be the Local Government Association, which has already been approached and has agreed in principle to carry out this function.</p>

<a name="70712-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07071266000616"></a>Clause 4 requires the Government to publish their decisions on the proposals in the shortlist in Clause 3, giving reasons why each proposal has been accepted or rejected. All proposals that the Government have decided to implement must be published in an action plan, with each proposal accompanied by a statement of action stating how the Government intend to implement it. The clause therefore sets out the national framework to be implemented by government to help to improve the sustainability of local communities, with the contents of the plan and subsequent government action being driven from the grass roots. The requirement to publish an explanation of the decisions taken on which proposals to implement or reject introduces transparency and accountability into the process. This is further enhanced by subsection (4), in which the Government have a duty to report every year to Parliament on the progress being made in implementing the proposals in the action plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07071266000617"></a>Clause 5 requires the Government to implement a set of regulations that must be followed in regard to approaching councils for proposals on improving local sustainability and in drawing up a shortlist of those  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1568"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1568</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposals as defined in Clauses 2 and 3. Subsections (1) and (2) deal with the requirement for the Government to publish such regulations and in so doing to consult the selector and any other bodies that represent local authorities in drawing up the regulations. Subsection (3) suggests guidance on what the regulations may contain surrounding the procedures that local authorities should take prior to making proposals and the procedures that the selector must follow in drawing up a shortlist and reporting to the Government. The most important part of the clause is in subsections (4) and (5), which state that the regulations must contain a duty on local authorities to involve all sections of society and to obtain their views and to try to reach agreement on proposals to improve local sustainability prior to submitting their report on proposals to the selector. That ensures that the process is truly devolutionary, capturing the ideas and the suggestions of local people. Subsection (4) will try to achieve that by a mechanism of local citizens&#146; panels to consult and try to reach agreement on any proposal put forward.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07071266000618"></a>Clause 6 requires the Government or the person they see fit to appoint to provide local spending reports that give a detailed breakdown of all the money spent by the Government and their agencies in local government areas. The purpose of the clause is simply to open up the books and for the first time enable both local authorities and communities to have a clear picture of how government money is spent in their area. That will enable greater transparency and accountability at the local level and also enable councils to identify areas where a transfer of function in Clause 2 would be most appropriate in promoting local sustainability. Prior to the production of any local spending reports the Government must first consult any persons or bodies that are likely to be affected by the compiling of the reports.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07071266000619"></a>Clause 7 deals with sustainable community strategy. For the purposes of standardising all legislation that deals with local communities and sustainability, this clause enables the Government to amend current and any possible future legislation that makes reference to a term &#147;community strategy&#148; so that it can be amended to be &#147;sustainable community strategy&#148;.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07071266000620"></a>Clause 9 provides for money to be made available from Parliament for the Government to fulfil their obligations under the Bill. Clause 10 sets out the Short Title. The Act will be known as the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. It also defines the geographical and political extent of the Act. The Act does not extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland for the obvious reason that for a Bill that so clearly proposes the devolution of power it would be inappropriate to extend that to Scotland and Northern Ireland, which already have their devolved rights.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07071266000621"></a>I am glad that the Bill so closely follows the Prime Minister&#146;s approach. I note that his consultation paper, <I>The Governance of Britain</I>, published only last week, says:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000724"></a>I entirely agree with that and I suggest that the Bill is based on a philosophy that is now accepted by the three main political parties in Britain. The Bill may

I also congratulate the Local Works campaign on the sterling job that is has done not only on producing the legislation but on the campaign that led up to it. When I first read the Bill I was concerned that it might be rather technocratic and wondered whether people in communities would get behind it and understand what we are seeking to achieve. However, I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of local meetings across the country, the attendance at the rally here and the wide range of interest groups that have put their weight behind the Bill. I am glad that my initial misgivings were proved wrong. We on these Benches certainly give the Bill our wholehearted support.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07071266000624"></a>The fact that there are sometimes successful campaigns against the closure or the opening of a supermarket should not cloud the fact that one of the fundamental problems facing society is a sense of powerlessness. People feel that decisions about their lives are taken in a way that they do not understand or have no opportunity to influence. People feel a huge sense of frustration when time and again they come up against a system that provides no accountability or recourse and when they cannot voice their concerns with confidence that someone will listen and take them on board.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07071266000625"></a>We support the Bill because it puts people first and gives them a bigger say in what happens. It does so in three ways. First, it helps to identify and tackle community decline, promoting greater social, economic and environmental sustainability in communities. Secondly, it actively encourages participation by communities in the decisions affecting them. Finally, it provides accountability in areas where there has previously not been enough democratic accountability.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07071266000626"></a>I particularly welcome the fact that the Bill helps to provide a framework within which groups that do not always have the strongest voice can make their voices heard. Too often it is a minority of very loud people in a community who get their way, rather than the majority, who find it difficult to fight their way through the system. The Bill&#146;s potential merit is its holistic approach to community involvement. Closures of schools, post offices and family farms are part of an interrelated package. Campaigns against the loss of services such as a village school, for example, are often not formed exclusively of the immediate beneficiaries of the service. Even when people do not have children in the local primary school, it is evident that if the demographics of the area change, then the shop could close, public

All such changes have a knock-on effect. A Bill that actively promotes participation by the whole community by helping them to identify problems and to do something about them can be only welcomed.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07071266000627"></a>The Bill&#146;s important aspect, particularly as it relates to the local government Bill going through your Lordships&#146; House at the moment, is that it puts the duty on central government to help local areas, whereas the local government Bill is very much about how local councils have to adhere to the policies and practices put forward by central government. There is a tendency among central governments of all kinds to adhere to one-size-fits-all and not always to understand that, although there are times when a policy may well have the effect which they desire in one area, the law of unintended consequences will always kicks in and result in things going badly wrong somewhere else.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07071266000628"></a>Local spending reports are one of the most important parts of the Bill . At present there is no sense of relative priorities in areas&#151;funding streams are split up and managed in different ways; some are more or less accountable. People very rarely have the chance to say, &#147;What would my priorities be for my area? If I could put all this together and think about how the money is spent, how would I do it?&#148;. If the information in the local spending reports helps to provide them with the information to do that, that can only be welcomed.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07071266000629"></a>The Bill is about empowering local communities and complementing and extending what the Government were intending to do in their White Paper. It is about supporting communities. Communities are something that we all feel passionately about, whether in terms of the environment, social exclusion or the economy. There are hundreds and thousands of people who are passionate about their communities and who want their services restored and extended, but they have not had a chance to have their voices heard. That is what the Bill is about and that is why we shall support it from these Benches.</p>

I declare a personal interest which has a tincture of family pride. I know that there are other families&#151;at least two&#151;who can boast, as we can, of four generations in direct descent serving in another place, but I think that it is rare for a new Member of Parliament to steer a Private Member&#146;s Bill through all its stages in the Commons in this way.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07071266000631"></a>This Bill fits into the pattern of localism which, as my noble friend says, now runs through the thinking of all our political parties. The Government has announced, as the noble Baroness has just reminded us, plans for giving local people greater say over local government spending. However, this is a complementary  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1571"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1571</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concept which fits neatly into the general puzzle by proposing to give local people greater knowledge through the local spending reports and greater say in stimulating and guiding spending in their locality, including spending by central government.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07071266000632"></a>I would like to make two general points about this movement towards localism. I hope that the Government are gradually weaning themselves away from identifying localism with regions, and I hope that the definitions in the Bill may help them in this direction. I know the bureaucratic attractiveness of thinking in terms of regions, and I know the European dimension. However, in most of England, regions are still an artificial concept and will remain one, achieving neither recognition nor loyalty. They do not act as the stimulus for local energy, which is what this Bill and many other efforts are about.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07071266000633"></a>Secondly, we need to accept a consequence&#151;that greater local knowledge and influence over what happens, and how money is spent, will lead to a greater variety of practice and priorities. The fact that people receive different levels of service in different areas depending on where they live will in the end no longer be regarded as a reproach&#151;a postcode reproach&#151;but as a justifiable fact, a necessary consequence of greater local democracy and a necessary incentive to experiment.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07071266000634"></a>Having been Home Secretary and therefore in charge of perhaps the most naturally centralising of government departments, I have come to believe that experiment&#151;and that means local experiment&#151;is crucial. One consequence of this Bill may be increased local experiment in sector after sector. My caveat&#151;a caveat that we must all have&#151;is that this needs to be within a commitment to the values and integrity of one British nation, a commitment to values that must exist regardless of ethnic background or origin.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07071266000635"></a>We all recognise and lament the fact that our democracy is going through an apathetic stage. However, there are reserves of enthusiasm and interest which derive not from our activities in this Palace but from the interest that both speakers have stressed&#151;an interest which naturally exists locally, for local thinking, local initiative and local decisions. Harnessing that interest&#151;which to some extent is still dormant&#151;to the cause of our general democracy is not just a good cause, it is an essential one.</p>

It will come as no surprise to noble Lords to learn that I support this Bill from the perspective of rural settlements, although I realise that it applies equally to urban communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07071266000637"></a>The first aspect that pleases me about the Bill is that it defines sustainability as promoting the economic, social and environmental well-being of an area. All too often, sustainable development is assumed to be an environmental agenda which should take precedence over everything else, whereas in reality a sustainable community is one where family and friends support  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1572"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1572</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>each other, where jobs are available, where there is a mix of housing&#151;and if we are extremely lucky, even an availability of housing. There should be a range of services available and a sufficient mix of people to sustain them, and there should be community activities of all sorts, ranging from a football club to whist drives to work with charities and even people who just make donations to the local youth club. It should be somewhere in which people are generally prepared to come together to give something to their community.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07071266000638"></a>I probably could have declared an interest as a former chairman of the Countryside Agency, if being a former chairman of anything is reckoned to be an interest. I should say that the agency took a keen interest in and was a strong supporter of the rural sustainable development agenda. We tried to use the countryside to promote businesses there and to lift people&#146;s lives. Above all, we tried to promote anything that encouraged community sustainability. We supported all sorts of community activities with grants. Quite often they were small payments, and we sought to make the application process a simple one. We devised and administered the local heritage initiative, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. We helped hundreds of communities create their own village greens using the New Opportunities Fund, and we had our own village grant scheme to help anyone do almost anything that brought people together. Actually, it was not quite as loose as that, but there is no doubt that the scheme was as much about promoting community working as it was about implementing the various projects being proposed. Creating pride of place within a community was very important to us.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07071266000639"></a>I remember being heartened by the report of a schoolgirl from a very deprived and run-down former coal-mining village in County Durham. When asked why she was supporting a particular project that we were promoting, she said that she had been involved the year before in a school project to write a history of the parish, which we had also helped. She said, &#147;I used to think that my village was&#148;&#151;and here she used a rather unparliamentary word which stems from a well-known firm of plumbers called Thomas Crapper and Company&#151;&#147;but now I know it is not&#148;. I thought, &#147;Great. You beauty, that is exactly what it is all about&#148;. Her new pride of place led her to contribute to village life, and therefore we had been successful. It meant that she might not want to leave the village the moment she finished school, and that if she did leave she would be prepared to come back and start a family there, thus making a contribution. In that case, we had definitely achieved something.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07071266000640"></a>Alongside these very small incentives for parish activity and innovative pilot schemes to help promote the delivery of local services by having joint outlets, mobile post offices and so on, we tried to encourage both market towns and parishes to think about what they wanted. They were to draw up plans to work out what they wanted their parish or town to be like in 10, 15 or 20 years&#146; time. Did they want a pub, a village school or a village shop, and what would they have to do to encourage that to happen, or to ensure that their public and private services survived? What mix of community did they want? Did they need some affordable housing&#151;the answer to that question was  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1573"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1573</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>almost always yes. We also ran training courses for parish councillors so that they could implement their plans. All that is now dead and gone, but this Bill incorporates the principles of our agenda, and for that reason I strongly support it.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07071266000641"></a>I was sorry to see that the earlier intention of giving more direct control to parish councils got squeezed out in the Bill&#146;s passage through the other place, and that it is now the principal councils that have control. However, I am glad that they are specifically obliged to have regard to parish plans. One of the biggest bugbears of parish councils is that, having gone through the often rigorous process of devising a parish plan, they then find that no one in authority pays any attention to it. As your Lordships will be aware, parish councils have all too little control over the future of their community, either in terms of planning decisions or meaningful spending powers. Anything Parliament can do to help in that respect is most welcome.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07071266000642"></a>My own town of Ilminster in Somerset, for example, is furious that it appears to be in the process of almost being destroyed by a series of planning decisions that neither the town council, nor the chamber of commerce, was able to prevent. We should bear in mind that this town, in the old days, used to be its own urban district council. Unlike the town in Suffolk mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, a very large Tesco store is being built in our town, despite the fact that there is a Tesco only six or so miles away. To give Tesco its due, it wanted to put the store on the rural side of the town car park but the planners insisted that, for environmental reasons&#151;this is why, all too often, sustainability and the environment get muddled up&#151;it had to put the store in the town car park, which has now been moved to the outskirts of the town. Soon, anyone coming to shop in Ilminster will have to walk past the new Tesco to get to our shops&#151;if they can be bothered; some of the shops are now nearly half a mile away. The situation has been made worse by making one of the main roads into the town a one-way street running out of town, so that most people parking and shopping have to go literally all round the houses to get home.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07071266000643"></a>The decisions have not been easy. I highlight the problems of Ilminster only because there is no doubt that the concerns of the town were never properly heeded throughout the process. Residents now feel completely disillusioned with our local democracy and the planning system. I sincerely hope that this Bill will ameliorate that situation in future.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07071266000644"></a>I hope that the Bill will have an easy passage through this House and that, if anything, more power will be given to parish councils to control their own future, rather than leaving it to the principal councils to dribble down favours that they might think the parishes should be allowed. I do not quite understand whether the local spending reports can now go down as low as to parish level, or whether they only apply to the principal council areas as a whole. Perhaps the Minister or the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, could respond to that. I believe that, with the possible formation of more unitary authorities, it will be particularly important for parishes to be able to grasp their own futures. I guess that it will all depend on the signals

So, in spite of some very minor misgivings, I strongly endorse this Bill.</p>

<a name="07071266000645"></a><b><a name="70712-0011.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071266000988"></a>Lord Bruce-Lockhart:</b> My Lords, first, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, and those in another place, who have brought the Bill forward. Having said that, in many ways I am dismayed that the Bill is necessary. That is a reflection of the imbalance of power in England between an increasingly centralised state on the one hand and, on the other, local people, local organisations and their local authorities. Of course, the Government must be able to set their own national priorities. In the local government White Paper, we have seen the emphasis on just 30 national outcomes; and that is right. But local authorities should be able to pick those up and drive them forward in the way they think fit. I accept also that local authorities must themselves devolve&#151;to community organisations, social enterprise and individuals. I support the noble Lord, Lord Cameron. Devolving to parish councils is extremely important.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07071266000646"></a>However, the Bill would not be necessary in most of the other major democracies in the world. Devolution took place in France some 15 years ago. In the United States local authorities have responsibility for health, police and economic development. Tony Travers, professor at the London School of Economics, pointed out this week that England is now at the bottom of the list of OECD countries for the percentage of taxation raised and spent locally by local authorities.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07071266000647"></a>We have been over these arguments a hundred times. In my last three years as chairman of the Local Government Association, I have discussed these issues probably once a week with the department responsible for local government. We all agree on the need for a devolutionary agenda, but I am dismayed that the action has not matched the rhetoric. We have agreed at all the meetings that the UK Government are now unique in the high degree of central control they exert over public services and local government in England. The Secretary of State talked about a new era, a tipping point of devolution. We all agree that this high degree of central control is holding back improvements in public services and in economic prosperity. We have agreed that it is wasting public money; I refer to the report to the Treasury by Sir Peter Gershon. It is holding back local choice. It is simply denying the ability of local democratic representatives to assess local need, to make local choices and to respond to those choices. It is also denying and eroding democracy itself.</p>

<a name="70712-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07071266000648"></a>The Local Government Association argued that there is a crisis of trust. Out on the street, both central and local government are simply not relevant to so many people&#146;s lives. It is not a question of apathy as is sometimes said across Westminster and Whitehall. People are not apathetic. They care deeply about the issues that affect their everyday lives, but they are frustrated by a remote and unreachable Government. Therefore, we have to take government closer to people&#146;s lives. In the absence of other devolution, the Bill will enable that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07071266000649"></a>In meetings with the Treasury and the DCLG we have also agreed that there is a real need to boost economic prosperity. I have argued previously in your Lordships&#146; House that statements from the Treasury in the devolved decision-making report show that our great cities of England have just half the GDP per head of their European counterparts. The report states that one of the reasons for that is that those European cities enjoy far stronger devolved political autonomy. Therefore, the Bill will enable local authorities to put forward proposals for the devolution of those key powers&#151;those key economic levers in planning and transport, in skills and economic development and in housing. However, I was dismayed that in the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement on the governance of Britain the only point made about housing&#151;an issue made so much of, with lots of talk of devolution&#151;is that there will be a new central homes agency. In France, Germany and Switzerland housing supply matches demand, yet in this country housing is being built at half the rate that it was in the 1970s. Therefore, we need to allow local authorities, local people and local businesses to take charge of housing targets and development, as they do in France, Germany and Switzerland where the system works so much better.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07071266000650"></a>I hope that the Bill will allow local authorities to take responsibility and powers away from the centralising agencies which are now proposed. We have heard statements about devolution and yet there seems to be a strengthening of the regional layer, which has simply sucked up powers from local authorities and local people. Those powers have not been devolved from the centre. I hope that the Bill will enable that devolution to happen.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07071266000651"></a>I am mystified that the Prime Minister should have made the following statement last September when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, although I think that it is absolutely right. I quoted this statement in the <I>Official </I><I>Report</I> in June. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07071266000752"></a>&#147;It is right that local councils, not Whitehall, should have more power over the things that matter to their community, and from economic regeneration to public transport, the empowerment and strengthening of local councils and local communities is what we must now do&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000725"></a>Yet nowhere do I see this process, except in the Bill before us. Therefore, I support it very strongly. The Local Government Association, of which I am no longer chairman, has agreed to act as a selector&#151;in a sense as a filter. I am dismayed that that is needed but it has offered to do that.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07071266000652"></a>As regards local authorities proposing initiatives on social, economic, environmental and sustainability issues, and on what local people want, I should be grateful for clarification that when functions are devolved, the powers, resources and money that were held by the original agencies and the freedom and flexibility to respond to local issues will also be devolved.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07071266000653"></a>In conclusion, I strongly support the Bill, but, after so much talk about devolution and the many meetings that I have attended, it is disappointing that such a Bill is necessary.</p>

It is quite an achievement to get a Private Member&#146;s Bill through both Houses. I managed to do it with the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Bill and I know the nightmares that are faced by all parties, including the Government, at every stage. That occurred at a time when certain Members of the other place were still alive and making life even more difficult than is the case now.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07071266000655"></a>I am particularly keen on a Bill that has &#147;sustainability&#148; in its Title. When I held my party&#146;s brief for overseas development under the ODA, as it then was, I discovered that the Government would try to strike out any amendment which used the word &#147;sustainable&#148; because it had connotations of unaffordability. You never knew exactly how much it would cost, as sustainability lasts for ever.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07071266000656"></a>This Bill is supported on all sides of the House. Therefore, unless somebody appears from nowhere, the only people who can kill it are the Government. I very much hope that they will not table amendments to the Bill. Amendments were made in the Commons. I very much hope that they will support the Bill in its present form. I think that without amendments the Bill&#151;which, as everybody has acknowledged, is a great idea&#151;will go through. However, the real reason I support the Bill is its underlying bottom-up basis. It comes from local power for local people, based around the three criteria of social, economic and environmental issues.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07071266000657"></a>I live in two places: a small village in Northumberland and Tufnell Park in north London. I found it interesting that I originally thought of Northumberland, where we have the problem of the local shop closing down and elderly people having to move out of the village, because if you have no car you are stuck. Local transport has disappeared, and with the post office and the local shop closing down went the local newspapers. It is a very difficult situation. However, I was particularly taken when I listened to one of the advocates of the Bill, Mr Ron Bailey, on Radio 4, who was talking about this in terms of town and city landscapes. Cities have exactly the same problem, as a city is just a vast number of local communities together. Those local communities can often be destroyed by large supermarkets in the area, which suck out all the local shops even in the high street. You end up with areas which a few years ago were very vibrant now being dead zones with faceless shops or with none of the local character and none of the local community that was once associated with them.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07071266000658"></a>This will be a difficult Bill to implement, but I hope that the Local Government Association, acting as the selectors&#151;although that has not been set out in the Bill&#151;will publicise the fact that local decision-making means that people do not have to accept decisions from on high. The planning process always gives the impression that it is something that people cannot stop and because the rules allow it, it has to take place. That should not be the case. Local communities know what they want and what they do  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1577"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1577</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not want, and if they do not want a certain supermarket or another development in their area, it should be up to that local community. It enhances a local community to have a local campaign on an issue. Everyone will know that the one way to meet your neighbours in London is set up an organisation such as a neighbourhood watch, which allows you to meet people who live in your street. On that basis, I very much support the Bill, and I hope that the Government will support it wholeheartedly.</p>

The Bill is remarkable in many ways since, as we understand it, it now has all-party support, which is unusual in any dimension. One other unusual thing has happened today, which is worth putting on the record: a Member on these Benches was able to praise the work of his son, who was standing at the Bar. It is very nice to see Nick Hurd, who has steered the Bill through the other place, and to have heard his father, who I suspect is quite proud, speak from these Benches.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07071266000660"></a>The Bill has come about thanks to&#151;we may claim credit on this side&#151;the efforts of the Conservative Party working with Local Works and campaigning for stronger local democracy. We have heard from every speaker today about the importance of local democracy. Perhaps if it had come a bit sooner, it could have replaced swathes of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which we are trundling through at the moment, particularly the area that we were dealing with yesterday, which related to parish councils. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, drew attention to the importance of parish councils in their work and in the fact that they represent so closely people in rural communities.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07071266000661"></a>The Bill embodies the response to widespread public concern about the decline of rural communities. As others have said, it follows on from the loss of key services from local post offices, banks and community shops, and from widespread concerns that, despite government assurances, an assault on the countryside for the development of even more housing will impact further on those local communities, without them having any way of influencing the outcome. We already know that there has been a big impact on the green belt, despite what the Prime Minister said. In the past 10 years, more than 16,000 houses have been built on new green-belt land.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07071266000662"></a>It is important that the Bill&#146;s effect is to give local communities a real say over future developments. It will deal with the sort of matters raised by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, about the supermarket being put in the wrong place, so sucking up, as it is there, not only the annoyance of local residents but the trade that could come from others.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07071266000663"></a>In light of the Prime Minister&#146;s plans announced yesterday that housebuilding will be at the top of the agenda, I take this opportunity to say that those plans should not be implemented without the inclusion and approval of local communities, which after all is what  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1578"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1578</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill is about. The very first test of whether this Bill is successful will be that, where large housing developments&#151;or even small ones&#151;are planned to deal with our big housing problem, local communities will be properly involved in the schemes and will not be ignored when they say that there is a flood plain that has been there for ever, which no one has built on for 500 years for the good reason that they will get flooded out if they do so. That is the sort of local knowledge that we should be paying attention to.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07071266000664"></a>An interesting aspect of the Bill is that the proposals being put forward by local government for consideration will have to be filleted&#151;if I can put it like that&#151;by a selector. I very much hope that, as the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, said, the Local Government Association&#146;s involvement will make that an easy process. It is extremely important that the LGA is seen to be as impartial as possible and that there are proper criteria about which people cannot argue. The local criteria have to be agreed with local government in advance.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07071266000665"></a>I hope that the Bill will revitalise the relationship between central and local government. That relationship needs revitalising and the apathy that has been talked about needs to be dispelled. I again agree with my noble friend Lord Bruce-Lockhart that much of it is not apathy at all, but sheer frustration. People are kicking the boxes beneath their feet because they think that they cannot and will not succeed whatever they say. If this Bill opens up the opportunity for local people to be considered and have their voice heard, it will have done a really good job.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07071266000666"></a>The Bill is long overdue. I know that it has been given a fair wind in the other place. We understand that no amendments will be tabled, so there need be no further stages of the Bill and it can pass today&#151;rather, it can have Royal Assent quite soon. However, there are three things that I wish the Minister would clarify, because they are not explicit in the Bill.</p>

<a name="07071266000672"></a><b><a name="70712-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071266000995"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> My Lords, I am delighted to speak on behalf of the Government to support the Sustainable Communities Bill. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, on bringing forward the Bill, and I add my congratulations to those of the noble Lord, Lord Hurd of Westwell, to the honourable Member for Ruislip Northwood. It is an achievement for a Member of another place to bring a Bill forward so successfully, achieve such a high level of cross-party support and find a Minister in the House of Lords speaking in support of a Private Member&#146;s Bill.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07071266000673"></a>The Government believe the Bill can help in our efforts to engage and empower communities, strengthen local democracy and devolve real power to local authorities, their local partners and their residents. The Government have always supported the main aspiration of the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is to promote the sustainability of local communities. Indeed, the Government can claim to be the original author of the concept of &#147;sustainable communities&#148;. <I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I><I> - t</I><I>he Local Government White Paper</I> contains a powerful set of measures which give local people and local communities more power to influence their lives.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07071266000674"></a>I am sure that we all accept that the Bill, as it was introduced to Parliament, was, as its sponsor put it, &#147;honest but imperfect&#148;. While we supported the Bill&#146;s main aspiration, we felt that in operation it would, or could, have been impractical. We were therefore pleased to work very closely over several months with the honourable Member for Ruislip Northwood and the Bill&#146;s other sponsors, including my honourable friend David Drew MP, Julia Goldsworthy MP, and Local Works who have done so much over a number of years to bring the Bill to this stage. Our objective throughout was to strengthen the Bill so that it could be used in a positive and constructive way while ensuring that it dovetailed with government policy and its backers&#146; aspirations. We believe that that has been achieved and that the Bill which is now before the House of Lords is substantially improved from the Bill that entered the Commons.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07071266000675"></a>There are two elements of the Bill that I shall highlight today as substantial steps forward in moving power from the centre to local communities. We have had an interesting and important debate today, and we had it in the context of the local government Bill that is in Committee. The first aspect is that we have strengthened the dialogue between central and local government. Under the Sustainable Communities Bill, there will be a formal channel through which ideas that come from communities can be presented to central government through a body that represents democratically elected councils; namely, the Local Government Association. Central government will be required to co-operate with that body in drawing up a shortlist of proposals to consider. That will enable the role of the LGA and the existing central local partnership to be strengthened. The Government welcome that.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07071266000676"></a>The second aspect of the Bill that I shall highlight is that it provides a mechanism&#151;local spending reports, to which noble Lords have already referred&#151;that for the first time will map the public funding which goes  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1580"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1580</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into each local authority area. We believe that this resource mapping will strengthen local democracy and enhance the operation of the new local area agreements by ensuring that there is greater accountability and transparency in funding. Many noble Lords referred to the importance of this aspect, and I echo their comments. It will enable local authorities, their partners and communities to take better informed decisions about the priorities that they choose to pursue to promote the sustainability of their local community.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07071266000677"></a>The Government have a strong and successful track record in this area. They have already brought forward a series of powerful measures to promote sustainable communities. For example, the Local Government Act 2000 gives local authorities broader power to do anything that they consider is likely to achieve the promotion or improvement of the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area. There is much more that local authorities could do to make the most of that power.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07071266000678"></a>The same Local Government Act also requires local authorities, in consultation with their local partners,<I></I>to prepare a community strategy for their area that has sustainable development at its heart. The Government have taken the opportunity presented by the Sustainable Communities Bill to rename these strategies in statute as &#147;sustainable community strategies&#148;. That reflects their core importance in promoting the sustainability of local communities.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07071266000679"></a>Although the Delegated Powers Committee has identified an issue here, we have thought very carefully about it and weighed up the importance of giving the Bill a fair wind. In the light of that, we are prepared to indicate clearly that we will not bring forward amendments to the Bill.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07071266000680"></a><I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I>,<I></I>the local government White Paper,<I></I>and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill contain a series of powerful measures. Our intention is to devolve and decentralise, to strengthen local democracy and community governance and to give people a real say in how their communities are run. Devolving power to communities and their locally elected representatives is the best way further to improve local services and promote the sustainability of local communities.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07071266000681"></a>I shall not go through the measures in the Bill because many of us in the Chamber are involved in the Committee stage of the local government Bill, on which we are having important discussions. However, devolving governance is just one of the ways in which we are strengthening resident and community involvement through our implementation of <I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I>. Another way is community empowerment, by which we mean giving confidence, skills and power to communities to influence what public bodies do for or with them. My right honourable friend Hazel Blears has championed that in particular.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07071266000682"></a>Our vision for empowerment is to allow local flexibility. Local authorities know best how to reach their citizens and communities and will want to adopt a range of different approaches to empowerment depending on their circumstances. We do not want to  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1581"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column 1581</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prescribe; we want to work with partners to build on what they know about effective practice and to encourage its use.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07071266000683"></a>This Government&#146;s view is that democracy should be about much more than casting a vote every few years. Local people know the needs of their area better than anyone. This Government are delivering a real shift in power to town halls and ensuring that town halls pass it on to local communities. At Second Reading of the local government Bill, I sensed a consensus that that Bill was very much about devolution. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, that the Prime Minister is very much behind this approach. He has spoken clearly this week of his vision for a,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000769"></a>&#147;reinvention of the way we govern&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000726"></a>promoting &#147;the active citizen&#148; and &#147;the empowered community&#148; and building &#147;open enabling government&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07071266000727"></a>It is equally clear that this will be one of the Prime Minister&#146;s main priorities. In recent weeks he has spoken of local democracy, strengthened by citizens&#146; forums and new citizens&#146; juries, where citizens and their representatives have had a chance to fully debate the concerns that matter to them. Last week he spoke of enhancing representative democracy by devolving more power directly to the people, and launched a debate on a series of specific proposals that would bring this about.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07071266000684"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, asked a specific question about the Bill. While it is not my role to answer on behalf of the mover of the Bill, I want to make a point from the Government&#146;s perspective about whether local spending reports go down to the parish level. In Clause 6(4) the area of the local spending report can be,</p>
<ul><a name="07071266000770"></a>&#147;one or more parts of a local authority area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071266000728"></a>We will consult as the Bill requires on the approach to be adopted.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07071266000685"></a>The time has come for the idea of sustainable communities. Our local government White Paper, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, and the Prime Minister&#146;s recent statements confirm the Government&#146;s commitment to devolution and community empowerment. The Sustainable Communities Bill clearly pushes in the same direction. I am confident that the Government support it taking forward. I confirm that the Government do not intend to amend the Bill and we look forward to continuing the work of the Bill&#146;s supporters and working with them to bring the aims of the Bill to fruition.</p>

<a name="70712-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07071266000686"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, was very kind to suggest that my right honourable friends Hilary Benn and Hazel Blears would be committed to taking forward the aspirations of this Bill. I believe that they will be. With that, I am delighted to confirm once more the Government&#146;s support for the Bill.</p>

As we all know, and I think people outside this House are beginning to realise, the House of Lords does not endorse, embrace or easily pass anything which is not good legislation. Therefore, the imprimatur of this House is of itself of importance and value.</p>

<a name="70712-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07071266000688"></a>I so agree with my neighbour the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, that this Bill will enable not just the loud voices to be heard. That ties in very much with the comment of my noble friend Lord Hurd that it will harness the dormant interest which exists. My noble friend referred to regions. The simple fact is, as we have all learnt now&#151;including certain leading politicians such as Mr Prescott&#151;that people of this country do not identify with regions. They identify with their towns, with their cities, with their counties and, above all, with their parishes. That is how people think. That matters enormously.</p>

<a name="70712-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07071266000689"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, made a particular reference to the need for parishes to be involved. Parishes will be involved because as soon as people think they can matter, they take action. We are back to the dormant interest. I thought it was interesting when my noble friend Lord Bruce-Lockhart referred to European towns often being more politically conscious in some ways. It is not a coincidence that leading French politicians, for example, however eminent, important and busy they are, very often regard the probably quite small commune of which they are the mayor as their grassroots and their powerbase. his matters a great deal if we go back to de Gaulle in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. For all the centralism in France, people there often closely identify with grassroots. I would not compare my sympathies to any politicians, but certainly regard the most important elected post that I ever held to be the chairman of my parish council.</p>

<a name="70712-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07071266000690"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, on this question of sustainability. Frankly, that is what it is all about. England would not be what it is today had our forefathers not sought to ensure its sustainability, protection and preservation, particularly in the rural areas.</p>

<a name="70712-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07071266000691"></a>My noble friend Lady Hanham talked about the LGA as an assessor. I hope that the LGA will be a satisfactory assessor, but the LGA is not in the Bill as an assessor. Presumably, if it did not perform properly steps could be taken to find somebody else who would do it better.</p>

<a name="70712-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07071266000692"></a>Finally, the Minister had a useful phrase, not quite a hostage to fortune but one that will be valuable to people who note it. She said that local people know the needs of their community better than anyone. That could be the motto of the Bill. I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000007"></a>Clause 8 [<I>Use and retention of information</I>]:</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071267000128"></a> Clause 8, page 5, line 41, after &#147;of&#148; insert &#147;biometric&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000009"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments intends to make it clear that the provisions in Clause 8 governing the use and destruction of information apply only to biometric information collected under the biometric registration provisions, rather than biographical information such as a person&#146;s name, address, reason for applying for leave and suchlike. The amendments also make it clear that the destruction provisions of the clause apply only to biometric information held by the Secretary of State. I shall address those two aspects in more detail.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000010"></a>Under Clause 8, the regulations must make provision about the use of biometric information. In addition, Clause 8(3)(a) and (b) provides for when both biometric and non-biometric information must be destroyed. The amendments will ensure that the provisions requiring destruction of the information in Clause 8 apply only to biometric information. Biometric information, we recognise, is of a more sensitive nature than biographical information. That is reflected in the previous immigration Acts. The existing immigration legislation has always expressly provided for when this type of information must be destroyed, and it is right that it should.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000011"></a>However, the type of biographical information which the Secretary of State will collect under these provisions is of a different nature. The Secretary of State  already requires individuals to provide biographical information&#151;such as name, address, reason for applying for leave and suchlike&#151;when a person makes an application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. That type of information is protected by current law. The Secretary of State always handles that information carefully and it is always subject to the safeguards of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act of the same year. One of the key principles of the Data Protection Act is that personal data must not be kept longer than is necessary for lawful purposes.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000012"></a>A person will have to provide the same type of non-biometric information when he or she applies for   


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a biometric immigration document, because the document will be the way in which the person is authorised to stay in the United Kingdom in future. As previously mentioned, it is likely that a single combined application form will be used for both the application for leave and the application for the biometric immigration document. Just as the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act provide robust protection for this type of information when the person applies for leave, those Acts will provide  the same high level of protection for the rights of the person when they apply for a biometric immigration document. We do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to make provision for the destruction of biographical information in Clause 8 in addition to the extensive protection provided by current law.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000013"></a>Let us look at the second element to the group. The amendments will also mean that the destruction provisions in Clause 8 will apply only to biometric data held by the Secretary of State. Where the Secretary of State shares information with a third party&#151;for example, the police&#151;the sharing of the data will be governed by the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. We also expect that third party to process the information in such a way as to protect the rights of the data subject, where that is provided for in data protection legislation. So, for example, when data are shared with the police for crime prevention purposes, the police are under their own obligation to comply with the Data Protection Act in how they handle and retain that information. They are also obliged to comply with the Human Rights Act, particularly the right to respect for private life. Accordingly, when the Secretary of State has lawfully shared information with, for example, the police, we think that the obligations which govern how the police use that information provide sufficient safeguards, without the need for the Secretary of State to be subject to a separate obligation under Clause 8 to ensure that the data passed to and therefore held by the police are destroyed. I beg to move.</p>

That has been revealed by such issues as the progress, or egress perhaps, of Muktar Ibrahim, the leader of the gang that brought fresh terror to our streets just a fortnight after bombs killed the 52 travellers in July two years ago.</p>

Muktar Ibrahim was able to leave the country to travel to Pakistan, having been stopped and questioned by Special Branch officers at Heathrow. They were acting on a request from MI5, which had followed a car in which Ibrahim was a passenger to the airport. He was allowed on his way, even though he aroused suspicion, because he had

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000016"></a>It also emerged that Hussain Osman, another of the convicted plotters who came to Britain in 1996, claiming to be a Somalian, was in fact an Ethiopian who had been living in Italy. When he came to the UK, when his Italian visa ran out and he claimed asylum, his application was turned down; but in 2004 he was given discretionary leave to remain. After his failed bomb attack on the underground, he fled to Italy, travelling unchallenged through the Waterloo Eurostar terminus despite the biggest manhunt in British history.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000017"></a>In the same week, we have seen reports that the head of Interpol has complained that the UK was failing to check visitors against a database of stolen passports. We appreciate that the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, told Sky News last Sunday that the Government were looking at the issue as a matter of urgency. They should be not only looking at the matter but doing something about it.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000018"></a>It behoves the Government to have dealt with those matters before they considered bringing forward this Bill. We shall continue to scrutinise the Bill with great care but we continue to be of the mind that a lot of its proposals will not provide the solution. I am sure that at Report we shall have to come back to some of the major issues about other ways in which to deal with these matters. In the mean time, we do not oppose the government amendments. I merely observe wryly that at this late stage they have sought to make what appear to be rather basic practical amendments.</p>

Mr Muktar Ibrahim, for example, would not be covered by the provisions in Clause 5(1), even if it had been enacted in time for his exit and re-entry into the United Kingdom.</p>

I am simply using them as a means of reflecting at the start of the third day out of five in Committee that there other methods by which to address this matter. If the Government had been minded earlier to accept proposals from the noble Lord&#146;s party as well as mine with regard to UK border police being established and a much better system of scrutinising passports, much of this Bill would not be required, including some of the provisions to which the noble Lord has much objection.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000022"></a>To return to the amendment moved by the Minister, we were grateful to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, for her letter of 22 June which explained, as the Minister did again this afternoon, that these amendments are intended to make it clear that Clause 8 applies to the use, retention and destruction of biometric information obtained through regulations made under Clause 5(1) and not to the non-biometric information, which, as the Minister has already explained, is already covered by the Data Protection and Human Rights Acts. In her letter, the noble and learned Baroness added that, subject to those Acts, the Government would share the BID information, including biometrics, with others, including government departments.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000023"></a>The provisions regarding destruction of the biometric information required by Clause 8(3) include provision for the destruction of copies. I hope that the Minister is paying attention to this because I will ask him a question which is of some importance. As I said, there is provision for the destruction of copies unless under Clause 8(4) the information is retained in accordance with and for the purposes of another enactment.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000024"></a>What enactment do the Government have in mind? There would not be any enactment which would already refer to the biometrics. Therefore, I am assuming that the Government have in mind some future hypothetical use to which the biometrics might be put by a person other than the Secretary of State. I would be grateful if the Minister could elucidate that question. Under what enactment might copies be retained since they could not have been referred to in any existing enactment? What sort of purposes do the Government have in mind which would require copies of the biometric information being retained, when the originals in the ownership of the Secretary of State would have to be destroyed under Clause 8(3) regulations? That is an important point because there is no purpose in destroying the parent biometric information if multitudes of copies can be retained by other persons to whom the Secretary of State has transferred them.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000025"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07071267000158"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> I have three questions. My noble friend Lord Avebury, drew attention to the database. When we proceed to a national database following the introduction of identity cards, how  will that apply to the destruction of biometric information? If information is on a national database, will it not be retained in one way or another?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000026"></a>Secondly, what distances are involved in the interview areas? I know that certain recommendations have been made, such as 25 miles. How confident is the Minister that there will be access to this centre for interviews?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000027"></a>Finally, we know that there are problems with personal interview procedures for passports&#151;I have mentioned that once or twice before. Of the 69 personal passport interview officers, only two are effective at the moment. How confident is the Minister of the success of this scheme to collect biometric information? Is he confident that the whole system will support the measures outlined in the Bill?

<p><a name="07071267000028"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071267000159"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on using a convenient amendment that happens to be passing by to give the Committee the benefit of her party piece, and I understand why she is doing that. She is quite entitled to do so.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000029"></a>One can have the best border police service in the world, but there is always a likelihood or possibility that something will be missed. My guess is that our friends in America would think that they have a fairly robust system, yet they suffered one of the worst terrorist outrages that has ever been visited upon any country in the world&#151;9/11. I am sure that they have improved their processes since then. I am confident that we have done so, and that what we are putting in place through this legislation will improve matters. I have greatly enjoyed some of the support that we have received from the noble Baroness&#146;s party and from other parties to improve the way in which Customs, police and immigration services can work together through the Border and Immigration Agency and the border management programme to ensure that we have more robust procedures in place.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000030"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made it plain the other day that he was less than satisfied with what had happened with regard to the convicted terrorists and the movement of some of them. He was right to draw attention to that in the way that he did. We will have to ensure that vigilance is maintained. Some of the errors were perhaps of an operational nature. Even if some of the measures proposed here had been in place, there may well have been some gaps&#151;who can be absolutely sure? For that reason, the Prime Minister quite rightly wanted to ensure that matters were properly reviewed. We try and make progress. We try to ensure that that law is right. We think that these measures are right and proportionate. We keep things under review and, no doubt, we will return to the issues raised by the noble Baroness, not just today, but on other occasions.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the use of powers allowing the retention and destruction of biometric information. Clause 8(4) enables biometric information to be used or retained under the Identity Cards Act, even when a person becomes a British citizen. I know that the noble Lord was concerned about those issues and, no doubt, he will continue to be concerned, but it is right that we have those powers so that we can act on the information that they obtain. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked how confident we are that biometric information can be collected. We are entirely confident, as I have explained on a number of occasions. We have already had successful experience of collecting biometrics from visa applicants. We will make use of the possibility for the incremental rollout of bids to pilot and test the process to ensure that the project is implemented as successfully as the fingerprinting of visa applicants.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000032"></a>The noble Lord asked how confident we could be of access to interview centres. We are looking at the best options to achieve a target of reasonable travel to these centres. The noble Lord will be well aware that I

I think that that system will work well. I congratulate the noble Lord on raising the issue at every opportunity. The rollout programme has been explained to him in the past and we have placed in the Library of the House some of the more refined details. I hope that that answers the noble Lord&#146;s points. I am grateful for the comments made in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000033"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071267000160"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily, but if the Minister will forgive me for saying so, he has not actually answered my question, which was very specific. Copies are made of the documents that are under the control of the Secretary of State. They are transferred to other persons, such as other government departments and, as the Minister has mentioned, the police. The regulations will specify under what circumstances and at what point the biometric documents under the control of the Secretary of State will be destroyed.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000034"></a>I asked the Minister whether he could explain what the other enactments are that are referred to in Clause 8(4). If such enactments are to be put before your Lordships in the future, we should know about that. This is a purely hypothetical provision to cater for some unforeseen eventualities, and not for something that the Government have in mind at the moment. I wanted the Minister to explain what sort of purposes were envisaged under which these copies would be retained by some other person to whom the Secretary of State had transferred them after the destruction by him of the parent records.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000035"></a>I do not expect the Minister to give me an immediate answer because he may not have access to the information but, as he has been so assiduous in writing to Members of the Committee after every Grand Committee sitting, perhaps I could ask him to include that in the letter he writes after today&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000036"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07071267000161"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am happy to do so. Much of the regulation for information sharing, data sharing and so on is governed by data protection and human rights legislation. As the noble Lord knows, by and large the retention of this information will be for law enforcement purposes. I do not have anything I can tell him about what other purposes we might envisage that information being retained for, or the legislation we might have in mind.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000046"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is designed to address concerns raised by Members of both Houses and by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee about the level of scrutiny of the code of practice for the biometric civil penalty regime. We provided a commitment to review the existing clause. The amendment reflects a similar provision in the Identity Cards Act and will mean that the first code of practice will come into force subject to the affirmative procedure, and any subsequent changes will be made by the negative resolution procedure. The code of practice will set out how we intend the sanctions under Clause 7(2) to operate. I also undertake to place copies of the draft code in the Library of both Houses. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000047"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07071267000166"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Clause 14 deals with the code of practice covering the penalties that may be imposed on a person who fails to comply with any of the regulations to be made under Clause 5(1). The amendment clarifies the first code of practice for determining whether to impose a penalty on a person who fails to comply with any of the regulations made under Clause 5(1) and, if so, the matters to be considered in determining the amount.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000048"></a>The code may require the Secretary of State to consider the non-financial penalties that may come into play automatically under Clause 7, or they may be imposed at the entire discretion of the Secretary of State. I noticed the extensive powers granted under that paragraph more recently than I should have done. We may have to return to Clause 7(2)(e) on another occasion because it is a very sweeping power.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000049"></a>The provisions in Clause 7 may have a drastic effect on a person&#146;s life. For example, the withdrawal of leave to enter may cause a person&#146;s university studies to be terminated or his leave to remain here for employment to come to an end, wrecking his future career. In view of that, I should be grateful for an assurance from the Minister that the code will require any decision made under Clause 7 to be considered when deciding whether a fine should be imposed and, if so, by how much.</p>

That will be made clear in the code, as will the circumstances in which penalties will be applied. The sensitivities which the noble Lord draws to the Committee&#146;s attention will be well understood and the circumstances he describes will be covered by the way in which the code operates.</p>

The penalties are described in Clause 14, and the code which covers the penalties may require the Secretary of State to consider the non-financial penalties in Clause 7. My question to the Minister was whether, instead of giving the Secretary of State the option of considering the penalties under Clause 7 when deciding whether to impose a financial penalty, the code would oblige him to do so. The penalties which may come into play under Clause 7 could have a devastating effect on the lives of the persons concerned and should be taken into consideration in deciding whether to impose a financial penalty.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000052"></a>If the Bill were left alone and the Government do not give me the assurance that I seek, it would allow them to impose a financial penalty on a person who fails to comply with any of the provisions in the regulations in Clause 5(1) and can then remove his leave to enter or to remain. We seem to be imposing two penalties for the same offence and therefore, at the very least, the Secretary of State should have to consider the impact of the penalties imposed under Clause 7 when deciding whether to impose a financial penalty as well.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000062"></a>The noble Lord said: The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium, which speaks for 23 children&#146;s organisations, and with which the Children&#146;s Commissioner, UNICEF, the UNHCR and the British Red Cross have observer status, endorsed the demand by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that the UK withdraw its general reservation on immigration and citizenship. In Amendment No. 27, we invite the Committee to take a step in that direction by bringing the BIA within the scope of the convention, while explicitly preserving the right of the Secretary of State to deport a child under the immigration Acts. This saving is not necessary legally, in our opinion, because Article 22 of the CRC provides that states must,</p>
<ul><a name="07071267000144"></a>&#147;take appropriate measures to ensure that&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071267000123"></a>an asylum-seeking child,</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000063"></a>If there were any doubt about whether a failed asylum seeker who was a child could be deported, and there had been no case before the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Government could have sought clarification from the committee. But I am sure that states parties which are already parties to the convention routinely remove children, and do it as humanely as possible as none of them has been in trouble for any breach of the convention. I am open to correction by the Minister. I am equally sure that if the only concern were about removals, the Government would have been able to draft a much more limited reservation than the one we have to observe at present.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000064"></a>As we heard at our first sitting, the Government are desperate to avoid any commitment to the welfare of the child by the BIA, whereas we believe that in accordance with Article 3 of the CRC, the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration. We are particularly concerned with current procedures in connection with immigration control that are clearly breaches of the convention. I shall give a couple of examples with which the noble Lord may be familiar.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000065"></a>The first concerns the separation of breastfeeding mothers from their infants, on which I have corresponded with three Home Office Ministers&#151;Mr Tony McNulty, Mr Liam Byrne, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland. After the first case of Mrs N, Mr McNulty instructed senior officials to conduct a review in April 2006. On 18 May last year, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, told me that the review had been completed and amendments were being made to the operational enforcement manual. I have not been able to identify those changes, and I would be grateful if the Minister would let me know what they were.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000066"></a>Mr Byrne wrote to me on 12 July 2006, saying that correct procedures had not been followed and that all staff had been reminded that families should be separated only on the authority of an assistant director, a procedure that is not a judicial review and therefore not compliant with Article 9 of the convention.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000067"></a>A month later, I wrote to Mr Byrne about a second case, that of Mrs P, who had been detained when she went on a routine signing-on in April 2006 and separated from her breastfeeding infant for two days. The review which had been conducted on the case of Mrs N had not looked at whether there were any similar cases at that time, although I had asked for that to be done, and we still do not know whether there were any.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000068"></a>On 27 August last year, I wrote to Mr Byrne, reminding him that I was awaiting a reply to my letter of 12 July. He replied on 12 September saying that the IND had no record that Mrs P had told the immigration staff that she was lactating. That was plainly untrue. Not only had Mrs P told the officer repeatedly that she was breastfeeding her little boy, but it became obvious because her breasts were leaking&#151;a fact remarked on by other officers.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000069"></a>I wrote again with details of the events that had taken place at Communications House. In his reply of 23 October, the Minister finally admitted that Mrs P had told the officers that she was &#147;feeding baby&#148;, but the interviewing officer said that he had not understood that she meant breastfeeding. The Minister also admitted that Communications House denied her the facility of making a telephone call to the carer of her baby, who thought that Mrs P would be gone for a couple of hours and was no doubt getting desperate. Mr Byrne said that the official concerned had been retrained, and that specific guidance was being developed in relation to breastfeeding mothers and parents of young children, including a requirement that breastfeeding infants should not be separated from their mothers unless compelling and exceptional circumstances indicated that it might be appropriate. He said that the same would apply to any young children. I was unable to find that guidance on the Home Office website, and would be grateful if the noble Lord would give the reference, for the satisfaction of the Committee this afternoon.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000070"></a>In spite of the assurances that I had been given in both those cases, a third case has arisen&#151;as the Minister is aware, I hope&#151;that of Mrs Janipher Maseko, whose name I can mention because the case is already in the public domain. She was said to have come to the end of her asylum application after she had just been delivered of her son, Collin, in Hillingdon Hospital. She lost her accommodation and the support that she had been receiving, and was taken into custody by the police when she was found sleeping rough on 9 May. At the time, Collin was two weeks old and his sister Chantelle was one year old. They were placed in foster care while Janipher, after spending four days in police custody without a shower, was taken to Yarl&#146;s Wood immigration removal centre. The two babies were not restored to

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000071"></a>The Minister has now instructed the children&#146;s champion for the BIA to investigate the circumstances and make recommendations, but how can we have any confidence in the process when investigations into the previous two cases failed to prevent a recurrence?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000072"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will forgive me for going into some detail on this problem but I hope that it will convince them that, if this sort of thing can happen, there is an urgent need to bring the BIA within the scope of the CRC. The convention provides a critical standard against which the UK&#146;s treatment of refugee children must be assessed, and should be used by the Government as their guiding principle on all matters relating to refugee and asylum-seeking children.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000073"></a>In October 2002, the committee said that the Government should,</p>
<ul><a name="07071267000146"></a>&#147;address thoroughly the particular situation of children in the ongoing reform of the immigration and asylum system to bring it in line with the principles and provisions of the Convention&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071267000124"></a>The Government have stated that the reservation does not prevent them having regard to the convention in the care and protection of child asylum seekers. We challenge that assertion, on the basis of our knowledge of cases such as those mentioned, and because the reservation allows the UK to pass immigration laws without reference to the convention. It allows the UK to detain children in places such as Yarl&#146;s Wood, contrary to the advice of the JCHR and in the face of repeated criticism by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000074"></a>A new handbook by Bail for Immigration Detainees&#151;no doubt we can go into it in greater detail on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and others&#151;concludes that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071267000147"></a>&#147;urgent changes are needed to safeguard children against the worst excesses of current detention policy and practice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071267000125"></a>The honourable Member for Hendon, chair of the JCHR, goes further in his press release accompanying the committee&#146;s report on asylum seekers. He says that asylum-seeking children should never be detained, and that the treatment of asylum seekers in some cases, particularly the policy of enforced destitution&#151;we will discuss that later&#151;reaches the human rights threshold of inhuman and degrading treatment.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000075"></a>These situations will continue to arise as long as there is no underlying principle governing the treatment of asylum-seeking children. Now that we have a new Government, it is time for a fresh start. There could be no better indication of a radical change in the child-hostile asylum policies of the past than for the Minister to say this afternoon that the Government will consider withdrawing their reservation on the CRC, as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged. I beg to move.</p>

Any nation is judged by the way that it treats the most vulnerable in its midst.

</ul>
<p><a name="07071267000126"></a>Is it not time not to retain this reservation, but to  take a lead in abolishing it, and to say that children come first in the conflict between immigration legislation and children&#146;s rights? You can argue in government about different legislation&#151;you can have a million words&#151;but one child suffering is a shame upon us as a nation. As I have done on many occasions, I urge the Government to go ahead and withdraw that reservation. I am glad that Section 9  of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 has largely been put on hold. We will come to that. It might show that the Government see a glimmer of light and be a wee response to our pleading. I wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000079"></a>On 22 March, a woman from Kosovo and her three children under seven, including a new-born baby, were dawn-raided at their home in Portsmouth while her partner was in London. The children had to witness their parents&#146; possessions being rifled through in a search for documents. They were not given time to eat breakfast, but were taken to Yarl&#146;s Wood  and informed that they would be on a flight back  to Kosovo on the following Thursday. On the Wednesday before that, the baby started vomiting and seemed seriously ill, so the whole family was rushed to hospital. They spent the day there, but in the early evening the older children were returned to Yarl&#146;s Wood alone, against their mother&#146;s wishes. The children were terrified and screaming, but had to spend the night in Yarl&#146;s Wood while their mother remained in hospital with the sick baby. The following evening, the mother was taken back to Yarl&#146;s Wood, while the baby stayed in hospital. In other words, she was reunited with her older children, but separated from her sick baby.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000080"></a>On 30 March, the mother was taken back to the hospital to see the baby and said that the nappies had not been changed since she had left the previous day. The baby was discharged later on the same day and, by the evening, they were all together in Yarl&#146;s Wood. Despite the age of the children, they were all held

They were then returned to Portsmouth and reunited with their father, who had been too afraid of arrest to visit them.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000081"></a>This story may illustrate the range of problems with which the authorities are faced in meeting the best interests of the child during the process of removal&#151;it is no easy matter. It also shows the Home Office&#146;s desperation to achieve its targets, and the lack of consideration for family life which characterises some aspects of government policy. I know that later we shall come to amendments in the name of my noble friend Lord Listowel and others which relate specifically to removals but, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked, with these sorts of stories, how can we have any confidence in the process?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000086"></a>It is right that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, directs us again to the issue of child welfare and how it should be promoted. We have revisited many of the arguments that were dealt with at the end of day one of Committee, when we looked at Amendment No. 13. The conundrum that has to be resolved is: how does one adequately protect and promote the welfare of children who are affected by the immigration system, while the Government, as their prime duty, protect the people of this country, many of whom are children and to whom the Government also owe that duty of protection and welfare?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000087"></a>We have heard some harrowing stories and obviously the Minister will address the particular of those but, looking to the general, I am grateful for the briefing from the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, that organisation is concerned that the Government have stated that they do not intend to sign up to the UNCRC in respect of the terms of the amendment. The  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC240"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government said that they believe that their general reservation on immigration and citizenship does not prevent them having regard to the UNCRC in their care and protection of separated children. I appreciate that the Minister gave much of his answer on the first day in Committee, but we need to hear from him again why the Government believe that that is the case. Of course, we have been given the code of practice, <I>Keeping Children Safe from Harm</I>, from the Border and Immigration Agency, and that has been helpful. We considered the code and need to test how far it goes in meeting our concerns. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and others have said, we will return to this issue. There are other matters covering the welfare of children, particularly those in detention with or without a responsible adult.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000088"></a>The argument of the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium is that the reservation entered into by the Government means that, in practice, the Government are not able adequately to protect children. It alleges that it allows the UK to pass immigration laws without reference to the convention. For example, it alleges that some of the proposals in the Bill would be in contravention of the convention. Therefore, we need to hear from the Minister why the course that the Government intend to adopt and develop in response to amendments that we have already debated enables them to maintain their reservation without compromising the safety and welfare of children in the system. If the Minister is not able to do that, by the time we get to Report I feel that a head of steam will be building up and that noble Lords will want to try to ensure somehow that there is a core protection. </p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000089"></a>At the moment, the core protection is that encapsulated in Section 11. If the Section 11 proposals could be embodied in the Bill in some strong, guaranteed way, many if not all of the other amendments would not be necessary. I am not wholeheartedly saying that I support this amendment, because there are other ways in which we can address the problem. It was absolutely right for the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to bring it forward because the Minister needs to be able to enter his justification.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000090"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07071267000179"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This observation is felt as well as meant: I could not be other than moved by the cases referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. Clearly, that is not best practice and it is not what we want to hear. I cannot comment on individual cases because it would be wrong of me to do so, but the Committee will record its gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for being as assiduous as he is in pursuing us in government with those issues and drawing our attention to what he and others quite rightly view as malpractice. I congratulate him on doing that and it is right.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000091"></a>One feels extremely uncomfortable listening to disturbing stories of that nature. Whatever the justification, they make one feel very uncomfortable indeed. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, made the point that officials find themselves in difficult circumstances when dealing with families who have different family needs&#151;children of different ages  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC241"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requiring different things, where someone has become hospitalised or is in poor health, or where both parents are absent for whatever reason. Clearly, those are distressing circumstances and not easy for anyone to resolve. However, overarching all that must be the consideration that we must look after the best interests of the children concerned&#151;that whatever the outcome of each individual case, their welfare and care must be of primary importance.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000092"></a>We come to the amendment and its effect and the issues that were so neatly drawn together in her concluding comments by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, who quite properly draws out the issues relating to core protection. Numerous bodies are charged with the care, protection and welfare of children in this country. Local authorities, education and healthcare professionals are among them. All these are bound under domestic legislation to provide the same standard of care to all children, irrespective of their immigration status. We are satisfied that children subject to immigration control and present in the United Kingdom receive comprehensive care, protection and support in the main. That is not to say that improvements cannot be made or that occasionally there are circumstances when those standards are not met in the spirit of domestic legislation.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000093"></a>The amendment would require every decision to grant, refuse or vary leave involving a child to be made so that it is compatible with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, with a view to that child&#146;s best interests. However, this wording is too vague; it is not clear how it would be interpreted, and it is quite likely that because of this vagueness it will be used as another avenue to remain in the United Kingdom by those who have no right to stay.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000094"></a>The Secretary of State is entitled to query the purpose of the amendment. We have already established that it cannot be so that children who are subject to immigration control receive the same care, protection and welfare as other children in the UK. Our domestic legislation provides for that. The amendment can only be designed to prevent the carrying out of immigration functions, yet that is the very reason that we have an immigration reservation in respect of this convention. We could not operate an effective immigration system unless its functions&#151;under powers given by Parliament&#151;were not able to supersede other benefits that a person gets simply by being physically present in the country. If it did not matter how you got here, whether or not relatives who could look after you were here or whether or not they had obeyed the laws of this country&#151;if all that mattered was that you should be physically present and claiming to be under 18 and that the immigration functions no longer applied to you&#151;our system could not operate effectively or efficiently and another reason for impeding it would have been found.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000095"></a>No doubt those who support the amendment will say that the second part of it still allows a deportation order to be made, so some of the immigration functions can be carried out; for instance, a child who is a family member of a person who is being deported would not be covered by the convention. Deportation is the last resort in the exercise of immigration control and is hardly ever, if at all, applied to children in their

Cases involving children as a family member of an adult who is being deported are, of course, considered very carefully and with specific reference to the effect on the children; the Immigration Rules require that. The amendment would not change anything of practical consequence. Taken together, this would work against the effectiveness of our immigration control. The Government believe that the reservation remains justified to maintain effective immigration control.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000096"></a>Further, the amendment would go beyond removing the Government&#146;s reservation; it would, to a limited extent, incorporate the United Nations convention into domestic primary legislation and make it justiciable in UK law.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000097"></a>All that said, it does not mean that we are not responding to the concerns expressed that the functions of the Immigration Service do not carry with them the same obligations to take account of children&#146;s needs as other agencies. It is for that reason that we have introduced a new duty for the Border and Immigration Agency to have regard to a code of practice to keep children safe from harm while they are in the United Kingdom. That has been welcomed. </p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000098"></a>I recognise that noble Lords will be disappointed at this response, and I accept that there is more for us to do in the field of protecting the interests of children and child welfare as a primary issue. But we have to return to the point to which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, referred: the duty to protect citizens of the United Kingdom. That is one of the primary purposes of immigration control and, however uncomfortable that may feel from time to time, we have to have firm principles in place and a clear basis on which to operate. That is why we have adopted the current position.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000099"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071267000180"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am grateful to all who have spoken to the amendment: my noble friend Lord Roberts, the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, who was in favour of the spirit of the amendment although she believes that the same purposes can be achieved via Clause 11, to which we will come at a later stage.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000100"></a>I should like to put on record the fact that I appreciate the difficulties the Minister mentioned in seeking compatibility between the obligations to safeguard our borders and to get those who do not qualify to remain back to their country of origin, including children and families, and reconciling that duty with the need to look after the best interests of the child. I was interested that at one point in his response the noble Lord said that the Border and Immigration Agency did look after the best interests of the child. That is precisely what we are asking it to do by making the convention applicable to the BIA.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000101"></a>If the amendment is wrongly worded in that it would interfere with the specific functions of the BIA, we can discuss that. I should like some conversations offline with the Minister to see whether we could extend the exceptions to the application of the

In that way, if decisions were made on matters other than deportation, they would also be exempt from the judicial review challenges, which is what the Minister fears.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000102"></a>I am interested not in the decisions of the BIA but in the BIA&#146;s conduct. The Minister&#146;s remarks about the duties of the local authorities, healthcare professionals and others towards these children were perfectly reasonable, but they are all bound by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am feeling my way towards the application of the convention to officials of the BIA, except when they are exercising decisions on the removal of the child. If we can come to a formula that covers that, we will have achieved something even more extensive than Clause 11&#151;and I look forward to conversations with the Minister on that subject.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000103"></a>When we come to the conversations, I hope that the Minister will be armed with the information that I sought, which is on what has happened in other countries that have signed up to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly countries in the European Union, and whether they experienced any difficulty in controlling their borders as a result of having signed up to the convention and are putting in reservations similar to those that the United Kingdom has. If we find that France or Germany, for example, have signed up to the convention without reservations of the kind that we have entered into and have nevertheless not encountered the sort of difficulties with immigration control that the Minister fears would happen if we did so, that would have to be taken into consideration. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07071267000108"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is the first to the clauses that deal with treatment of claimants. We are covering here the additional restrictions that are potentially to be imposed on everybody with a limited leave to remain&#151;conditions that are far more intrusive than the provisions of the 1971 Act, which has served the purpose all these years. The reporting and residence conditions that may be applied now

The clause provides that, in addition to reporting to the police, a person with limited leave to remain must also report to an immigration officer or to anyone else employed by the BIA. That is what the expression &#147;Secretary of State&#148; actually means, as the Public Bill Committee was told. It also allows the BIA to specify an address at which the person concerned has to reside.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000109"></a>In another place, when the then Minister, Joan Ryan, was challenged on the breadth of the clause, she said that it was intended to apply to only two groups of persons. Maybe the Minister will confirm what she said&#151;that it was designed for foreign national prisoners who could not be removed at the end of their sentences for legal reasons and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, but not for every person in either category. Joan Ryan told the Public Bill Committee that there would be tens rather than hundreds of foreign national prisoners, somewhat fewer than the 1,960 UASC granted discretion and leave to remain in 2005.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000110"></a>One would expect that the number of UASC arriving at our ports of entry would be going down, since visas are now required from practically every country outside the EEA. It would be interesting if the Minister could say something about the manner in which 270 UASC from Afghanistan and 80 from Iran, who applied in the first quarter of 2007, managed to get here in the first place. I noted that in the overwhelming majority of the UASC from those two countries, the applications were made in-country and not at a port. Therefore, those children entered either clandestinely or in some other capacity, and we ought to be told how that is happening.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000111"></a>Are the UASC entering the UK from other EU countries? How many of the 810 UASC who applied in quarter one could be identified as Dublin convention cases? We have none of that information; it is not given in the quarterly asylum statistics. That is particularly unfortunate when we have to discuss legislation concerning UASC. It would have been useful if a certain research department at the Home Office had made a special effort to provide us with comprehensive information about the UASC so that we would have had it before us when considering these clauses.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000112"></a>I suggest that we ought to keep a particularly close eye on UASC because of the risk of trafficking, which we discussed only a couple of weeks ago in your Lordships&#146; House. The global visa regulations, which were mentioned in that debate, are supposed to ensure that children who are subject to entry clearance are recorded as they enter on what is called a &#147;vignette&#148;. I hope that will reduce the number of children brought in as domestics and then forced into prostitution, examples of which are given in the UK action plan on human trafficking. Have the global visa regulations and the establishment of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre had any effect on the disappearance of children who were in the custody of local authorities? That has preoccupied noble Lords on a number of occasions in debates in the House.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000113"></a>Why is it now considered necessary for children to report to BIA officials as well as to the police, when the local authority is already responsible for their care? Why is it less likely that they will disappear, whether of their own volition or under the compulsion of traffickers, if they live at an address specified by the BIA rather than one that is decided for them by the local authority?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000114"></a>With regard to the foreign criminals who cannot be deported at the end of their sentence, it would be useful to hear more from the Minister about the nature of the problem. There have been difficulties in the past concerning prisoners&#146; documentation, and if it is the intention to use the clause to release a prisoner at the end of his sentence to a specified address with narrow reporting conditions, rather than continuing to detain him either in prison or in an immigration removal centre, that would be welcome. However, if Clause 16 is aimed at those prisoners and what one hopes is a diminishing number of UASC who are not qualified under the refugee convention, why is the clause not limited to those two categories?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000115"></a>The Government may have in mind a third category, those designated as having a special immigration status, introduced by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. These are foreign criminals within a more extensive definition than the one in Clause 31 of this Bill, as well as their spouses and children. If those foreign criminals, who may have been convicted of relatively minor offences, cannot be deported because of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act, they will come under the new status. I understand that the Government have said that people designated under Clause 115 of the new Bill form another category to which Clause 16 here is intended to apply. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000116"></a>We will seek to avoid the confusion that would otherwise be caused by two different definitions of &#147;foreign criminal&#148; when we get to Clause 31. Meanwhile, though, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that under Clause 117(2) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill the second kind of foreign criminal is not to be deemed to have been given leave to enter the United Kingdom, whereas in Clause 16 of the UK Borders Bill the additional conditions are expressly attached to leave to enter. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain how that inconsistency is to be resolved, if indeed it is intended to apply Clause16 to those foreign prisoners. </p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000117"></a>In any case, whether or not there is to be a third category subject to Clause 16, we believe that the Government should not have the power to impose these additional conditions on anyone with limited leave to remain. We also believe that, within the categories identified as being subject to the conditions, it should be demonstrated that for each individual designated there are weighty reasons, as set out in Amendment No. 27A, for the imposition of a residence condition.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000118"></a>We also say that, if the two conditions are to be added to Section 3 of the 1971 Act, they should be applied only in a manner consistent with the ECHR,  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC246"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the ICCPR and the refugee convention. The then Minister in another place, Joan Ryan, touched very briefly on the human rights implications of this clause when she dismissed the suggestion by Liberty that residence conditions might breach Article 8 on the right to family life and Article 11 on freedom of association. She pointed out, correctly, that both those articles may be subject to limitations which are necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000119"></a>It is also true that the maintenance of effective immigration control is a legitimate aim, but that does not mean that all and every infraction of Articles 8 and 11 with a view to better control of immigration are proportionate. That would have to be settled by a case at the European Court, and we should like it to be recognised in the Bill that, whatever residence restrictions are to be imposed under Clause 16, it remains to be established that they are indeed proportionate.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071267000120"></a>The United Kingdom is of course a party to the ICCPR and periodically we are examined before the UN Human Rights Committee, which is responsible for its implementation. The reference to the ICCPR in Amendment No. 30A emphasises that we shall be accountable to that committee for the way in which the power in new Section 3(1)(c)(v) is exercised. I beg to move.</p>

I shall speak to the clause as a whole, which is a classic example of having been designed for the convenience of Governments and not human beings. We know one reason why it is being introduced: it is a convenient means of keeping track of young people or unaccompanied children pending removal. There would have to be a legitimate reason for that and, drawing on the JCHR evidence, I cannot see how the reasons listed in Article 8 on respect for family life and Article 11 on freedom of association under the Human Rights Act can apply to unaccompanied asylum seekers&#151;reasons such as national security, public safety and the prevention of crime and so on. In fact, this clause could apply to anyone with limited leave to remain&#151;even spouses, I understand. In my view, while it might apply to those who committed serious crimes, it would be excessive, an unnecessary

The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium believes it to be unnecessary, unfair and costly, and says that it is damaging and inappropriate to seek to legislate for open-ended reporting and residence requirements for those children.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000002"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has already asked for reassurance, but I hope that the Minister can assure me that the clause will not  be used for asylum seekers or those with refugee status.</p>
<h5><a name="07071275000092"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071275000003"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0003.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07071275000097"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> It may help the Committee if I speak to Amendment No. 30, standing in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, in this group. That probing amendment would take children out of the new requirements on reporting in the Bill. Its purpose is to discover the Government&#146;s intentions. I regretted not being able to take part in the previous debate, and would like to comment on what happens when we make the sort of mistakes highlighted in it, which we might be encouraged to make by implementing the clause without thinking about the needs of children. The right honourable Iain Duncan Smith recently reported about the impact on this country of the fragmentation of families, and if we intervene incorrectly there is a danger that our interventions will backfire on us.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000004"></a>I think particularly of the four young men convicted recently for an attempted terrorist attack on the United Kingdom. One of them was an unaccompanied child seeking asylum from the civil war in Somalia at the age of 12. He was a Muslim, and was placed with devoutly Christian foster parents. I do not cast any aspersions at all on those foster parents, but for a Muslim child to be placed in a family so inappropriate to his culture perhaps demonstrates a lack of thought and a desperate shortage of foster parents. When we implement legislation of this kind, we must think of the need to manage migration but also the need to give children the right surroundings to thrive and contribute to society. They must not be left to feel downgraded, worthless or alienated. Another of the young men in the trial spent five years in Feltham young offender institution. I understand that that institution has improved recently, but he was caught up with an imam in it. That was an opportunity to give a young man a better education, training and hope for the future and, when we intervene in such ways, we must always seek to try to make the intervention positive and to not inadvertently undermine the development of children.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000005"></a>I return more specifically to the amendment. I wonder why the social worker cannot perform the role of communicating with young people, to reassure the Government that they are not disappearing from the system. If the intention is to prevent absconding, why cannot the social worker prevent that by keeping in touch? It appears that the intention is to enable immigration officers to secure young people more easily for removal. If so, I would appreciate the

It is fairer to the young people to explain that the purpose is to facilitate their return.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000006"></a>I hope that the Minister will consider whether the measure might prove counterproductive. We are talking about usually intelligent young people. If the purpose is to make detention and return easier, they will see that and may seek means to make themselves invisible. Is there a particular problem in deporting young people? If so, what does the Minister have to say about this possibly driving children underground and making the problem worse? It will certainly be distressing for them and may interfere with their education if they have to report in person. A more constructive approach might be for social workers and case managers to make the possibility of return clear from the earliest stage&#151;provided that a child is not too troubled to be acquainted with that truth&#151;to encourage continual contact with the child&#146;s family in his home country where that is possible and safe, and for the Border and Immigration Agency to build on existing arrangements for voluntary assisted returns.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000007"></a>Will the children and young people be near reporting centres, or be asked to travel long distances to report to the immigration officers? Will they be expected to be accompanied by a social worker, and will that add further stress on a system that is already overstretched? Will the travel costs be reimbursed? Will account be taken of the educational commitments of children and young people in these situations? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000008"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071275000098"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I warmly support the noble Earl&#146;s amendment, which he spoke to so comprehensively and convincingly that there is really very little to add. I just take this opportunity to stress a couple of points that have come out in our deliberations today, not least in what the noble Earl said.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000009"></a>First, it is not at all clear why this legislation is necessary as these children are anyway supposed to be in the care of the social services. We need to hear a more convincing rationale for why additional legislation is necessary. As the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium has made plain in a very helpful brief, rather than helping with the Government&#146;s objectives, this legislation, as the noble Earl underlined, is likely to make the situation worse, as young people disappear in fear.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000010"></a>Secondly, towards his conclusion, the noble Earl asked four specific questions that had arisen in the context of the consultation paper, <I>Planning </I><I>B</I><I>etter </I><I>Outcomes and S</I><I>upport for </I><I>U</I><I>naccompanied </I><I>A</I><I>sylum </I><I>S</I><I>eeking </I><I>C</I><I>hildren</I>. I am sure that the noble Earl is not alone in wanting that. I shall be very disappointed if the Minister cannot give specific answers to those questions, because there is a lot of anxiety surrounding the matter.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000011"></a>I conclude by emphasising what in our deliberations, with the best of intentions, we are sometimes in danger of forgetting. We are dealing with children going through the most demanding emotional and psychological experience. If we take seriously the undertakings that we have given in the convention, it really is unthinkable that we can be party to increasing that mental anguish,

That point cannot be emphasised enough. We talk these days a great deal about citizenship and what it means to be a United Kingdom citizen. Do we really believe that being a United Kingdom citizen means identifying ourselves with a policy that is aggravating the suffering of children?</p>

It should not have been printed as it was on the groupings list; it should have been reprinted and was not. I appreciate that the Deputy Chairman was at a disadvantage because she was not part of the group that I e-mailed. My amendments reflect directly on Amendment No. 27A, and I felt that it would extend the work of the Grand Committee improperly if I were to degroup them.</p>

Whoever is to be covered by this tougher group of conditions, are those conditions appropriate or disproportionate in how they will operate?</p>

<p><a name="07071275000024"></a>The new provisions introduced by the Government would introduce reporting and residence conditions for those who have limited leave to enter or remain. Those persons would include refugees, work permit holders, highly skilled migrants and family members of those who are already settled in the UK. I am not sure that the wide remit of these provisions has been properly understood by the public. That is my concern. The whole thrust of the Government&#146;s press release system on this has been to present this as a Bill that attacks illegal migration. Of course, the Government need to do that because they need to impress on the public that they are doing what they can to secure this country. But it means that those who will be affected by Clause 16 may not appreciate what is about to hit them. It is important that we discuss these matters.</p>

Those more limited conditions encompass prohibition from working, no recourse to public funds and registration with the police. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, reminded the Committee that when this clause was debated in Committee in another place, at col. 303 on 13 March, the Minister, Joan Ryan, stated that the Government initially intend to apply these further conditions only to two categories&#151;to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and to those foreign prisoners whom the Government are unable to remove from the UK.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000026"></a>My amendments probe the extent of the conditions that the Government intend to impose on whether they are likely to be effective or proportionate. Amendment No. 28 would require that any condition imposed on residence should be reasonable in the circumstances. As we heard earlier, points were made about how easy or difficult it will be for people to travel to those reporting places.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000027"></a>Amendment No. 29 would disapply the power to impose residence conditions if the residence indicated by the Government was more than 25 miles from the nearest reporting centre or would unduly interfere with the person's ability to keep their employment.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000028"></a>Amendment No. 66 would require the chief inspector of the Border and Immigration Agency to report on the way in which the new restrictions in Clause 16 have been imposed and the effects on the individuals affected.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000029"></a>The Minister in another place claimed at col. 304 in Committee that the Government would apply these reporting and residency conditions to children only when strictly necessary, either for their own welfare or with a view to closer contact management as they approach the age of 18. That appears to be exactly what the noble Earls, Lord Listowel and Lord Sandwich, were talking about. The Government want to keep tabs on these children because they think that they are going to abscond. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was correct in trying to tease out from the Government whether absconsion is what really worries them.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000030"></a>We need to know, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has asked, whether the Government think that there is a problem with the absconsion of children. If there is, we need to tackle it. This may not be the right way to do that, but we must tackle it, because their welfare will be at risk. We have heard stories about children absconding from the care of social services and going straight back into the hands of traffickers. That is something that none of us wants to happen. The methods that the Government are adopting may be the only way of preventing that and we will have to consider them, but we need to hear from the Minister what other avenues they have sought to use to safeguard children in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000031"></a>The Minister will have read the briefing from the Refugee Council, which makes the point that, at the moment, there appears to be no evidence to suggest that minors are more likely to abscond than any other category of non-national. On the contrary, the Refugee Council argues that it is in the children's interest not to abscond because they are more likely

They have a vested interest in staying put.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000032"></a>The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium has particular concerns about this measure being applied to unaccompanied children. Children who seek asylum alone in this country are by their nature very vulnerable: they often do not know the language; they cannot understand or navigate complex systems of support and they may be very traumatised by their experiences. How does the Minister believe such children are best addressed by these proposals? It may be that they are, but we need to know how. The worry is that the impact of imposing reporting and residence requirements on these children will be immense and make them feel even more fearful.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000033"></a>The Minister in another place claimed that the Government would be reasonable in dictating where a person should live or where they should report, but where in the Bill do we find any assurance that the powers to be used will be limited in that way and for a limited definition of people? At the moment, the provisions in the Bill go very wide and give the Government the opportunity to pick and choose  the timescale of rolling out the proposals to any specific group of people or to all people. We need to know the Government&#146;s plans and their justification.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000034"></a>I appreciate that it was misleading for the Deputy Chairman&#151;we have had a change of Chairman in the interim&#151;that the original grouping has been maintained, but it is helpful. I know it was a slip of the tongue from the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, when he said he was moving Amendment No. 30; like me, he was simply speaking to it. When we come to the amendments in their place we will not move them, but at least I hope it will give the Minister the opportunity properly to answer the debate.</p>

In any event, we will not accept any of the amendments, so that certainly does not apply. However, it enables me to address all the issues in one place and I shall go through them. I appreciate the sensitivity of the issues and understand the concerns that have been raised as part of the discussion.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000036"></a>At the outset, I should explain our thinking behind Clause 16, which is designed to allow the Border and Immigration Agency to monitor and maintain contact with certain individuals who have been granted limited leave to remain; that is its primary purpose. Our aim is to keep in touch with individuals in whom we have an interest in monitoring more closely. We will grant leave with reporting and/or residency conditions only where this is justified by a need for close monitoring of an individual. We want to be able to apply the clause to minors with a view to improving child protection.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made reference to children who go missing from care. The example which is often introduced in our debates is of young

We are very exercised by that; we do not want young people in a vulnerable position to be removed from care and trafficked. We do not want them to become involved in that; it cannot be in their interests and it cannot be in society&#146;s interests. So there is good reason for us to improve child protection and we believe that good and close monitoring will help us to achieve that highly desirable objective.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000038"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071275000110"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I apologise to the Minister but I am having some difficulty in understanding how this will help to achieve his aims, which are very laudable. We all recognise this as a problem, but surely it is far more likely that these children are already being monitored: they should be monitored in the children&#146;s home and they should be monitored by the social worker. But if they are obliged to go to somewhere where they think they might be picked up and taken off to a detention removal centre, is this not, on balance, more likely to make the situation worse than better? In any case, sometimes they will leave of their own volition from the setting they are in&#151;not because someone is taking them away but because they are unhappy with the home or unhappy with their residential childcare worker, and so on. I would appreciate more reassurance from the Minister that this would not be an inadvertent consequence. I apologise for interrupting the Minister but this is a very important point. He has said already that too many children disappear from care at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000039"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071275000111"></a>Lord Judd:</b> As my noble friend has been interrupted, I reinforce the point that the noble Earl has made by putting it in a different way. My noble friend has rehearsed again the arguments that led the Government to their conclusion as expressed in legislation. He has not responded so far to the arguments that have been put forward that this legislation will be counterproductive. We all know that the ultimate objective is not so that the welfare and well-being of the child can be ensured but to ensure efficient deportation. The youngsters are going to know this. If these measures are taken, how can my noble friend argue that they are not more likely to persuade more young people to get into still deeper trouble by disappearing and avoiding the situation?</p>

<p><a name="07071275000040"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071275000112"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Earl is entitled to interrupt me&#151;that is how the Committee works, and it is a perfectly reasonable point to make. I shall try to deal with the issue as I go through the arguments. I say the same to my good and noble friend Lord Judd. I hear his question, but the state has a responsibility. Monitoring children in these circumstances is done for good immigration purposes but, equally importantly, for good child protection reasons, too.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000041"></a>It is not our intention to take over the valuable work done by social services, but it is our intention to complement that valuable and important work. As my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland made clear at Second Reading, we will not impose

We envisage these procedures working sometimes in a light-touch way; it may be that reporting can be done by telephone and outside school hours for children.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000042"></a>On that point, I believe that it was the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who raised the question about things such as travel expenses for those with a reporting obligation. We currently pay travel expenses to some of those on temporary remissions who have to report. Although there is no express power allowing the Secretary of State to pay travel expenses to those with leave to report, we are giving some more consideration to that welfare issue. It is something that we are keeping carefully under review.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000043"></a>We also intend to apply the new powers to foreign criminals who cannot be removed at present due to legal barriers. The need to monitor such people with a view to eventual removal is clearly in the public interest. That case has been made before.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000044"></a>I shall deal first with Amendments Nos. 28 and 30A, as the arguments for resisting them can be quickly made. These amendments would add nothing to Clause 16 beyond that which is already provided in domestic legislation and international agreements. The Human Rights Act makes it unlawful for public authorities to act in a way that is incompatible with convention rights&#151;hence we cannot lawfully impose such restrictions where to do so would be in breach of the refugee convention or infringe rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Reporting and residency restrictions can lawfully be applied to those recognised as refugees. There is also a general legal requirement on public authorities to exercise their powers in a reasonable and, I argue, proportionate way. This would apply to the exercise of the new powers in Clause 16 as it stands.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000045"></a>Amendment No. 27A seeks to limit the application of conditional leave to specified circumstances and does not allow the flexibility that we would need to attach reporting and/or residency conditions to individuals falling outside those criteria. The amendment would also limit the application of the clause for child protection purposes, which Amendment No. 30 also seeks to do.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000046"></a>As we have already explained, we want to be able to apply the clause to minors, with a view to improving child protection. Granting leave with reporting and, where needed, residency conditions should mean that the absence of a child from care is noted at an early stage, the reason for the absence established and all reasonable steps taken to locate the child. That would not be possible if this amendment were in place.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000047"></a>We also intend to use Clause 16 to ensure good contact management with those we may want to remove at a later date, but believe that it would not be right for the Government to have to show that there was a risk of absconding. There would be arguments about the level and timing of risk. In fact, those on limited leave may not be likely to abscond in the short term, as some Members of the Committee have already mentioned.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC255"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000048"></a>We believe that it is right to maintain closer contact with older children whose leave is about to expire. That will allow us to ensure that appropriate arrangements are made for their removal from the UK or for further applications for leave. We will continue to seek to return young people who no longer qualify for leave when they reach 18. Sending children to the United Kingdom who do not have genuine asylum claims in the hope that they will establish a footing for the rest of the family in this country is an abuse of the asylum system and exploitative of the child. Returning those who have been sent in this way when they reach adulthood will deter this unacceptable practice. The contact management aspect of Clause 16 will also help prepare young people, ahead of their 18th birthday, for removal after it.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000049"></a>Amendment No. 29 would allow the Border and Immigration Agency only to apply a condition about residence on someone who lives within 25 miles of a reporting centre. It also states that, where the location is relevant to a person&#146;s employment purposes, that will take precedence over our ability to restrict residence. Accepting this amendment would severely undermine the condition about residence and the usefulness of the provision in terms of contact management. If a person chose to live more than 25 miles from a reporting centre, they would not have to tell us their address, and we would not be able to approve the address at which they wished to reside. We would not be able to use the clause for child protection issues in these circumstances either. Others living within 25 miles of a reporting centre might be able to argue that we did not need to know of or approve of a change of address because their employment made a new location suitable.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000050"></a>Under current reporting arrangements for asylum seekers, individuals are not generally expected to travel further than 25 miles to report. If there is not a reporting centre within 25 miles, there are alternative options&#151;requiring the person to report to an immigration officer at a local police station, for example. We anticipate that a similar policy will be adopted for persons with limited leave who are required to report.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000051"></a>The amendment as drafted would preclude any alternative reporting options for any individuals residing over 25 miles from the nearest reporting centre. Once they had moved, reporting conditions would be modified accordingly so that they could report to a reporting centre nearer to their new home. </p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000052"></a>Amendment No. 66 would place a specific duty on the chief inspector of the Border and Immigration Agency to consider practice and procedure in setting conditions under Clause 16. Clause 47(2) is drafted in such a way as to allow the chief inspector to consider the practice and procedure in making decisions in all aspects of the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s work. Where there is a specific area of concern, the Secretary of State will be able to ask the chief inspector to investigate and report on the matter.</p>

I do not have those data today. There are many routes for immigration, as he knows. However, I will ask officials to undertake some research and interrogate the numbers that he made reference to.</p>

That was published in August 2006, so I take it that the figures relating to 2006 will be published in August 2007. Therefore, we can only tell what was happening to UASC about a year and a half ago and not what is happening today.</p>

Clearly, we need timely information and I shall endeavour to secure that for the noble Lord. He also asked about those caught by special immigration status&#151;foreign criminals who are excluded from the refugee convention. I think he said that they were not granted leave, so were not caught by these provisions. That is correct. These conditions can be imposed only on people who are granted limited leave to remain.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000056"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071275000115"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The Minister has confirmed what I suggested, which is that the foreign criminal who is dealt with in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill&#151;who is deemed not to have been given leave to enter the United Kingdom&#151;cannot be made subject to the conditions in Clause 16.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000057"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07071275000116"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I agree with the noble Lord on that point. The simple reason for residency restrictions is the need to maintain effective contact management, and they are one of a number of devices that we use to secure that. They are not intended to be applied to all limited leave cases, but it is invaluable for case managers and case owners to have the option of imposing residency restrictions. As I have said before, they will be imposed reasonably and appropriately. We have argued that they are needed in relation to child protection, and contact management is certainly valuable for enforcement reasons as well.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000058"></a>How will the restrictions apply in practice? Obviously an assessment will be made of how contact can be best managed for individuals. We would need to know where most people intended to live and we would generally approve the addresses. In child protection cases, we might wish social services to conduct better and fuller checks on an address to establish its suitability, and further consideration might be appropriate following the intervention of social services. As I have argued before, where leave is coming to an end, the Border and Immigration Agency will, properly, want to be able to consider whether to extend it or pursue removal. In those cases, good contact is very important.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000059"></a>I cannot agree with the assertion that imposing residency restrictions is contrary to our obligations under the refugee convention. That case has been made and upheld in case law. In any event, residency conditions would not only be applied to refugees. There is no policy intention to single out refugees and impose the conditions on them alone. The restrictions can be imposed on all those who do not have a right of abode but have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. It is lawful to impose such restrictions on refugees where the condition can be applied to all non-British residents, so we do not accept that assertion.</p>

Of course, I shall look very carefully at <I>Hansard</I> to check whether the information given by the noble Lord was as I heard it.

My concern is that the way in which this well intentioned proposal will be applied might upset that balance and cause more children and young people to leave the security of a safe environment and risk going to stay with friends, or with people who they do not know well but who can offer them a bed for a few nights, and get drawn into the kind of life where perhaps they take a few drugs or develop a liaison with an older man who can pay them money. I ask the Minister to think very carefully about how this might work out in practice.</p>

It is a long time ago now since I was involved in the world of social work and I do not claim that I was the world&#146;s greatest social worker&#151;far from it. I understand what the noble Earl is saying. We will have to work very closely&#151;we already do&#151;with social services departments and those responsible for child welfare, and clearly they are much more skilled in the way they work and understand that balance. However, I return to the point that there is an entirely benign purpose, in part, behind what we are trying to do. It is important we recognise that we have obligations to those unaccompanied children and we want to assure that they are afforded proper protection.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton has given an interpretation of the figures which I find alarming. Certainly in the brief period in which I was a professional social worker, had I felt that we had as a home failed to protect children&#151;who then went walkabout and were vulnerable to criminals, to those who do not have their best interests at heart and to those who simply wish to use them and manipulate them&#151;I would have been appalled by our record and our failure.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000068"></a>That is our case. That is why we are where we are on this, but we recognise that we must continue to seek excellence and improve our record. Obviously, we need powers to do that.</p>

One has to distinguish between intentions and perceptions. What I am worried about is the perception of the child&#151;and this has been emphasised by other noble Lords. What is all this about? It could not have been put better than in paragraph 54 of <I>Planning Better Outcomes and Support for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children</I>, which stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071275000091"></a>&#147;Restrictions on the use of limited leave will also narrow the scope to make further applications and appeals post 18. This will mean that they are liable to enforced return immediately on turning 18&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071275000090"></a>That is the reality that we are dealing with. We are looking at all this in the context of that. Whatever my noble friend&#146;s intentions are, I urge him, when he goes away from these deliberations before Report, to think very deeply about just how this is seen by the young people themselves and what its consequences will be in reality.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000072"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071275000124"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I, too, find myself not quite as sympathetic towards the Minister&#146;s answers as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has every right to press the points that he made at the start of his intervention concerning the practical effect of these proposals on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Will they be more inclined to co-operate with the arrangements being made by the BIA, knowing, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has just pointed out, that under the changes to be made they will be liable to deportation immediately on their 18th birthday? Therefore, the reporting requirements to be imposed under this clause are specifically designed, as the noble Lord said, to facilitate the removal when the time comes. They will know that just as well as everyone else.</p>

Was this principally a matter of difficulty in documenting foreign national prisoners as they

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000077"></a>I wanted to know whether it was the intention of the Government, in using this clause, to allow foreign national prisoners to be released from custody. At present, because the arrangements for their removal have not been completed, they frequently remain either in the prison or in an immigration removal centre for some further time. I said that if the intention was to avoid that kind of situation, this clause was an excellent idea, but the Minister did not respond to that. Perhaps I can look forward to receiving something in writing.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000078"></a>Coming back to UASC, questions remain unanswered and there are additional concerns over the way that these conditions are to be applied to them, which we have not adequately explored during this short debate. The Government&#146;s consultation document, <I>Planning Better Outcomes and Support for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children</I>, which has been mentioned, also leaves many questions unanswered. In fact, it says nothing at all about reporting, although we are told that the clause is aimed particularly at UASC&#151;and we have discussed that at some length.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000079"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, reminded the Committee that the intake of UASC applying is said to have remained at about 3,000 a year in the past three years, with 6,000 in the pool, because 3,000 come in and 3,000 go out. That is the population of UASC being looked after, while the total number of asylum seekers has declined sharply. I wonder whether the Government think that the global visa regime introduced in 2006 will have any impact on the arrivals of UASC. It would be doubly remarkable if the number of UASC remained stubbornly at this level while the number of asylum seekers sharply declined and continued to do so while the global visa regime, which is intended to have an effect on the numbers, begins to have an impact.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000080"></a>From the sparse information that we have&#151;and I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will provide further details&#151;it looks as though a fairly large proportion of UASC may arrive here from other EU countries and, therefore, be sent back to those countries under Dublin II. I would be grateful if he could provide a single table of applications by UASC in the asylum statistics and for that to be extended to include the outcomes&#151;particularly the number who are granted limited leave to remain, analysed by age, as is the case in many other categories in the quarterly asylum statistics.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000081"></a>The UNHCR handbook says that an adolescent aged 16 or over may be regarded as sufficiently mature to have a well founded fear of persecution, but children of a lower age are presumably all granted limited leave, unless they came from another EU country. I would be grateful if the noble Lord confirmed that as well.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000082"></a>As the consultation document says, the unpredictability of demand for accommodation and other services for UASC makes it difficult for local authorities to invest in procurement strategies, and there may be merit in the suggestion that provision should be confined to a few local authorities with specialist capacity for dealing with UASC. I was surprised that no one mentioned that during this debate, because the reporting restrictions, which have been severely criticised, could be intended to make sure that the UASC reside in the areas of those specialist authorities, if that proposal finds favour with the LGA and the local authorities concerned. It would be useful to hear what the local authorities have said about that in response to the consultation document. As the consultation finished at the end of May, it ought to be possible for the Minister to tell Members something about it today.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071275000083"></a>If there is a consensus in favour of the specialist local authorities, a child could be directed to reside in one of them where it has been agreed that that local authority would provide the specialist accommodation and services for UASC. If they were required to report, under new Section 3(1)(c)(iv) a local officer of the BIA could be established in the area, perhaps in one of the offices of the local authority. I am giving the Minister a useful argument that he might like to use if he can provide us with that sort of information.</p>

<p><a name="07071275000085"></a>We ought to be able to provide some sort of feedback through the LGA from local authorities about the desirability or not of specialist local authorities. Some authorities are undoubtedly more expert in dealing with some of these issues than others, particularly those that have child welfare responsibilities close to the major airports. We need to think carefully about that issue, and I appreciate the sensitivity of it. I will do my best on that. I cannot the give the noble Lord the answers he wants today&#151;it would be unreasonable to expect me to do so&#151;but I am grateful to him.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000003"></a>The noble Lord said: For years now it has been settled government policy that immigration cases, usually asylum seekers, shall not be detained when there is evidence that they may be survivors of previous torture. The reason for that is that the loss of liberty is likely to be bad for their mental and physical health. The Detention Centre Rules 2001, Statutory Instrument 238, are clear on that. Paragraph (1) of Rule 35 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000160"></a>&#147;The medical practitioner shall report to the manager on the case of any detained person whose health is likely to be injuriously affected by continued detention or any conditions of detention&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071286000146"></a>Paragraph (2) deals with suspicions of suicidal intention. Paragraph (3) says that the medical practitioner shall report to the manager any case of a person who he is concerned may have been a victim of torture. Paragraph (4) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000161"></a>&#147;The manager shall send a copy of any report under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) to the Secretary of State without delay&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071286000147"></a>The Home Office&#146;s <I>Operational Enforcement Manual </I>asks, at chapter 38.3, entitled &#147;Factors influencing a decision to detain&#148;,</p>
<ul><a name="07071286000175"></a>&#147;has the subject a history of torture? ... has the subject a history of physical or mental ill health?&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000004"></a>The theory is therefore quite clear, and has been confirmed by government Ministers in both Houses on many occasions. As far back as 1999, a White Paper stated, at paragraph 12.4 on page 53:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000162"></a>&#147;The Government also recognises the need to exercise particular care in the consideration of physical and mental health when deciding to detain. Evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071286000148"></a>and this is most important&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07071286000176"></a>&#147;temporary release whilst an individual&#146;s asylum claim is being considered&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071286000149"></a>I argue that temporary release is equally important in cases where torture survivors failed to establish their right to remain.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000006"></a>The noble Baroness thought that the problem had been solved by medical examinations and proper procedures at removal centres. The next assurance  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC263"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was on 26 February of this year at col. <I>WA 293</I> when the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, quoted me detention centre Rule 35, which has already been mentioned, and mentioned the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. Most recently, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, on 17 May 2007 at col. 282, assured me that effective procedures are in place for detained people who allege torture or rape.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000007"></a>The replies and assurances are absolutely consistent in upholding the theory of good practice and the intention to prevent the undesirable detention of survivors of torture and rape, as well as other vulnerable people. So why have Members of both Houses felt it necessary to go on asking Questions and complaining about continuing bad practice? I believe that it is because they and the NGOs in the field regularly come across cases where the good theory is seriously disregarded.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000008"></a>I will now give recent examples of cases and detention removal centres where things appear to be going wrong. At Yarl&#146;s Wood in May of this year, 70 per cent of the large sample of women alleged rape and 57 per cent stated that they had no legal representation. On 3 July, the Minister himself replied to a Question from me that the figures of those reporting rape could not be confirmed as this would involve disproportionate cost. That suggests that the figures were high and yet the women were detained. One hundred women wrote to the Prime Minister with a variety of complaints. The <I>Observer</I> reported that nearly one-half of its sample of women had been in detention for more than three months. That hardly squares with the Minister&#146;s assertion to me that the average length of stay in May was seven to 10 days. Will the Government therefore investigate all cases of detention exceeding one month?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000009"></a>I now turn to two recent relevant cases of torture survivors. In neither case was access provided to the medical foundation. I have seen a medical report on Mr Francis Kahiga. He is Ugandan and arrived here in 2006. Because he came on a false passport, he was imprisoned and then detained at Harmondsworth and later at Campsfield House for over nine months. He claimed to have suffered torture when he arrived, but nothing was done to verify his claim or to pass on information about him, until he was examined by an independent doctor on 12 May at the request of a voluntary organisation.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000010"></a>My second example is Mr Peter Etame, who comes from the Cameroons. His immigration reference number is E 105-58-8886 and, again, I have seen the medical report of May this year. He arrived here in 2004 and was granted temporary admission after claiming that he had been tortured. Unfortunately, he worked to support himself and served a prison sentence for that. He was then detained at Campsfield from November of last year. Medical evidence confirms that he was tortured and raped while in prison in the Cameroons on account of his same-sex orientation, following attacks on him by his own parents and neighbours. Once again, the proper procedures were not followed in England and the length of detention has been excessive, particularly

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000011"></a>I am therefore right to assert, as I did on 17 May, that the Home Office has allowed its own rules and guidelines to be breached by both BIA employees and private contractors. It is essential that the Home Office complies with its responsibilities under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and implements the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The repeated assurances given by Ministers must, I suggest, cease to be purely verbal.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000012"></a>My Amendment No. 31 goes to the root of the problems by providing exemptions to schedules to the 1971 Act which permit immigration and asylum detention. It is intended to cover detention before an asylum hearing or appeal and afterwards, prior to any removal. The Minister may say that it goes too wide by turning on the person&#146;s claim to have survived torture. I believe that that is justified by reducing the risk of harm to mental and physical health and by making possible the necessary medical verification and appropriate support and therapy. If a claim is not verified, a new application to detain should be made.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000013"></a>The Committee will notice that two distinguished medical Peers have added their names to this amendment. I am glad to see the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in her place and also to have had the support in writing of the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice. The noble Lord, Lord Rea, also told me that he wanted to add his name but was prevented by early printing of the Marshalled List. There can thus be no doubt that I have strong medical support from all parts of the House.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000016"></a>We know that, under Rule 35, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate collates pro forma letters informing of alleged torture, but there is no feedback in this process. Therefore, it is purely a paper exercise which could be deemed almost meaningless.</p>

First, especially early on, they rarely disclose that they have been tortured and the way in which they have been tortured because they are deeply traumatised by what has happened to them. They do not know who to trust. They do not know whether by confiding in one person they will make their situation worse. They are disoriented, often both about place and their own identity, because part of the process of torture is to begin to break the person&#146;s internal spirit, their knowledge of who they are and their own personhood. The other problem is that they suffer flashbacks and are deeply, deeply traumatised.

<a name="70712-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000018"></a>We all know or have seen survivors from the Second World War who have never spoken to anybody until they get near their own death, when they may finally talk about some of the things that they have suffered&#151;even when they have their own family to trust. That is the depth of the trauma that they may be dealing with. We know, too, that the Immigration and Nationality Directive healthcare staff are not trained in handling victims of torture. They do not know how to ask questions in a way to facilitate disclosure. The Border and Immigration Agency officers have little or no training, and they do not ask questions about torture in the screening interview at all. It is not a subject that is raised or allowed on the table.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000019"></a>The second big problem is that these people who are so deeply traumatised need care, treatment and support. Without that their situation is aggravated by being left and ignored. We know that incarceration is a disaster for them. The Yarl&#146;s Wood report highlighted how deeply damaging it is. David Rhys Jones from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000163"></a>&#147;Detaining torture survivors is apt to trigger flashbacks and nightmares. They experience very real mental anguish at being locked up. Once the Home Office has been notified, such detainees should be released so their cases can be properly appraised without them being subject to further suffering&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000020"></a>I fully accept that it is a sad reality that some people in seeking asylum will claim to have been tortured when they have not. It is a sad fact of how human beings behave. It is incredibly important that these people are not only assessed, but repeatedly reassessed. It is that process of reassessment that builds up trust and allows them to disclose, and that process reveals who is making a false claim versus who really has suffered terribly. It is the most reliable way to discriminate between these groups. Given that some people have no external marks at all, that becomes particularly important.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000021"></a>However, I would point out that the Government in their White Paper, <I>Fairer, Faster and Firmer</I>, which goes back to July 1998, recognised that there was a problem. Yet holding asylum seekers in prison now conflicts with that policy. It is also contrary to the guidelines from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and from the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. To ignore that would seem to make a mockery of the Home Office&#146;s previous undertaking, and it would seem to compound the unspeakable and gross inhumanity of the torture that these people have already suffered to incarcerate them, lock them up&#151;often with people with a criminal background, who have no understanding or wish to understand or support them.</p>

The facts are truly horrific. No matter how impeccable the guidelines, it seems that the implementation illustrates unacceptable practice. One of the studies that was carried out by Medical Justice was of 500 individual detainees from four different detention centres. Twenty out of 56 who have now been thoroughly analysed show physical signs typical of torture, but in no cases had the Home Office investigated allegations of torture or offered medical assistance, which is in breach of statutory duties. It is true, as has been said before, that most people who have suffered torture are reluctant to reveal the extent of it because of the wholly dehumanising process that torture engenders and the shame that people feel for having allowed themselves to become so depersonalised. That results in severe depression, which is immediately exacerbated by being held in detention. Many of those examined by Medical Justice were suicidal.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000023"></a>I shall cite a couple of cases. In one case immigration authorities disbelieved the story of a woman from Uganda who had been repeatedly raped and tortured. She was taken from detention centre for deportation with five escorts, but became so unruly that the deportation did not succeed&#151;whereupon an immigration officer let it be known to her that the army in Uganda would be informed of her return if she did not co-operate. That is almost Kafkaesque; not believing her story and then saying, &#147;We are going to inform the army so that you will undoubtedly be detained again if you are returned&#148;. These things are not conducive to good health.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000024"></a>A woman who was removed from detention to Malawi, despite the fact that a judicial review had been lodged and the immigration authorities had agreed that deportation should stop, was nevertheless deported because the escorts claimed they never got the message. I find it incredible, where people&#146;s lives are concerned, that there are mistakes of that kind. Surely there should be procedures in every possible Bill to ensure that this does not happen in the future. </p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000025"></a>There are many cases of people in detention who are the victims of disputed nationality. I am sure your Lordships will know that that can happen very frequently. I am thinking in particular about a group of Zimbabweans. There is one case that a lot of people are dealing with at the moment, where a Zimbabwean national&#151;he had a Zimbabwean medical card, he has brothers and sisters there, he has a school record&#151;escaped illegal detention and torture and fled to Malawi. He was unable to get a visa while he was in Zimbabwe, for understandable reasons. He bought a passport in Malawi, admittedly in an irregular way, and then came to this country. He is threatened with deportation back to Malawi. There appears to be a lot of agreement, even collusion, between the immigration authorities and the Malawian High Commission about accepting this guy as a Malawian citizen, but he would nevertheless be

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000026"></a>It is worth considering that we argued in the House not so long ago that terrorists should not be detained for longer than 28 days without charge, yet it appears that we are able to detain torture victims for up to two years. That is an anomaly that should not be accepted. The need to treat torture survivors with humanity and dignity cannot be overestimated. That is why I support the amendment, and wish to see it in the Bill and in any others that seem relevant.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000027"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071286000189"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is to be warmly congratulated on the many times that he has raised the issue of torture victims on the Floor of the House and in Grand Committee, particularly on the occasion he mentioned, on 17 May, when there was a useful exchange at Question Time. I asked the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, about the three successive reports of the chief inspector, Anne Owers, on Dungavel, Campsfield House and Harmondsworth, in which she found that healthcare staff were not trained in dealing with victims of torture. Although pro forma letters were being sent to the headquarters of the BIA in accordance with Rule 35 notifying the allegations of torture made by detainees, there was hardly any feedback, as the  noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has mentioned. The Minister claimed that the case management process had been changed to enhance the opportunity of identifying cases where individuals may need additional support, though we were not talking about support but the recognition of torture victims and their appropriate treatment, as I wrote to the Minister afterwards.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000028"></a>In her reply to the supplementary question of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, the Minister referred to detainees who are &#147;fast-tracked through NSA procedures&#148;. Such claimants are dealt with under the fast-track procedure rules&#151;SI 2005 No. 560&#151;which provide that where a claimant alleges that she has been tortured and the allegation is not manifestly frivolous or ill founded, it would be expected that under Rule 30(1)(b) the claimant would be transferred out of the fast-track system with a view to obtaining expert medical evidence. We have no idea whether that happens, because the asylum statistics do not go into that level of detail. Although I raised the matter in my letter to the Minister of 21 May, she did not refer to that letter&#151;nor has she replied to it&#151;in the letter that she wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, of 13 June.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000029"></a>NSA cases are an entirely different matter and not to be confused with the fast track. NSA claimants are removed to their country of origin without any hearing, so the question of an in-country appeal by an NSA applicant on the basis of a torture claim must be almost unheard of. I asked the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, whether there were any cases in 2006 where an NSA applicant had exceptionally been given an in-country right of appeal because of a credible prima facie allegation of torture but, again, she has not replied.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC268"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000030"></a>Most NSAs are held at Oakington, and I asked for details of the 72 persons out of a total of 2,893 who had been released for Medical Foundation appointments pre-decision but who all failed to substantiate their claims, according to the noble and learned Baroness. I asked her to let me know how many of the 72 claims of torture were found to be ill founded by the Medical Foundation, and how many had had their asylum claims rejected in spite of medical reports by the Medical Foundation or other independent medical experts confirming that there was evidence of torture.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000031"></a>I also referred the Minister to significant anecdotal evidence of people being detained with no prior medical examination or only a perfunctory one, though the chief inspector reports a large number of pro forma Rule 35 letters which could not be reconciled with the statistics that she gave. I asked her to give me the number of Rule 35 letters that were issued at each of the IRCs in 2006, and the number at each referred to the Medical Foundation or to another doctor with experience of torture victims. I wanted to know why the action was not taken on the chief inspector&#146;s repeated complaint that Rule 35 letters were not followed up. I asked for an assurance that they were now being properly scrutinised by the case holders under the new asylum model, with prompt action taken where this revealed that there were grounds for believing that the person may have been tortured, followed by feedback from the case holders to the IRC concerned.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000032"></a>Having unsuccessfully looked for BIA responses to the three reports by the chief inspector that I have mentioned, I asked the Minister what was the practice on publication of responses and, if they were not in the public domain, whether that did not mean that Ministers and officials were able to ignore the findings with impunity, as they appear to have done on the Rule 35 letters. I would like an answer to that question. Where can one see the responses by the Secretary of State to the successive reports that have been made by the chief inspector in which she has made allegations about the failure to follow up Rule 35 letters? If the Minister and his colleagues do not reply to these allegations&#151;or do not reply for many months afterwards&#151;we have no check on whether these recommendations are being followed up.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000033"></a>The Minister made clear in her letter to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, dealing with a sample of 21 cases in which it was alleged that procedures for torture cases were not properly followed, that in the majority of these cases&#151;17 out of the 21&#151;the torture allegation had been considered at the asylum decision stage or at appeal, or both. In other words, there was no separate consideration of the decision to detain, as we say that there should be in compliance with Chapter 38.3, paragraph 5 of the <I>Operational Enforcement Manual</I>, which says that in considering whether to detain, account must be taken of any history of torture. In other words, if there is an allegation of torture form&#151;the Rule 35 letter&#151;and the statements made in it are not manifestly ill founded, there has to be consideration of the decision to detain, quite separate from the determination of the asylum claim. The Minister&#146;s letter acknowledged  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that in the 17 cases cited, that did not happen. It seems to us that Mr Hyde, the senior police officer who was brought in to audit the cases, wrongly advised the Minister that, as she said,</p>
<ul><a name="07071286000177"></a>&#147;procedures relating to the new form for recording torture were being correctly applied&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000034"></a>Since the Minister decided on reflection, as she told me, that Mr Hyde&#146;s report was not to be published, we shall never know how he managed to reconcile his conclusion with the language of the <I>Operational Enforcement Manual</I>. Again, I should like an answer from the Minister on that question.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred to two further cases submitted by Bail for Immigration Detainees, in which it alleges that the Home Office is in breach of its own guidelines. We are also owed a reply from the Minister to that letter, which was sent on 20 June. I assume that the department would have taken particular steps to see that it was replied to before the matter came before the Grand Committee. If the letter has not yet been answered, will he put a bomb under the officials in the Home Office who have to deal with these matters? It really is insufferable that when we are discussing matters in Grand Committee we do not have the answers to very important questions raised by agencies such as BID.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000036"></a>In response to the JCHR&#146;s concerns expressed in paragraph 236 of its report on the treatment of asylum seekers, the Home Office says that where independent evidence is produced that supports a claim to have been tortured, detention would not normally be appropriate. However, the fact is that BID&#146;s cases and others show there is still a gap between what Marsham Street says is supposed to happen, and what is actually going on in the IRCs.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000037"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, suggests that a claim to have been tortured should automatically lead to the person&#146;s release from detention or prevent him being detained if he is at liberty. Perhaps he might agree that this should be so only when the claim is not manifestly ill founded, or his amendment could lead to a spate of spurious claims. But he is surely right to say that a person whose claim seems to be plausible should have the benefit of the doubt and should not be detained, unless and until he has been examined by a doctor with experience of torture, and that doctor has certified that there is no medical evidence to support the claim. The person could still adduce non-medical evidence of torture in support of his asylum claim, and this would still have to be considered separately. But at least when there were sequelae following torture including rape, that could be uncovered by a medical examination and detention could be ruled out immediately.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000039"></a>When a woman has, for instance, been raped repeatedly in a culture where it is taboo to talk about sex and has to talk about this for the first time with an interviewer, it is vital that the interviewer is supported. I warmly welcome the attention given by the Government to the workforce in this area and the increased diversity of the workforce and case managers. But there is such horror attached to this work, that one is reminded of the words of TS Eliot, who wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000164"></a>&#147;Humankind cannot bear too much reality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071286000150"></a>Some things are just too unbearable to consider and the danger is that a case manager may be led to deny what he is hearing, simply because he cannot bear to consider it himself. Therefore, training is important and perhaps the Minister might write to me about that.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000040"></a>It is also essential that these decision makers should have the same supervision that probation officers, social workers and staff in children&#146;s homes receive. I know that this will be costly and it will take time for it to come about, but I would be grateful if the Minister could inform me what the timescale for this change will be. I understand that the Border and Immigration Agency is considering this and I would be grateful to hear any details that the Minister can provide.</p>

I know that I am not alone by a very long chalk and assure my noble friend that many noble Lords on the Labour Benches feel every bit as strongly as noble Lords who have spoken. I warmly thank the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for his amendment, wish him well with it, and urge on my noble friend the paramount importance of taking it seriously, replying as fully as he can this afternoon and, as this Grand Committee procedure enables him to do, going away and considering in depth the points that have been made and how the Government might respond to them.</p>

He will remember that my noble friend and I raised these questions back in the previous millennium. I am sorry that we still have to go on doing that.

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, said in 1999, during the passage of the Immigration and Asylum Bill, that,</p>

<p><a name="07071286000151"></a>He was not enthusiastic about giving detailed reasons, but he took seriously the question of torture and gave undertakings that any history of torture would at least be recorded. The Government have frequently

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000165"></a>&#147;The Government also recognises the need to exercise particular care in the consideration of physical and mental health when deciding to detain. Evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or temporary release whilst an individual&#146;s asylum claim is being considered&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000043"></a>Since then, we have had evidence, not least from the Chief Inspector of Prisons, as has been mentioned, and from my three noble friends today, that torture is still being missed at various stages of asylum procedure, even now calling into question, as my noble friend mentioned, the training of case officers under the new asylum model&#151;the people who have to make those important initial decisions.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000044"></a>The chief inspector&#146;s annual report of 2005-06 has been mentioned. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000166"></a>&#147;A particular problem highlighted in inspection reports, and confirmed in the inquiry into the healthcare provision at Yarl&#146;s Wood, was the inadequate use of procedures to alert the authorities to the fact that detention may be injurious to a detainee&#146;s health, under Rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules. Healthcare staff lacked specific training to recognise and understand signs of trauma or previous torture. Even when such information was provided, we could find no evidence in any IRC that this had been systematically filed, monitored, responded to or followed up by IND&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000045"></a>I support any efforts to raise this issue. The Minister may think that this is a sledgehammer but it is a very large nut to crack.</p>

Has that information been sought? Is a doctor or another professional able to assess it? Furthermore, how many have claimed that they are victims of torture?

There may be occasions later when I shall not speak to an amendment because I do not consider it is my job to do the Government&#146;s work for them and explain why it would not be right to accept an amendment. However, on this occasion, it is right that I continue to give the reason why we on these Benches cannot support the amendment.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000048"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, 100 per cent in what he seeks to do. The principle should be that the guidance and good practice that is supposed to be followed by the BIA or the IND should be followed. There should not be these errors. All noble Lords will be greatly concerned to have heard the instances given today of when good practice appears to have gone out of the window in respect of those who not only have claimed torture but, it would appear, have a substantiated claim that they have undergone it. There can be no doubt that all noble Lords would wish to ensure that those who have been subjected to torture should be treated in the right way. Whether that is extended on every occasion to those

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000049"></a>As I have said before to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, on these occasions, I have concerns about the unintended consequences of the amendment. One could be picky and say that that does not define torture, but that goes to the core of the issue. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, was right to refer to mental health. We know that if one is subjected to torture it can have a huge adverse effect on one&#146;s mental health. We need to know how one would define torture if an amendment such as this were put into the Bill, because the amendment has significant consequences and confers significant protections against detention.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, helpfully pointed out that some amendments might be required to make the amendment more roadworthy. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, spoke, I not only agreed with him but thought of several more ways in which the amendment would need to be tweaked. The more I thought about it, the more I realised that it would be extremely difficult to bring the amendment to the condition in which it could be put into the Bill. There has to be so much flexibility in determining how one deals with different people who claim for different reasons that they have been subject to torture.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000051"></a>Let me give an example. On this occasion, I will do the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, the honour of giving him a different example; I shall change my grounds and give him a more up-to-date one which occurred to me after I had read a report of UNICEF UK and Amnesty. I had been looking at the conditions of people in Darfur, as have all noble Lords, and was considering the case of a member of the Janjaweed who had raped, pillaged and murdered&#151;you name it&#151;but came to this country under another nationality, by an indirect route, to claim asylum. He did so because he had double-crossed other members of the Janjaweed, which, of course, is fluid in the way it operates. He had double-crossed his own thuggery chief and had himself then been subjected to torture. So here was a person, a member of the Janjaweed who had perpetrated the most appalling crimes on people there, and yet had come here, masquerading as a different nationality, and claimed that he had been tortured.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000052"></a>Consider then, if there were a case&#151;and I do not know whether there is&#151;of a woman in Darfur who had been raped by a member of the Janjaweed, who comes here and claims that she has been subjected to torture and should also therefore find respite under the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. As it is drafted, I would expect the amendment to treat both those people equally and exempt them from detention. I do not believe that is what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, expects. I give way to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000055"></a>One has to consider that the blanket protection given by the amendment means that a person who genuinely claims he has been tortured, who is someone to whom a country would wish to give protection, will be treated in the same way as someone who has abused others. The question is: should they or should they not be given exactly the same exemption? That is the kind of question that noble Lords would have to answer if the amendment were to return in its current state on another occasion when it could be pressed to a Division. Having listened to the debate so far, but without the benefit of listening yet to the Minister, if I were put in that position, I could not support the amendment and I would ask my noble friends not to do so.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000056"></a>I am careful to cover this at some length because noble Lords will know that I am shortly to enter a period of silence in a different guise and that my noble friend Lady Hanham will have the fantastic experience of taking over this wonderful brief in which one hears the great experience of noble Lords. It covers the most difficult of issues and my noble friend will have to read these debates to see why I would not support the amendment. At first sight, supporting the amendment seems the most honourable thing to do, but I fear it would have unintended consequences.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000057"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071286000197"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I do not know whether I have congratulated the noble Baroness publicly on her elevation to the post of opposition Chief Whip in the next Session. If I have not, I certainly ought to. It is a congratulation that is most heartfelt because the noble Baroness has been a tremendous advocate for her party over these past few years, on this and on many other Bills, and I have enjoyed our time in the Chamber and in Committee. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, will work equally as hard to put forward the best possible case in all circumstances. She should be inspired by the earlier work of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000058"></a>This is a difficult area of debate and that is clear from the discussion that has taken place in the past three-quarters of an hour. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has drawn out one of those tricky issues&#151;certainly one that is hard to resolve. It is obviously a difficult area for the Government. Most of us can probably recount a story or two of people we either know or have had some contact with who have been subjected to torture. I have friends who fall into that category, going back to the time of Pinochet&#146;s Chile. I was grateful that this country provided Chileans with a place of fresh refuge, and quite rightly so. Some things that were done under that regime do not bear repeating; they were fairly unpleasant and appalling. We should do all that we can to tackle torture internationally and we do exactly that. We as a country should treat people decently when they properly come here to seek refuge and claim torture as the reason for that.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC274"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000059"></a>However, that does not mean that we must in any way demur from the rigours that need to be properly applied in terms of immigration procedures and that we should not properly question those claims because we should if we are to retain the integrity of our immigration system. The proposed new clause seeks to create a blanket exemption from immigration detention for any person who claims to have been a victim of torture&#151;and I fully understand why. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is a keen and passionate advocate of the issue and he has set out his argument very clearly in his presentation today. I know that he has had many exchanges in the past, not only with me, but with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000060"></a>I entirely understand the noble Lord&#146;s motivation: it is one that I appreciate and I appreciate his sincere concern for victims of torture. But the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, will not be surprised to hear that we cannot accept this new clause. The current position is that our stated policy and the published guidance issued to border and immigration staff make it clear that the history of torture is one of those factors that must be taken into account in determining whether to detain a person and would normally render the person concerned unsuitable for detention other than in exceptional circumstances. Independent evidence of torture will, of course, weigh heavily against detaining an individual.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000061"></a>That is not to say that there will be no circumstances in which a person who may have been, or at least claims to have been, a victim of torture might be detained. For one thing, an allegation or independent evidence of torture may come to light only after a person has been detained, for very good reasons. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, said earlier that victims were often reluctant to explain why they had come here and why they were seeking asylum and refuge. We understand that. In those cases, the information would have to be considered in deciding whether detention should continue.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000062"></a>There will be other circumstances where a person who may have been the victim of torture may be detained, perhaps in the sort of case mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. For example, detention might be appropriate for reasons of public protection in the case of convicted criminals. A person might be a persistent absconder. It might be appropriate in the case of a person who is to be returned to a third country for consideration of their asylum claim or, most commonly, it is likely to be appropriate in the case of persons who have no lawful basis to remain in the United Kingdom and whose removal is to be enforced.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000063"></a>Cases have to be considered on their individual merits and all factors arguing either for or against detention must be taken into account in deciding whether to authorise detention. Systems are in place to ensure that allegations of torture made by detainees are reported. Reference was made to Rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001. Under that rule, the doctor at a removal centre is required to report any concerns that a detainee may have been the  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC275"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>victim of torture. Procedures are in place to ensure that such reports are passed to those in the Border and Immigration Agency responsible for managing a person's detention and properly considering their case. The report must be taken into account in deciding whether continued detention is justifiable and appropriate.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000064"></a>The noble Lord will know that we have recently made improvements to those systems. A standardised reporting form has been introduced and agency staff have been instructed on the need to acknowledge receipt of reports. A random sample of cases was checked to ensure that reports had been received by the relevant case workers and acted on appropriately. It was confirmed that they had been. The agency is also exploring the possibility of providing training to removal centre healthcare teams on identifying victims of torture. Not all claims of torture will be accepted and not all claims of ill treatment, even if accepted as having occurred, will amount to torture. Even where a claim of torture is not disputed, there will be circumstances where detention may still be appropriate, as I set out earlier.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000065"></a>This new clause would prevent the proper detention of any person who claimed to have been the victim of torture. It would not be necessary for the person to substantiate his claim&#151;acceptance of the claim would be irrelevant and it would not matter if the claim were manifestly false. The mere fact of having made a claim would suffice to trigger blanket exemption. From a government perspective, that is unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000066"></a>The new clause would also create a potentially significant gap in our ability to ensure and enforce compliance with immigration rules and would almost certainly be exploited by those intent on circumventing those laws. Detention has a key part to play in maintaining effective immigration control and a robust but fair asylum system. That has to be the case. The new clause would seriously undermine that aim and, in our view, would serve only to encourage widespread abuse of the system. We cannot tolerate that. For those reasons, we cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000067"></a>Understandably, a whole range of questions was asked during noble Lords&#146; presentations in the debate. I want to deal, first, with an issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, which relates to the correspondence, outstanding letters and e-mails that he conducted with my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland. As the noble Lord knows, my noble and learned friend has moved on and is now the Attorney-General. My noble friend Lord West will write shortly to the noble Lord to respond to the various outstanding items. I may have already responded to some of them in the correspondence that I have been conducting with noble Lords as part of our Committee proceedings.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000068"></a>There were also questions relating to training. Training is obviously provided to those who have to conduct interviews. They receive instruction on dealing sensitively with asylum applicants who claim to have been tortured or raped.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC276"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07071286000069"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071286000198"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> That is contrary to what the chief inspector said in the three reports that I mentioned. In the cases of Dungavel, Campsfield and Harmondsworth, the chief inspector repeated the allegation that healthcare staff were not trained to deal with victims of torture.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000070"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071286000199"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I was talking about whether case workers and case owners were trained, and certainly they do receive training. I was not referring directly to healthcare staff. However, I accept that training is an issue and we are clear that we need to make improvements in the quality of the training. We have had the benefit of the chief inspector&#146;s report and no doubt that will inform the way in which we approach this issue in the future.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000071"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked more specifically about specialised training. As part of their training, Border and Immigration Agency case workers dealing with the backlog of outstanding asylum claims in the case resolution directorate and case owners dealing with cases under new asylum procedures receive instructions on dealing sensitively with asylum applicants who make claims of torture and rape. That is dealt with in the foundation training programme for case owners dealing with cases under the new asylum model procedures. It is there at an early stage and there is a specific element within the interview skills module. It is an important element of the training programme.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000072"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about the competence of removal centre doctors and addressed the question of whether they are required to assess allegations of torture and whether they are competent to do so. That issue is also of interest to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. Removal centre doctors are not expected to assess torture allegations, nor could it be fairly argued that they are competent to do so; they are merely required to report concerns that a person may have been a victim of torture. Those concerns may arise from their own observation or examination of the individual, they may be based on allegations made by the individual concerned, or they may be based on a combination of those circumstances. We are exploring the possibility of providing some further training to removal centre doctors on identifying victims of torture, but it is not an easy field and there are no easy answers in terms of improving the quality of understanding on those issues, as I am sure Members of the Committee can appreciate.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked whether the Government would investigate all cases of those detained for over one month. All cases are already kept under regular review at successively higher levels within the Border and Immigration Agency. Detention lasts for no longer than is necessary and is not prolonged unduly. Individuals may apply for bail at any point and may challenge the lawfulness of detention through the process of judicial review and habeas corpus.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000074"></a>Questions have generally been raised, although I am not quite sure who by, about how many torture allegation reports have been sent to the Border and  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC277"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Immigration Agency. The data I have are from January 2007 to the end of last June and show that some 703 reports were referred to the BIA. Central records were not maintained before that time, when the standardised reporting form was introduced. For that reason I am afraid figures for 2006 are not available. Case workers have instructions to consider the reports in terms of any asylum claim and the appropriateness of continued detention, as I explained earlier. They also provide acknowledgment of receipt to the removal centre doctor.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000075"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071286000200"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am sorry to interrupt, but what Anne Owers specifically complained about was not the filling in of the Rule 35 letters, which she said was more or less universally done by the IRCs, but the lack of feedback from the BIA, when it considers those letters, to the management of the IRC on future action.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000076"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071286000201"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Clearly that is an issue which we need to look at and address. I am grateful to the noble Lord for his comments. He also asked questions in his commentary relating to the response to the chief inspector&#146;s reports on Dungavel, Campsfield House and Harmondsworth removal centres. The action plan responding to the recommendations made in the report on Dungavel has been issued, and a copy of that has been placed in the Library. We have deferred responding to the Campsfield House and Harmondsworth reports pending the report of the investigation of the disturbances at the two centres, which is being carried out by Mr Robert Whalley, a retired civil servant who, I can attest, is very experienced at dealing with these issues. We have done that because we want to ensure that our response to the chief inspector&#146;s report can take into account any issues arising from that more recent investigation. We expect to receive Mr Whalley&#146;s report shortly, and it will be published as soon as possible. Copies of our action plans responding to the chief inspector&#146;s report on Campsfield House and Harmondsworth will be placed in the Library.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000077"></a>The question also arose as to whether we would publish the results and the report of the internal audit of torture allegations carried out by the agency. It would be fair to say that the audit was an informal checking exercise completed by officials and, as such, there is no report that could be published. However, the results of the exercise showed that instructions to staff and the appropriate procedures were being followed. In the sample of the 21 cases in which torture allegation reports had been sent to BIA caseworkers from removal centres, 17 concerned cases in which asylum applications had already been refused and where appeal rights had been exhausted. In each case, torture allegations had already been raised and considered in the initial asylum decision and at appeal. Three cases involved proposed removal to a third country and one was at a very early stage of the asylum process. In no case within the sample did  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the allegation of torture report raise new information. The allegations of torture would not therefore call into question the continued detention that would have been considered on receipt of the Rule 35 reports.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, raised the issue of mental health. I accept that that is a proper concern about detainees but, interestingly, an audit completed by doctors in 2006 found a very low level of incidence of mental ill health problems&#151;lower, in fact, than one might expect to find in the community generally. In a way, one can understand why that might be, because these particular people have had great strength of character in getting themselves to the position that they have. All centres are required to have registered mental nurses on the healthcare staff and visiting consultant psychiatrists will ensure that there is proper access to secondary and tertiary care, including for mental ill health issues.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000079"></a>The final point that I have to deal with was raised by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who asked for some correspondence relating to the supervision of care managers and how it is intended that that will be introduced. I have scoured my notes and asked officials, but I do not have any material with which I can reply to the noble Earl this afternoon. However, I accept that it is an important issue and, clearly, we want to ensure that we have proper models of supervision in place; it is quite properly an issue that we need to be on top of. I think that we are on top of it, but I should be happy to write and describe that managerial process for the noble Earl. Of course, I shall share that with other Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000080"></a>That was a full response but I have tried to answer all the various points. I accept that this is a very difficult and sensitive issue.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000081"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071286000202"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I thank the Minister. It was most kind of him to make that point. To be clear, I meant to say case owners rather than care managers.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000082"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07071286000203"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> We have had a very comprehensive short debate on this matter. There is hardly an aspect of a very complex question that has not been covered in some way or another&#151;and it is a question that has been causing trouble for a very long time. I am most grateful to those who have spoken in support of my amendment and even to those who have only expressed mild sympathy for it. It was particularly valuable that the guidelines of the UN Commissioner for Refugees were mentioned and the study of a large sample of cases by my noble friend Lady D'Souza. Of course, the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, gave us the benefit of her profound medical and psychological knowledge. I am grateful also to the noble Lord for the replies that he has given to the other questions raised; we will study them with great care. I am disappointed that the Minister did not say that he would take away the amendment and consult with his colleagues about it.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000083"></a>There are two possible approaches to this difficult matter. One approach would be through administrative means of a variety of kinds, but experience has shown over a long period of years that administrative means

I support Amendment No. 32 because it provides us with an opportunity to end one of the most inhumane aspects of our present policy: the terrible destitution of

It is a destitution suffered by extraordinarily large numbers of vulnerable people. The latest figure I saw was 280,000, but I suspect no one knows how many people are destitute up and down this land today. If that figure is true, it is about the size of the population of the city of Newcastle, where I live.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000089"></a>One of those 280,000 people&#151;if it is 280,000&#151;who lives in Newcastle is a woman called Milly. She is a 48 year-old from the Congo who arrived in this country in 2004. She was refused asylum despite her experiences of rape and detention in one of the most dangerous and volatile countries in Africa. Her case was eventually dismissed in February 2006; her accommodation was stopped and her &#163;40 a week support was also stopped. She has been destitute ever since for about 18 months. Hardly surprisingly, she suffers from depression, and she constantly moves from place to place looking for somewhere to sleep. Her story is typical of so many whose applications have been refused and whose only option is to rely on churches, charities and voluntary groups for support. </p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000090"></a>At one point last year, in the centre of Newcastle, we discovered that more than 300 people were living&#151;&#147;existing&#148; is a better way of putting it&#151;without any means of support at all; no home, no food, no cash, nothing. That is frightening, and it is not surprising that the voluntary bodies, which provide a little&#151;it is a little&#151;by issuing the likes of food parcels and the occasional box of toiletries, are in danger of being overwhelmed. What have we come to, I wonder?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000091"></a>First, the amendment seeks to provide the opportunity to end once and for all the destitution of refused asylum seekers by allowing them to have access to the financial and housing support that they desperately need. Secondly, it will ensure that they have access to secondary healthcare. On this latter point, the 2004 regulations, for example, deny someone treatment for cancer and force pregnant women to give birth alone, wherever they happen to be living or staying. That seems to be a shameful situation for any society that claims to be civilised.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000092"></a>How many of us have sat down and talked to someone who has nothing&#151;no money, no home, no family and no security&#151;but is simply full of painful memories? When you sit and talk to someone in that situation, you cannot but change your view of what life is like in Britain today.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000093"></a>Of course, I accept that there must be safe and sustainable means of return to the country of origin for those who have no protection needs. However, until that is achieved, surely there must be a basic right to a basic means of existence. The amendment provides that. I hope that it will receive the Minister&#146;s support and that the Government will show a more caring and humane response and a more human face than is experienced by many, many people as a result of our present and harsh asylum system. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC281"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I should say at the outset that my amendment is not as comprehensive as his, but obviously I completely endorse and support everything that he said in putting forward his amendment.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000095"></a>From time to time in this Committee, I have brought messages from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Perhaps I could do so again in support of the right reverend Prelate and in support of my own amendment. It is interesting that the committee started what it had to say by doing exactly what the right reverend Prelate did&#151;that is, to welcome the clause in so far as it goes. However, we continued to have great anxieties. In our report, we drew attention to the fact that, in our recent report on the treatment of asylum seekers, we had been persuaded by the evidence that, whatever their intentions, the Government had been practising what was, in effect, a deliberate policy of destitution in relation to asylum seekers and that such deliberate use of inhumane treatment was obviously unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000096"></a>Refused asylum seekers pursuing an appeal receive no support as the law is currently interpreted. The committee therefore welcomed the fact that, like us, the Government had come to the conclusion that such destitution was unacceptable. However, we made a number of recommendations for legislative changes at the earliest opportunity to end the deliberate use of destitution as an instrument of policy. The committee believed that the present provided just such an opportunity to implement some of our proposals&#151;and they are there in our report. We therefore recommended that to reduce the risk of asylum seekers being subjected to inhumane treatment contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to ensure that they are treated with common humanity, as the common law requires, the Bill should be amended to provide for this. I believe that our amendments seek to achieve that purpose and, in proposing my own, I warmly endorse what the right reverend Prelate said.</p>

That does not mean to say that I do not support the right reverend Prelate&#146;s Amendment No. 32. However, I shall raise one or two minor points about it. First, I wonder whether it goes sufficiently wide, particularly in the direction of the dependant children of families already in this country. Secondly, in subsection (1)(d) it refers to those who remain in the UK following the making of a claim. Would that also cover those whose cases fail but who cannot be returned to their country of origin, for one reason or another?</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000098"></a>At Second Reading I mentioned the significant numbers of asylum applicants who failed to present their cases to the high standard required for refugee status. Many of those thus refused have not been deported, nor have they been able to return voluntarily. Many genuinely need humanitarian protection because they come from countries in turmoil such as Iraq, Somalia or Darfur, or countries suffering repression such as Iran, Burma or China. Others are at risk because of their religious beliefs.  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC282"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, I have to ask why the old category of exceptional leave to remain has been so sparingly used in recent years? Will the Government enable those who have been refused refugee status to appeal for exceptional leave to remain when they have real protection needs? Exceptional leave, if granted, would enable them to work&#151;and that is a very important point&#151;because it would reduce the demand for welfare benefits, generate tax revenues and, above all, prevent destitution. It would have the further merit of meeting at least part of the current demand for temporary migrant workers. Ministers frequently speak of the importance of building social cohesion and reducing the size of the black and grey economies.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000099"></a>Those are some reasons why I support Amendment No. 33 and the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. However, I suggest that what I have asked for is fully compatible with other direct attempts to prevent destitution. I suggest that the Government should grasp both approaches since they both seek to achieve policy aims that various Ministers have stated over and over again.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000100"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071286000207"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The right reverend Prelate said that he hoped the amendment would receive support from the Government. If it does, it will be the first time any amendment has done so during the 12 hours or so that we have been sitting in Grand Committee, so I am not quite as optimistic as he is.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000101"></a>The right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, have already covered much of the ground in the report <I>Still Human Still Here</I>, which makes a valuable contribution to the discussion of destitution. I pay tribute to the Refugee Council and the many charities, including the churches of all denominations up and down the country, that are supporting destitute failed asylum seekers who they consider have good reasons for not co-operating with the BIA in their removal.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000102"></a>At the time that the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill was before noble Lords in February 2006, it looked as though greater emphasis was going to be put on voluntary returns with the aid of the resettlement grants provided by the IOM. However, that programme seems to have plateaued. In my experience, the grants alone are not enough, but have to be reinforced by counselling to assure the returnees that they will be safe in their country of origin, building on the experience of others who have gone back already. That would be a more effective policy, at least for those who come from the countries on the white list, to which another 10 countries were added this week. That seemed to have some resonance with the Government in their response to the JCHR&#146;s 17th report, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, where they appear to place greater emphasis on the priority to be attached to increasing voluntary returns.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000103"></a>For those who get to the end of the road and for one reason or another cannot be removed, the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment provides that basic financial and housing support should still be afforded to them until it becomes impossible to remove them. To deprive them of all means of support, and even to

Parliament should take this opportunity to say that we will not tolerate this use of extreme weapons of coercion against vulnerable and helpless people. We shall have a lot more to say on this subject when we come to the next amendment, but in the mean time we support the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord in their attempts to mitigate the effects of the Government&#146;s cruel and inhuman policy.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000104"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071286000208"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> I fear the Minister must feel very lonely in the Committee today. We all criticise. We all see the horror of much of what is going on. There are three amendments here that are intended to see an end to Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act. We are all agreed on that.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000105"></a>Last year, or the year before, the Government gave tremendous support to the Make Poverty History campaign&#151;and yet in our country we are not making poverty history; by forcing people into destitution, we are creating poverty. That is totally at variance with any aim of a civilised society or of a caring Government. Now, however, we might just be seeing a wee bit of light at the end of the tunnel. In a recent Written Statement, the Minister at the time, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, put Section 9 more or less on hold, admitting that it was a failure. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071286000174"></a>&#147;In the form piloted, Section 9 did not significantly influence behaviour in favour of co-operating with removal, although there was some increase in the number of applications made for travel documents. This suggests that the Section 9 provision should not be seen as a universal tool to encourage departure in every case&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/7/07; col. <I>WS 50</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071286000152"></a>The noble and learned Baroness goes on to say that she&#151;or whoever is in charge now&#151;will keep it, but it is not to be used on an indiscriminate basis.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000106"></a>We had three pilot areas: West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and the eastern part of central London. In the past week or so, I am told, we have had the long-awaited evaluation report. Again, that report admits that the provision was a failure.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000107"></a>The Government could take positive action to reduce destitution, and admit their own failure, by repealing Section 9 of the 2004 Act. Whichever amendment the Government accept&#151;whether it be the amendment of the right reverend Prelate, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, or our own Liberal Democrat amendment&#151;we are speaking with one voice to ensure that the Government do that. We all make mistakes&#151;even Governments make mistakes&#151;and it is time to back down on this section. I hope that when the Bill is finally enacted, that provision will have gone forever.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000108"></a>I move among some of the homeless and rough sleepers and I have seen the destitution. When counts are taken, people go into hiding and we do not get a proper assessment of the problem. I invite the Minister to accompany me and others to see where the problem lies and what provision is made. Perhaps he has already done so, but it would be an eye-opener for him to see the state of total hopelessness that Section 9 can lead to.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000109"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, we warmly endorse the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment, as we

We will urge this provision in the Liberal Democrat amendment when we bring it forward at a later stage.</p>

I support the right reverend Prelate and I was pleased to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that he thinks that is the more comprehensive amendment.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000111"></a>The right reverend Prelate pointed out that there are perhaps more than 280,000 so-called failed asylum seekers. These figures from the National Audit Office in 2005 estimate a cost of &#163;11,000 per forced removal. These so-called failed asylum seekers are being pushed closer to the edge of destitution and the churches, aid workers and others who care for them are increasingly arguing for a new direction, a limited amnesty and a more humane policy above all. The Strangers into Citizens campaign would be a sensible way out for the Government, remembering that it will take three successive Parliaments to remove these numbers at the current rate. I commend also the Still Human Still Here campaign which focuses on this particular category.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000112"></a>I welcome the Government&#146;s new provision of eligibility during the grace period after appeal. I believe the Government are still appealing against the Court of Appeal and I am not clear about the exact definition of the grace period or the prescribed period described under Clause 17(5). I hope the Minister will elaborate on that.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000113"></a>Meanwhile, as has been said, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on page 15 of House of Lords Paper 105, concedes that destitution may not be a deliberate policy, but there remains a risk that some asylum seekers will be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 3 of the European Convention. This is why the committee, with all its authority, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has said, recommends the repeal of Section 55 of the 2002 Act and Section 9 of the 2004 Act and, most importantly, the extension of the duty under Section 11 of the Children Act to immigration.</p>

Noble Lords&#146; deliberations might appear to be guillotined if the Minister were in full flow and noble Lords rightly wished to intervene further on this vital matter, so I just pose the question as to whether the Committee might wish to avoid appearing to lose that opportunity by deferring the Minister&#146;s response until next time. If we do not do that, we will have to finish as the clock strikes six and he will have to continue with his speech next time. I leave it in the hands of noble Lords; it is just a suggestion.</p>

It is hard not to feel moved by his comments and observations on the way that the asylum seekers&#146; support system works. One appreciates the thinking behind his comments. That said, we, as a Government, have to take hard decisions and we have a firm framework of legislation designed to deal with problems within the asylum-seeking process and the issue of support. Noble Lords should not run away from that.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000116"></a>Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 seek to extend asylum support to those who have been found to have no need for international protection and who should be taking steps to leave the UK. Amendment No. 33 seeks to repeal Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and all three of the amendments we are debating seek to repeal Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000117"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071286000212"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Our amendment is separate from the other two.</p>

I want to set out the intention behind Clause 17. The clause is a technical amendment that amends the definition of an asylum seeker to ensure that an asylum seeker and his dependants will continue to be eligible for support as an asylum seeker or dependants of an asylum seeker until the end of the immigration appeals process. That is what currently happens, and was always the intention.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000119"></a>It is relevant where an asylum application has been refused by the Secretary of State but the asylum applicant can bring an in-country appeal or has lodged an in-country appeal with the appropriate authorities and that appeal has not yet been determined. It was always the intention of the legislation that a destitute asylum seeker would continue to be eligible for support until he or she had the opportunity to have an appeal heard by an independent tribunal. However, recent litigation interpreted the existing provision in such a way that destitute asylum seekers may cease to be eligible for support as soon as the Secretary of State served a refusal of asylum. The litigation remains the subject of an appeal, but we consider it only right to take this early opportunity to clarify the statutory provisions to make it quite clear that, so long as they meet the relevant criteria that they are destitute, asylum seekers continue to be eligible for support until the point when any in-country appeal has been determined.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000120"></a>Noble Lords welcomed what we put in the Bill, so far as it went. However, the proposed amendments seek to do something rather different. Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 would maintain asylum support potentially indefinitely for those who have made a claim, who have had that claim and any appeal rejected and who choose not to leave the UK. The motivation behind the amendments is understandable&#151;a wish not to see people living in destitution&#151;but the fact is that these people do not have to be destitute. They can choose to go home, a home to which it has been found it is safe for them to return.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000121"></a>Support is available under Section 4 of the 1999 Act for those who are taking all reasonable steps to  


<notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC286"></a><b>12 July 2007 : Column GC286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>return home, while that return is being arranged. It is also available where there is some temporary barrier to returning. Those making a voluntary return are also eligible to receive the world-leading reintegration assistance provided by the International Organisation for Migration on behalf of the Home Office. It is not right that UK taxpayers should be asked to fund, potentially indefinitely, those who have been unwilling to make a voluntary return.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000122"></a>We must maintain the integrity of our system. We have a long and proud tradition of granting asylum and protection to those fleeing persecution and torture, but that tradition must not be exploited. To support indefinitely those who have been found not to need our protection would be to undermine the purpose of protecting the UK&#146;s borders and would undermine our efforts to ensure that those with no right to be in the UK make arrangements to leave.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000123"></a>Amendment No. 33 also seeks the repeal of Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. Both those measures play an important part in encouraging compliance with our immigration system. Section 55 prevents the provision of asylum support to asylum claimants who do not make their asylum claim as soon as reasonably practicable after their arrival in the UK. The sooner an asylum claim is made, the more likely that factual information can be obtained and verified to inform the asylum decision processes.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000124"></a>There are a number of safeguards in Section 55 to protect the vulnerable. Children and their families are excluded from its provisions, and it would not prevent the provision of support if it would be a breach of human rights not to provide it. Support is not refused under Section 55 to any person who does not have alternative support available, including overnight shelter, adequate food and basic amenities.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000125"></a>Amendment No. 33 further seeks to restrict the use of vouchers to provide for those who are receiving support under Section 4. It is important to make it clear that failed asylum seekers cannot be expected to receive support on the same basis as those still in the asylum process. Section 4 support is intended as a limited and temporary form of support. The vouchers provided for the purchase of food and essential toiletries are ordinary high street vouchers which are also available to the public at large. They do not in any way mark the user as a failed asylum seeker.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000126"></a>We acknowledge that there are some needs which cannot be met within the existing Section 4 regime. We will shortly commence a consultation on draft regulations to meet specified services and facilities, which will enable us to give additional support to the most vulnerable receiving Section 4 support, including pregnant women and mothers with children. What we cannot agree to do is to extinguish the distinction between those still awaiting a final decision on their asylum claims and those who have been found not to need our protection. To do so would undermine the integrity of the system by sending out mixed messages to those expected to leave.</p>

That will be the first thing that we do on the next occasion that the Grand Committee meets.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000129"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07071286000215"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I appreciate that, but I am addressing the whole group and the issue has been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. He is entitled to an answer.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000130"></a>There are, however, exceptions, and support will be available if one of these exceptions applies, such as support being necessary in order to avoid a breach of a person&#146;s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.Section 9 is not designed to make families destitute or to split them up but to influence behaviour so that people co-operate and to incentivise voluntary return before removal is enforced.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000131"></a>My honourable friend the Minister of State, Liam Byrne, recently published the evaluation report on the Section 9 pilot. That report makes it clear that based on the results of the pilot, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, we do not think that Section 9 is suitable for use on a routine basis. However, we cannot agree to the repeal of Section 9. We think it is important to retain a provision to withdraw support from families who refuse to co-operate with removal. In any case, where a case owner considers that it may be appropriate to use Section 9, a case conference approach involving local stakeholders, such as the local authority, will be followed.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000132"></a>Since the pilot was undertaken, the approach to dealing with asylum applications by the Border and Immigration Agency has undergone a significant transformation. The new approach offers a more credible and sustainable end-to-end system. Specialist case owners are now responsible for managing the claimants and their cases through the whole system to either removal or integration as refugees. There is a strong focus on ensuring that early steps are taken so that those whose claims are not successful leave the United Kingdom in a timely manner.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000133"></a>Those who have been refused asylum have no basis to remain in the UK. It cannot be right to give false hope to individuals that they will be able to stay here after their asylum claim is determined. It is particularly important that families should not give false expectations to children. We think that it is important to make it clear that those refused asylum cannot expect to receive support indefinitely.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000134"></a>We therefore think it important to retain an ability to withdraw support from families who wilfully refuse to co-operate. In such cases, the case owner will take a view on which approach to encouraging departure is most likely to be effective. Case-specific close working

<a name="70712-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000135"></a>Repeal of Section 9 would also have the effect of giving a right of appeal to the asylum support tribunal where asylum support was refused or withdrawn because of the operation of Schedule 3 to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Schedule 3 is an important measure to discourage benefit-shopping and prevents support to those within specified classes, except to the extent necessary to prevent a breach of their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights or Community treaties. This exception already provides an important safeguard in the operation of Schedule 3. Section 9 and Schedule 3 are important parts of our work to preserve the integrity of the asylum system, and the amendments would not help us to achieve our objectives.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000136"></a>Finally, I should address the question of access to healthcare&#151;an issue that has arisen on a number of occasions during our deliberations. The right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment seeks to change the current entitlement to free secondary healthcare for those who have been unsuccessful in their asylum claims. As announced in our strategy to enforce compliance with our immigration laws, published in March this year, we intend to shut down inappropriate access to services that are privileges intended for people who are in the UK legitimately. At its simplest, this is an issue of fairness.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000137"></a>In relation to healthcare, we shall review the rules governing access to the NHS by foreign nationals. We will work with the Department of Health to ensure that the implementation of new rules flowing from the review is accompanied by a programme of communication and good practice for those who apply the rules, including practice staff, GPs and trusts. Given that review, it would be inappropriate to make any changes at present.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000138"></a>However, I reiterate to noble Lords that the basic humanitarian needs of failed asylum seekers in relation to access to healthcare are already met. They receive free treatment in accident and emergency departments and for many infectious diseases such as TB. For other life-threatening conditions and for the purpose of preventing any conditions from becoming life-threatening, they will receive appropriate treatment, regardless of their ability to pay. Treatment will not be withheld or delayed. Charging issues will be sorted out subsequently. Therefore, care will be available at the point at which it is most needed and it will be free. Issues of charging will come later. I remind the Committee that trusts also have discretion to write off any debts accrued when it would not be reasonable or cost-effective to pursue them.</p>

<a name="70712-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071286000139"></a>I think that I have covered all the issues raised in the debate. I know that the right reverend Prelate will be disappointed by my response but we need to retain the integrity of our system, and we think that the asylum support system works to achieve that end.</p>

<p><a name="07071286000140"></a><b><a name="70712-gc0009.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071286000216"></a>The Lord Bishop of Newcastle:</b> I thank the Minister for his comments. Naturally, I am very disappointed by what he said, although I am not entirely surprised.

Where there has been absolute unanimity on the matter, that will not go away. Destitution as a policy does not work. It will take 14 years to &#147;clear up the backlog&#148;, which is a terrible way of describing the situation. Therefore, we are committing hundreds of thousands of people to destitution for the next 14 years. What do we think we are doing? As I said, I am grateful for what everyone said, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="wms_date_0"></a><a name="07071279000001"></a><I>Thursday 12 July 2007</I></h2>

<a name="wms_subhd_0"></a>
<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="07071279000002"></a>Agriculture: Wet Weather</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="07071279000016"></a><b><a name="70712-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071279000222"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07071279000017"></a>The unprecedented wet weather has caused significant disruption for a number of farmers. In recent days, including during my visit to the Great Yorkshire Show, I have received representations from industry representatives and individual farmers about two specific measures that we might take to help to alleviate their difficulties. Both have now been implemented.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07071279000018"></a>Given the urgency of the issue, I gave instructions yesterday that the cross-compliance requirement&#151;good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC) 3&#151;prohibiting the use of mechanical field operations and mechanised vehicles on waterlogged soil should be suspended until 31 July 2007. This will enable farmers to use mechanical equipment and vehicles on waterlogged soil and access their crops. Farmers should use their soil protection review as a means to identify and mitigate any soil-related issues arising as a result of the suspension.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07071279000019"></a>Livestock farmers have also been experiencing problems in accessing sufficient forage for their animals. I have, therefore, authorised the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to allow farmers in England to graze set-aside land with their own animals or harvest hay or silage for their own use. Farmers wishing to make use of this derogation should telephone, e-mail or write to the RPA customer service centre providing the reference numbers for the fields that they wish to graze or harvest. Exceptionally, in these circumstances, farmers may consider that the derogation has been granted unless RPA subsequently makes contact to indicate otherwise.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07071279000020"></a>Further details of these measures are accessible on the RPA website: www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/839744302B8BBA1080257315005078F1</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="07071279000024"></a><b><a name="70712-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07071279000224"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07071279000025"></a>The Court Funds Office (CFO), an associated office of the Ministry of Justice, provides a banking and investment service for funds held in court. The work is governed by the Administration Act 1982, the Civil Procedure Rules and the Court Funds Rules. CFO manages some &#163;4.5 billion in a mixture of cash and equity holdings. Investment on behalf of children is generally made into the equity index tracker fund, which is managed on behalf of the Ministry of Justice by Legal &amp; General, one of the largest managers of index tracker funds in the UK.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07071279000026"></a>A recent review of children&#146;s damages awards that are held in court and administered by the CFO identified a requirement to correct a number of children&#146;s accounts, to ensure that the award is appropriately invested as originally directed by the court. Where the award is more than &#163;5,000 and the child is under 13 years of age, part of the award would usually be placed in an index tracker fund. In a number of cases, this investment in equities did not take place.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07071279000027"></a>Prompt action is now being taken to identify all affected cases and, where the consequence has been a lower rate of return, to pay the balance necessary to ensure that beneficiaries are not disadvantaged. The administrative failures that led to this situation have been addressed to ensure that cases are invested in accordance with the courts&#146; directions without delay.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07071279000028"></a>The process for calculating the correction payments has been reviewed by a City firm of accountants and by the Strategic Investment Board, a panel of appointed financial experts that provides generic investment advice to the Ministry of Justice in respect of its clients.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07071279000029"></a>It is estimated that approximately 4,000 current and closed cases have been affected and that the full cost of corrective payments will be approximately &#163;12.5 million. This is out of a total of 90,000 current children&#146;s cases, holding nearly &#163;650 million in cash and investments, and 1.1 million closed cases.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07071279000030"></a>Letters providing full details of the corrected accounts are being sent to all litigation friends who represent the children involved.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="07071279000031"></a><b><a name="70712-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07071279000225"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (John Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07071279000032"></a>Contracts have been signed with EDF Energy, E.ON UK, Scottish and Southern Energy and Scottish Power to conduct the trials of smart meters and associated feedback devices. They are being funded by &#163;10 million from the Government, matched by a similar amount from the companies involved. The funding was announced as part of Budget 2006.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07071279000033"></a>The trials will include 15,000 households receiving state-of-the-art smart meters and 8,000 more receiving clip-on real-time display units for their existing meters. The other households in the trial will be testing new ways of receiving information to help them to cut their energy use. Altogether, around 40,000 households will be involved.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07071279000034"></a>Clip-on real-time display units can tell people how much energy they are using and how much it is costing when individual appliances are turned on. Smart meters allow energy suppliers to communicate directly with their customers, removing the need for meter readings and ensuring entirely accurate bills with no estimates. Smart meters tell people about their energy use either through linked display units or in other ways, such as through the internet or the television.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07071279000035"></a>The trials will test out consumers' response to better information on their energy use through a variety of methods, including:</p>
consumers to be able to access information about their consumption and energy costs through visual display units that can be displayed round the house, over the internet and even through digital TV;the potential for energy suppliers to provide enhanced billing information with advice to consumers on how they can cut down their energy bills; andproviding a breakdown of energy use to the customer and exploring a range of tariffs for consumption at different times of the day.
<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07071279000036"></a>The trials will be conducted throughout the country and will look at the responses from a range of customers, including those in fuel poverty.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07071279000037"></a>The trials will also look at:</p>
increasing the frequency of billing as well as the impact of more accurate bills; andencouragement to become even more energy efficient through more information and community engagement.
<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07071279000038"></a>Smart meters are expected to be rolled out to most households within the next 10 years and to all but the smallest businesses in the next five years.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07071279000039"></a>In the mean time, the Government have proposed that real-time display units be provided with any new meters fitted from 2008 and to all households that

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07071279000041"></a>I am today announcing the arrangements that we have put in hand to establish the post of forensic science regulator, whose role will be to advise the Government and the criminal justice system on quality standards in the provision of forensic science. This will involve identifying the requirement for new or improved quality standards, leading on the development of new standards where necessary; providing advice and guidance so that providers will be able to demonstrate compliance with common standards, in procurement and in courts, for example; ensuring that satisfactory arrangements exist to provide assurance and monitoring of the standards; and reporting on quality standards generally.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07071279000042"></a>The regulator will be supported and advised by a Forensic Science Advisory Council, whose members will be drawn from key stakeholders, expert bodies and others with a particular interest in the provision of forensic science to the criminal justice system. These arrangements draw on the recommendations of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in its report <I>Forensic Science on Trial</I>, which was published on 16 March 2005, and on the responses to a consultation exercise carried out by the Home Office last year.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07071279000043"></a>A team has been established in the Home Office under the management of a senior civil servant to set up the office of the regulator and the Forensic Science Advisory Council. The regulator will be appointed by the Home Secretary following recruitment through the public appointments process. Pending this recruitment, the responsible official will serve as the interim regulator.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="07071279000141"></a>On 14 June, the Ministry of Justice received the results of two unannounced inspections, by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI), into Oakhill secure training centre. They assessed the centre&#146;s development as poor.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_121"></a><a name="07071279000147"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor has today published the seventh report by the President of Appeal Tribunals on the standards of decisions made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in cases that came before appeal tribunals. The major reasons given for appeal tribunals overturning or amending decisions were that new evidence was produced at the hearing or the tribunal took a different view of the same evidence.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_122"></a><a name="07071279000148"></a>In his report, the president acknowledges improvements by some Department for Work and Pensions agencies, particularly the Disability and Carers Service.

In addition to the agreements, regular meetings are held to review respective performance and discuss any issues to improve customer service.</p>

Take-up of tax credits is a significant success. In 2004-05, take-up of the child tax credit rose from 79 per cent to 82 per cent, with over 90 per cent of the money available being claimed. Take-up among those on incomes below &#163;10,000 is 97 per cent and take-up among lone parents is 93 per cent. This is higher than for any previous system of income-related financial support for working families.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_175"></a><a name="07071279000200"></a>Tax credits play a major role in moving people into work and helping people to move up the employment ladder, ensuring that work pays over welfare. Tax credits, economic stability and the Government&#146;s welfare to work programmes have helped to increase the number of people in work by over 2.6 million since spring 1997.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_176"></a><a name="07071279000201"></a>As a result of the Government&#146;s reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, from April 2007, in real terms:</p>
families with children are, on average, &#163;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth will be, on average, &#163;3,450 per year better off; anda single-earner family on half average male earnings with two children is &#163;3,900 a year better off.
<a name="70712-wms0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_177"></a><a name="07071279000202"></a>The tax credit system has also played a key role in tackling child poverty. Since 1998-99, 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty, compared with a doubling of child poverty in the previous 20 years.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_178"></a><a name="07071279000203"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is today publishing its estimates of error and fraud in the tax credit system in 2004-05. This analysis shows that the rate of error and fraud has declined by a sixth between 2003-04 and 2004-05. This is below the error and fraud rate under the predecessor system and is comparable to error and fraud rates for income support and jobseeker&#146;s allowance when the Government first started collecting data in a systematic way in 1997-98.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_179"></a><a name="07071279000204"></a>Looking to the future, HMRC is seeking to accelerate the production of error and fraud figures, which will enable it to set clear targets for a further reduction. HMRC is also looking carefully at whether an estimate can be made of the split between customer error and official error for the 2005-06 and subsequent inquiries.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_180"></a><a name="07071279000205"></a>The largest component of the figures published today is error (&#163;1.13 billion) as opposed to fraud (&#163;40 million). These figures are from a period when the Inland Revenue was starting to recover from the early operational difficulties and new rules and processes were starting to become established.</p>

<a name="70712-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_181"></a><a name="07071279000206"></a>Since the introduction of tax credits, HMRC has had a detailed programme of action in place to ensure that individuals receive the tax credits to which they are entitled, at the right time. To tackle error, HMRC has continued to improve its communications with members of the public, simplifying the claim form and award notices. Access to contact centres has also been improved, with 99 per cent of callers in 2006-07 answered on the day they called. Advertising and increased contact have been used to make individuals aware of their entitlements and to reduce error.</p>
