<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  My Lords, before business begins, may I take the opportunity to inform the House that I will be undertaking a ministerial visit to Northern Ireland and Edinburgh on Tuesday, 25 October? Accordingly, I trust that the House will grant me leave of absence.

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether the recent increase in oil prices has led to an increase in the use of coal to generate electricity in the United Kingdom.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the share of UK total electricity supplied from gas was two percentage points lower during the first half of 2005 than in the first half of 2004, while coal&#039;s share increased by one percentage point. That change in the UK generation mix was attributable to the rise in the price of natural gas relative to coal, which was largely the result of higher oil prices.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his informative Answer. It is an unfortunate reality that rising coal use increases carbon dioxide emissions, which have an adverse affect on global temperatures. It is a classic case of a situation in which the short-term interests of electricity generators are in conflict with the long-term need to save on carbon emissions. Can the Minister tell the House whether the Government give priority to the short term or the long term?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right: other things being equal, the increased attractiveness of coal as a fuel for generating electricity tends to result in more CO2 emissions. Typically, coal is twice as carbon-intensive per megawatt as gas. However, that tendency will be ameliorated and offset over time by the UK&#039;s participation in the EU emissions trading scheme. That is important with regard to the long term. The White Paper in 2003 set out the framework for a long-term energy policy, and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1016"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1016</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the emissions trading scheme is important in that context in ensuring that carbon abatement is achieved in the most cost-effective way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the figures that he gave us are bad news indeed for our Kyoto obligations and that there is no evidence that we should be optimistic about the target for non-renewables being met? In those circumstances, can he say anything further about the Government&#039;s policy on the nuclear generation of electricity? If he cannot, will he undertake that his noble friend will say something of substance in the debate on Thursday?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that question. He has been steadfast in pursuing the issue. With regard to Kyoto, it is clear that we are on course to meet and exceed our obligations under that agreement. Progress has been made on renewables. I think that there has been an increase of 9 per cent in capacity, just between 2003 and 2004. However, there are significant challenges ahead.
</p>

<a name="51024-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The Government&#039;s policy on energy was set out in the 2003 White Paper. It focuses on the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. We acknowledge that nuclear power is a source of carbon-free electricity, but there are significant issues relating to cost and the handling of waste.
</p>

<a name="51024-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The Prime Minister has already announced that we will be publishing proposals on energy policy next year and has made it clear that issues of climate change and our reliance on imported energy supplies necessitate an assessment of all options for future energy policy, including civil nuclear power, renewables and clean coal technology. Issues of more substance may come forward in the review and possibly in the debate on Thursday.

<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, the Minister has said that nuclear fuel is carbon free. However, even with nuclear, there is&#151;and I hope that he mentions this in the debate on Thursday&#151;a massive carbon footprint in the mining of a fossil fuel. Can he say when on present trends wind power will be cheaper than oil, coal or gas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord on his first point about the footprint. I do not have data on the cost of wind power, but I should be happy to write to him with such information as we have. But I think that we should celebrate the fact that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1017"></a>

there have been advances, particularly in on-shore wind power, which is helping to tackle the challenges that we face.

<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   My Lords, how long are the Minister and the Government he represents going to be content to dither and to waste time with meaningless phrases such as &quot;Keeping the nuclear option open&quot; when they are doing absolutely nothing to do so?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I reject that assertion. A lot of research is being conducted into a whole field of issues relating to energy policy. As I said earlier, we have set down a very clear framework within which the industry can operate and make its long-term investment decisions. As for nuclear energy, the position as set out in the White Paper will be kept under review and considered as part of the 2006 exercise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Lawson of Blaby: </b>   My Lords&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </b>   Perhaps I may rephrase the question of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton. Is my noble friend aware that many people in the energy industry are very disturbed because of the changes that have taken place since the 2003 White Paper? We do not know which way we are going. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that something will be done next year, but we want to know this year whether we should invest in one direction or the other.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the framework within which business can make its investment decisions was set down in 2003 and has not changed. Clearly that policy, as the policy document itself made clear, will not pick up every issue and every item that will need to be addressed over a period of 20 years or more. However, given the issues of security, importation of supplies and the increasing challenges of climate change, it is absolutely right that we continue to modify and keep abreast of such developments. That is what the exercise is about. It is not work that will be undertaken next year; it is something that will be forthcoming next year as a result of the ongoing review and implementation of the policy that is in place.

<a name="51024-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they propose to revive the road map to peace in the Middle East, in the light of Israel&#039;s continuing expansion and consolidation of settlements in the West Bank; and, if so, what steps they propose to take.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, the road map remains the best way forward in the Middle East peace process. Following the success of disengagement, it is vital for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to make progress on their road map commitments, including an end to Israeli settlement construction. On 20 September the quartet called on both sides to renew action on their road map obligations and avoid actions which prejudice final status negotiations. We are working with the quartet and the parties to re-energise the road map.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51024-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, but is that really sufficient in the light of the fact that, this year, the Israelis have moved more than 14,000 settlers into the West Bank compared with the 8,500 they withdrew from Gaza, and have expropriated more land around east Jerusalem than they yielded up at Gaza? Surely the truth is that all this undermines Abu Mazen&#039;s position and creates a huge backlash of Palestinian and indeed Muslim opinion. When is the Prime Minister going effectively to honour his repeated commitment to the road map?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051024/text/51024-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the building of settlements, as anybody who looks at the map can see, makes it extremely difficult to create a contiguous authority for the Palestinian people east of Jerusalem. We have said so repeatedly and we will continue to say so. We have made these representations on a very large number of occasions, together with others in the quartet. All those who are interested in a peaceful resolution should look at the achievements that have come from the disengagement and build on them. The reality is that it is a very long, hard haul, and everybody must try to take the maximum advantage of any success and any development.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar: </b>   My Lords, surely the Minister realises that the road map is now largely a device for allowing Mr Sharon sufficient time to go on building his illegal settlements in his apartheid rage, so why do we go on talking about it? Surely action is needed and not just talk.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the Middle East&#039;s problems will be resolved by talk; they will certainly not be resolved by any of the methods that are being adopted in the region. Some of the building programmes have been halted, largely because of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1019"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1019</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

pressures that have been brought to bear by members of the quartet. That gives a little bit of space for further development in the West Bank. That has to be the objective. There are no silver bullets for suddenly resolving this issue by means other than negotiation.

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may remind the House of the gracious Speech of 17 May this year, in which Parliament was told that peace in the Middle East would remain one of the Government&#039;s highest priorities. In the light of that, what response has the quartet had from the Israeli Government to its call? Does the Minister agree that the continuing build-up of settlements not only prejudices any chance of a peaceful settlement but directly contravenes the commitments to which the Israelis have signed up?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the building and extension of settlements is plainly contrary to the arrangements under the first phase of the road map. It is also true that breaches of security and attacks on Israel are contrary to the provisions of the road map. There are difficulties on both sides. The withdrawal from Gaza and from some parts of the northern West Bank has provided a window of opportunity for parallel development. That is what the Government must seize on, just as all members of the quartet agree they must.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Wright, for interrupting him. I misheard. Does the Minister agree that the use of the word &quot;apartheid&quot; is both offensive and inaccurate, given that many Arabs live at peace within the state of Israel and are full citizens of that state?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree with that, and I regret that I have to say it. The truth is that it is the kind of language which makes the peace process almost impossible. We would all do a lot better if we were a bit more cautious in what we said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, if there is to be a next step in the road map process&#151;I think we all have to concede that it looks somewhat stalled at the moment&#151;the halt in the expansion of Israeli settlements and the dismantling of illegal Jewish hilltop settlements are essential. But does the Minister agree that, on the Palestinian side, it would be very valuable if the Palestinian authorities could ensure that the candidates in their elections and local elections break their links with the armed militias so that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1020"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1020</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

candidates are not using armed methods and violent means? That would at least be in accord with the Oslo principles and might help the process inch forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree with that. There is no place for the gun in civilised politics. I am glad to report to the House that, in a meeting between President Abbas and President Bush in Washington recently, the question of reining in terrorists and making sure that security was improved was one of the fundamental issues, and there was a renewal of the undertakings in that regard given in London in March. All sides have to make certain now that they do nothing that prejudices the prospects for the road map. Those prospects are difficult at any time. Anything that makes them more so must be wholly unacceptable to this House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </b>   My Lords, with your Lordships&#039; leave, I will presage my question by saying what a joy it is to see how the House can behave in a successful self-regulatory manner, without the need for intervention from either the Front Bench or the Woolsack.
</p>

<a name="51024-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Does my noble friend not agree that Israel, especially in the evacuation from Gaza, has made several steps of great value to the process towards peace, which we all desire? Does he not also agree that it would be helpful if the Palestinian Authority discouraged the participation in elections of those who come from groups such as Hamas or Hezbollah, whose programme in Arabic is clear: the total abolition of the state of Israel and its people?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51024-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the decision to move back from Gaza was brave. I compliment the Israeli Government on the success with which they did it. It was done carefully, and in a way that meant that those who resisted moving from Gaza were dealt with in a civilised yet firm way. It is important that that is reciprocated. The truth is that there are people in the Palestinian enclave who still advocate violence and do not accept Israel&#039;s right to exist. So long as they pursue those politics it is difficult to see how the Palestinian Authority can act with the authority it needs. That is precisely why building some effort towards peace on the basis of what we have must remain a priority.

I entirely agree with her that a balanced approach must be taken, and I welcome the amendments that have been tabled since I put this question down, although I would not claim cause and effect. I urge the Minister to reconsider the position of private museums, which are not caught by these two amendments and will therefore still have a problem with deactivated weapons. Many such museums are extremely popular and have had up to 1 million visitors during the course of their existence. In many cases they are also a valuable source of weapons for public museums, as private collectors often bequeath them their collections.

<a name="51024-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that assurance, as far as domestic consumers are concerned. But what is going to happen to industrial consumers, including power stations, which supply the domestic market? If we were to have the recurrence of the sort of conditions that we had in 1963, for example, what level of cut would there be in the industrial market, bearing in mind that the level of gas storage in this country is very much lower than it is in continental countries? Secondly, does this not indicate that, as we <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I certainly agree with the last point. That is why the Government are concerned to put in place a long-term strategy to improve our position with regard to energy supplies. As the noble Lord said, that is forced upon us by the end of our independence with regard to our energy supplies in this country. We shall be importing energy, as the whole House knows. That is why, for instance, we are increasing gas storage facilities and are about the business of contracts for liquefied natural gas. It is why, in fact, we are promising next year a complete review of the position on energy, because we realise that the situation needs long-term solutions.

He is right that nuclear is carbon-free once it is in production, but he will also recognise that the establishment of a nuclear power station produces problems for the atmosphere.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, as we all know with regard to the research carried out so far, that is such a potentially benign energy source that we would hope it had a role to play in the future. However, the noble Lord knows as well as anyone in the House that we are still a considerable way from transforming the research into viable projects. Until we are in that position we cannot place reliance on it.

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Earl is confused by sitting behind so many. The Minister said that infrastructure will be considered over the following year. However, this situation is not of great surprise. We have known for a long time that the North Sea gas supplies are running out. We have only three days&#039; supply, whereas Germany has 55 days&#039; supply. Which department is responsible for future planning? It seems to have come as a massive shock to the Government that no supplies are being built and it will not take just one year to rectify the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, nothing comes as a surprise to the Government, and certainly not in this case. The noble Lord is wrong. We do not have three days&#039; gas supply; we have 11. We also have an increase in storage facilities. With regard to the 11 days&#039; supply, we are increasing that capacity. We also still have indigenous resources. The Netherlands, which also has indigenous resources, has no gas storage facilities of any kind. One can over-dramatise the position that faces us with regard to energy. That is not to say that important decisions do not need to be taken; that is why the Prime Minister announced a few weeks ago that those decisions will be taken next year.

<a name="51024-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Shephard of Northwold: </b>   My Lords, both the noble Lord and his colleague in an earlier Answer spoke of the challenges facing the Government&#039;s energy policy.

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, in terms of meeting the general challenge, preceding each of our winters over the past three years, there have been contentions in this House that we are on the brink of <br>&nbsp;<br>

a national emergency, yet we have always had a sufficient margin in hand for supplies. Even in the extreme case quoted earlier of a winter such as that of 1962&#150;63, we are indicating that we will be able to cope with regard to the domestic consumer.
</p>

<a name="51024-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The noble Baroness is right that we need to and are seeking to encourage the development of biofuels. They have a role to play; and that is why we are concerned that they should play an increasing part in the general supply of energy to this country. But she will recognise how marginal that contribution is when we are talking today principally about supplies of gas, which are bound to be a major element in our energy supplies. That is why we have entered into the contracts for liquefied natural gas to be imported to the country and have sufficient storage to be able to receive it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew14"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   My Lords, of course the noble Earl is confused; that is why he is asking the Government a question. He is confused by the Government&#039;s reaction. Have they seen the figures in today&#039;s newspapers, reliably reported in the<i> Times</i>,<i> </i>that nuclear is the cheapest energy per kilowatt hour, wind power offshore is by far the most expensive, wind power onshore is the second most expensive and that both require coal-fired or gas-fired generating powers as standby so that they produce no carbon gas net savings at all?
</p>

<a name="51024-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Furthermore, we are running out of nuclear energy over the next 20 years and we are not an energy exporter, which has been pointed out several times. Surely we must take up nuclear energy as quickly as possible and not allow the Prime Minister to be frightened of his own Back Benches on the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="51024-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I have indicated that we have a timetable for the consideration of the issue with regard to the nuclear industry. The noble Earl is wrong to say that nuclear energy is cheaper; it is cheaper only if we write off certain areas of cost, not least the costs of waste disposal, which are still a major issue in this country. He is measuring the full and total costs of wind power while putting the case for the nuclear industry and deleting a significant part of the costs.

<a name="51024-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My Lords, the Minister referred to the energy with which his Government and the United States are investing in clean coal technology. A long time ago a distinguished economist described our country as one that was &quot;built on coal, surrounded by fish&quot;. The fish, alas, have gone but much of the coal remains. Will the Minister undertake, in reviewing energy policy, that the Government will make an up-to-date assessment of the extent of our country&#039;s coal reserves?

Enormous new fields have been opened by the Norwegians, but there is one snag. The pipelines to land that gas at Easington on the east coast of the UK have not been built and that is a failure of planning. Should not the Government, who, I understand, pride themselves on planning, have established earlier the pipelines necessary to ensure that we do not go short of gas?

But the noble Lord will recognise that, in fact, we have for some considerable time been able to exploit the North Sea for our own use with our own resources. We are transferring to that new position and we have a strategy for employing those resources properly.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="51024-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The UK has one of the strongest and most efficient consumer credit markets in the world. We represent a quarter of the EU credit market generally, and 50 per cent of the EU credit card market. For 30 years, the consumer credit market has helped to build what is now a thriving economy, with low interest rates and record employment. It is this credit market and this economy that has not only enabled our consumers to achieve high standards of living, but has also ensured that our businesses can flourish.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>We want to ensure that this market remains competitive. But the consumer credit market has changed immeasurably since 1974, when the current legislative framework was established. Then, only one credit card was available; now there are 1,300. Then, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1026"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1026</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;32 million was owed on credit cards; now it is over &#163;49 billion. There is clear evidence that some consumers are suffering significant harm. We cannot deny that irresponsible or unscrupulous lenders can destroy lives. Borrowers can find themselves with credit agreements that they either do not need or do not understand. Often, the most vulnerable in society are disproportionately affected. More than half of the over-indebted households have incomes of less than &#163;7,500 per year.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Noble Lords may be aware of the case which the Under-Secretary of State described to the other place. The case concerned a couple, both of whom suffered from mental illness, whose initial loan of &#163;500 spiralled to debts of more than &#163;5,000. But in addition to this, the couple also owed another &#163;19,000 to other lenders, and had no means to repay it. We need to drive out irresponsible lending, not only to protect consumers, but also to ensure that credible businesses can operate with confidence in a competitive market. We also want to empower consumers to make informed borrowing decisions. This relies on transparency and clarity of agreements with lenders, and on consumer confidence in appropriate levels of rights and redress. In this context, the Government are committed to full-scale consumer credit reform with one over-riding aim: to create a fair, clear and competitive consumer credit market for the 21st century.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Noble Lords will no doubt be aware of the important work already completed by the Government in this area. Our consumer credit White Paper of 2003 set out the Government&#039;s agenda. Since then we have introduced secondary legislation, developed initiatives for tackling over-indebtedness, and run pilot projects to tackle illegal money lending. Our secondary legislation has standardised the method by which APR is calculated for running account credit, so that consumers can compare credit advertisements with confidence. We have required lenders to provide, at the outset, key information clearly on the product, and we have made early settlement charges fairer and more transparent for consumers.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The Bill builds on the good progress we have already made. We have consulted carefully and widely, with business, consumer groups and regulators. I am confident that this input has helped to get this legislation right.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The Bill itself is built around three key themes: enhancing consumer rights and redress; improving the regulation of consumer credit businesses; and ensuring that regulation is appropriate. Our first key objective is to enhance consumer rights and redress. We believe that consumers should have the right to challenge unfairness where it exists and obtain redress where appropriate. The current tools available to consumers for obtaining redress or solving credit disputes are, at best, limited. Where disputes with lenders arise, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1027"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1027</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consumers are often restricted to court action. This can be costly and time-consuming, for both consumers and lenders. As such, consumers are dissuaded from making what would be legitimate complaints. Furthermore, even where complaints are taken to court, examples of success for the consumer under the existing extortionate credit test are rare.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The Consumer Credit Bill addresses these problems in two key ways. First, the Bill will introduce an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) scheme for consumer credit disputes. ADR will empower consumers with a fast and effective means of resolving disputes, without having to resort to court action. The ADR scheme will be free for consumers, meaning that all consumers will have access to redress, and not just those who can afford to pay for it. The system will be run by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), an independent and credible ADR provider. In developing this ADR system, we have worked hard to ensure fairness on both sides of the dispute. Therefore, the FOS will be able to consider disputes only once a lender&#039;s internal complaints handling procedures have been exhausted. In addition, the FOS will be able to refuse any frivolous or vexatious claims, if appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Secondly, the Bill improves means of redress for consumers by replacing the out-of-date extortionate credit test. Too many real cases have shown that the old test sets the bar for what is &quot;extortionate&quot; too high to be of use. Equally, the test has been confined to the cost of credit or terms of agreement at the time the agreement was made. Noble Lords will appreciate that having a credit card or personal loan is not just about price. Many other factors can impact on an agreement, such as the lender&#039;s conduct in administering the loan. That is why the Consumer Credit Bill introduces a new test based on the principle of unfairness. Consumers will be entitled to apply to court to challenge agreements where there is an &quot;unfair credit relationship&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Under the new test, courts will be able to consider all aspects of the transaction, including the lender&#039;s conduct before and after making the agreement, the administration of the loan, and the overall terms and conditions of the agreement. The new unfair relationships test ensures that the courts will have wide discretion to assist those who face unfairness from lenders.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>On top of those improvements to rights and redress, consumers must also be confident that they are borrowing money from responsible lenders. Our second key objective is therefore to improve the regulation of consumer credit businesses. The Office of Fair Trading runs the consumer credit licensing regime and polices licence holders. But the OFT is currently hampered in its work by the bureaucracy associated <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1028"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1028</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with licence renewals, limited information-gathering powers and a lack of intermediate sanctions. The Bill will therefore streamline the licensing system. It will create more focused categories of licence and introduce standard indefinite licences, removing the need for renewal. That will make the regime easier for the OFT to administer and more proportionate for licensees.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The Bill will give the OFT powers to obtain the information it needs to ascertain and monitor the fitness of firms to hold a licence. The OFT will also be able to impose measured requirements on licensees, and financial penalties for failure to comply with such requirements in cases where it is not proportionate to withdraw the licence completely. Of course, we have put in place safeguards against disproportionate use of requirements. They include the obligation for the OFT to issue guidance, a procedure to seek representations from the affected person, and a right of appeal for licensees to the Consumer Credit Appeals Tribunal.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Bill also introduces a broader test that the OFT will use to decide whether someone is fit to hold a licence. The current test is too limited: it essentially relies on past behaviour as a guide to future conduct. The new fitness test will enable the OFT to assess positive evidence of credit competence on an ongoing basis. It will help the OFT to identify irresponsible lenders and drive them from the market.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>To industry&#039;s benefit, the new test ensures that businesses will need to satisfy the OFT only that they are &quot;fit&quot; to hold a licence for the specific area or areas of consumer credit activity that they undertake. This system will be less onerous for business and more targeted for the OFT, which will be able to concentrate its attention on the areas of highest risk. Enhancing OFT powers and the licensing regime in these ways will improve the way that consumer credit businesses are regulated.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Noble Lords will also appreciate that keeping consumers informed is an essential part of being a responsible lender. That is something that the Government have been particularly keen to promote. More informed and more confident consumers will reduce the risk of over-indebtedness and encourage competition in the market. The current regime means that consumers are too often surprised by arrears or default fees or are not even told when they are behind with their payments. The Bill will therefore ensure that lenders give consumers regular information about the state of their credit account, including whether they are in arrears, whether they have incurred default sums and whether they are incurring interest on judgment debts. These changes are essential, but their success also depends on the scope of regulation of consumer credit businesses.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>That is why our third and final aim is to ensure that regulation is appropriate. Regulation must be appropriate and measured, ensuring comprehensive protection for consumers, while allowing industry the flexibility to innovate. The consumer credit market, and the amounts consumers borrow, has grown considerably over the past 30 years. Nowadays, it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1029"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1029</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not uncommon for consumers to borrow more than &#163;25,000, for example, for debt consolidation purposes and second charge mortgages. But the existing legislation does not cover consumer credit borrowing over that amount. The Bill therefore removes the &#163;25,000 financial limit, extending the protections of the Act to cover all consumer borrowing.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Extensive consultation also highlighted concerns about the impact of regulation on business lending and &quot;high net worth&quot; individuals. We listened to those concerns to ensure that the Bill provides protection where it is needed. We will therefore maintain the protections for business lending under &#163;25,000 and exempt business lending above that limit.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The Bill also enables the Secretary of State to make secondary legislation allowing &quot;high net worth&quot; borrowers to opt out of regulation, provided they meet specified criteria and undertake certain steps. This not only empowers those individuals, but also allows industry the flexibility to innovate.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I have described in some detail the extended protections for consumers. However, lenders must also be confident that they are operating on a level playing field&#151;they should also be protected. Under Section 127 of the existing legislation, lenders can be unfairly penalised for minor, insignificant or technical breaches of certain requirements of the consumer credit legislation. In such cases, the agreement becomes automatically unenforceable. There have been cases where consumers have benefited unfairly from this.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The Bill therefore makes the Section 127 provisions more proportionate. It gives the courts full discretion to rule on the extent to which defective agreements may be enforced, or not, by the lender. This will not remove consumer protection, because agreements can still be found unenforceable. It will, however, be fairer for business. This more appropriate approach to unenforceability must be seen in the context of the wider reforms of this Bill, such as the new unfair relationships test and ADR provisions, which will provide more protection for consumers.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I have outlined the content of the Bill in some detail. I now refer briefly to one particular issue concerning something that is not in the Bill; namely, data sharing. This was the subject of lively and interesting debate in the other place. Lenders are not able to share data on credit accounts that were opened before the late 1990s, when it became routine for lenders to ask borrowers for permission to share their credit data.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>There has recently been some pressure from industry to use the Consumer Credit Bill as a vehicle for addressing this issue. However, as the Under-Secretary of State explained during the Report stage in the other place, the issues around data sharing are wider than just those covered by the Consumer Credit Act . It is also important to ensure that the benefits gained from the sharing of these data are proportionate to the legislative measures involved. Noble Lords will appreciate that we do not want to rush out approach to this complex issue.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1030"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1030</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Data sharing will therefore not feature in the Bill. However, the Government have listened to industry and believe that data sharing is a necessary and important means of ensuring responsible lending. So I am pleased to announce that we intend to consult on the issues raised by industry proposals, to investigate the case for relaxing restrictions on data sharing for the purposes of assessing ability to pay credit. This will ensure that we get the approach to data sharing right.
</p>

<a name="51024-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>In conclusion, the Bill is a comprehensive and long-awaited piece of legislation. It received a relatively smooth and quick passage through the other place. It provides a balanced set of provisions, which will benefit both consumers and industry. It builds on a significant amount of previous work, it enhances consumer rights and redress, it improves the regulation of consumer credit businesses, and it ensures appropriate regulation. The Bill sets the framework for a fair, clear and competitive consumer credit market for the 21st century. I commend it to the House.

<a name="51024-05_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, before I begin what I had intended to say, I only realised as I read the newspaper today that it is the Minister&#039;s birthday&#151;a very significant one. With the leave of the House, I pass on all our good wishes to him.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I thank the Minister for his full and clear explanation of the Bill. We are already somewhat familiar with it, due to it being the second time that it has reached your Lordships&#039; House, after twice passing through the other place and being dropped here because of the general election.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a> First, I shall restate our attitude to the general principle of the Bill, as stated by my honourable friends during both Second Readings in the other place. The Bill presents Parliament with a valuable opportunity to bring the law on consumer credit&#151;which is largely based on a 30 year-old law&#151;up to date.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The whole market, the attitude of borrowers and the opportunity to incur debt have changed out of all recognition since 1974. For example, the number of issuers of credit cards has risen from a handful in 1974 to some 1,300 today and whereas a credit account with a major store was then a sort of status symbol, they are now pressed on customers at every possible opportunity. That is an important background that the Bill has to address. It took 600 years of banking history for household debt to reach half a trillion pounds but in the eight years since the Government took power, it has more than doubled to more than 1.1 trillion. One household in five is now using more than a quarter of its income on consumer credit repayments.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I assure the Minister that I am not making any political point on this by suggesting that it is anything to do with the Government, but it is a fact that the current buoyant state of the consumer market is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1031"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1031</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

caused by a comparable increase in GDP or by the wise stewardship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is caused by the torrent of credit available to almost everybody and anybody and the daily incitement to remortgage the family home, instead of treating the windfall in house prices as extra security for old age. Having said all that, I am saying in general terms that we accept the Bill and are pleased to see it come before this House.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I find most objectionable the sort of television advertisement in which someone is paraded in front of the camera to explain how his crushing burden of multiple debts has been replaced by a single affordable monthly payment. So far, so good. But then he goes on to say, &quot;So we even had enough left over to pay for a new car or a new holiday&quot; as though building up further debt was an acceptable or appropriate way to behave. Do these people not realise that they will be paying for that holiday for the next quarter of a century or that the car will long have been scrapped before they have finished paying for it? It is no wonder that the Bank of England has repeatedly expressed concern at the level of personal indebtedness and the economic consequences that will ensue if the bubble ever bursts.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>In supporting the objectives of the Bill, we have certain reservations that, despite two opportunities during its passages through the other place, the Government have not been able to rectify. There is a lack of detail in some aspects of the Bill that could have been cleared up since January, when it received its First Reading in the other place. That is bad for business and consumers alike. With 11 months of extra time, there is no reason why drafts of the regulations in respect of matters that the Government choose to cover by secondary legislation should not be available now for us to see. The Government should also know that, in view of the far-reaching effect of the regulations that will affect so many vulnerable people, we will press for those regulations to be subject to the affirmative procedure.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>While endorsing the extended protection that the Bill will give consumers, it should be an underlying principle that no additional burden is placed on legitimate business without there being a positive effect. The case that the Minister mentioned was not familiar to me, but I know of the infamous Meadows case, where a loan of &#163;5,750 escalated, despite payment of instalments, to a staggering &#163;384,000, resulting in the courts having to exercise some judicial ingenuity to strike down that iniquitous claim.

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Clause 19 introduces a so-called &quot;unfairness test&quot;. That fulfils the much-needed objective to redress the balance between creditor and debtor in the same way that legislation on unfair terms and conditions does in other fields. However, we believe that it definitely needs modification, so that it still removes any imbalance against the debtor but will not provide an unfair escape loophole to avoid a legitimate debt incurred with a reasonable and responsible creditor. The Government have not met our concerns on this <br>&nbsp;<br>

point. We will introduce some amendments in what we consider to be one of the core provisions of the Bill for your Lordships and the Government to consider.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I have listened with care to what the Minister said about data-sharing. I am sure it will not surprise him that I intended to bring that up, and say why we thought it was a valuable tool. In view of what he has said about the review they will initiate, however, I shall leave out a couple of paragraphs of my speech, which will no doubt please your Lordships. To give one simple fact, there were 13,229 individual bankruptcies in the first quarter of this year&#151;an increase of 1.6 per cent on the previous quarter, and nearly 28 per cent on the same quarter in 2004.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Then there are the functions of the OFT. We believe that they need to be spelt out more precisely, including the way that it should be empowered to issue so-called guidance, which can have far-reaching effects on the credit industry. We want that guidance to be subject to oversight by the Secretary of State who in turn is, of course, answerable to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The Bill provides for civil penalties for certain breaches of its provisions. These penalties should be subject to five-yearly reviews and amended, if appropriate, by order&#151;in the same way that some criminal penalties are, without taking up parliamentary time with primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>There is also what is called the &quot;half-rule&quot;, which I confess I had never heard of until I started looking into the Bill and received numerous briefs from the lobbyists about it. As anyone who has ever read the extraordinary fine print of a hire-purchase agreement will know, the rule relates to the consequences of early cancellation of the agreement by the hirer. Saying that I had never before heard of it makes it quite clear that I never read a hire-purchase agreement until now; I leave such things to my husband. The half-rule is claimed to be an out-of-date issue, but we will be putting down a probing amendment to ascertain the Government&#039;s view, which has not hitherto been made clear.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>We have views on the unsolicited increasing of credit card limits and the blatant sales device of credit card cheques. Those are designed to suck the customer into extra spending and liability to interest. I do not know which of your Lordships read page 20 of the <i>Times</i> today. It was in reading the <i>Times</i> that I discovered it was the Minister&#039;s important birthday today, but on page 20 Rose Heiney, a student, tells her story in her own words. She has just been approved for another gold card&#151;the third in the last two months, with a loan facility of &#163;6,000 and the withdrawal power of &#163;500 a day. She said, quite rightly, that she will probably end her studies in debt anyway; she has to live, to buy books, and so on. She tends to be a rather extravagant girl, and she said she certainly does not need more credit cards foisted upon her. I hope that the Minister will in due course look into such things&#151;they do cause problems.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para13"></a>

like to mention that my noble friend Lord Mawhinney and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark of Calton, will both be making their maiden speeches today. I look forward to hearing them and would like to congratulate them in advance, for obviously I know not what they say. I also congratulate the noble Baroness who will be responding to this debate with her maiden speech, and wish her every success in her time on the Front Bench.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>We will table any necessary amendments in good time, so as to enable the Government to have ample opportunity to consider them&#151;instead of being able to say, straight off, no, we do not have time. We want them to be able to consider our amendments carefully. This is a sufficiently uncontroversial Bill for the Government to be able to discuss with us any differences which are likely to be on detail rather than principle. I hope that they will feel able to do so.
</p>

<a name="51024-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>My noble friend Lord De Mauley will be winding up and will mention some other matters that concern us. While mentioning my noble friend, it is right that I mention to your Lordships as a courtesy to Ministers and to the House that he has kindly agreed to take a substantial part in the carriage of this Bill from these Benches to give me a chance to recover from a very nasty gastric ulcer from which I am suffering. However, let me assure your Lordships that that is nothing whatever to do with the Government or, indeed, the Minister, who has crossed swords with me many times across the Dispatch Box.

<a name="51024-06_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we would all respond to what the noble Baroness has just said by wishing her a speedy recovery.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Two Christmases ago, I received an advertisement from a bank that invited me to make my Christmas happy with a personal loan. I hope that no one has offered to make the Minister unhappy on his birthday with a similar offer.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I ought to begin by declaring an interest, although I am not entirely sure about the boundary between declaring and advertising an interest. I am the author of a book on the subject, so I declare that interest and say that the book is available at all good bookshops.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Like many people who have spoken about the Bill, including the noble Baroness, I support it. Paradoxically, the relatively small number of noble Lords who have advanced their names to speak in this debate reflects the fact that it is relatively uncontroversial and widely supported. That is a very good thing. It is extremely important that we deal with issues of unfairness. As it has not been mentioned so far, I acknowledge the contribution of an excellent report produced by a commission under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, which I believe was set up by the then shadow Chancellor and which has many valuable things to say on this topic.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Behind the Bill lies the awareness, which is widely shared, that the place of the market in credit is extremely important, but that it cannot be left to itself. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1034"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1034</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

This is not an area where we can simply let price decide; there are public interest issues in the level of credit and how it is given and enforced. That is why the part of the Bill that begins with Clause 19 is so important. The introduction of the notion of unfairness in a credit relationship seems right. I do not agree with the Confederation of British Industry that that must be spelled out in great detail. That seems precisely a matter that we can look to the courts to decide, while providing through our debate some indication of some of the factors that we want the courts to bear in mind in considering unfairness in the matter of credit relationships.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I realise, as will other noble Lords who have received the same briefings, that a debate is under way among those who deal a lot with the vulnerable victims of indebtedness about whether some kind of ceiling on interest rates would be a good thing, with the citizens&#039; advice bureaux, whose experience in this matter is formidable, briefing against it, and Debt on our Doorstep, which includes a huge number of significant agencies, considering that one would be helpful. My view is that the interest rate should definitely be a factor that the courts could bear in mind in deciding whether a loan is unfair. I do not believe that one has to spell out an exact figure, and I am certainly not in favour of the criminalisation of lenders unless, of course, they resort to threatening behaviour. But interest rates can be unfair, even if they are properly notified and agreed with.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>In a matter of this kind, if one allows the market to rule, there will be those whose weakness in the market and in their general financial circumstances makes them likely to enter into relationships that are unfair and which it is not in the public interest that they should enter into. It is certainly not in the public interest that we should provide courts and legislative machinery for the recovery of debts from people who have been the victims of very unfair interest rates.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>It seems to me that the situation is analogous to world trade. It is possible for a market to produce situations that are unfair, and if they are unfair, it is proper for society to intervene, whether nationally or internationally, to rectify that unfairness. In that respect, I do not believe that the market should be sacrosanct.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>My main purpose in speaking in this debate is not one that will have any direct effect on the drafting of the Bill, but it is something that we need to think more seriously about than we are apt to: that is the cause for reflection contained in the very title of the Bill: consumer credit. Those words draw attention to the fact that the rates of interest and loans, to which we are devoting attention in this debate, are for consumption. Without doubt, attitudes to the use of borrowing for the purpose of consumption have changed radically in our lifetime. In an earlier debate, the then Minister said that in making this point I was asking for a return to pre-modern economics. That is not the case. I ask that we take seriously what our parents and certainly our grandparents would have taken very seriously, that the escalation of indebtedness is not a social situation with which we should be content.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1035"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1035</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>There is no doubt that the availability of credit and the changing attitudes to credit have had a major effect on, for example, the housing market and on levels of consumption. That has produced a bubble which might burst, causing enormous human suffering. Even if it does not burst, it is already having an effect on the consumption of the world&#039;s resources which should be available for tomorrow. We are treating the planet on which we live as a credit card; a credit card with no credit limit and no repayment date. That is because we have allowed attitudes to change in a very uncritical way. I am not asking for a return to pre-Depression economics, but it seems to me that we have sleep-walked into a realm of imprudence about which a good deal of further reflection and, if necessary, economic and legislative action may be required.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>In that connection, perhaps I can comment on what the Minister and the noble Baroness have said on data sharing. One of the insufficiently remarked on aspects of data sharing is the weakness in the credit market of anyone who has never borrowed before. It is almost becoming necessary to advise people to take out a loan even if they do not need one because only if one has had a loan and repaid it does one have a credit rating. That is a serious situation, in which we are disadvantaging people for living within their means.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>We also need to take seriously the effect the transfer of finance from grant-aiding to loans has had on the student population. It is true that when grants were inadequate people took out loans, but now they have one kind of loan&#151;a student loan&#151;and other loans, offered by the banks which they usually need to take up. That is educating people to fail to distinguish between loans for investment and loans for consumption, and that is deeply misleading. We should be very concerned about that, and I should like to feel that the Government would be similarly concerned.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>So the issue of data sharing is not just an issue of civil liberties, though it certainly is that. It is also a subtle means by which people are lured into a level of debt beyond what they should have. I am concerned that, as well as attending to the detail of this Bill&#151;and I hope to play some part in that&#151;and ensuring that the unfairness test includes all the factors that can contribute to unfairness in a debt and credit relationship, we do not put from our minds the aspect of economic change in our general living, which is this escalation in debt and credit.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I frequently use the example of people who took out mortgages before the war, and were quite clear that it was their duty to repay as quickly as possible, because others might need a mortgage more than they did. Imagine walking into a building society today and saying that you would like to repay your mortgage in order that someone who needs it more than you do could have one: you would certainly be looked at as though you were from another planet. That is quite a grave situation&#151;a situation in which people are encouraged to borrow beyond their means. One of the things I shall be looking out for in Committee is that we make clear to ourselves that allowing somebody to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1036"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1036</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

borrow what they cannot properly repay should be grounds for being deemed to have entered into an unfair credit relationship.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I repeat my support for this Bill; I repeat my support for the desire to do something about unfairness in debt and credit relationships. I wish to add that some of that unfairness is induced by the totally uncritical attitude adopted in recent years to the explosion in credit. I believe we should remedy this before it is too late.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I know that the House is eagerly awaiting the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, and will welcome the enormous experience, not least in this area, that he will bring to the work of the House.

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="51024-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Mawhinney: </b>   My Lords, on making my maiden speech, it is a great pleasure to follow my noble friend, Lady Miller of Hendon and the right reverend Prelate. As an Anglican of the evangelical tradition, he will not be surprised that he and I take a broadly similar view of this piece of legislation.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Last Thursday, along with many others, I attended St Margaret&#039;s Church for the memorial service of my very good personal friend and former member of this House, Emily, Lady Blatch, of Hinchingbrooke. In the bidding Canon Robert Wright said that Emily Blatch rapidly came to adore the House of Lords. I empathise with that view. It is a great privilege to be elected to serve the people in the other place. In joining your Lordships&#039; House, I feel myself doubly privileged and doubly blessed. I thank Members of this House and the staff for the warm welcome and courtesy they have shown me in the past few weeks. It was much warmer and more embracing than the welcome that I was offered when I entered the other place in 1979. I seek only the traditional patience of your Lordships as I learn the details of the operation of the House, where there are snags aplenty for a new boy. I also thank my very old friends, my noble friends Lord Harris of Peckham and Lord King of Bridgwater for being willing to stand with me at my introduction.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I commend the Government on introducing the Bill, and I thank the Minister for his careful exposition of it. It follows legislation enacted in 1974. Much has changed since then. I had access to the same information as others. Then, there was one credit card company and &#163;30 million of debt; today, there are 1,300 credit cards and almost &#163;50 billion of debt.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>As the right reverend Prelate pointed out, we also have a different view of debt today. We are less censorious. He rightly pointed out that there were down sides to that more liberal view, but it has also resulted in an improvement of life for many people. Financial markets have been liberalised and, as a consequence, choice has been extended, as we have heard and, no doubt, will hear further. That has been to the benefit of consumers, assuming always that they keep in mind the golden rule&#151;the need to balance debt with the ability to pay that debt. The second golden rule is to remember that debt that is affordable this year may not be affordable next year.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51024-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Not only has there been change since the previous legislation, the speed of change is startling. My noble friend quoted the remark made by our right honourable friend the Member for West Dorset about how we had had 600 years of banking history and eight years in which debt has doubled. That is a frightening speed of change. In June, at Second Reading in the other place, my honourable friend the Member for Wealden said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;Research by Datamonitor reveals that consumer borrowing for each adult in the UK through credit cards, motor and retail finance deals, overdrafts and unsecured personal loans has risen to more than &#163;4,000, which is an increase of . . . almost 50 per cent. since 2000&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 9/6/05; col. 1417.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The Bank of England has confirmed that household debt is rising at the rate of 15 per cent a year. The legislation is welcome in principle, not just because things have changed but because things are changing so quickly.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>There are four concerns that, I hope, will be addressed satisfactorily before the Bill makes its way to the statute book, as undoubtedly it will. I cannot be the only Member of your Lordships&#039; House who almost weekly receives through the mail unsolicited invitations to sign up for yet another credit card, each one of which has an advantage that makes that card the one that I always must have. I yield to no one in my admiration for the market place and for the freedom of the market place, but the right reverend Prelate was right: occasionally, in public interest terms, we must look at the operation of the market place. I for one would be happy to have fewer unsolicited invitations to get into debt, and I hope that the Bill will address that issue before it reaches the statute book. I am not quite sure of the procedures here, but I declare that I have one credit card. I used to have two, the second as a back-up, but at the moment I have only one.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The second issue that I hope the Bill will address is the unsolicited increases in borrowing limits. No one has ever asked me whether I wanted my borrowing limit raised, but it has been raised regularly over the years. No one has ever checked whether I have the ability to repay the credit limit that the banks have so generously bestowed upon me. I hope the Bill will address that issue as well.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>As a former Member of Parliament, I know the destruction that can occur to individuals and families through a combination of those two events. People can, and do, get into the most enormous debt. Only the scariest stories appear in the media, but Members of Parliament can testify that they hear many equally scary stories in their surgeries and are not capable of offering the kind of help their constituents seek.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The third issue I hope the Bill will address before it reaches the statute book is the necessity for much greater clarity about where financial responsibility lies when cards are fraudulently cloned. I have to declare another interest: twice in the past few years my credit card has been cloned. I pay tribute to the HSBC bank, with which I bank, that it spotted at least the first one before I spotted it. It is possible to take out insurance but there is a grey area, in my experience, between the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1038"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1038</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bank assuming responsibility and the individual assuming responsibility. I hope that there will be much greater clarity on that point before the Bill reaches the statute book.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Finally, I hope that, arising from this legislation, consumers will have much clearer, more jargon-free information about contracts, with greater transparency which makes it easier for consumers to understand what it is they are signing up to. I welcome the unfair relationship test but I would like more definition; I would like to know what it means. I hope we can find out what it means from the Minister during the passage of this legislation. I know from 26 years&#039; experience that most ordinary people do not instinctively think of going to the courts when they have a problem. Most of them are, understandably and correctly, very nervous about taking on big organisations with almost unlimited resources; many are simply financially not capable of resorting to the courts. So, for those reasons, we need new systems in place that are easier to understand, easier to work and easier to produce results, when appropriate, for consumers. In this legislation the unfair relationship test is crucial, but it needs more work.
</p>

<a name="51024-06_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The 1974 Act took six years to achieve full implementation. It would be helpful to know at some point how long the Government think will be necessary to allow for full implementation of this Act and whether guidance will be offered towards the intermediate stages as the Act is implemented. I, too, welcome the legislation and I hope to take an interest in its passage through your Lordships&#039; House.

<a name="51024-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, it is a great honour and privilege to follow the noble Lord in his maiden speech. He had a distinguished career in the other place and held a number of important offices, ending up with the somewhat arduous task of being chairman of the Conservative Party. But despite the many successes that he has had, I was reminded during his speech that he has had his failures as well. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, came into the Chamber. I believe that he defeated the noble Lord when he was trying to get his feet on the first rung of the ladder.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>It is very encouraging that the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, has sought to make his maiden speech quite so soon after his elevation to this House. There are those Members of this House who have held high office whom we do not see much; there are others who, we are glad to note, feel that they have a further contribution to make. I take it that the thoughtful, excellent speech that the noble Lord has delivered today is an earnest that we will hear more from him in the future. After all, to use a word that has become common in the past few days in various contexts, I have a feeling that the noble Lord has a &quot;hinterland&quot;; in fact, he has several hinterlands. He has Northern Ireland; he has the Church of England; and he has something which is quite rare in this House, let alone in the other House: he is a scientist. In all those <br>&nbsp;<br>

respects, he will be welcome to speak on whatever subject he chooses. We all must welcome his arrival in this House and wish him well for the future.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I declare an interest, albeit a past interest, in that between 1976 and 1992, I was head of the Office of Fair Trading, which was responsible for the licensing system that was established by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It was realised even then that we had moved on a great deal. The checks to determine the fitness of someone to hold a licence helped to clear the industry of some of its worst elements. The Minister has already indicated that it is most helpful that the Bill widens the criteria on which a trader can be tested by covering competence as well as fitness. A very serious weakness of the 1974 Act was that the only sanction for misbehaviour was the nuclear one. To say that some eminent bank should be deprived of its licence to lend to hundreds of thousands of people because of some minor misdemeanour would have been absurd. The current Bill, I am happy to say, proposes a flexible range of sanctions, including reprimands and fines as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>It is worth saying&#151;the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, mentioned it&#151;that the Crowther committee stated in 1971 that most people used credit wisely. I read that phrase again recently. I had a feeling that the committee was perhaps being a little over-optimistic. Or perhaps that was the feeling in 1971. I think that most people probably still use credit wisely, but it is evident that there are more worries about it now. However, the freedom of access to credit should not be unduly restricted. There is hardship today among people who are over-committed, but that hardship could be far worse if, for example, a statutory ceiling on interest pushed more people into the arms of illegal money lenders and loan sharks operating in the shadows of our major cities.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I notice that it was mentioned in the debates in the House of Commons that the OFT draft guidelines on fitness to hold a licence refer to the need to be sure that the borrower can repay the loan. I do not know how many of those credit banks and credit card purveyors to whom the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, quite rightly referred really check up on the student who was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I do not suppose that they check up at all&#151;they just hope for the best. If that is to become a reality, however, we need to hear a lot more from the OFT and its guidelines.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The 1974 Act included provisions to protect consumers from so-called extortionate credit bargains. There seems to have been an all-party view in the House of Commons in the passage of the Bill that that definition of extortionate credit bargains was so high a hurdle as to be pretty useless. For 30 years, experience suggests that the provisions have hardly been of any use in protecting vulnerable consumers from exploitation. The Government are right&#151;subject to a qualifying remark I will make&#151;to replace them with Clauses 19 to 22, so that a court can consider all <br>&nbsp;<br>

aspects of the agreement and the way it is operated to see if the relationship between the creditor and the debtor is unfair.

<a name="51024-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I understand the concerns of banks and others, some of whom have lobbied me on the subject and, no doubt, have lobbied others. They are worried about the uncertainty of the test. They do not know when the relationship will be regarded as unfair. In the nature of things, legislation cannot foresee all the circumstances in which vulnerable consumers may be exploited. Given that we are unlikely to have another consumer credit Bill for another 30 years, how can anyone foresee what relationships may be regarded as unfair? Reliance ought mainly to be placed on the courts.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Clause 22&#151;which I confess I do not fully understand and hope the Minister will help to explain&#151;talks about giving guidance on the inter-relationship between the provisions on unfair relationships and Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, allowing the Office of Fair Trading to bring proceedings against anyone who harms the collective interests of consumers. Will the Minister give an indication of the OFT&#039;s intentions regarding Clause 22? Without such guidance, I should mention something significant: the legal opinion of eminent counsel Michael Beloff QC, obtained by the banks, is that these provisions do not satisfy the requirement of legal certainty in the European Convention on Human Rights. I do not know whether that is so, but that is a belief, and, as the opinion has been made available to me and others over the months, I am sure the Minister may be able to provide an indication of an answer.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I welcome too, as do the Citizens Advice Bureaux, not remarkably, the introduction of the ombudsman scheme allowing for better access to justice&#151;and, as the Minister emphasises, without charge to the consumer. That is most important. Since the 1960s, ombudsmen have been gradually dealing with disputes, both in the private and public sector. They have been a great success as an alternative dispute resolution. One of these successes has been the financial services ombudsman, Mr Walter Merricks, and the extension of that scheme to consumer credit&#151;financed by a levy on the licensees, incidentally&#151;builds on proven achievement.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I would like to raise a matter that has not been referred to by the Minister, perhaps because it emerged just before the general election and has been followed up since. In March 2005, around the time when the Consumer Credit Bill passed through all its stages in the Commons and had its First Reading in this House, just before the election, Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury published an important report by Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of Sainsbury&#039;s, entitled <i>Reducing Administrative Burdens</i>. It has some significance on the Bill now before us; and I believe that we should be told what that significance is. A key proposal in the Hampton report is to create a new body at the centre of government to co-ordinate the work of consumer protection and local authority trading standards. In July&#151;which your Lordships will appreciate was just <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1041"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1041</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

after the general election&#151;the Government put out a consultation paper on the Hampton proposals, for which the response period has just expired.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The Bill assumes that the well established Office of Fair Trading, for which I have a certain regard, will continue to be the licensing and enforcement body, as it has been since the Consumer Credit Act 1974, when it has worked in close harmony with local authority trading standards officers. But I am worried that on two counts the Hampton report creates great uncertainty, in saying that although the new consumer protection agency could be based within the OFT, it might be preferable to create a new body separate from the OFT&#039;s competition responsibilities and therefore,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;wholly focused on this major task&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>as the consultation paper says. That seems to be the favoured proposition of the Government&#039;s consultation paper. But then a mere footnote on page 65 of the Hampton report says that the Government may want to consider,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;whether the consumer credit functions of the OFT should pass to the Financial Services Authority&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Nobody else has mentioned that&#151;it was not mentioned by the Minister today.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I am not at all sure that it is desirable to separate the consumer protection functions of the OFT from its competition policy functions, and the Hampton report is clearly in two minds about that because it talks of the need for strong linkages between consumer and competition policy. Further, it is a new complexity to this House&#039;s consideration of the Bill that instead of assuming that the consumer credit licensing powers as amended by the Bill will remain in the experienced hands of the OFT, it may be transferred to that super-regulator, the Financial Services Authority, with its vast-ranging other responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="51024-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I hope that I am not being awkward in asking the Minister whether he can throw light on those responsibilities. I realise that I am perhaps placing a burden on the Advocate General for Scotland whom I welcome in giving her maiden speech in this debate, but this is an important issue and I hope that we can consider it.

<a name="51024-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   My Lords, it is with some trepidation that I follow the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, because he probably has more experience than many noble Lords in these matters, not only through his distinguished service with the OFT but in consumer credit matters generally. I warmly join him in congratulating my noble friend Lord Mawhinney on his most excellent maiden speech. In another place, he had responsibilities placed on his shoulders that normal mortals would have found extremely difficult to discharge. He did so with great distinction and great good humour and all of us, particularly noble Lords on this side of the House, welcome him most warmly. His light-touch, thoughtful and pithy style will be much welcomed in your Lordships&#039; House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1042"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1042</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>My only qualifications for participating in this debate is to be one of a long line of former Ministers from the other place who had responsibility&#151;briefly, for two years&#151;for deregulation. I want to concentrate on and follow some of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, made. I am clear that the Bill should be welcomed as a whole. Clearly your Lordships, following convention, will welcome its Second Reading, but the devil is of course in the detail. I want to flag up some areas that I hope your Lordships will look at in Grand Committee&#151;as I understand it will be if your Lordships so decide.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>In opening, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, said that he and the Government wished there to be a fair, clear and competitive credit market. The noble Lord is right and the whole House would agree with him. The question is how those great principles are applied in the Bill. I would like to follow the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in considering some aspects of the Bill in the light of Philip Hampton&#039;s excellent report, which I hope that some of your Lordships will have had the chance to read. It was published for the Treasury in March 2005 and, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, is called <i>Reducing Administrative Burdens: Effective Inspection and Enforcement</i>.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>A survey shows that businesses generally are concerned about the cumulative burden of regulation. The estimates, which I have not heard challenged by the Government, are that the costs of regulation per annum vary between &#163;20 billion and &#163;40 billion&#151;a staggering sum. To put that figure in statistics that your Lordships might better comprehend, David Arculus, the excellent chairman of the Better Regulation Task Force, commented in his report of March this year that if the Government could cut administrative costs of regulation on businesses in the United Kingdom, there could be a gain of about 1 per cent per annum of the GDP. That is a staggering sum and I believe that David Arculus is correct.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>There are three tests we should use in analysing not only the Bill as a whole but some of its detail, which we can come to in Committee. First, are the intrusion and the costs of regulatory burden minimised? I accept what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester said; I agree with him and the Minister that this is a legitimate area for legislation, but it is also legitimate for the House to question exactly what the burden is on the supplier of credit as well as dealing with the fairness of the way in which industry conducts its business with the demanders of credit.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I am not convinced that Clause 38, which gives a broad responsibility to the OFT, meets that test. We will need to return to it in some detail in Committee. The powers of the OFT need to be clear and much more limited than they are enshrined in the present clause. Your Lordships might be interested if I quote Philip Hampton on burdens. He was talking about risk and how the important principle is for a regulator to look at where the risk is and not seek to legislate for all aspects of business. In his report, he said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;risk assessment is not being implemented as thoroughly and comprehensively as it should be&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1043"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1043</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>by regulators in the United Kingdom. He came up with a recommendation that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;Comprehensive risk assessment should be the foundation of all regulators&#039; enforcement programmes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>If the OFT will be responsible for the years to come in administering the respective legislation it is important that it follows that principle.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Secondly, is a level playing field maintained between the protection of the consumer and the profitability of the supplier? The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, spoke approvingly of that principle and I agree with him: he is right. The right reverend Prelate implicitly supported the principles of Clause 19, which deals with the unfair relationship between the supplier and the consumer of credit. But I agreed my noble friend Lord Mawhinney when he suggested that in Committee we should look at what that clause actually means. I am not satisfied that it meets the level playing field test. It needs further work and further clarity.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The final test relates to something to which the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, referred. Does this legislation impede or permit the future consolidation of regulators, as Philip Hampton recommended? One option in his report was that both the OFT and the Financial Services Authority should cede powers to a new regulator, the consumer and trading standards agency. I join the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in asking the Minister to confirm the timetable for the consolidation of regulators, particularly in the consumer credit field. Is it true that we are still looking at April 2009, which seems a long time away? I know that some senior people in the OFT are nervous about the OFT ceding responsibility to a new agency on the grounds that it could produce a worse situation&#151;one that was more bureaucratic and less flexible. However, I was not entirely convinced by some of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. We need to look with a sceptical eye at whether it would not be better to cease the functions of the OFT and that part of the FSA&#039;s responsibilities for consumer credit, and establish one regulator in place of a number of them.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I conclude by echoing the comments of my noble friend Lady Miller. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark of Calton, will be making her maiden speech and I am sure that she will deal with the debate in her normal courteous style. Last time I participated in a debate in this House, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, also made her maiden speech, which was a cracker of a winding up speech.

One reason for that is that I have been fortunate enough in my life never to have had to get into debt, and I am appalled by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester telling me that I probably will be unable to get into debt in the future.

</p>

<a name="51024-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I suppose I should commiserate with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark, because no one will be able to speak after her and tell her how well she did. I am sure that we will all do so in the bar afterwards, if she allows us to, but we all have to tell her how well she is going to speak before having what will undoubtedly be that proof.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I have sat in this Chamber for 30-odd years and if I were putting together a small anthology of the best speeches from the Bishops&#039; Benches, I would say that they were always good&#151;in both senses of the term: both right and almost always good. I seldom hear a bad speech from those Benches, but the number that plunge deeply into the ethical depths of the Christian religion are few, and I think that we heard such a speech today. I entirely agree with parts of that speech, and welcome it as something new for me to take on board.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The reason for putting my name down today is to deal with the questions of caps and ceilings on interest rates. It is obviously a fraught issue. I have fortunately had the briefing from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, as have some of your Lordships, which I take extremely seriously. I have not had the benefit of the opposing briefing on this point, but no doubt we will be able to look at it in Committee and thrash it out there. At the moment I am persuaded by NACAB. It argues a counter-intuitive case, because the obvious reaction of NACAB, myself, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester, and probably of the rest of your Lordships, would be that caps must be a good thing to protect the poor and the consumer. Yet there is a forceful case for the disadvantages of interfering with the operation of the capitalist market. I do not spend my time coming to the defence of the capitalist system, nor does the Green Party. Here, however, there is a considerable case for saying &quot;let the market work&quot;&#151;there is always a good case for saying that. NACAB makes the case that rate ceilings restrict the range and diversity of credit products available, and also that some lenders withdraw from the credit market altogether when a rate ceiling is introduced.
</p>

<a name="51024-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>This is not the moment to dwell on that, because it will come up in Committee and, as is usually the case, we will probably argue the subject into the ground. I thought to warn your Lordships that a beginner in this field would be intervening. I am glad that I put my name down, or I would not have had the good fortune to listen to two or three outstanding speeches this evening.

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I also apologise on behalf of my noble friend Lady Thomas of Walliswood, who is the chairman of Sub-Committee G of the European Union Committee. She is unfortunately indisposed today, but had hoped to speak in this debate and was anxious for your Lordships to know that Sub-Committee G has itself completed an interim report, published on 27 July this year, on the proposal from the European Commission for an EU directive on the harmonisation of consumer credit.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>In that report we drew attention, mainly on UK evidence alone, to the rapid growth in consumer credit and the proliferation of new credit products; the steep rise in indebtedness; aggressive competition between lenders, leading sometimes to reckless lending and the mis-selling of products; heavy-handed debt recovery practices; the need for clearer consumer-friendly information about lending terms and conditions; and the need for better protection for disadvantaged consumers.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>That inquiry has now been suspended, but we have had notice that the Commission is now bringing forward a revised directive, and we will continue with our inquiry as a result. As I said, the Commission has modified its position, but as yet we do not know whether the threat that the Commission may want to introduce EU-wide harmonisation of consumer credit has receded. But I say to my noble friend that, whatever the response of government, we hope that the EU directive does not weaken the scope and effectiveness of UK domestic consumer credit legislation, that it still offers the protection currently enjoyed by British consumers, and that it will not constrain the capacity of future governments to respond rapidly and flexibly to developments in the domestic consumer credit market which might not necessarily be replicated elsewhere in the EU.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>In concluding, I ask my noble friend whether the Government have had any first thoughts on the revised EU proposal for the consumer credit directive and whether current UK legislation might offer a model to the European Union upon which it can progress further thinking.

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>So far as concerns the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark of Calton, it is difficult for those of us who have not yet heard her maiden speech to congratulate her in advance. However, if the reputation with which she comes to this House is, as I know it will be, replicated in her maiden speech, then early congratulations are not premature.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>From these Benches, as right across the House, we welcome the Bill. I think it is more than 30 years since there was last a consumer credit Bill, and the Government&#151;or those responsible&#151;are to be congratulated on the timetabling. Having just lost the Bill when the election was called, they have fought their corner to include it early in the current government programme.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Clearly, in the 30 years since the previous legislation was enacted, as noble Lords have indicated, there has been a massive explosion of credit. That may be regretted in certain quarters, but it is worth indicating, and reflecting on, the fact that credit has meant a significant improvement in the standard of living of a lot of people. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester might reflect on whether the world is a better place since the days when people had to save to have a fridge or washing machine&#151;white goods that we all regard as an essential part of everyday life&#151;because people can use credit to have a standard of living that they might not otherwise be able to achieve. It is easy to criticise the actions of credit card companies and lenders, and of course I share that criticism. However, we should not ignore the serious benefits to society&#151;particularly those less well off&#151;of properly managed credit.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>That leads us to the real issue: what is properly managed credit? Clearly, nobody wants to live in a world in which people take on liabilities that they cannot afford, with the financial tragedies that often result. The first issue&#151;on which I think the Government have the almost unanimous approval of your Lordships, and the general consensus seems to be in support of the Government&#039;s position&#151;is whether we should cap interest rates. There has been a very effective campaign led, although not exclusively, by the Reverend Paul Nicholson. We have all been subjected to lobbying from that quarter over the months.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>From these Benches, I detect that the general opinion of your Lordships is that it would not be correct to impose that credit cap. The Bill is correct in that. Most of us accept the evidence from the National <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1047"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1047</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and others that the imposition of interest rate ceilings can exclude high-risk borrowers from the licensed commercial credit market. That is a rather pompous way of saying that if we imposed interest rate caps a lot of people would fall into the hands of unscrupulous moneylenders whose methods of collection would not commend themselves to your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Having said that we support the Bill, that does not mean that we do not have concerns. My party and the other opposition party raised a number of concerns as the Bill went through the other place. The first is over the new powers being given to the Office of Fair Trading. There is a concern that it will effectively be able to create new law simply by issuing guidance. A number of the provisions and powers given to the OFT under this legislation are quite draconian. I can do no better than repeat the words of my friend Norman Lamb, a Member of Parliament in another place on Third Reading:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;There needs to be a legislative framework for the exercise of these onerous powers; unfettered discretion is dangerous&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 14/6/05; col. 1006.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>We will be looking to put guidance for the Office of Fair Trading&#039;s exercise of these powers into the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The second concern, which other noble Lords have touched upon, is with the definition of &quot;unfairness&quot;. I am sure that we will have another go at the question of defining &quot;unfair relationships&quot; in Committee. In another place, the Government resisted an attempt to define &quot;unfair relationships&quot;. Those of us who have either been, or have access to, lawyers, can spend a lot of time asking whether we are treating this as a definition under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999; or whether we are going to go back to the definition of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, in <i>The Director-general of Fair Trading </i>v<i> First National Bank</i> in 2001; or whether we are going to simply say that it is a matter for the courts.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The problem with saying that it is a matter for the courts is that it will take a considerable period of time for a body of precedent to be established to provide a definition of an unfair relationship. I know the other side&#039;s argument, and the arguments are finely balanced. The Government will say, as they said in another place, that we do not know how the definition of unfairness is going to develop in the years ahead. But we will be arguing that there is no reason why the Government cannot take regulatory powers to provide a definition of an unfair relationship and amend it as we go through the next decade. We will be arguing for that in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>There are other issues on which we were unsatisfied with the Government&#039;s proposals as the Bill passed through another place. The first is the question of data. The Minister touched on it in his remarks. There is an issue regarding the capture and dissemination of data in pre-1999&#151;or pre-1998, I forget which&#151;agreements. The Government&#039;s position appears to be that it is a serious issue and that extensive consultation needs to take place before they can bring in regulations or legislation to deal with it. The problem with that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1048"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1048</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

approach is that legislative time is precious. We have not had a consumer credit Bill for 30 years. If this is a serious issue, what powers do the Government think they will have to deal with the issue? Do they think that they would require primary legislation? If so, how will they find the legislative time to bring it in? If we are going to spend time dealing with this issue, which we would all welcome, is it not possible for the relevant consultation with the industry and government departments to take place before we get there?

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The next two points are rather technical, but they are important. We are concerned that they have been omitted from the Bill. The first is the calculation of interest. I think I am right that we are unique among western democracies in regarding the statement of the APR on any credit card statement as requisite to tell people the interest they are paying. I think I am also right that virtually every card company calculates the APR in a different way. This is a serious concern. If we are going to legislate once in 30 years and have it enshrined for the next 30 years, could we not deal with the question of greater transparency on the calculation of the interest rate paid on credit cards?
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The second point is again quite technical, but it affects a lot of people. It concerns the issue of cheques to credit card holders. There is a lot of misunderstanding and a lack of transparency here. People do not appreciate that cheques are treated by most credit card companies as credit card transactions at a different rate of interest that kicks in on the day the cheque is written. We want to probe that area and see whether the Bill can be improved.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Finally, a technical issue has been presented to those of us who have been lobbied by banking and lending organisations. It is also a question of principle. It is the issue of retrospection with regard to unfair relationship provisions. I do not want to give any noble Lords who may be expert on the subject a lecture on how the securitisation of mortgage lending works. Yet securitisation is a significant issue in the provision of proper competition between the traditional lending banks and building societies and other lenders. There, a collection of financial mortgage instruments is taken together, often financed from overseas, to provide more funding for the mortgage market. The industry is significantly concerned with the issue of unfair relationship provisions, and the proposal that those should be introduced retrospectively. The DTI originally suggested, in a policy statement communicated to lenders in February 2004, that the provisions dealing with unfairness would be applied in any forthcoming legislation to all existing agreements, but that lenders would have no financial liability in respect to actions taken before the law was changed.
</p>

<a name="51024-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>As the Minister will be aware, there is considerable concern that the Bill as currently drafted reverses that policy decision by the DTI. We will certainly wish to address that issue from these Benches in Committee, and looking at the eager anticipation on the faces of the Conservative opposition, I detect that they might support us on that.

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51024-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord De Mauley: </b>   My Lords, I begin by thanking all those noble Lords who have spoken so eloquently today. In particular, I welcome and congratulate my noble friend Lord Mawhinney on his excellent maiden speech and I much look forward to the maiden speech of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark of Calton. I join my noble friend in congratulating her in advance, not only on her maiden speech but also on her arrival on the Government Front Bench and on her position as Advocate General for Scotland. Both the noble Lord and the noble and learned Baroness will make knowledgeable contributions to the House that will add to the quality of debate generally, and in particular on this Bill.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I also humbly suggest that the relatively small number of speakers in the debate is more than compensated by the high quality of their contributions. That is what one would expect of such high-calibre speakers. Following them is enough to fill the inexperienced speaker with trepidation.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>As my noble friend Lady Miller has made clear, we on these Benches recognise the need for the Bill and its commendable updating of the legislation in the consumer credit sector. There is a commonality of interests between borrowers and lenders, because without the one the other cannot exist. Whatever amendments we do propose in due course will be balanced between those interests.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Before going further, I must declare interests both as a director and controlling shareholder of a small business which holds a consumer credit licence, and as a former director of two merchant banks&#151;and, in those days, an adviser to their clearing bank parents which engaged in the consumer credit business.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I turn to our concerns with the Bill. Our over-riding concern is perhaps with the lack of detail in the Bill. We feel that too many significant policy areas have been left to secondary legislation and guidance from the OFT&#151;an agency over which the Government have no ministerial control, in an area where it is also the regulator. As a result, there is a danger that it may become both judge and jury. That will create uncertainty for business and consumers. Like several organisations on the lending side, Credit Action&#151;a national charity committed to helping people manage their money better&#151;has told us that it too envisages problems arising through this lack of clear definition. As my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon said, at the very least we need to see the secondary legislation being subject to the affirmative procedure, and the OFT&#039;s guidance being subject to oversight by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>While a major criticism of the Consumer Credit Act is that it fails to provide the OFT with sufficient powers to tackle improper or unfair conduct by consumer credit businesses, we are concerned that the Bill, by contrast, goes too far. It expects the OFT effectively both to make law and to enforce it, yet there is no right of appeal.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1050"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1050</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights specifically expressed concerns about the OFT&#039;s proposed powers to impose requirements on licence holders where it is &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and concluded that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;the unfettered scope of this power fails to satisfy the requirements of reasonable legal certainty and risks the disproportionate use of the power in practice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, referred to the Hampton report and its suggestions for alternative regulators to the OFT. We think that the interests of all sides are best protected if the OFT is given a set of ground rules. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, referred to a legislative framework within which it can carry out those functions. We look forward to hearing how the Government plan to deal with that.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>I now move to the concept of unfair relationships, with the general idea of which we concur, as my noble friend Lady Miller said. Our concern, like that of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is that the provisions fail to provide legal certainty about whether a relationship is unfair. We feel that both lenders and borrowers would benefit from greater certainty. Furthermore, as the burden of proof is placed on the lender, it appears that every relationship will be deemed unfair until the contrary is proved. The DTI originally suggested that where the contract was clear and the consumer had not been misled, the burden of proof would switch in favour of the lender. We need to understand why that was dropped.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>As a separate but related matter, retrospective application of the new unfair relationship provisions after a one-year transitional period is potentially detrimental to lenders who have securitised credit agreements, who may find them adversely affected. The intended targets of retrospective application are, we understand, loan sharks, who will tend to operate outside the regulatory framework anyway and tend to take advantage of vulnerable customers. We therefore need to know the justification for retrospective application.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>We have concerns about the use of what are known as typical rates. Loans, in particular, are often advertised at such typical rates, where it is permitted that up to one-third of customers may receive a different rate from that advertised. There is concern that customers do not realise that they may not receive the advertised loan rate when they apply. We want provisions in the Bill to require lenders who advertise typical rates to obtain the explicit agreement of the consumer to the rate that they are actually being offered before proceeding with the application.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Many UK card providers currently allocate payments to outstanding balances at the lowest rate of interest, leaving items such as purchases and cash advances to continue to accrue interest at significantly higher rates. Customers who cannot pay off the full balance on their cards may run up bigger debts than they expected because any money that they pay towards their debt will go towards lower-interest balances. We suggest that the Bill would be an appropriate place to right that wrong.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1051"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1051</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>We join other noble Lords who have said that they feel that the Bill offers an opportunity as yet not taken to take the heat out of the ballooning levels of personal debt by outlawing unsolicited offers of credit cards, unsolicited increases in credit limits and unsolicited credit card convenience cheques. Those mechanisms are often aimed at a poorer, less financially experienced and more vulnerable people and can lead to them unwittingly running up debt that they did not intend to.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>In the area of data sharing, a critical issue, as the Minister mentioned, is that of older, longer-running credit agreements put in place prior to the enactment of the Data Protection Act, which therefore did not include authorisation by the borrower to the lender to share data as required. We look forward to hearing the Government&#039;s explanation of how it is proposed that that problem be resolved. Perhaps the noble Baroness will be able to shed light on the timing of the publication of the results of the work to which the noble Lord referred earlier.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We welcome in principle the application of the financial services ombudsman scheme to the consumer credit regime. That is, however, subject to certain reservations. Those include that the ombudsman scheme must be fully and appropriately resourced to enable it effectively to take on what may be a large number of complaints relating to much smaller transactions than it currently covers. Noble Lords will be well aware of the proposed EU directive on the matter of consumer credit. We ask how the Government plan to deal with conflicts between it and the Bill, such as the fact that the directive is intended to reintroduce a ceiling for borrowing that the Bill will have just removed for personal borrowing; and for their assurance that there will be no gold-plating. We also specifically ask the Government to demonstrate how they have verified that the move under Article 30 of the directive from minimum to maximum harmonisation is not breached by the Bill or the Act.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>It is perhaps disappointing that the Bill does not reform the outdated and inflexible law on hire purchase and, in particular, the half rule. That seems illogical as the 1974 Act, which this Bill specifically sets out to update, encompasses hire purchase. The half rule allows the customer to hand back a vehicle and be liable for only half the amount otherwise payable. Inevitably, there is a stage during each contract when, if the customer were to exercise its right, that would result in a certain loss to the provider of the finance. That will be made worse under the Bill because it abolishes the lending ceiling for personal borrowers. However, the real loser will be the customer, who will find hire purchase facilities more difficult to come by.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>As regards the timetable for implementation, the majority of the detailed provisions of the Bill are to be made by order, or through the OFT by guidance, notice or clarification. That creates uncertainty for lenders who require sufficient notice for implementation given the scale of the changes that will be required to their processes and IT systems. Therefore, we seek the Government&#039;s assurance that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1052"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1052</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

commencement dates will allow for sufficient consultation of the outstanding detail of the Bill and adequate lead time for implementation.
</p>

<a name="51024-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>In conclusion, law of this type is often examined only in terms of its impact on lenders. It is usually assumed that the effect for consumers will be without exception beneficial. That is not necessarily the case. If legitimate lenders find that more and more claims are being made against them, or that the OFT&#039;s new bureaucratic requirements end up costing them far more than the current system, there will be a knock-on adverse effect for consumers. The most likely outcome is that certain groups of consumers&#151;those on the lowest incomes&#151;will find it far harder to get credit and could even end up going to illegal lenders and, in addition, the cost of credit could rise. We look forward to hearing how the Government plan to tackle these complex issues.

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="51024-11_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Clark of Calton: </b>   My Lords, I have listened with great attention to the many expert contributions that have been made in this interesting and constructive debate. The contributions came fast, but not furious, and I shall respond in that spirit. I want to associate myself with the tributes paid to the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, for his most useful analysis and comments in his maiden speech. Noble Lords tell me that my speech has been much anticipated&#151;it may have been much anticipated by Members but it has not been much anticipated by me. I understand now why it has been so anticipated: some Members think it is the Lord Advocate who is to reply and we know from the days when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, was Lord Advocate, that that would indeed be something worth waiting for. Since 1999, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General for Scotland have not been UK law officers, as they have gone to lend their expertise to the Scottish Executive. They are Members of the Scottish Executive and the Lord Advocate was replaced by the Advocate-General for Scotland. So it is as Advocate-General for Scotland that I appear today.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Some 30 years have passed since I first studied the Consumer Credit Act 1974, prior to my Bar examinations in the Faculty of Advocates. To my great relief at the time, I found that I did not have to answer any questions on that legislation. I hope this, my maiden speech, will not turn into a long-postponed oral examination as I attempt to deal with some of the general issues raised by noble Lords arising out of the provisions in this Bill.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>As it is my maiden speech, I hope noble Lords will grant me some indulgence. I am encouraged in that hope by the warmth of the welcome and the generous help that I have received not only from noble Lords but also from so many officials and staff. I am also very grateful for the kind words that have been said about me by so many noble Lords and I hope that my speech does not disappoint their high expectations.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>I have appeared in front of some of my noble and learned Lords on previous occasions, both on the Judicial Committee of this House and the Select <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1053"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1053</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Committee on Privileges, but on these occasions I was clad in wig and gown, which provided some measure of protection and disguise. I did not realise that I would feel so unprotected and exposed as I stand at this Dispatch Box. I think it is not noble Lords&#039; indulgence that I crave, but invisibility and, preferably, escape. Unfortunately, I can find no procedural device in the <i>Companion to the Standing Orders</i> to achieve that, and so, I regret, I must continue.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The office of Advocate General for Scotland, which I established in 1999 and for which I was, until recently, held responsible in the other place, was described by a noble Lord, in the course of the Scotland Act debates as a &quot;bed of nails&quot;. One of my legal colleagues described the office as a &quot;poisoned chalice&quot;. It is true that I have had some sleepless nights and I have certainly avoided drinking from chalices. Overall, the duties and work of the office have been fascinating and intellectually stimulating. I am sure that will continue to be the case in this House.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Turning to the Bill, I can offer some relevant experience. The need for improved consumer protection became obvious during my work, many years ago, as a law lecturer in a Dundee law centre, and more recently, in trying to help my former constituents in Edinburgh Pentlands. I consider it a privilege to be able to assist with this Bill, which covers reserved issues under the Scotland Act. The Bill therefore extends to Scotland and is intended to apply throughout the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The Government are very grateful for the support the Bill has received from all parts of the House today, and that support will make my task easier. I know that the Bill will receive a high level of detailed and expert scrutiny in Committee, but I would like to respond briefly, in this winding-up, to a number of important general issues that have been raised by noble Lords today.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>First, I would like to deal with the unfairness test. This was raised by a number of noble Lords: the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, the Opposition spokesperson; the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney; and the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. We in Government have considered the new unfair relationship test very carefully and have explored its implications. It is important that the test does not constrain or impede the courts&#039; ability to make a fair and unbiased judgement in each case. That is why we have taken the decision not to define an &quot;unfair relationship&quot;. Lenders are already familiar with the concept of fairness. It is a standard used by the Financial Services Authority industry codes and the rules on unfair contract terms.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I am grateful, in particular, for the support of the right reverend Prelate in this matter, and the general support of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on the main points. The test will not exist in a vacuum: it will operate in the context of existing laws and case law. The Government want a test with a lower threshold for challenge, a test which makes it clear that the court can consider all relevant circumstances. The danger in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1054"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1054</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

trying to define, or provide examples of, an unfair relationship is that it risks limiting the scope of the new test. There is also a defect in the current test, which requires the credit bargain to be &quot;extortionate&quot;, as defined, quite specifically, in the 1974 Act. That test is a hurdle which is far too high. Few consumers have commenced actions under the existing test, and even fewer have been successful. The new unfairness test is general, in order that it can catch all unfair relationships. The new test is designed to encourage credit providers to adhere to the spirit of the Act, and not merely comply with technical requirements. This is not a checklist. All lenders should ask whether what they are doing is unfair. If the court finds that there is an unfair relationship, it has the discretion to impose a remedy, for example, altering the terms of the agreement, or setting aside all or part of the agreement. I regret to say that I must disagree with the noble Lord on the Opposition Front Bench about when the agreements should be caught by the new test. Some of the agreements are extremely long&#151;15 or 20 years&#151;and we cannot wait that long to protect consumers.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie made an interesting contribution on human rights. The Government were provided with a copy of the opinion of Mr Beloff QC on the compliance of the unfair relationship provisions with the ECHR. The Government believe that the provisions are compliant with the ECHR, and the Minister has made a statement to that effect. I am pleased that the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which reported today, appears to support the Government&#039;s position. According to its report, the committee also considered the legal opinion of Michael Beloff QC and Andrew Hunter before reaching its view. It concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;In our view, therefore, although further guidance as to the meaning of &#039;unfair&#039; in this context might be desirable, the absence of such guidance does not render the unfair credit relationship provisions in the Bill incompatible with Article 1 Protocol 1 ECHR&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>It is plain from the debate that all Members of the House share the concern about vulnerable consumers. We may have different ways of dealing with it, but it is a big concern. The Government are certainly concerned about it. Obviously, the vulnerability can arise in many different ways. We have heard examples today. Those most at risk may suffer particularly from inadequate information, leading to inappropriate financial decisions. They may also be more at risk of exclusion from services. The Government have taken many initiatives, apart from the Bill, that will help to support vulnerable people&#151;for example, the over-indebtedness action plan. Various statutory instruments were made in summer 2004 to increase the transparency of credit agreements and help consumers to make better financial decisions. Several noble Lords commented on that. The Bill will add to those initiatives and provide much greater protection for consumers. It will be of particular help to the most vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The Government are also grateful for support in the debate on interest rate ceilings. I think that the right reverend Prelate raised that matter, and the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, I think, gave <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1055"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1055</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

support for which we are grateful. The Government are following the general trend of the debate and are of the view that the research indicates that it is not appropriate to introduce an interest rate ceiling in the UK. Noble Lords may be aware that detailed research into such matters has been carried out by Policis, including comparative work in other countries.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The Government are not convinced that introducing interest rate ceilings will help the consumers that they are supposed to protect. For example, Policis found that, where there are interest rate ceilings, lenders either do not provide small loans repayable over a short period or they offer products that have extra charges not included in the interest rate calculation. As a result, interest rate ceilings could exclude some vulnerable low-income consumers from the market, forcing them to use inappropriate products, take out larger loans than they need or even go outside the regulated market.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>There is an issue about the burden on business. There must be a balance between protecting consumers and putting extra work on businesses. However, the Government have worked hard to ensure that the Bill balances those interests. Those interests are not always in competition; it is also in the interests of business to have fair competition. As a Government, we have consulted all interested parties extensively, including representatives of those active in the consumer credit business. We have endeavoured to balance the requirements of consumer protection with the need for business flexibility.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>On post-contract information, we have tried to ensure that the required information is necessary and can be combined with other information where appropriate. We are setting a minimum standard for information provision, and business is free to do that in the most cost-effective way. Many credit providers already provide such information to their customers.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>We are also endeavouring to deal with the issue of irresponsible lending and we are doing so in a number of ways. One way is the introduction of the new fitness test. This will help the OFT to identify and clamp down on irresponsible lenders. It will be able to look at any evidence of irresponsible lending when assessing a lender&#039;s fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. In order to ensure that this is clear to businesses, the OFT will issue guidance on the kind of issues that it will look at when considering fitness.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>It is perhaps worth remembering that the OFT was established as an independent body by an Act of Parliament and its powers were largely defined by the Enterprise Act 2002. The OFT is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and judicial review in the normal way. The Bill as drafted reflects an extensive period of consultation with both consumers and industry about the powers to be granted to the OFT to ensure that they are appropriate and proportionate.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>We have balanced these additional powers with important safeguards to ensure that the OFT exercises its powers reasonably. For example, it will have to give reasons for requesting information; give reasons and notice before accessing premises; warrants may be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1056"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1056</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

obtained only from magistrates; and the court process contains built-in safeguards against abuse. In addition the OFT must issue guidance and it must consult. We have built in many safeguards.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>A number of separate issues have been raised. I shall not be able to deal with all of them in detail but I hope to deal with the majority. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, asked for an explanation about Part 8 of the Enterprise Act. I share some of his difficulties. Paragraph 51 of the Explanatory Notes gives some explanation but, in general terms, under the powers of Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, the OFT will be able to take enforcement action, including taking lenders to court, where unfair relationships affect consumers generally. This could be, for example, where a lender uses standard terms or operates in a common manner in respect of borrowers generally so as to make each relationship unfair. The OFT will be required to issue guidance, following consultation, on how it expects to use its powers.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the question of secondary legislation. I understand that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has considered the Bill and published a report on 13 October this year. The committee has agreed with the Government&#039;s proposals for consideration of secondary legislation by Parliament in all but one respect in relation to consequential amendments. We are considering the committee&#039;s suggestion in that regard.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, raised some very interesting issues. He asked about plastic card fraud, which is a very complicated subject. In general terms, the Government work closely with the finance and retail sectors as well as with the police to combat fraud and take an active role in improving public awareness. From April 2004, the Home Office, with the Corporation of London, has provided significant additional funds to enable the City of London Police to expand its fraud squad. The Home Office has also set up the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit, which works closely with the banking industry to help prevent organised card fraud. There are also other similar initiatives.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>As to the unsolicited provision of credit cards, limit increases and credit card cheques, the answer to some of these issues is that the Bill is very much concerned with transparency. We do not want to prevent business from marketing its products but we want it to do so responsibly. We want consumers to have clear information about what the credit deal entails. The Government have introduced regulations which impose new standards of transparency in advertising, pre-contract disclosure and agreements. Credit card limits are currently covered by the banking code, which was revised in March this year. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State committed to keeping the effectiveness of the code.

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>A question was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Freeman, about the Hampton report. The Government have accepted Hampton&#039;s recommendation to create a Consumer and Trading <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1057</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Standards Agency. We are considering how to implement this recommendation in consultation with business and other stakeholders. A consultation period on the roles and functions of the Consumer and Trading Standards Agency opened in July and closed on 12 October. Stakeholders and other interested parties will now be considering these matters.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Members will know that the EU Consumer Credit Directive has had a long and difficult passage. Substantial negotiations are to take place, and it is not at all certain what a final proposal may look like. The provisions in the Bill are important responses to the problem that we encounter in the UK. We cannot afford to wait for a directive that may not be agreed for many years, and we do not know what form it will take, but we are certainly considering the latest draft of the directive.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The consumer credit market has changed a great deal during the past 30 years. Far more consumers are using credit and far more businesses are providing it, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1058"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 1058</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but the legislation designed to support this important sector and protect its consumers has not been adapted accordingly. Parts of the 1974 Act are no longer appropriate to the current environment and the potential dangers of credit for consumers have become more acute. Reform is long overdue: I think we agree about that. The Government have made significant progress in this area, but there is still more to do. The Bill will take further, important steps towards a fair, clear and competitive consumer credit market for the 21st century. It will give regulators the powers they need to monitor the licensing of consumer credit businesses more effectively and proportionately; it will give consumers the protections they need by providing them with rights to comprehensive and effective means of redress; and it will give consumer credit businesses the confidence they need to operate fairly in a competitive market.
</p>

<a name="51024-11_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Grand Committee.

Before the Minister moves that the first order be considered, it may be helpful to say a word about the procedures for today&#039;s Grand Committee. Our proceedings are essentially the same as those of the House. Noble Lords will speak standing. All noble Lords are free to attend and participate, and the proceedings will be reported in <i>Hansard</i>. As there is more than one item of business today, each item will be called on by the Clerk. In the case of each order, the Motion before the Committee will be that the Committee does report that it has considered the order in question. I should perhaps make it clear to noble Lords that this Committee is charged only to consider affirmative orders, not to approve or not approve them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.

<a name="51024-12_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) Order 2005</h3>



<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51024-12_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker) </b>  rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) Order 2005 [<i>4th Report from the Joint Committee and 9th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>The noble Lord said: The order was laid before the House on 14 September. The order was made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State on 13 September under the urgency procedure provided by Section 19(3) of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. It came into effect at midnight at the beginning of 14 September.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The order specified the Ulster Volunteer Force, generally referred to as the UVF, and the Red Hand Commando. The latter organisation is associated with the UVF and has been used as a &quot;flag of convenience&quot; for UVF activity. The Secretary of State specified those organisations using the powers conferred on him by the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The Act makes provision for the specification of an organisation that is concerned in terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland or in promoting or encouraging it, and has not established or is not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire. In applying his judgment to that test, the Secretary of State is obliged, in particular, to take into account whether an organisation is committed to the use now and in the future of only democratic and peaceful means to achieve its objectives; has ceased to be involved in any acts of violence or preparation for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC234"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

violence; is directing or promoting acts of violence by other organisations; and is co-operating fully with the decommissioning commission.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>In addition to the UVF and the Red Hand Commando, the following organisations continue to be specified, which is why they are listed on the draft statutory instrument as a consolidation exercise. They are the Continuity Irish Republican Army, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, the Orange Volunteers, the Real Irish Republican Army and the Red Hand Defenders. A statutory duty is placed on the Secretary of State to review this list from time to time in case changes of circumstances require it to be amended. To that end, the Secretary of State keeps the status of all specified organisations and those purporting to be on a ceasefire under continuous review and takes advice from the Chief Constable and his other security advisers as to the robustness of all ceasefires.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Under the general requirements of the Act, an order to specify an organisation shall be made by statutory instrument which has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House, unless the Secretary of State thinks it necessary, for reasons of urgency, to proceed without a draft having been so approved. For reasons which I hope will become self-evident, it was necessary for the Secretary of State to proceed with specification of the UVF and the RHC with immediate effect on 13 September.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>In June, the UVF recommenced its long-standing feud with the Loyalist Volunteer Force, a terrorist organisation which is already specified. Over the succeeding weeks, the UVF carried out four murders, numerous attempted murders and various violent attacks which were all directed towards the Loyalist Volunteer Force, their families and associates. While some attacks were also perpetrated by the LVF, the overwhelming violence emanated from the UVF. The detail of the feud and its genesis is provided in the IMC report laid before the House on 22 September.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Despite various assurances through third party interlocutors that the UVF would desist, feuding continued up to and including 9 September. On 10 September a major Orange Order parade, known as the Whiterock parade, took place. It was contentious, and the Parades Commission made a determination that placed a route restriction on the parade. As a consequence, those taking part initiated a protest at the contentious parts of the parade route. Subsequently, there was an outbreak of violence initially between some of the marchers, their supporters, and the police. Violence quickly escalated and spread to other parts of Belfast and beyond. However, the most serious and sustained violence occurred in the general vicinity of the West Circular Road part of the parade route.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Almost all the violence was directed towards the police and their military colleagues who were there in support. It was violence of the most vicious kind, intended to maim and kill. Petrol bombs, blast bombs, pipe bombs and other missiles were unleashed, much of it from rooftops raining down on the security forces below. Such was the ferocity of the attack, it was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC235"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC235</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

simply not possible accurately to record the volume of missiles thrown. One of the most discouraging and disconcerting of all things among that mayhem was the use of live fire. Some 115 rounds were discharged at both the police and the Army by the so-called loyalists; those loyal to the police and the Crown.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>A detailed assessment of the violence has been made by the Chief Constable and the security service. Advice to the Secretary of State confirmed the involvement of the UVF in the instigation of the violence. It was not a spontaneous event perpetrated in the heat of the moment. It clearly required preparation, co-ordination and stockpiling of missiles, the deployment of guns and, crucially, the authorisation to ferment and actively participate in the violence.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The violence on 10 September continued for fully 12 hours, from 3 pm to 3 am the following morning, and it was repeated on 11 September and 12 September, though to a lesser effect. The fact that no police officer or soldier was killed was indeed fortunate and was in no small measure due to their training, the tactical deployment and the quality of their public order equipment. The Chief Constable rightly made the point that no police force in western Europe or indeed the United States has had to face such a sustained and brutal assault. The involvement of the UVF in the violence and its previous actions against the LVF are incompatible with any claims to be on ceasefire and cannot be tolerated by any civilised society. Therefore my right honourable friend took the action that he took, for which he is now seeking parliamentary approval. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) Order 2005 [<i>4th Report from the Joint Committee and 9th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].&#151;(<i>Lord Rooker</i>.)
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51024-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the Minister for bringing the order before the Committee this afternoon. I have no wish to detain the Committee unnecessarily. Needless to say, the Opposition supports the order specifying the Ulster Volunteer Force. I have some comments and questions for the Minister. The Independent Monitoring Commission concluded in paragraph 3.30 of its seventh report, published last week:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;We conclude that the UVF is, in the words of our Fifth Report, &#039;active, violent and ruthless&#039; and we believe it will continue to use violence where it thinks that would be in its interests. It remains an extremely dangerous organisation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The IMC&#039;s sixth report, on the UVF/LVF feud, catalogued the number of incidents in which the UVF, is involved, as the Minister outlined. In our view, the scale of these activities is more than sufficient for the Secretary of State to use his powers under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 to specify that organisation. It is a far cry from the commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means set out both in the Act and the Belfast agreement. During the summer we saw the sickening spectacle of loyalists attacking the police and the security forces. We utterly condemn such behaviour.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC236"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC236</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>As my honourable friend the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary said at the Conservative Party conference earlier this month:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;Whatever sense of disillusion loyalist communities might feel today, none of that can ever justify sectarian attacks on Catholics, nor the sickening spectacle we saw last month of men bragging about their loyalty to the United Kingdom and then hurling rocks at United Kingdom police officers. There is no place in a modem, democratic Northern Ireland for paramilitaries, whether republican or loyalist&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I am sure that all Members of the Committee will endorse that stance, and I hope that the call by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party at the weekend for loyalist paramilitaries to:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Engage with the Decommissioning Commission . . . place your arms beyond use . . . and commit yourselves to exclusively peaceful and democratic means&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>will be heeded.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The debate takes place against a background of increasing controversy over plans for further reforms of policing in Northern Ireland and possible plans for further government support for so-called community restorative justice projects. There is a good deal of fear within Northern Ireland that their effect will be to hand over the effective policing of loyalist and republican areas to paramilitaries or those associated with them. That would be completely unacceptable to us and, I hope, to noble Lords throughout this House.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>On Friday, the chairman of the Policing Board in Northern Ireland, Professor Sir Desmond Rea, wrote to the Secretary of State voicing the unanimous concerns of the board&#151;including and especially those of nationalist members&#151;over the Government&#039;s plans. He demanded an urgent meeting with the Secretary of State, warning of an,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;imminent danger across Northern Ireland of seeing a two-tier system of policing introduced by the back door, with self-appointed groups taking on quasi-policing roles&#151;including stopping and searching people in the street&#151;squeezing out PSNI, and being paid out of public funds&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>and stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;There is no way that we can stand idly by and allow this to happen&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>We agree with the board that legitimate restorative justice schemes can play a useful role within the overall criminal justice system. We did not oppose the schemes established under the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, because they were just that&#151;a full and integral part of the criminal justice administered by the state. In particular, it was made very specific in Part 4 of that Act, dealing with youth justice, that the youth conferencing element of the restorative justice&#151;in many ways its key aspect&#151;had to have the active presence and participation of a police officer. For the sake of clarity, I should say that that is in Section 57.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Will the Minister therefore give us assurances that: first, any future community restorative justice schemes sanctioned by the Northern Ireland Office will not simply work alongside the criminal justice system but remain fully integrated within it; secondly, nobody with any history of involvement in paramilitary activity will be permitted to participate in the youth conference element of community restorative justice systems; and thirdly, all youth conferences will <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC237</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continue to be attended by a real, full-time and fully trained member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, not by any police community support officers that might be introduced in the future, or by members of an extended part-time reserve?
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Any departure from the existing provisions of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act will inevitably fuel further suspicions that the Government are prepared to weaken the safeguards currently in place, and to introduce precisely the situation about which the chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board warns. I hope therefore that the Minister will be able to answer those questions clearly and unequivocally. They are matters of the greatest importance and the subject of concern across Northern Ireland today. My party will fight tooth and nail against any proposal that sees restorative justice contracted out of the criminal justice system or administered by groups that are effectively fronts for paramilitaries.
</p>

<a name="51024-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I shall return to the order. It is a regrettable necessity and, toothless as it is, it will have our support.

<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51024-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the order. At the time that the decision was taken to specify the UVF, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcomed the move by the Secretary of State. However, we were concerned, and still are concerned, about why it took the Secretary of State so long to make this move. The UVF has, among other things, been linked to four recent murders, including that of a completely innocent, law-abiding young man, Craig McCausland, whose family understandably look to Her Majesty&#039;s Government for justice.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>We have also been concerned for some time at the state of the so-called &quot;ceasefire&quot; by this organisation. The IMC&#039;s report of 24 May drew attention to various shootings and assaults that have been attributed to the organisation, and it was further blamed for violence and exilings at the beginning of the summer. So I again ask the question: why did it take the Government so long to take the decision to specify the UVF? When the Secretary of State&#039;s decision was announced, NIO statements mentioned the deaths in the loyalist feud and the Whiterock parade rioting and attacks upon the police, as the Minister outlined. However, it is far from clear what was the threshold of violence that tipped the Government over the edge. Did the Secretary of State act only on the basis of the violence surrounding the parade? Why did he not act on the basis of the four murders over the summer attributed to the UVF? We have asked the Government before what constitutes a ceasefire. There does not seem to be a standard by which the public can clearly judge when a ceasefire has been broken. It is unclear whether the Secretary of State takes criminal activity or internal community exilings and intimidations into account when reviewing the state of the ceasefires. Do breaches of ceasefires occur only on the basis of attacks on the security forces, or do they now consider murders of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC238"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people from the perceived &quot;same side&quot; of the community to be breaches too? These are issues which matter a great deal to the people of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration called for an immediate, full and permanent cessation of all paramilitary activity. It is incomprehensible that a ceasefire should be regarded as anything less than full compliance with paragraph 13.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>May I also suggest that the Government are making a mockery of specification when Ministers refused to take action to end Assembly allowances to the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), as recommended by the IMC&#039;s April 2005 report? It is quite clear that the PUP is not breaking its links to the UVF. It seems to us that Her Majesty&#039;s Government are sending out a very mixed message when they stop some but not other allowances&#151;an argument used on many occasions by my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Finally, I understand that the Ulster Defence Association is not currently specified, yet the seventh IMC report published last week states quite categorically on page 18 at paragraph 3.24 that the UDA has remained active in organised crime and acts of violence. Indeed, footnote 9 on that page states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;The murder of Jim Gray by the UDA on 4 October 2005 occurred outside the period under review in this report&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>However, it clearly states that the UDA has murdered. There it is in black and white in the seventh report of the Independent Monitoring Commission.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Having said all that, we support this order. We simply ask the questions that I hope the Minister is able to answer.


</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51024-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am most grateful for the comments of both noble Lords in support of the order. Other issues have also been raised. If the issue was as black and white as being able to list a specific incident or what incidents might trigger certain things, then we would be in a different ball game. The matter has to be looked at in the round.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Perhaps I may deal first with the words of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I fully accept the issues he raised regarding the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, but they are somewhat outside this. I am very grateful because he gave me notice of some of the issues he intended to raise. However, as I was not specifically briefed on that issue, I shall write to him.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>On the general issue of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the courts, they will be fully involved in the systems concerning the justice Act and restorative justice. Although I do not have a copy with me, I recall confirming that when I repeated the Statement of the Secretary of State in the House a week ago last Thursday. That made it quite clear that the Police Service of Northern Ireland would be involved; in fact it would be the trigger for things to go through the system. But I will write to the noble Lord on the specific issues he has raised.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Regarding the questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, the definition of &quot;ceasefire&quot; is set out in legislation, although I suspect <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

she might not think that it is specific enough. It is set out in Section 3(9) of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State shall in particular take into account whether an organisation&#151;(a) is committed to the use now and in the future of only democratic and peaceful means to achieve its objectives; (b) has ceased to be involved in any acts of violence or preparation for violence; (c) is directing or promoting acts of violence by other organisations; (d) is co-operating fully with the Commission&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Of course the Secretary of State will take advice on these matters and reach a judgment in the round. What I cannot say is that if, for example, there had not been the four murders but there had been Whiterock, or if there had been the four murders and no Whiterock, we would be doing this today. That is not possible. We have to judge what happened. What happened? What happened was the feud, the four murders and the outrageous behaviour at the Whiterock parade. That was a parade which had been delayed from earlier in the year. Taking all those factors into account the Secretary of State came to the view on 13 September that specification should take place. I cannot be more specific. That is how the system works. One cannot say that it is because of the four murders or because of Whiterock&#151;that if one had not happened, this would not have happened. The fact is that we have to look at what happened. The events happened at a period of time and the decision was taken in the round.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>As regards the UDA, it is quite clear that it has been involved in recent violence, including some associated with the Whiterock parade. The Secretary of State, again judging the case in the round, concluded that there are insufficient grounds to specify at the present time. That applies for today. That is the current decision of the Secretary of State. But those circumstances and all the other factors are literally kept &quot;under constant review&quot;. That is not a glib phrase that Ministers use from time to time as an excuse to say, &quot;Well, we don&#039;t really know what we are doing&quot;. These issues are kept under review to see whether action can be taken and whether that action will bring about some positive changes.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The leadership of the UVF must think through what &quot;specification&quot; means. It may be classed as being not very effective, but things can follow for members of a specified organisation, particularly those who have been let out of prison. That is not to say that we are going to round them all up and put them back in. The fact is that their status is different if their organisation is specified and if they are out on licence from what it would be if it were not specified. The leadership of that organisation has to take that fact into account.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>On the PUP, we would argue that there is no inconsistency. I accept that it is very easy to say that. Having had all the issues set out for public consumption, the Secretary of State has had different decisions to make and has reached a conclusion. The Secretary of State has considered what the IMC had to say about the PUP&#151;that is the party linked to the UVF. He made it clear in the Statement of 13 October that he does not intend to impose a penalty now, but that he is keeping it under review over the coming <br>&nbsp;<br>

months and will want to see what is said in the IMC&#039;s January report. The reports in January will be crucial, for lots of reasons. They will be a very important milestone. The October reports, for various reasons, only cover a certain few weeks after other events that I do not want to go into.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The PUP has taken steps in the right direction. We want to encourage, not discourage, further progress to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. As a Member of this place, let alone a former MP, it sticks in the craw, on the surface, that we are paying the MLAs&#151;they still receive three quarters of their allowance. It does not look logical but there is a reason for it. They are suspended; we want them back working. We want that Assembly up and running as quickly as possible. I realise that it is three years since it was suspended but, because of other decisions taken, we are probably on the verge of some momentous changes.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>It is in everybody&#039;s interests that a political class is kept in being, so that there is no excuse, when the time comes, for those people who have been childish in one respect, because they did not want to participate in grown-up politics&#151;that is what it is all about&#151;to say that others should take the difficult decisions. We want them to take the decisions for the people of Northern Ireland and not to pass the buck anymore on to direct-rule Ministers. It would not be satisfactory, therefore, to go through negotiations, put through various legislative changes and then perhaps to have to start with a clean sheet of paper to set up an Assembly, with the personalities and everything else involved.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>In the round, it suits Westminster, which wants the devolved Assembly up and running, to maintain the genesis of the Assembly so that it can be switched on quite quickly. It is true that people may want a fresh mandate, but that is for discussion. I cannot speak for all MLAs, as I have neither met nor received letters from all of them, but many carry out a representative role for their constituents. Although they cannot make legislation and speak in an Assembly about it, as we all know, there are many other ways of representing one&#039;s constituents.
</p>

<a name="51024-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>That said, I am very grateful for the contributions and I will write to follow up the points that I have not been able to answer.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="51024-14_time0"></a><h5>3.58 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51024-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Civil Partnership (Miscellaneous and Consequential Provisions) Order 2005 [<i>5th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>The noble Lord said: The order was laid before the House on 12 October. I shall speak also to the Social Security (Inherited SERPS) (Amendments relating to Civil Partnership) Regulations 2005.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC241"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>In my view, these Statutory Instruments are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Members of the Committee are aware that the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which we debated last year, provides for same-sex couples to gain legal recognition of their relationship by forming a civil partnership.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The Committee will recall that on 7 July this year, we debated orders that amended legislation relating to pensions and benefits to make provision for civil partners. I regret that I have to take up noble Lords&#039; time on these orders. They contain technical changes for which we realised the need only after those earlier orders had been laid before Parliament. I have great sympathy with the officials. They trawled through nine Acts and more than 70 sets of regulations of social    security legislation alone, searching for provisions that had to be modified to take account of civil partnerships. Many references to marriage, widowhood and so on had to be extended. It is perhaps forgivable that a few were missed the first time. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who is shaking her head, agrees with me. She raised that point in July. I hope that my sympathy for the officials is shared.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I believe that we have made the changes we require to ensure that civil partners and their survivors receive the pensions and benefits to which they are becoming entitled. I am not brave enough to say that I am certain we have found absolutely every tiny change, but I hope that we have. I am sure that that view is shared.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The statutory instruments before the Committee today deal with the remaining amendments needed to primary DWP legislation to ensure that same-sex couples are offered the same rights and responsibilities as opposite-sex couples. I believe there are a further five to come from other government departments.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I turn first to the Civil Partnership (Miscellaneous and Consequential Provisions) Order 2005. This order amends primary legislation to ensure that surviving civil partners are given the same rights as surviving widowers to inherit graduated retirement benefit. This order provides specifically for the rights they will have before 2010 when widowers&#039; rights are made equal with those of widows. It also provides that surviving civil partners are afforded the same rights as surviving spouses for the purposes of establishing certain protected rights over and above the guaranteed minimum pension.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Furthermore, the order also ensures that the financial settlement rules surrounding earmarking and attachment orders apply to former civil partners in the same way as they do to former spouses. The order also makes an amendment to a Department of Health provision to take account of civil partners in the statutory scheme for the protection of vulnerable adults.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Lastly, the order amends excepted matters in Northern Ireland legislation to provide rights for civil partners in respect of occupational and personal pensions.

</p>

<a name="51024-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I turn now the Social Security (Inherited SERPS) (Amendments relating to Civil Partnership) Regulations 2005. Members of the Committee will recall that on 28 February this year, we debated at length the subject of inherited SERPS and the new arrangements which give people who defer taking their state pension the choice between a lump sum and extra pension. These regulations do no more than extend the new arrangements to civil partners by allowing any inheritable SERPS to be calculated in the same way as is currently provided for spouses. Where existing provisions treat widows and widowers differently, civil partners are treated in the same way as widowers.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>These extended rules also allow any inheritable increments or lump sum derived from the deceased civil partner&#039;s deferred SERPS pension to be calculated in the same way for a surviving civil partner as for a widower. The regulations put bereaved civil partners on an equal footing with bereaved spouses in relation to inheritance of SERPS. To ensure that direct discrimination is avoided, civil partners will have those rights that are currently available to widows and widowers from the implementation date and, where there is a difference in treatment, civil partners will have the same rights as married men and widowers.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>In summary, these statutory instruments deal with the remaining necessary amendments to DWP legislation to ensure that civil partners are afforded the same treatment as married couples. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Civil Partnership (Miscellaneous and Consequential Provisions) Order 2005 [<i>5th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#151;(<i>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</i>.)
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51024-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   We supported the Civil Partnership Act and therefore we support any orders designed to complete the implementation process. However, I want to raise a couple of points.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The Minister pre-empted one of my questions, but I want to explore it a little further. We dealt with orders in July and we have more now. Some were affirmative and some were negative orders. The question is: when will it all end? The Minister said that he was not certain, but although five more departments are producing orders, today&#039;s orders complete the task of the DWP.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>How do the four negative resolution orders which appeared on the Order Paper last Thursday relate to what the Minister has said today? Was he confining his remarks only to affirmative orders, or are there many negative orders to come forward? That is important, because we need to give certainty to the body of law which deals with civil partnership.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I have sympathy with officials who are coping with the Government&#039;s legislative programme, which is large and often rushed, and overlaying the complex civil partnership legislation on to already complex social security and pensions legislation. We shall have the opportunity to return to the latter, of course, when Adair Turner produces his report in a little over a month&#039;s time.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC243"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>We now have a second round of orders, the Government having recognised that they did not get the implementation right in the first round. What process have they undertaken to ensure that all the necessary areas have been covered for the complete implementation of civil partnership? That is particularly important because in today&#039;s mail I received an invitation from Stonewall to celebrate the implementation of the Civil Partnership Act. I would very much like to attend, but in the full and certain knowledge that we have a complete body of law to implement it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51024-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I, too, have a great deal of sympathy with the civil servants in the Department for Work and Pensions. For some years, I was my party&#039;s spokesman in your Lordships&#039; House on pensions. I became all too aware of the immense and ever-increasing complexity of legislation on pensions and I am not surprised that some of the regulations which needed to be changed escaped the attention of the Civil Service. During that time, I became familiar with some of the concepts involved here, such as inherited SERPS, but reference to &quot;contributions equivalence premium&quot; is a new one even for me.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>We strongly supported the Government on the principle of the Civil Partnership Bill, in particular the aim that in financial rights there should be complete equivalence between partners in a civil partnership and married couples. It is clear that these orders work towards that end and that in one respect&#151;that of caring rights&#151;they go somewhat beyond. We are therefore entirely in favour in principle of what lies behind these orders. We are satisfied that they are necessary to achieve the objectives and are happy to support them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51024-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for welcoming the orders. The noble Baroness asked two questions. First, she asked where it will all end. I am equally interested in the answer. However, there will be a considerable number of negative orders, which we have always made clear. They will relate to details of legislation, court rules, public service pensions and contracted-out pension schemes. There are likely to be some 20 negative orders.
</p>

<a name="51024-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Furthermore, five affirmative orders are to be debated at a future date in the House to complete the process. They are amendments to the judicial and Church pension schemes; amendments to the parliamentary pension scheme; an order under Section 219 of the Civil Partnership Act to make provisions in relation to the jurisdiction of UK courts in relation to dissolutions; an order under Section 259 of the Act amending the Family Law Act 1986; and an order under Section 259 of the Act amending the International Organisation Act 1968. There are also two sets of regulations amending tax law, which will debated only in the House of Commons.

</p>

<a name="51024-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Secondly, the noble Baroness asked whether we are sure that we have made all the necessary changes. This is a complicated issue, but the noble Baroness is right that we must have legislation without loose ends. Lawyers and officials have trawled through hundreds of pieces of legislation and firmly believe that they have covered all but the most obscure provisions. We need not worry about those. I therefore say on behalf of government departments that we strongly believe that we have covered the ground and identified all the changes that need to be made by orders.

<a name="51024-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Will the Minister write to me setting out areas where the additional negative orders will apply? He outlined them in general detail and read into the record the five affirmative orders. It would be helpful to have notification of that.

<a name="51024-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Chesterton </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Contingency Planning) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2042) [<i>8th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>The noble Lord said: Some Members of the Committee will recall that when the Civil Contingencies Bill was considered in the House there was a good deal of discussion on how the different organisations would be consulted. They focused not only on consultation in the event of emergency, as mentioned in the description of the Bill, but also on consultation before and after an emergency.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>It is perhaps opportune and sobering that we are considering the implementation of the Act in a year in which there have been many applicable events. We had the Boscastle flood in September 2004 and the events in London in July this year. There have been similar <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC245"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

events in other parts of the world, including the floods in New Orleans, the earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami. In all those events, there was great loss of life and economic activity and many personal tragedies. There is a good case to be made that many examples of local, expert knowledge were not used. In Pakistan, for instance, the young boys who survived were those who hid under their desks. In some countries, that is a common emergency training activity. In the west of England, some people batten down their tiles so that they are never lost in high winds, while other people do not do that. There are many examples of ways in which much more could be done.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The important question is whether the organisations that will participate in working with local authorities and emergency services are being empowered and consulted. We discussed that privately and on the Floor of the House. I hope that the Minister will provide some answers. In private discussions with my noble friend Lord Bassam, I suggested that a significant public conference should be held after the passage of the Bill to review how the Act is being implemented and for the many contributing organisations of the UK to discuss how best they could contribute. One can understand that there were differences of opinion among local authorities and emergency organisations about being bogged down by an excessive bureaucratic process of having to consult everyone, but there is a difference between that and, as it were, non-consultation. That is most important. In particular, consultation, information and providing people with advice and training before emergencies are very important. I think that still in our schools we do not have the training for children that there is in many countries with the same level of susceptibility to emergencies.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Finally, this is the half-year in which the UK holds the presidency of Europe. A conference will be held at the Thames Barrier, London, on 15 and 16 December, involving the Civil Contingencies Secretariat and the Environment Agency. When the Government make their statement at that conference, it would be very good if they would emphasise how we are proceeding in terms of consultation in this sphere. Perhaps that could be discussed across Europe, so that best practice is implemented. I beg to move.

In the National Assembly for Wales debate in June, Brynle Williams raised our concerns about the need for tighter security. He said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;we are living in dangerous times. So far, we have been lucky, mainly due to the efforts of our security forces. It is amazing that we had to wait for over two years following the devastating events of 11 September for a Civil Contingencies Bill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51024-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The Conservative Party, being a constructive opposition, has supported most of the measures in the Bill, but remains concerned about the operation of emergency powers. The stark fact is that Britain is woefully unprepared for a terrorist attack. We as a nation need to see a dedicated Minister for homeland security, so that preparations for a potential disaster are realistically exercised. I can assure the Government that we shall be united on that front if it moves in that way.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Here we are, June has gone, and we are almost in November&#151;again, woefully unprepared. This time, there is a potential bird flu epidemic. The dead parrot sketch has a more deadly ring than was ever suggested when it was first broadcast. A recent survey has shown that nine out of 10 poultry farmers have not been contacted by the Government offering advice and guidance on how to prepare for a bird flu epidemic and what steps to take to prevent it. The Government are failing hopelessly to prepare for a possible epidemic. My colleague in another place, Oliver Letwin, described the recent survey as &quot;deeply disheartening&quot;. Government Ministers and officials are not doing enough to stop a preventable crisis. We need greater co-ordination and political will to ensure proper emergency planning. The only way to do that is for the Government to appoint a single Minister in charge of civil contingencies.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>We on these Benches will not oppose the regulations, but we urge the Minister to encourage his Government to rethink how emergencies are planned for and to ask again if they will consider appointing a homeland security Minister, once and for all, for the protection and safety of our country and its people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51024-15_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, for moving this consideration of the contingency planning regulations. I have to admit that I was fairly disappointed when I read them. Perhaps that is just because I have not read enough regulations in my short time in your Lordships&#039; House. Of course, it is impossible to make regulations for every possible contingency for different local situations and the changing nature of the contingencies to be considered. But as you read the regulations in parts they are somewhat vague. I looked on them as a checklist for any emergency planner in any category 1 or category 2 responders organisation and for those who are involved in emergency planning.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Let me give an example of the vagueness. As a category 2 responder considering whether you should attend a meeting, the regulations state that you must attend that meeting but only if it is reasonably practical. Either it is important that category 2 responders attend if they are invited, or we just say that they should attend if it is convenient. There are other ambiguities. For example, the section that refers to informing the public is counteracted by the section that says not to alarm the public, but there is no guidance on how to balance those two things.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>There is also the question that was addressed at some length when considering the Bill; namely, the vexed issue of the role of voluntary organisations. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC247"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

There is a very welcome section on how voluntary organisations, when relevant, should be engaged, but there is also a series of factors that are a way of checking-off and finding a reason not to engage voluntary organisations. Again, order and counter-order seems to be the way that it goes.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>As time goes on, we are ever more conscious of the possibility of major disasters; we have seen so many this year already. We need clear lines of leadership. I have some sympathy with the noble Baroness&#039;s views on leadership. One can debate the mechanism. The regulations address leadership quite well when we look at London, which is very much in the focus of the regulations. But for the rest of the country there is a series of ways of appointing leaders, without giving alternatives if those people are not available on the day.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>During the discussions of the Bill, I continually raised what seemed to me to be extraordinary; namely, that our major resource for civil contingencies&#151;the Ministry of Defence&#151;was not tasked at all. I notice that it is excluded even in the interpretation of intelligence services where all of our intelligence services are listed with the exception of the Defence Intelligence Service, which would be able to give advice in certain areas of terrorist attacks and would have various assets available.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The wider question is how these regulations engage the defence assets that we have, whether we are talking about the poor response in Louisiana&#151;the lack of helicopters going there quickly&#151;or Pakistan. The defence assets are important. We need to get them engaged at an early stage in our contingency planning.
</p>

<a name="51024-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a> Overall, as a checklist, this is a useful document, if somewhat ambiguous in places. There is a lack of evaluation requirements, which are important. There is no mention of the frequency or scale of the sort of various training exercises that are required. There are also uncertainties about the regions beyond London. We need to do more. I notice that in, I think, today&#039;s <i>Guardian</i>, another leaked government document says that there was some worry internally in Downing Street about civil contingencies as they affect terrorism turning into talking shops rather than delivering action. In this document we have a recipe for a number of talking-shops. They are important, but we must ensure that somewhere we have contingency plans that give confidence that we will get delivery. I welcome the chance to look at the regulations, but this is not the answer to disasters in the future. It can be an aid to it, so we will support it.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and supporting regulations and guidance establish a robust single framework for civil protection capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. It will further enhance the resilience of the United Kingdom by setting out a clear set of responsibilities for those organisations with a role in preparing for, and responding to, emergencies at a local level, delivering greater structure and consistency in local civil protection activity and establishing the basis for robust performance management of local responders&#039; civil protection work. While the broad shape of the duties is set out in the Act, the regulations clarify the scope of the duties and prescribe the manner in which they are to be performed.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The regulations are complemented by the statutory guidance, <i>Emergency Preparedness</i>, a copy of which I have before me. It is important that noble Lords recall the need to read it in conjunction with the regulations. It provides what I think is required: effective good practice guidance to support local responders in complying.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The regulations have not just been dreamt up in Whitehall. The Government have worked closely with Parliament and a wide range of stakeholders over the past 18 months to ensure that the package is fit for purpose. In particular, the Government published an indicative set of draft regulations on introduction of the Bill in January 2004 to facilitate parliamentary scrutiny. We also established a series of stakeholder working groups during the passage of the Bill, as noble Lords will recall, to advise the Cabinet Office on the development of the draft regulations and the accompanying statutory guidance; consulted publicly on the draft package of regulations and guidance, engaging directly the expertise of practitioners in a series of roadshows in each of the English regions and Wales; and kept responders informed of progress throughout the process by issuing regular bulletins and maintaining close dialogue on implementation issues.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>That open and consultative approach has without doubt been fruitful. In particular, it has meant that we have delivered a better package of regulations and guidance, which reflects the needs, concerns and aspirations of our stakeholders. It has led to a clear sense of ownership among front-line responders, who feel that their views have been taken fully into account and acted upon, and a genuine commitment to delivering the objectives of the legislation.

</p>

<a name="51024-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The approach highlights the benefits of a genuine dialogue between the Government, Parliament and practitioners. In particular, I welcome the Merits Committee&#039;s recognition of the Cabinet Office&#039;s efforts in that regard.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Finalising this legislation and bringing it into force is very much the beginning of the process and not its conclusion. A significant amount of work is under way in a number of areas to give local responders the support that they need to meet the challenges in the Act, and it is perhaps worth giving noble Lords a flavour of that work. The new legislation is underpinned by the right level of resources. The level of funding for national security and emergency preparedness will double between 2001 and 2008, and local responders have benefited significantly from that new investment. For example, funding for local authorities&#039; civil protection work was more than doubled in the last spending review. We as a Government are committed to ensuring that established public expenditure processes continue to secure for local responders the funding that they require.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The Civil Contingencies Act has also generated an unprecedented demand for learning and professional development opportunities. We are working with all the government colleges&#151;the Emergency Planning College, the Fire Service College and so on&#151;to ensure that we meet that demand. The Government are also committed to giving local responders the guidance and support that they need to comply with the requirements of the Act. One good illustration of that commitment is risk assessment. In addition to the risk assessment methodology set out in <i>Emergency Preparedness</i>&#151;the guidance&#151;in July the Government issued centrally provided risk information to all category 1 responders. That will ensure that local risk assessments are made on the best possible evidence and will minimise the scope for duplication of effort. It has been warmly welcomed by stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The Civil Contingencies Act has without doubt raised the profile of civil protection work, and the performance management regime that we are putting in place will ensure that continues to be the case. The Government are committed to ensuring that the requirements of the Act are reflected in local responders&#039; mainstream audit and inspection regimes in a robust, fair and consistent way. The Act establishes a clear set of standards, and we are working closely with audit and inspection bodies, notably the Audit Commission and HMIC, to ensure that those are met.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Noble Lords made a number of useful and valuable points for discussion. I shall try to work through them now, so that questions can be properly dealt with. I shall start with the three points made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The Government carried out active consultation work with the key stakeholder groups, which was an inclusive process. We were encouraged on that during the passage of the Bill, and that was right. The Cabinet Office convened a number of working groups to develop the draft regulations and the guidance during the course of working on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC250"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC250</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation, which was very helpful to us in honing the expertise of those on the front line in the policy development process. We consulted publicly on the draft regulations and guidance, and hosted a series of consultation roadshows to facilitate that dialogue. We can honestly say that we listened carefully to the views of stakeholders, and made a number of changes to detailed aspects of the package as a result.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also referred to the importance of local responders. We take that very seriously, and it is right that we put in place systems that are therefore warning and informing the public&#151;the dual role of those local responders&#151;and ensuring that they are made well aware of the arrangements that are being put in place in any given emergency. In particular, we want to ensure that risks are understood, so that the public will understand what actions have to be taken by an authority if an emergency occurs and the things that the public can do in an emergency. The Act requires local responders to maintain arrangements to warn the public and provide appropriate advice at the time that an emergency occurs. The point is often made that we need to ensure that the public are informed in advance of an emergency. That is right, and the local authorities are doing a valuable job in ensuring it happens.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also referred to the need for conferences. Public events have taken place. We want to ensure that people are well informed. The notion of a generalised conference is welcome and valuable. We may need to hold such an event in the future.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, made the usual points that we expect from the Conservatives on civil preparedness. The Conservatives have a well honed argument: they suggest that we ought to have a homeland security Minister. There are different approaches but we argue that ours works well. The emergencies that occurred this summer&#151;the security issues and the terrorist attacks&#151;showed that our emergency services worked and performed to their best. We can be proud of that, although we must not be complacent. I am not sure how that process would have been strengthened by having a homeland security Minister. The United States, for instance, has a homeland security Minister. I have no wish to criticise the approach of the United States, but weaknesses were shown in its response to Hurricane Katrina. Some of those may have been a by-product of its organisational structure. We need to learn the lessons from events abroad and to reflect on them, but we are confident that our system is robust, our framework works, we have a clear line of ministerial responsibility and those responsibilities are well understood. I am not confident that we would want to introduce a homeland security Minister. We think that our process works well.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The noble Baroness also raised concerns about avian flu. I take issue with her in that we have in place measures and a structure for dealing with such matters. We are prepared for risks as they develop. We have regularly updated the generic contingency plan for avian flu and the UK influenza pandemic <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC251"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC251</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contingency plan. We are stockpiling antivirals and other equipment, and we are acquiring vaccines and the capacity to acquire new vaccines rapidly. We are flexible in our approach. We have strong generic arrangements for emergency responses. Organisations at local, regional and central level are preparing all options for dealing with an outbreak of either disease and ensuring that plans are scaleable.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I also argue that we have been decisive. We have in place clear arrangements for directing planning and response. Lead government departments direct that, and we have tried-and-tested structures for managing emergencies, as I said earlier.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>We must work internationally. The issues of avian flu and pandemic flu are well known internationally. We work together with other administrations to ensure that those issues are tackled on a global basis&#151;that makes perfect sense. We must protect the public here as best we can and take important countermeasures. In the light of our expertise, we can reasonably argue that we have undertaken global work and that we are working well with other authorities. In particular, it is of benefit that we can take a lead as the current holder of the EU presidency.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>In response to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Garden, I did not think that there was a great deal there. The civil contingencies regulations are quite a detailed document. It is not often that one gets such a detailed, 36-page document. I looked for the paragraph that the noble Lord said was vague. It qualifies an important point&#151;that category 2 responders need to be present at meetings, on a need-to-know basis. That is not suggestive of vagueness in the regulations. The regulations work very well.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Our general approach is to try to inform not alarm. We want to work well with category 2 responders. We seek to inform them in a way that is clearly understood. The way in which our civil contingency arrangements have developed over the past two or three years has demonstrated many of the system&#039;s strengths.
</p>

<a name="51024-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>We will go on developing; we certainly cannot afford to be complacent in any way, shape, or form, because emergencies take many forms. It can be a flooding in Boscastle; a flooding in Carlisle; an outbreak of avian flu; it could be a mini-tornado in Birmingham. We know that these things take different variants. Our approach, in particular in the summer to the fallout from the London bombing attacks, showed just how far we have come in speedy response and effective action, because that is what the public need and want. On that basis, I am more than content with the regulations.

<a name="51024-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Chesterton: </b>   Can I take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Garden? I was head of the Met Office, which is part of the MoD and is highly involved in many aspects of emergencies. He seemed to point out that the regulations did not include the MoD&#039;s role, which is in fact extensive. The moment there is an emergency the Met Office sets up emergency cells with all the different ministries. Is it an oversight <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC252"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC252</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

or is it deliberate? Can the Minister explain? Since the point has been made by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, it should be answered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51024-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   This came up in the debate on the Bill. We already have in place effective arrangements for ensuring that the MoD is actively involved and informed&#151;that it is there when it needs to be. The MoD has a clearly defined role in terms of supporting civil authorities during emergencies. The MoD is also closely engaged in civil resilience arrangements. We recognise and have always made it plain that the Armed Forces&#039; organisation, skills, equipment, talent and training make them an extremely valuable national resource. There is nothing in the regulations that takes away from that; far to the contrary. They have a well established, flexible command-and-control structure, and are well integrated in our planning and thinking.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Emergency regulations can authorise the Defence Council to deploy the Armed Forces, which enables emergency regulations clearly to delineate the uses to which the Armed Forces can be put in any emergency. Perhaps it is worth saying that it might be necessary to confer additional powers on members of the Armed Forces where their use in an emergency was considered appropriate. The system works well. The military understands its role and when it is required, and we already have in place well honed arrangements for that involvement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51024-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   The Ministry of Defence question was raised again. We discussed it during the passage of the Bill, when there was an extraordinary reluctance to put the Ministry of Defence under any obligation to do anything. It always works on the principle that it will turn up on the day with what it has got. Currently, it is a bit short in those terms. This is a serious, non-partisan question: will the Minister undertake to look again at whether he is putting in place the appropriate structure to engage the Ministry of Defence? I hear out in the field that the relationships are not always that good.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51024-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Obviously, it would be silly indeed of me to say that we do not keep these things under review and we do not look again at things, because we do that all the time. That is part of our process. I take exception to what the noble Lord said; the relations are good and robust. The links and arrangements are well understood. Of course, we are happy with the way in which things have developed, but we are always looking to improve things.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I have no indication from what I understand of military involvement and engagement that there are any problems at all, so I do not understand where the noble Lord is coming from on this. I suggest to him that he might want to consider it further too. Again, we keep all these things under review, and I am more than happy to engage in some dialogue with the noble Lord and other noble Lords who have participated in the debate. If they want to come and talk to us some more about this and receive some further briefing on those arrangements, I am more than happy to arrange that.

<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="51024-17_time0"></a><h5>4.45 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51024-17_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Astor </b>   rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government by what criteria the Casino Advisory Panel will judge expressions of interest from local authorities when advising on the location of new casinos under the terms of the Gambling Act 2005.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The noble Viscount said: I seek to obtain information from the Government for the benefit of those involved in the industry, interested in it, and who partake in it in one way or another. I hope that the Minister will give us as much information as he can, so that it will help take the debate forward.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The issue stems from the Gambling Act, which was passed in the dying days of the previous Parliament. Under it, an independent panel&#151;the Casino Advisory Panel&#151;was set up to advise the Government on areas in which new types of casino should be located. The panel was appointed by the Minister, Mr Caborn, in September. It is chaired by Professor Stephen Crow and has four other members. I understand that it started work on 3 October and will report by the end of 2006. Based on the panel&#039;s advice, the Secretary of State will specify the areas for the 17 new casinos&#151;one regional, eight large and eight small&#151;in a parliamentary order, probably at the beginning of 2007. That order will require the approval of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The panel will begin its work by inviting expressions of interest from local authorities. Of course, local authorities that are unwilling to license a new casino will not be considered. The primary consideration of the panel will be to ensure that the areas identified satisfy the need for the best possible test of social impact; that is the department&#039;s term rather than mine, and I am not sure what it means. Perhaps the Minister will elucidate on that. The panel will take into account the potential for regeneration in the areas, and will invite regional planning bodies in England to identify a broad list of locations for the regional casinos. Once Parliament has approved the areas for the new casinos, the relevant local authorities&#151;or, in Scotland, licensing boards&#151;will be able to run competitions for the new casino premises licences. The Secretary of State will issue a code of practice concerning the conduct of the competitions before they begin.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Also under the Gambling Act 2005, the Gambling Commission was set up. It has taken over the role previously played by the Gaming Board for Great Britain in regulating casinos, bingo, gaming machines and lotteries. It will have responsibility for regulating betting and remote gambling, as well as helping to protect children and vulnerable people. It will also be responsible for advising local and central government on issues that relate to gambling. Its timetable is similar; it has been formally established, and will consider applications for new licences under the Gambling Act in January 2007. When those take effect, it will exercise all its functions.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The Secretary of State has some responsibilities and the Gambling Commission has others. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister how those <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC254"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interact and relate. There is some confusion about how things will work, certainly in my mind, which I am sure that he will be able to explain in his usual careful way.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Some issues are complex. In the Act, there is provision for an existing operator to expand one of its casinos to take over one of the 17 new licences if it is located in one of the local authority areas. However, the reality is that existing casinos and operators will not be able to offer a local authority the same levels of regeneration that a newcomer might and, effectively, will be priced out of the market. If the Government are solely making the decision on the criterion of regeneration, it is difficult to argue that an existing casino could move up, as it were, because it is already there and is not bringing as much regeneration as someone given a totally new licence. In some cases, that might give an unfair advantage to a new licensee to the detriment of an existing one that wants to move up. Perhaps they should be considered on a more equal basis. Will the Minister comment on that?
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>In effect, the Government will have to ask the panel how to consider the competitive impact of locating a new casino in a local authority area that already hosts casinos. We do not really understand the brief or criteria that the department has given the panel, whether there will be instructions or advice, or whether the panel will have to wade through the columns of <i>Hansard</i> to look up who said what when the Bill went through Parliament. The Government need to be a little more open on how things will happen.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>No doubt the Minister has been approached by as many different local authorities and interested parties as I have about the regional casino licence. An awful lot of people want it. I take no view on where it should go, except that I do not think that it should be used to bail out the Dome. It is important that the Government are clear that they do not intend to change the terms of the Act before the new licences have come in and following a review. I understand that the Government&#039;s original intention was that there would be two reviews, each after a three-year period following the new licences coming in in 2007. That implied that there would not be a review until 2012 or 2013. It would dampen a certain amount of speculation if the Minister could be clear in saying that the Government still stick to that timetable, which is the one that we supported during the passage of the then Bill.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The department has set up the panel, but we do not know on what criteria it will select areas or at what it will look. Then the Secretary of State has to judge its recommendations before accepting them, and we do not know what form that will take. Will the Gambling Commission have input at that stage? The Minister might say that the panel&#039;s criteria should be kept secret, but it is probably better for everybody that we know what they are. I am not sure whether they come under the Freedom of Information Act, so the Government might have to tell us anyway. The answer might be interesting.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The panel that will offer all this advice to the Secretary of State will have to consider things like population and regeneration. What are the criteria? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC255"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC255</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

What are the Government saying that the panel should take into account? Is there an order of importance? How will it look at the social and economic impact and regeneration? Will it consider the impact of existing licences under the 1968 Act? After all, there are 137 casino licences in operation, with 20 licensed but not yet open, some of which are casinos in the process of opening and some may or may not open in future. Will existing licences be considered until 2007, or will there be some cut-off point prior to 2007? The industry does not know how long it will be able to apply for licences under the existing rules. It would be helpful if the panel published the guidance or directions that the Secretary of State will give it.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>It is difficult to know what regeneration means. We now have the somewhat bizarre state in which local authorities, many of which have been rather anti-gambling in the past, seem to be about to indulge in a rather unseemly squabble of promoting that each has a better regeneration case than the next. In effect, it is only the large regional casinos that will ever provide major regeneration, because those will be the ones designed by their pure size to attract visitors and tourists from outside their individual areas. All the others will really rely on their local population. It would be helpful if the Minister could say something about that.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>There is one other issue, which is about transitional provisions for existing casinos. There are casinos out there that are large enough to move to become either small or large casinos. The only transitional arrangements in the Act are in Part 1 of Schedule 18. They refer to existing casinos too small to be new casinos. The Government may designate existing casinos that are large enough to meet the new criteria&#151;that was their original intention&#151;and then add conditions to the licences limiting the number of, say, slot machines. In other words, they could prevent the casinos enjoying the same commercial freedoms of a new large or small casino.
</p>

<a name="51024-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>It is a somewhat complicated point. I have written to the Minister on the subject, because I thought that he would probably be able to understand it more clearly than from my trying to explain it to him. Between one and the other, I hope that he will give an answer. We need to consider that those in the industry should have the same chance as new operators to improve their casinos so that they can move up as well. It is about being fair, and the Minister will want to be even-handed when the Government consider those already operating in the industry compared with those coming in. I look forward to his response.

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC256</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

historical tour of some aspects of the Act. Most of us will agree that it had a fairly chequered history in terms of how regional casinos were dealt with.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a> On these Benches, we have very much taken our tune consistently from the Joint Committee of both Houses in its second report of July 2004. It said that it did not think that &quot;regional casino&quot; was particularly helpful in describing the fundamental nature of the very largest casinos. That is what we are talking about. At paragraph 15 of its report, the committee stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;We expect regional casinos to be large scale entertainment complexes offering gambling alongside a wide range of non-gambling facilities. This concept is not adequately captured by the current classification&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>As a result of that, in the other place we voted against the Bill at Second Reading, and moved a reasoned amendment stating our deep concern at the potential impact of its casino proposals on the number of problem gamblers and local communities. If you recall, at that point the Government were more or less saying that they would be perfectly happy with the number of super casinos and regional casinos that the market would bear.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>In Committee in the other place, the Government backed down and said that they would limit the number of regional casinos in the first phase to eight. The Minister, Mr Caborn, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;Whether more regional casinos will be allowed in due course will depend on the results of careful evaluation of their impact after the initial period&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 16/11/04; col. 140.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51024-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>A month later, he announced on 16 December that an independent advisory panel&#151;the one to which the noble Viscount referred&#151;would be appointed to make recommendations not only about regional casinos, but about small and large ones as well. That was fairly baffling in the circumstances. Be that as it may, it deals with all three categories of casino.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Clearly, the guidance of 16 December is crucial in the circumstances. We welcome the terms of the Bill generally, but that was the area about which we were concerned. We were also rather concerned about the pre-election manoeuvring that led to the reduction of what seemed to be a perfectly sensible number of regional casinos to one, and we did not support that proposal expressly in either House. Despite the fact that the Bill contained some provisions with which we did not agree, as it regulated matters such as remote gambling and had other beneficial aspects, we thought that it was better to accept an imperfect Bill rather than try to put the kybosh on it at that stage. However, be that as it may, the way in which the Government went from a multitude of possible super regional casinos down to eight and then one seemed a masterpiece of poor political management. I assume that the 16   December guidance is still operative so far as those regional casinos are concerned. Certainly, the replies to Parliamentary Questions, for example, that of Mr Caborn to Mr Kevan Jones on 4 July:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;The casino advisory panel will consider submissions from local authorities wishing to issue premises licences for regional, large or small casinos&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 4/7/05; col. 30W.],</p>
</ul>
<p>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC257</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>seems to indicate that the guidance is still valid even though it applies currently to only one casino. The reply of 21 July to Mr Nicholas Brown, also from Mr Caborn, is very much of the same tenor.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Later in the year the story shifts to the rumours and reports that the Government want to raise the number of super regional casino pilots from one to any number up to 10. It is accepted that that would be permissible if the requisite delegated legislation was agreed by both Houses. Industry analysts appear to believe that the advisory panel may recommend such an increase in the number of super casinos based on the strength of the competing expressions of interest from local authorities. Like the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, my understanding is that the panel is due to give its advice on the location of the new casinos by the end of 2006 to allow a parliamentary order to be laid at the beginning of 2007. It is extremely important that the Minister clarifies exactly what the Government&#039;s attitude to a recommendation by the casino advisory panel will be. I should be very much interested to hear in rather more detail what is meant by a number of terms in the guidance such as regeneration and the social issues mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. The matter of whether the casino advisory panel has been given licence to make a recommendation and whether the Government will accept that recommendation is the key issue. What are the Government&#039;s intentions in that respect?
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I am perfectly happy to tell the Government what our approach is to the matter. If the Casino Advisory Panel recommends up to eight regional casinos, and if that decision is informed by the principle of destination gambling, we would be prepared to support an order incorporating that provision. However, we must have clarity about the Government&#039;s intentions with regard to what constitutes genuine regeneration and the social issues that might arise with some of those casinos. It is clear that a number of extremely good schemes are being put together. Simply believing that one town is the only appropriate holder of a regional casino licence seems to us illogical and certainly not really capable of evaluation, and goes completely against the arguments that were originally made in the 16 December guidance. However, proper research needs to be done before the casinos are set up. There needs to be as it were a benchmark of gaming prevalence prior to the regional casinos being set up and the period of assessment needs to be sufficient. I believe that the Government originally mentioned a period of three years. If we have a larger number of casinos, a longer period may be appropriate.


</p>

<a name="51024-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The fact is that the larger the casino, certainly the greater its impact in all kinds of ways on the surrounding community. It may be beneficial as regards regeneration but not as regards the incidence of problem gambling and so on. At this crucial juncture we shall be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say.

<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51024-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, for introducing the debate and for asking a series of questions that he considered ought to be answered about policy with regard to casinos. I shall do my best to answer his questions as fully as I can. I also appreciated the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. I noted his indication of the support that he might give in future if recommendations from the panel accorded with what he anticipated might be an increase in regional casinos. I do not know whether that will be case; we shall have to await developments. I am grateful for that contribution.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>However, I was not quite so happy with the account given by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, regarding the history of the Bill&#039;s development. If the noble Lord does not mind my saying so, the Liberal Democrat Party is a little prone to wanting to have its cake and eat it. It has always impressed upon government the need for flexibility and consultation, the need to adjust to a changing situation and to hear representations made in Parliament. There was a classic case before the election. We had very clear ideas on what we wanted as regards the number of regional casinos. However, the noble Lord was all too well aware of the fact that there was some fairly forthright opposition by the Conservative Party to those proposals. We had to reach a compromise or not see the legislation reach the statute book at all. However, the noble Lord berates me, saying that the parliamentary process let him down. He considers that he as a good-thinking Liberal did not get his way just as he would have liked on how Parliament ought to work. As I say, he cannot have it both ways. This listening caring Government faced the reality of the situation and produced fresh proposals. I do not think that we should be berated for that.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Lest we lapse&#151;not that we would do, of course&#151;into an authoritarian mode where we thought every idea that we had was, from its very origin, absolutely unchangeable, and we never listened to representations from elsewhere or any amendments tabled by any party in either House, I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, would be the first to demand different and better conduct from this Government. With this Government he gets the best of all worlds. He gets a clear definition of policy regarding what we want to achieve. On those occasions when representations are made of which we have to have due cognizance, we respect those opinions. As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, made clear in his opening remarks, we are committed to one regional casino at the present time. We are working on a formula of one:eight:eight, as laid down in the Act. Of course, we shall await the panel&#039;s findings and listen to public opinion as time goes on. The idea that those numbers are set in stone for all eternity is quite absurd. We intend to work, and ensure that the panel works, against that background. We shall see what emerges from such deliberations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, accurately pointed out&#151;backed up by the noble Lord, Lord, Clement-Jones&#151;the panel has been working for a couple of weeks only. It will meet to agree its working methods in the next week. It is for the panel to work out its own methods of working. It will prepare detailed criteria for the crucial role of assessing applications over the coming weeks. I understand that it hopes to announce the result of those deliberations early next year. What I say today is intended to be helpful in a developing situation and is not intended in any way to be prejudicial to the process upon which the independent panel is about to embark.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>The national policy statement on casinos issued last December outlines the broad criteria that the panel will need to use in recommending locations for the new 17 casinos; that is, the formula of the one regional, eight large and eight small casinos. The reason for the initial limit on numbers is clear. We have always recognised that limits are necessary to allow for an assessment to be made of the impact of casinos and the risks that they pose in terms of problem gambling. The primary consideration for the panel will therefore be to recommend locations that provide the best possible test of social impact.   To that end, the panel has been asked  to identify areas for new casinos that will provide a good range of types of location and a good   geographical spread of locations across Britain. The panel will want to ensure that those areas selected are willing to license a new casino. Subject to that, the panel is asked to choose areas in need of economic development and regeneration, as measured by employment and other social deprivation factors, and likely to benefit in regeneration terms from a casino.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The Government have asked the panel to invite the views of interested parties when developing its recommendations. I am sure that the panel intends to consult as widely as possible in carrying out its work. However, in formulating its recommendations, the panel will be able to take into account only representations that it considers relevant to its specific remit: the locations of the 17 new casinos to Ministers.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Last year&#039;s national policy statement made it clear that the Government would expect the panel, in formulating its recommendations, to consult the regional planning bodies, which are best able to make judgments on the social and economic impact of casino development in their region. Each board&#039;s role is essentially to determine, through the normal regional spatial strategy process, which broad locations in its region would be suitable in planning terms for a regional casino. Some regional planning boards may also wish to comment on the suitability of broad locations for large casinos, if they consider that in their region large casinos would be of regional significance.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Ministers have asked the panel to ensure, before it finalises its recommendations, that the local authority areas that it recommends are compatible with the broad locations identified in England in the regional spatial strategy or in any draft revisions of the regional spatial strategy before the Secretary of State.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC260"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC260</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>It is important to emphasise that the panel will be required to identify local authorities, not specific locations, amenable to, and enthusiastic about, the development of casinos. It is for local people to judge on specific locations. The panel must determine which local authorities wish to avail of the potentiality. It is likely that, in formulating its recommendations, the panel will want to consult regional development agencies and other bodies. The panel will also be expected to consult equivalent economic, regeneration and planning bodies in Scotland and Wales.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The panel is due to make its recommendations to Ministers by the end of 2006. Based on that advice, the Secretary of State will specify the areas for the 17   new casinos in a parliamentary order at the beginning of 2007. That order will require the approval of both Houses of Parliament&#151;the affirmative procedure&#151;as would any order changing the number of new casinos in those categories.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>All the appointments to the advisory panel were made following an open and fair competition according to Nolan principles, to ensure a fair, open and transparent process. I assure the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that we are prepared to publish the advice that the Government give the panel. There must be full public confidence in the operation and the process must be as open as possible. To state the obvious, the enabling Act has been promoted by government but, from now on, the initiators of the new casinos, the decision-takers, will operate on a local and regional basis. So the panel appointments were advertised in the national press and candidates applied in the normal way. I am sure the Committee will accept that this was a perfectly open and fair practice. All members of the panel were required to declare any actual or perceived conflicts of interest as part of the application process. Members of the panel will continue to maintain a register of possible conflicts of interest which will be available to the public and published.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The reason it will take some time for the panel to produce its advice and why we will not see action until 2007 is because it needs to take a great deal into account. It needs to take account of the revised regional spatial strategies, which are the responsibility of regional planning hubs. A wide range of issues are germane to its consideration. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, was gently drawing me onto the well-meaning hook&#151;were we not disappointed that the numbers we had in the original Bill were different from those which are in the Act, and therefore are you not eager to change the situation? We are proceeding on the basis of the Act. It may well be that the panel will produce recommendations to indicate that the Act, which restricts the provision to one regional casino, may be too restrictive. We will have to see how things develop in those terms.
</p>

<a name="51024-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>First, the panel has to produce recommendations. Secondly, if it were decided to increase the numbers, the parliamentary process of an affirmative order would have to be followed and opened to the widest consultation. We all recognise that none of this would <br>&nbsp;<br>

be done overnight, hence our commitment to a timetable for the existing 17 proposed&#151;I give way to the noble Viscount.

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51024-19_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord. There is a point that I am not clear about and I should be grateful if the Minister could explain it. Might the panel make a recommendation that the number of regional casinos could be increased prior to the first regional casino being opened in 2007 and prior to an assessment being made over a period of time on what the impact of that one regional casino had been in the area? In other words, would it, as currently envisaged, actually have to see one up and running before it made    any recommendations or could it make recommendations prior to that date?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51024-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The panel&#039;s remit is to work with the proposals in the Act&#151;the 1:8:8 policy. That is what it is expected to do. It has its work cut out to come up with recommendations in just a little more than 12 months in order that the process can be forwarded in 2007. So it will be working to that rubric. The noble Viscount is right: we expect the panel to be involved in an evaluation process. That will mean that we will need to look at the operation of the new casinos as they come on-stream. So I can answer him categorically on that point.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>In the course of his speech the noble Viscount raised some very interesting questions. I need a framework within which to reply both to him and to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, with regard to the broad structure of the panel. That is why I am commenting on this. I just want to reassure him that I would not dream of ignoring his extremely pertinent and accurate questions. I shall do my best to answer those in these terms.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We cannot rule out the possibility&#151;that is what Nolan is commenting on&#151;of increases in the future, but we are operating on the basis of the Act. Any increase in number will not be a matter for the Government; it will be a matter for Parliament to make judgments on, having had the benefit of seeing the social impact of casinos already in place.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked me a number of detailed questions. I wanted to set out the structure of how we intend to operate while at the same time being fair to him by responding to his questions. First, I do not think that it is right to contend that existing casinos are disadvantaged. In some ways, existing casinos are rather well placed. They are actually working and have their relationships established. They often are respected by the local area in which they exist. Local areas know their benefits and also those that may accrue from their development. So they are disadvantaged by the requirement of looking at social impact. It would be strange if an organisation of any buoyancy could not convince its local authority that, if it were already respected for its contribution to the local society and economy, it could not do better with greater support. So I do not think that there is a problem there. The noble Viscount may have erected rather a straw man <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC262"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for me to deal with. I do not see the disadvantage to existing casinos. In fact, in some ways it seems obvious that they have some strength.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The noble Viscount also asked about criteria. I have indicated that we shall publish those criteria so that the nation knows what the panel&#039;s judgments will be based on. We all recognise that that is absolutely crucial to the whole process. He asked about local casinos and the research being done. The research can be commissioned. We already have some insights into the operation of casinos&#151;that goes without saying&#151;but this is a dramatic new development. No one underestimates the significance of this Act and the creation of the new casinos. The monitoring of those developments will be carried on under the responsibilities of the panel.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Local authorities must decide on the bids for their areas. Some local authorities will find that very testing. Local authorities in whose areas there are no bids for casinos will have an easy ride. I bring to the Committee&#039;s attention one obvious point: one does not have to stretch one&#039;s mind too far to think of a situation where a local authority has received bids for casinos from two groups, each of which is perhaps strongly supported by a major football club in its locality. So we have two local football clubs competing for the one position. No one will underestimate the challenge to that local authority in making that decision. Local authorities will be on their mettle in applying the criteria and making these decisions.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>By the same token, such is the significance of that decision that local authorities will be very mindful of the casino&#039;s impact on their locality&#151;in terms of economic regeneration and the social impact&#151;and what is good for the welfare of the local communities, because they will have been involved in a decision of considerable significance. We should have no anxiety about how carefully the development of the new casinos will be monitored; and none of us would underestimate what is at stake. That is to say nothing of the national picture and the wider interests of those of us who may not live in local authorities with a casino, but who are keeping a watchful eye on the development. But it will be readily recognised that local authorities will have a very important role to play.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The noble Lord asked me about the degree of research being carried out. It is for the panel to make up its own mind on the processes for development of the criteria. He will recognise that we sought to choose wise and effective people to operate the panel. The criteria laid down by the Secretary of Stare are explicit. I think that we can rest on the fact that all this work will be done with great openness, which is the surest test of the efficacy of the operation of the new body, which, we all recognise, is charged with an enormously significant role.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>On the broad issues with regard to regeneration, of course in government we have a vast amount of data on successful regeneration strategies. We are proud of the areas in which we have been successful. We know of certain levers that can be pulled successfully. During <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC263"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC263</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a number of hard years in government we have also discovered a number of strategies that have not worked so well. This one will have to stand the test of economic regeneration. But there is no doubt that we can already sense by the interests of a wide range of authorities in this development that they are all too well aware of the potentiality of casinos and the structure of leisure facilities associated with them bringing enormous benefits to their areas. There has even been a suggestion that one authority knows that it will get the big casino&#151;the number one. No one that I have spoken to in that authority is counting any chickens; they are well aware that there will be intense competition from other parts of the country. I think that we can rely upon the inevitable pressures of local authorities seeking to do well by their local communities and feeling able to monitor this process successfully to guarantee that the whole process will be successful.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I was asked about the social impact. No one underestimates problem gambling. We all know that certain forms of gambling are particularly addictive <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC264"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column GC264</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and may make young people, in particular, vulnerable. The controls are there for certain forms of gambling because we know the seduction of slot machines or, as our Australian friends refer to them, &quot;pokies&quot; and the ease with which both young people and adults can succumb to such problems.
</p>

<a name="51024-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>We feel that we have a structure in place that guarantees that the development of the casinos will be monitored to guarantee that this social problem is controlled and kept within a framework. We recognise that a large number of our fellow citizens are engaged in gambling, and a relatively small percentage find that that leads to compulsive and problematic behaviour. We will see the Gambling Commission carrying out a prevalence study over the next year. The impact of the regional casino will be assessed in not less than three years after it is established&#151;so there will be time. I give that reassurance to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, on what I think is his most pertinent question on the development of this policy. On that basis, I hope that I have succeeded in allaying anxieties expressed this afternoon.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>It has since been brought to my attention that the output figure for employment opportunities was reported inaccurately by Advantage West Midlands. Amended copies of the output results have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and are also available on the DTI website at www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info. The correct figure is 11,760, which is above the agency&#039;s target of 11,200. The incorrect figure given in July was 15,439.

</p>

<a name="51024-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>As each day passes, the true scale of the disaster is becoming clearer. Due to the mountainous nature of    the terrain, many areas could not be accessed immediately, and some have still not been reached. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS65"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column WS65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The government of Pakistan now report that 51,400 people have died with 74,500 injured. The number of homeless people is estimated to be between 2.7 million and 3.2 million. The homeless are in urgent need of shelter, blankets, and warmth.
</p>

<a name="51024-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>On 20 October I visited Muzaffarabad and Balakot and saw the scale of the devastation. We are now in a race against time to save lives as winter sets in and temperatures drop below zero. On the same day, I allocated an additional &#163;20 million to the relief and recovery effort. This brings DfID&#039;s total pledge to date to &#163;33 million; &#163;9 million of this new allocation is already earmarked for the relief operation including an extra &#163;1 million for medical support and services, an extra &#163;1 million in support of water and sanitation, and an extra &#163;1 million towards shelter.
</p>

<a name="51024-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The government of Pakistan and the international community face massive challenges in reaching the population affected in remote areas. DfID has committed a sizeable part of the new allocation to supporting the co-ordination and logistical effort. UK support includes &#163;3 million for helicopters including three British military heavy lift CH-47 Chinook helicopters, as well as four helicopters already being funded by DfID through the UN and Red Cross. DfID has also earmarked a further &#163;1 million for logistics, transport and coordination, and &#163;2 million for the Red Cross movement which includes helicopters as well as the provision of immediate relief supplies such as blankets, tents and water. The remaining funds, around &#163;12 million, will be allocated as needed.
</p>

<a name="51024-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>Of the &#163;13 million previously announced DfID has allocated: &#163;5 million for the UN Flash Appeal; &#163;3 million to pay for in-kind donations and airlifts for the Disasters Emergency Committee; &#163;1.5 million for the Red Cross; &#163;300,000 for Save the Children UK for the provision of tents, blankets, clothing, primary health care and services to help reunify families; &#163;300,000 for Christian Aid for tents, food packages, shelter kits, first aid and medical assistance; and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS66"></a>

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column WS66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;300,000 for Action Aid for the provision of relief, food packages, shelter, health centres, tents, medical supplies and support. Also, &#163;1,660,000 has been provided by the UK as part of the EU&#039;s aid contribution through the European Commission Humanitarian Organisation (ECHO).

</p>

<a name="51024-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The UK search and rescue teams returned on 14 and 15 October, having been involved in the rescue of 14 people. The Government, through DfID&#039;s emergency response team, have also: undertaken 13 relief flights carrying a total of 900 tonnes of emergency supplies; organised and funded 23 Disasters Emergency Committee flights with another three planned over the next few days; paid for half of the World Health Organisation&#039;s appeal to provide enough health and trauma kits to support 40,000 people for three months; and provided logistical support to the United Nations including vehicles, airport handling equipment and a Humanitarian Information Centre.
</p>

<a name="51024-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Further information on the emergency response can be found at www.dfid.gov.uk. Staff at the High Commission in Islamabad continue to offer consular assistance to British nationals in Pakistan and who are travelling to the affected area to search for relatives. Sadly, there has been one confirmed British fatality, a 12 year-old boy from Luton. We have helped his injured parents obtain expert medical attention, accommodation and provided them with emergency passports. A few missing persons remain unaccounted for and High Commission staff are continuing to try to locate them.
</p>

<a name="51024-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>In recognition of the fact that many people here in the UK will be grieving for or concerned about relatives caught up in the tragedy, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who has responsibility for the aftercare of disaster victims, has arranged for the 7 July assistance centre to extend its helpline to those affected by the South Asia Earthquake. The centre is offering advice and support services on which people can draw. The helpline number is 0845 70547444.

<a name="51024w01_sbhd0"></a><h3 align=center>Afghanistan: Agricultural Development</h3>


<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="51024w01_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What funds they are making available though the Department for International Development or otherwise to encourage the cultivation in Afghanistan of crops other than heroin poppies and to assist the profitable marketing of such alternative produce.   [HL1676]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="51024w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  DfID leads the Government&#039;s efforts to develop alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan. In the financial year 2005&#150;06, it is spending nearly &#163;50 million for this purpose. This is an almost tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003&#150;04.
</p>

<a name="51024w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>A proportion of this spending is specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies. Between October 2002 and September 2005 DfID has agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilisers and poppy. Innovative ways for farmers to make a living are also being pursued, including apricot drying, honey bee keeping, tailoring and weaving and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production.

</p>

<a name="51024w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, it is important to develop non-farm alternative livelihoods if we are to ensure longer term sustainability. DfID activities in Badakshan and the Eastern Hazarajat provinces are developing sustainable economic alternatives and social incentives to enable farmers to stop growing poppy.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>Following consultation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, what is the agreed course of action for United Kingdom forces in Afghanistan tasked with countering the cultivation and marketing of narcotics.   [HL1675]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="51024w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  UK military personnel, mainly from the Army, serve with the UN-authorised International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), where they either help to maintain security in Kabul or work to extend the authority of the Afghan Government in northern Afghanistan. Other personnel serve with the US-led coalition. All contribute to ensuring that the remnants of the Taliban cannot threaten the establishment of a stable, peaceful and democratic Afghanistan.

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column WA146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51024w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>ISAF support for counter-narcotics (CN) activity on the ground in Afghanistan is set out within the CN annex to the NATO operations plan and includes the sharing of information, support for the counter-narcotics information campaign through a variety of methods, such as poster and leaflet distribution and radio broadcasts, and the provision of enabling logistical support to Afghan and international CN agencies. It precludes proactive eradication and interdiction activity.
</p>


<p><a name="wa_qn_2"></a>
<a name="51024w01_wqn2"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>What approaches they have made to the governments of other European Union member states to contribute to common funding to encourage the cultivation in Afghanistan of crops other than heroin poppies and to assist the profitable marketing of such alternative produce.   [HL1677]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="51024w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The international community is providing assistance across all strands of the government of Afghanistan&#039;s 2005 counter-narcotics (CN) implementation plan. Using its G8 lead nation status for CN in Afghanistan, the UK has been pressing for increased financial and other support from international partners, particularly in G8 and EU fora. We have negotiated strong wording on support for Afghan counter-narcotics in the EU Drugs Action Plan. Under the UK presidency, we have been working with member states to produce a matrix of increased EU assistance that will also act as a lobbying tool to lever assistance from other countries. At our invitation, Afghan CN Minister Qaderi took part in the EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Informal on 9 September, as well as the first EU-Afghanistan drugs troika on 6 September. He delivered strong messages on the need for increased EU and other international support, including making contributions to the government of Afghanistan&#039;s CN trust fund. We are encouraging member states, as well as other countries, to channel funding through the CN trust fund, and to provide training and expert assistance, including mentors for the CN Criminal Justice Task Force and Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA). Recently, Poland has offered to provide CNPA with trainers for an 18-month period and the European Commission has committed &#8364;15 million to the CN trust fund.

<a name="51024w03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   Since its arrival in December 2004, the European Union force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR) has, under the leadership of Major General David Leakey, successfully carried out its primary mission of providing deterrence, reassurance and a safe and secure environment for the Bosnian and international authorities to carry out their work. In addition to this primary mission, EUFOR has also vigorously pursued its key supporting tasks, including providing assistance to the fight against organised crime, supporting the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR) mission implementation plan and supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Key activity has included intelligence-based weapons collection operations and a number of significant operations targeting organised crime. In a typical three-month period, EUFOR collect some 500 small arms, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,500 hand grenades and over 250 kilograms of explosives. As a direct result of EUFOR&#039;s operations against fuel smugglers and illegal loggers, well over 100 cases have been brought to trial, and tax revenues on fuel have increased significantly. EUFOR has and will continue to work closely with NATO, the special representative, the EU police mission and others to provide an environment in which reform and reconstruction can take place.

I am aware that there are certain groups which are pressing for Holocaust Memorial Day to be replaced or supplemented by a generic genocide memorial day. However, the Government believe that such a change is neither necessary nor appropriate. The Government introduced Holocaust Memorial Day as an annual national commemoration, taking place each year on 27 January, for the victims of the Nazis&#039; genocide of the Jewish people, and for the other victims of Nazi genocidal and racial policies. The Government have always adopted a broad and inclusive approach towards the content and community outreach of the annual commemoration. Since its inception the commemoration has highlighted more recent tragedies, including those in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo, in some cases with the participation of survivors from those events.

The chief prosecutor is due to update the Security Council on the status of the investigation in December.

<p><a name="wa_qn_47"></a>
<a name="51024w06_wqn5"></a><b> Lord Hylton </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_49"></a>What progress has been made in deploying the 6,171 military personnel and 1,560 civilian personnel authorised for the mission in Sudan on 28 April by the African Union&#039;s Peace and Security Council; whether the union has sufficient funds to sustain this commitment; whether the union is expected to meet its 12,300 person deployment by spring 2006; and what support is being provided by the United Nations mission in Sudan to the African Union.   [HL1559]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_48"></a>
<a name="51024w06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The African Union (AU) have deployed a total of 5,581 military and civilian personnel, and 908 civilian police, as part of the AU mission in Sudan&#039;s (AMIS) current expansion to over 7,700 personnel. The AU has requested further funding assistance from donors, including a further &#8364;70 million from the EU&#039;s African Peace Facility. The AU is planning a joint assessment mission to consider whether a further increase is needed.

</p>

<a name="51024w06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) liaises closely with AMIS, through the AU Commission chairperson&#039;s special representative in Sudan, through meetings with the AU in Addis Ababa and through its constant presence and increasing joint activities on the ground in Darfur such as training in policing and operational planning. UNMIS has a liaison staff permanently deployed to the AMIS headquarters in El Fasher to ensure this support is closely co-ordinated. Additionally, the UN assistance cell to the AU, based in Addis Ababa, helps support the African Union in planning and providing technical advice for AMIS and works closely with other partners to facilitate the AU Commission&#039;s efforts to secure required resources and other support needs for AMIS.

<a name="51024w06_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Numbers of stops and searches under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 are not collected centrally below police force area level. Statistics on stop and search are available in two annual publications that can be accessed on the research, development and statistics area of the Home Office website. The Home Office statistical bulletin, <i>Arrests for Notifiable Offences and the Operation of Certain Police Powers under PACE: England and Wales</i>, details stops and searches under the Terrorism Act 2000, broken down by police force over financial years. The bulletin also shows subsequent arrests. The most recently available figures can be found on the Home Office website at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hosbpubsl.html. The document <i>Publications under Section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act; Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System</i> details stop-searches under the Terrorism Act 2000 by ethnicity. Figures are collated by police force over financial years and they also show subsequent arrests under the Terrorism Act and other legislation.
