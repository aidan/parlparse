The IPCC report does indeed suggest that, in many areas, considerable further work is required. That means that, locally, mental health services must work in partnership with the police and other agencies to ensure that effective alternatives to police custody for people detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act are available.</p>

It is clear that police stations continue to be used as a principal place of safety for lengthy periods of time and contrary to all the guidelines, at considerable cost to the welfare of those detained and the valuable time of the police. Is the Minister aware that in Nottinghamshire, for example, the time involved was more than 6,000 officer hours costing in excess of &#163;136,000 last year? Will she tell the House what steps Her Majesty&#146;s Government will take to require NHS trusts to provide adequate funding and staffing for reception centres for people detained under Section 136?</p>

There have been two reports highlighting the need for further progress in this area: the IPCC report already referred to and a publication by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The IPCC report refers to figures in 2005-06. Since then, we have issued new guidance and made funding available to develop NHS facilities locally. This also shows that it is possible to make the use of police stations an exception, but the key to success is to plan and develop services to meet those needs in conjunction with local partners.</p>

Declaring an interest as the Minister who took the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 through this House, are more vigorous means not needed to ensure that the money is spent to produce places of safety outside police cells when this section is implemented? Will the Minister ask her colleagues to consider ensuring that the police are adequately trained in the difficult art of identifying and separating madness from inebriation and whether the duration of 72 hours is not excessive?</p>

He points to some very important issues. In January this year the guidance was reinforced. A national training package for custody officers was published precisely to help them to recognise those people coming into police custody who need help. Our aim is to help prevent and minimise harm to those who come into contact with the police and who need help. Seventy-two hours is a maximum. It is always possible that 72 hours will be the maximum period and that people will remain in custody for less time than that, as we would wish.</p>

Can he confirm that that figure is already the highest for murders of prisoners by prisoners for several years, although the year still has three months to run? Can he therefore assure the House that however overcrowded the prisons are and however many staff posts are cut, prisoners will at least be kept safe from murderous assaults at the hands of other prisoners?</p>

But, yes, the figure is the highest since 2005. The average over the last number of years has been about 1.7 per year, which means that in some years there have been fewer than that but in other years there have been more. We take the safety of staff and prisoners very seriously and are committed to a robust approach on prosecuting the most serious of those offences. All prisons have in place a violence reduction policy which is used to identify the problems that are specific to that establishment and to develop practical solutions to managing violence. Overall, despite almost an almost doubling of the prison population between 1978 and now, homicides have remained relatively low. Each case is, however, a tragedy.</p>

This is in view of Georgia&#146;s economic progress and shift to lower middle-income status, as confirmed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2006. UK development assistance will continue primarily through our membership of multilateral organisations.</p>

We all know that the world is a very different place since DfID took that decision. If the Government are set to close the DfID office, what discussions have they had with the major multilateral donors to Georgia, particularly the EU, to make certain that there is continuity in development assistance? Will those organisations take over the kind of work that DfID was doing? Are there plans for a phased handover, or is DfID simply letting things drop? Georgia has suffered from a war in which many people have been injured and displaced. Does the Minister agree that this is a time not to close the office but to extend further humanitarian aid?</p>

There has been a review since the summer of whether the office should remain open and we have decided that it should not. We have, however, made a &#163;2 million contribution of immediate aid for work in other areas. That includes about &#163;1 million for the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is one of the few organisations working there, and &#163;550,000 for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We will also be involved in the donors&#146; conference later this month, which will consider the long-term needs of Georgia. We are convinced that the situation is entering a phase where a multinational, rather than a bilateral, effort is called for.</p>

However, we do not accept that multilateral aid is a bad thing. We see bilateral aid as being for low-income countries in particular. It is about providing intensive-care aid, where we go in and provide advice and support for real projects. When a country moves into the middle-income group, it needs international institutions; it needs a better voice on the stage for trade and it needs technical experience. The multilateral agencies are best at providing that aid and it is those agencies that we support in those circumstances.</p>

Instead, he recognised that the role for UK forces has evolved from combat to training. This is entirely consistent with the statement of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in July that our forces in Basra were now focused on completing the task of training and mentoring the Iraqi army before we make the transition to a long-term bilateral relationship with Iraq.</p>

In the interview, of which only parts were reported, Prime Minister Maliki praised the work of British troops and expressed appreciation for them. Our decision to withdraw from the centre of Basra to the airfield was not a unilateral one; it was made after consultation with the Iraqis, and they provided other support to replace the guard in Basra Palace. We have to take thoughtful decisions, which means not having knee-jerk reactions to such issues.</p>

About 50 people are involved in training the Iraqi navy, which is particularly important if we are to help Iraq to protect its oil potential. Clearly it needs naval resources to protect that area. That is at present under the command of a British naval senior person and it will continue for some time as there is much work to do.

As I said, our withdrawal was done after consideration of the issue with General Mohan, who was in charge there. Central government in Iraq knew about it and, in all that has been said by President Maliki over the past few weeks, there have been many expressions of congratulations for the work that has been done, respect for the British forces and thanks for the contributions that we have made in transforming the situation in southern Iraq. Our troops should get the recognition for the very good work that they have been doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08101545000086"></a>As I understand the situation&#151;I confess that I am not an English lawyer&#151;the codes of practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act set out the limited grounds for permitting questioning when someone has already been charged and might be questioned further about the same offence. These grounds include preventing or minimising harm or loss to some other person or to the public, clearing up ambiguity in a previous answer or statement, or, if it is in the interests of justice, commenting on information that has come to light since they were charged.</p>

<a name="81015-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08101545000087"></a>Clause 34 allows a general ability to question someone about terrorism offences after they have been charged. The Government&#146;s position, as I think it has been explained in the past, is that there is no need to address questioning for different offences as that is already permitted. Outwith the terrorism cases, if someone is charged with burglary, there is no difficulty with post-charge questioning if the offence that the person is being questioned about is, for example, a separate assault.</p>

<a name="81015-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08101545000088"></a>We tabled the amendment to seek clarity about post-charge questioning that involves a potentially different charge but one that arises out of the same set of facts. As I have already indicated, someone may

It could be argued that it is not clear what questioning is permitted under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act when that questioning relates to different offences but is based on the same facts. As I have already said, the use of the precursor offence is increasingly relied on.</p>

<a name="81015-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08101545000089"></a>I hope that the Minister will explain in his response the situation where the subject of the post-charge questioning relates to offences arising out of the same facts. That is why our amendments define related offences as those where the facts are wholly or substantively the same as those pertaining to the terrorism offence for which the person has already been charged or informed that they may be prosecuted. The Minister might find this a surprise, but it is intended to be helpful so that there is no dubiety about post-charge questioning being permitted in circumstances where the facts were basically the same but the charge may be more serious. I beg to move.</p>

As I understand it, and as the noble Lord has made clear, it is always open to police officers to continue their investigation after a suspect has been charged. If in the course of that investigation they discover other matters which would warrant a separate charge, it has always, as I understand it, been open to police officers to question that man in respect of those matters. To confine the subject to related offences seems to me, in a sense, to be beating the air because there is no need for that amendment. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say on that subject.</p>

As I understand it, this is a probing amendment. First, for the record, it might be worth outlining the purpose of the clause. Since 2001, experience of terrorism cases has clearly demonstrated that they have grown in scale and complexity, leading to an increase in the volume and complexity of evidence, about which we have heard a lot over the past few weeks.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81015-0003.htm"/>


<a name="81015-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08101545000096"></a>As the Director of Public Prosecutions has made clear, this means that a great deal of evidence comes to light following the charge of a terrorism suspect, either as a result of decryption or translation of material or as a result of additional investigation by the police. At present, it is not possible to compel a suspect to be questioned on such evidence following their charge, which is obviously not in the interests of justice. Therefore, this clause enables questioning of suspects about terrorism offences for which they have already been charged or informed that they would be prosecuted for in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08101545000097"></a>This questioning would be possible not only for the terrorism offences listed in this clause, but also where a Crown Court judge makes an order for a preparatory hearing to be held under Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 on the basis that an offence was connected to terrorism and carries a maximum sentence of at least 10 years. For example, that could allow post-charge questioning about conspiracy to murder if it was connected to terrorism. The clause would also enable adverse inferences to be drawn from an accused&#146;s silence in post-charge questioning; otherwise a suspect could simply choose to refuse to answer any questions with impunity.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08101545000098"></a>The amendments seek to allow post-charge questioning about a &#147;related terrorism offence&#148; where the related offence is connected to the same set of facts on which the person subject to post-charge questioning was charged. These amendments arise because there is a belief that it is not possible to question a suspect about an offence arising out of the same set of facts as those relating to an offence for which they have already been charged.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08101545000099"></a>The Government do not believe that this is correct. If a person has been charged with a terrorist offence, and if new evidence shows that the offence with which they are charged is insufficient to capture all the offending behaviour&#151;for example, conspiracy to murder turns out to have led to an actual murder&#151;the person can be re-arrested and interviewed for that new offence. That is not post-charge questioning but is normal  


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_744"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 744</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pre-charge questioning for the new offence. A problem could also arise if amendments to this effect were passed. Any such provision could undermine the police in their questioning of suspects in non-terrorism cases, as at present there are no statutory restrictions on their ability to question about other offences.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08101545000100"></a>Finally, the effect of these amendments could be to prevent questioning about the offence for which a person has been charged because of the insertion of the word &#147;related&#148; before the words &#147;terrorism offence&#148; in Clause 34(2). I hope that that explains why we do not believe that these amendments are necessary.</p>

He indicated that doubt had been expressed about whether, under both this clause and existing law, it was possible where the facts and circumstances were the same that they could give rise to different charges.

If it is a matter of a different offence, of course there is no problem, but that there might be some dubiety was raised with us. The amendments were tabled because we do not feel that such dubiety should exist. The Minister has said that he is satisfied that there is no grey area as such.

It is certainly something I do not know the answer to, but we will come to that amendment later on. On the amendments in this group, I should like to make it clear at the start that I am in no way opposed to post-charge questioning as such. As we all know, it already happens. Nor would I, as I thought the Liberal Democrats intended, confine post-charge questioning to related offences. For the reasons I have explained, I would allow such questioning in respect of offences for which the defendant has already been charged, but only in very limited circumstances. My great objection, therefore, is not to post-charge questioning as such, but to what is proposed in Clauses 34 to 36. I have no objection in principle, but I object to the way it is proposed to be carried out.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08101545000107"></a>In particular, I object to the proposal that post-charge questioning could be authorised by the police for a period of 24 hours, and I do so for two reasons. First, there is the obvious risk of oppression. The very idea that a suspect can be questioned for 28 days, can be charged and then questioned again by the same police officers over many days comprising the 24-hour period, even up to the very door of the court, would strike most people as oppressive or at least capable of becoming oppressive. On that ground alone, I urge the Committee to be cautious.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_745"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 745</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81015-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08101545000108"></a>Secondly, the provisions as they stand show, not for the first time, that the Government have failed to grasp one of the basic features of our criminal procedure. Once a suspect has been charged, he is no longer in the hands of the police. He has been handed over to the independent Crown Prosecution Service. In truth, he is no longer a suspect at all, but has become a party to proceedings launched by the Crown Prosecution Service in which the defendant&#151;for he is by then a defendant&#151;may well give evidence on his own behalf and sometimes will be the only witness on his own behalf. If the police, on their own authority, are to be entitled to ask the defendant further questions in order to test his evidence before the trial, surely it must follow that the defendant should himself be allowed to test the prosecution evidence before trial, otherwise the prosecution would have had a clearly unfair advantage and the defendant would not have a fair trial. Just as the extension of detention to 42 days, which we discussed on Monday, would be a clear infringement of his right under Article 5 of the convention, so post-charge questioning would clearly be an infringement of his rights to a fair trial under Article 6 of the convention if the clauses were to stand as drafted. That is the view which I believe our courts and Strasbourg would take if the matter were eventually tested there.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08101545000109"></a>What is to be done about these clauses? As authorisation by the police, for however short a time, is not acceptable for the reasons I have mentioned, and as it is clearly not a job for justices of the peace&#151;they would not welcome it&#151;the answer must be that the authorisation should come from a judge. That is the view of the Liberal Democrats, as one can see from Amendment No. 48; it is the view of the Scots lawyers, as one can see from Amendments Nos. 54A and 55, except that they refer to a sheriff rather than a judge; and it is also, of course, my view.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08101545000110"></a>If the authorisation is to be by a judge, it should be by a judge sitting in the Crown Court and not a High Court judge. This would have the great advantage that the Crown Court judge could go into all the facts at a preparatory hearing under Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, the Act which is referred to in the Bill. The purpose of Amendment No. 43 is to enable that to be done. At such a hearing, the judge could give directions as to the scope, the subject matter of the questions and the timing of the further questioning. Surely that is much better than having artificial limits placed upon the further questioning of 24 hours and five days, which would mean very little in such circumstances. I do not know what it would mean.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08101545000111"></a>So our judges, who are well used to dealing with such matters every day, would be dealing with the authorisation. It would surely be much better to rely on them to make sensible decisions in the light of the facts of a particular case; do not let us try to do the judges&#146; work for them. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 50 and, for those reasons, I would invite the House to accept the amendments in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08101545000112"></a>Let me turn now to my other amendments in the group. First, although, as I have said, I am in favour of expanding the scope of post-charge questioning, it should be confined to serious terrorist offences&#151;as,

The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and my noble friend Lord Onslow share the same spirit and objectives, but the view of these Benches is that the drafting of the amendments tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, is preferable.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08101545000114"></a>It is fair to say that there is considerable support in this Committee for post-charge questioning, but there is also a desire to ensure that it does not become oppressive and that there can be no accusation of impropriety in the investigation process. Many of the amendments before us endeavour to put in place judicial supervision of post-charge questioning. In another place, the Government made concessions on this and on the supervisory regime, but like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and other noble Lords, we do not think they are sufficient. I echo the sentiment that has been expressed that if judicial authority is required to extend pre-charge detention, it must similarly apply in the case of post-charge questioning. We do not think it is right that the police should, on their own authority, be able to go on questioning a defendant, even for 24 hours only. There is a question about the meaning of 24 hours.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08101545000115"></a>In this context, the amendments before us are concerned with what constitutes a sufficient level of judicial authority. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, we do not think that a justice of the peace is sufficient. It would be right for it to be a judge of the Crown Court. It seems desirable that a judge who is likely to try the case should authorise and supervise the post-charge questioning. That is likely to be a Crown Court judge. Our reasons for thinking that is right are identical to those set out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08101545000116"></a>There are other questions that, depending on the Minister&#146;s response, we would like to ask about the time periods and what triggers them. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, our preference is to put the supervision in the hands of the supervising judge and allow him discretion about how long it should continue and in what manner, rather than the time periods being set out in the legislation. I say that because there are questions about their meaning. Depending on what the Minister says, I might want to revert to that if he is not inclined to accept the procedure suggested by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08101545000117"></a>On a more general point, I do not think that this legislation is the place to set out the detail of the safeguards. On the next amendment, I will speak to the question of how they might be set out in the PACE codes.</p>

I should be grateful if he could explain to the Committee what his response is to the arguments put forward by Professor Cape and if the Minister would also do so. Professor Cape&#146;s proposition was that with post-charge questioning the person who is charged is placed at a severe disadvantage, particularly if a negative inference would be drawn from him exercising his right to silence. Professor Cape made the point that a defendant cross-examined at trial has the benefit of legal representation and will have received prior disclosure of the evidence on which the prosecution intends to rely and of unused material. He suggests that post-charge questioning is in breach of Article 6 of the ECHR, to which the noble and learned Lord referred just now, under which a defendant is entitled to know the case against him.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08101545000119"></a>My concern would be that with the extension of post-charge questioning that is proposed in the Bill, the balance of justice may be tilted too far towards the prosecution. I do not understand why the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, is satisfied that this would be acceptable if it was authorised by a judge. It still seems to me that there is a risk&#151;indeed, a probability&#151;that the balance of justice at a subsequent trial would have been tilted adversely and unfairly.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08101545000277"></a>&#147;Post-charge questioning may only take place in the presence of the defendant&#146;s lawyer&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101545000266"></a>We suggest that the post-charge questioning should be video-recorded and that the judge who authorised it,</p>
<ul><a name="08101545000290"></a>&#147;shall review the transcript of the questioning after it has taken place, to ensure that it remained within the scope of questioning under subsection (2) and was completed within the time allowed under subsection (3)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101545000267"></a>That seems to make complete sense. If the judge allows questioning on evidence which is brand new, it must be very tempting sometimes for an interrogating offer to move to the edges and to bring something up and try it. That is an important judicial safeguard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08101545000123"></a>We also propose that post-charge questioning should not be allowed before the beginning of the trial. I remember the noble and learned Lord speaking about the possibility of somebody being interrogated on the steps of the court. That is obviously totally unsatisfactory.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08101545000124"></a>I am not completely wedded to the exact wording of the amendment proposed by members of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, but I am certainly wedded to the principles which it encompasses.</p>

The defendant may not always choose to be represented by a lawyer. What, in that event, will happen?</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="08101545000126"></a><a name="81015-0003.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="81015-0003.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08101545000386"></a>The Earl of Onslow:</b> I know that some people refuse to be represented by lawyers, but it is surely right to have a lawyer present. If the defendant says that he does not want a lawyer present, I suspect that there is nothing that anybody can do about it, and I do not think that you can force lawyers on people. Here, I am thinking on my feet and hoping that the answers that I am giving to the noble Lord are accurate. However, the defendant must have the right to have a lawyer present while he is being interrogated after he has been charged.</p>

It is recognition of that which requires some action to be taken to ensure that if post-charge questioning is to be used, it is done under circumstances in which those disadvantages do not arise. That is why I find the general trend of the amendments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, to be entirely satisfactory. If the case were to come before a Crown Court judge, he would have an opportunity to consider that in deciding whether it should be allowed in the first place, and if it were to be allowed, under what conditions, including such things as are suggested in the amendment put forward by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Those are all possibilities that the judge could have in mind.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08101545000128"></a>While I accept that risks are sometimes involved, I think that there are also sometimes advantages, so long as there are adequate safeguards for the fairness of the ultimate trial. The judge would have a degree of control over what kind of approach could be made to the prosecution in relation to disclosure of the Crown case before questioning of that kind was allowed in some circumstances. To have a police superintendent in charge at the stage of post charge is wrong in principle, for the reasons that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, explained. A Crown Court judge would have sufficient power, authority and, generally speaking, experience to be able to decide whether the risks involved in a particular case were too great, in which case he would think that they should not be allowed. If, on the other hand, he thought that there were adequate safeguards to secure a proper trial, he would make the necessary arrangements to ensure that that should happen. I therefore generally support the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and I hope that the Minister will feel inclined to move in that direction.</p>

I share the concerns and caution expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. In going down the road of post-charge questioning, one must proceed with caution, which is why it is important that, in accepting the principle, as we do from these Benches, we should make sure that adequate and proper safeguards are in place. That is why our amendments cover very much the same ground as those of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, in, first, trying to ensure that the initial authorisation is judicial and not from the police. It is my understanding of the position&#151;it may be where the Government are coming from on this&#151;that the first 24 hours after arrest allow questioning without judicial authorisation, but it is stating the obvious that there is a world of a difference between the position of someone who has just been arrested and someone who has been charged. Therefore, there is no necessity for the initial authorisation to be by a police officer, not least given the fact that, if the questioning is to continue after 24 hours, a presentation and a case would have to be made to a judicial authority in any event. That would not in any way compromise or harm the questioning and the investigation taking place.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08101545000130"></a>The other amendments, specifically Amendment No. 49, add two issues which would have to be taken into account by the judicial authority before authorisation was given. In addition to the ones set out in the Bill, we propose that the judge must be satisfied that in the case of questioning under subsection (2) there are reasonable grounds for believing that it was appropriate to bring the original charge. That might be thought to be stating the obvious, but it reflects concerns that allowing post-charge questioning could allow for an inappropriate charge to enable detention on remand during an ongoing investigation into more serious terrorist activity. It may be that the lesser charge is wholly appropriate, but it is not an unreasonable requirement that the judge should be satisfied that the original charges were, in the circumstances of the case, appropriate.</p>

<a name="81015-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08101545000131"></a>Secondly, the judge must also be satisfied that further questioning would not be oppressive. It might again be argued that that would be unnecessary, due to the requirement that the questioning must be in the interests of justice; but the fact that it might be in the interests of justice to question does not mean that, perhaps cumulatively, it could not add up to oppression of the person who was to be questioned. There should be robust judicial safeguards importing considerations of oppressiveness if we are to go down the route of allowing post-charge questioning. In those circumstances, we would support the amendments proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I have already indicated the grounds underlying the amendments standing in my name and in the name of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford.</p>

In his absence, I ask my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern whether I am right in thinking that Clause 35, which applies to Scotland and which shows that the sheriff is responsible for supervising post-charge questioning in Scotland, does not meet the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. I think that he mentioned that, but I am not absolutely sure whether I followed him correctly. The sheriff is, of course, a judge&#151;the equivalent of a Crown Court judge, as I understand it. So I believe that the point being made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, is met in Clause 35. Will my noble and learned friend put me right if I am wrong on that?</p>

Certainly, the clause applying to Scotland involves judicial intervention at a particular stage&#151;the sheriff being the nearest Scottish equivalent to a Crown Court judge. Of course, the superintendent comes into it as well. The amendment proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, deals with that in a way that is not quite consistent with what is in this Bill for Scotland. However, although I await with interest what the Minister says, it is a little difficult for the Government to say that in Scotland there should be judicial intervention in this process when in England that is said to be unnecessary. In a way that could be defended by saying that a justice of the peace will be taken into account, as if he or she were a professional judge. I support the magistrates very much, but there is some question whether that would be an appropriate cross-over.</p>

I, too, was delayed unavoidably. I shall be brief, but it might be useful to put the point of view of someone who at one stage was responsible for managing some major investigations when the law on post-charge questioning was often quite opaque. I fully support what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has put before us today for offences that are concerned only with terrorism, involve new evidence, are authorised by a judge and have the safeguards of the accused paramount. I need say no more because everything that I would have said has already been covered, but I fully support the amendment.</p>

As has been pointed out, the professional judge is involved in Scotland, so it is strange that that necessity is not to be found in each of the clauses dealing with post-charge questioning in England and Northern Ireland. No doubt the Minister can explain that dynamic. However, in general I give my full support to what has been proposed in the amendments by the noble and learned Lord with regard to England and Wales, observing that they have some support elsewhere in the Bill as it stands.</p>

I will deal with the first batch first rather than moving straight to Amendment No. 60 and talking about legal support and such things.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08101545000139"></a>The majority of these amendments alter the mechanism for authorisation for post-charge questioning. Amendments Nos. 46 and 45 would remove the ability of a police superintendent to authorise the first 24 hours in England and Wales. Amendments Nos. 47, 50, 52, 43, 45, 48 and 68 would require a judge to authorise post-charge questioning rather than a justice of the peace as the Bill states at present.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08101545000140"></a>We believe that the police should authorise the first 24-hour period of post-charge questioning because such questioning may need to take place urgently&#151;for example, if someone had just been arrested and charged and the police believed that the suspect had information relevant to potential further terrorist activity. It should also be noted that at present judicial authorisation is not required for other forms of post-charge questioning or if a suspect is interviewed in connection with another offence.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08101545000141"></a>We also consider that it would be more appropriate for a justice of the peace, rather than a judge, to decide whether to grant further periods of post-charge questioning. We believe that for two reasons. First, a justice of the peace, unlike a judge, is available at all times and so can be asked to authorise questioning urgently, which may be important for the reason previously explained. Secondly, a requirement for a judge to authorise questioning could lead to lengthy proceedings, which could be tantamount to the trial for the offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08101545000145"></a>Amendment No. 49 would add two further conditions that a judge, as a result of the previous amendments, would need to be satisfied are met before they could authorise post-charge questioning. They would need to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the original charge was appropriate and that further questioning would not be oppressive. We do not consider that these amendments are necessary, as the rights of the suspect will be protected. If the questioning of a suspect after charge was deemed by a court during a subsequent trial to be oppressive, the court could refuse to admit any evidence obtained under provisions in Sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. That is not in the interests of the prosecution.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08101545000146"></a>Amendment No. 42 would mean that post-charge questioning would be possible only for a &#147;serious terrorist offence&#148;, which is defined in Clause 24(4). This would in effect mean that it would be possible to post-charge question an individual only for an offence where the maximum sentence was life; it would remove the ability to post-charge question about terrorism offences such as weapons training or terrorist finance offences. The Government do not believe that this should be the case.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08101545000147"></a>Amendment No. 53 would remove Clause 34(7). The subsection means that Clause 34 does not prevent PACE codes of practice from making provision for other types of post-charge questioning. At present, PACE Code C makes provision for post-charge police interviews of defendants to clarify earlier statements where public safety is at risk or where new evidence comes to light and it is in the interests of justice. If this subsection were to be deleted, this would no longer be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08101545000148"></a>Amendment No. 68 would prevent post-charge questioning after the commencement of trial. The Government do not believe that the Bill should make express provision for this, as there may be situations when questioning after the commencement of a trial is unavoidable, such as to prevent the person from causing injury to others or, if a retrial were to occur&#151;</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08101545000151"></a>In these cases, every effort would be made for discussions with the suspect, or his or her legal representatives, in order to minimise any disruption to the court process. Guidance on this is covered in the draft codes of practice, which make it absolutely clear that police and prosecutors should seek to avoid post-charge questioning that may limit or restrict the ability of the person, or his or her defence, to prepare adequately for court proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08101545000152"></a>Amendment No. 68 would also require the presence of the defendant&#146;s lawyer before questioning could take place. The Government accept that all those

However, we are concerned that the text of the proposed new clause would allow a suspect to veto questioning, as they could simply refuse to allow a lawyer to represent their interests.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08101545000153"></a>Amendment No. 68 would also confine the questioning to new evidence that had become available since the accused person was charged. The Government believe that it would not be appropriate or practical to confine post-charge questioning to new evidence that had become available following charge. To do so could make all post-charge questioning subject to challenge on the basis of whether the evidence was available at charge. We also consider that there may be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to question the suspect about evidence available pre-charge; for example, analysis of evidence collected after charge could cast a new light on evidence that was available pre-charge.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08101545000154"></a>The amendment would limit post-charge questioning to a maximum of five days in total. The Government accept that the circumstances in which it would be necessary to post-charge question for a period of more than five days are limited. However, if the circumstances were to arise&#151;for example, if there were to be an exceptionally complex plot&#151;the Government believe that it should be possible to post-charge question for a period of more than five days. It should be noted that any questioning beyond a period of 24 hours would need to be authorised by a justice of the peace, on the basis that further questioning is necessary in the interest of justice and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The amendment would also require all post-charge questioning to be video-recorded. The Government accept that this should be the case; indeed, Clause 37 of the Bill requires it.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08101545000155"></a>Finally, we believe that judicial review of the transcripts of post-charge questioning is unnecessary, as the trial judge could refuse to allow prosecution evidence if they believed it to have been obtained by unfair questioning. This would include confessions obtained through the oppression of the suspect. It is also unclear what actions a judge reviewing a transcript would undertake should they find discrepancies.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08101545000156"></a>We are satisfied that post-charge questioning complies with Article 6 of the European convention, in the same way that negative inference in pre-charge questioning has been held to be compatible.</p>

I have a simple point. Let us leave aside for a moment judicial review&#151;I understand the point made by the noble Lord. As regards Amendment No. 68, provided that it is made totally plain that the matter is within the total discretion of the judiciary, there is no problem. However, it is not good enough to say that on the Floor of the House; it has to be made clear in the Bill that the judiciary has total discretion in that matter.</p>

As regards what damage could be caused, I say to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, that the sort of thing about which we are thinking, which is picked up in PACE Code C, is if an arrested person has information about the location of a bomb. On that basis, I ask that the amendments not be pressed.</p>

Rather than detailing the respects in which I found it particularly unsatisfactory, however, I say only that I am not sure that the noble Lord appreciates quite how serious the proposed measures are. He has made no attempt to explain to the Committee how authorisation by the police to go on questioning up to the door of the court could possibly be reconciled with a fair trial and could possibly therefore be consistent with Article 6 of the convention. No doubt he will consider that point before the next stage, but I will certainly bring the matter back then.</p>

Of course, I am aware that there is a risk of tilting the balance too far against the defendant. I would be the last person to want to do that. Ensuring that post-charge questioning is controlled by the judge, as I believe it should be, is the best way of ensuring justice, both for the prosecution, when it wants to bring back other matters, and for the defendant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08101545000165"></a>Many of the things in the amendment tabled by the noble Earl are already covered one way or another. I entirely agree with him that post-charge questioning must be judicially authorised in advance and that it is not judicially authorised in that sense if it is authorised only by a magistrate. I do not agree with him that it should be limited to a certain number of days; it is much better to leave that to the judge. I half agree with him about limiting the matters on which the defendant can be questioned to new evidence that has come to light, but I am sure that the judge will have that matter very much in mind, whether authorising that further line of questioning or not.</p>

I had hoped not to have to cover much of this ground, because I had hoped that the Minister&#146;s answer on the framework for post-charge questioning  


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_756"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 756</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would render a lot of my questions unnecessary. I had hoped that we would hear that the PACE codes would be redrafted in the light of a new framework. Given that the Minister has resisted the possibility of accepting these amendments for the moment, I should raise the issues that arise out of the latest PACE codes that have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="81015-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08101545000175"></a>I want briefly to focus on four issues that relate to the draft amendments to the codes for authorising post-charge questioning. First, do the PACE codes make, or need to make, provision for post-charge questioning on a further offence when that questioning is based on the same evidence, not new evidence? The codes are not clear on this point&#151;an issue that remains active in the light of our previous discussion.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81015-0005.htm"/>


<a name="81015-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08101545000176"></a>Secondly, are the provisions in paragraph 15.12 of PACE code H, which is concerned with the dates for attending court and court hearings, strong enough to ensure a fair trial? The code states that police and prosecutors should seek to avoid post-charge questioning taking place which may limit or restrict the ability for the person or his or her defence to prepare adequately for court proceedings. The code continues on the point that has just been referred to by my noble friend Lord Onslow, and states that there may be situations when this is unavoidable, and in those cases every effort should be made to discuss with the suspect or his or her legal representatives in order to minimise any disruption to the court process.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08101545000177"></a>Can the Minister tell us why the practice of post-charge questioning should not cease before the trial? Can it really go on during the trial? The PACE codes clearly reflect that possibility, which is not right. There is a broader point, raised in Amendment No. 68 by my noble friend Lord Onslow on the potential oppressiveness of post-charge questioning.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08101545000178"></a>Finally, what are the differences between the texts that the Government have laid in each House? One was placed in the Library of the other place on 3 June by the then Minister of State for policing, crime and security, and the other was placed in the Library of this House on 8 October. There are discrepancies which, given that we do not where we might end up on post-charge questioning, remain live issues.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08101545000179"></a>Why is it no longer the case that the authorisation of post-charge questioning by a superintendent must be made in conjunction with the prosecutor? Why, unlike the version of 3 June, do the draft amendments make no mention of how to treat any break in detention periods? This is a troubling issue which I have not raised previously. What is the definition of 24 hours? We will have to revert to that issue if we cannot reach agreement on judicial supervision. Finally, why, unlike the version of 3 June, do the draft amendments before this House make no mention of how detention periods relate to a person released on bail or on remand pending attendance at a court?</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08101545000180"></a>This is a probing amendment. Whatever the outcome of these issues, we need a single draft text from the Government on the relevant provisions of the PACE codes, instead of two texts that have discrepancies between them. This House should be satisfied as to

However, it seems that the Minister is in a difficult position here because at the same time he is dealing with the arrest and subsequent questioning of a suspect and with what I would have thought would be the Ministry of Justice&#146;s brief on how justice should be applied. Perhaps that explained his difficulty in answering the questions about JPs and judges. If a Minister from the Ministry of Justice is not here to answer some of these questions, it seems that the Home Office will be in the position of being both prosecutor and judge.</p>

A number of the issues that she mentioned went back to amendments that we dealt with earlier. This amendment concerns the removal of subsection (6). I take her point about two versions of the codes having been placed in the Libraries. I have to say that I was not aware of the difference between the two, so perhaps I may come back to her on that. I assume that the later version is the current one but I will make absolutely certain of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08101545000183"></a>As the noble Baroness said, a draft of amendments to PACE code H to provide for post-charge questioning has been laid in the Library, and I shall ascertain which is the correct version. As I said, I assume it is the later one but I hope that the Box will let me know shortly. It sets out significant safeguards for the rights of suspects subject to post-charge questioning, including the right to access to legal representation during questioning. Therefore, the Government think that it is important to maintain the subsection and we would ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08101545000191"></a>At present, when a person is questioned after charge, he must be given a fresh caution which does not include any reference to inferences which may be drawn from anything that he says or does not say. That is provided in code C, paragraph 16.4, with which I do not expect the noble Lord to be in any way familiar, but that is the law as it stands. The suspect does not have to be told that inferences may be drawn from what he says or does not say. That became the position following an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 as a result of a decision of the European Court of Human Rights in a case called Murray in 1996. That is why we find code C, paragraph 16.4 in the form in which it is.</p>

The Director of Public Prosecutions made it clear in his evidence to the Committee in another place that the ability to draw adverse inferences will be a key part of the effectiveness of post-charge questioning, and without it the suspect would simply refuse to answer questions with impunity. The subsections currently included in the Bill would mean that the position on drawing adverse inferences during post-charge questioning would be the same as for pre-charge questioning. The same right to silence will apply to post-charge questioning as it does in the case of questioning before charge.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08101545000194"></a>With respect to Scotland, it will not be possible for adverse inferences to be drawn from the accused&#146;s silence in post-charge questioning because this inference does not exist under Scots law which, as we know, is often different from ours. While it may limit the effectiveness of post-charge questioning in Scotland, we believe that there is still merit in being able to put evidence available following charge to suspects as their responses may clarify matters in relation not only to their case but of others. I shall get back to the noble and learned Lord on the other points that he raised, but I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</p>

To be fair, she expressed some degree of scepticism with regard to the effect and benefit of this clause in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08101545000204"></a>In accepting the Minister&#146;s point that no inference from silence can be drawn north of the border, the Lord Advocate said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08101545000292"></a>&#147;the existence of post-charge questioning without an adverse inference from silence, which, of course, we do not have in Scotland either, is somewhat less valuable in Scotland than it would be in England and Wales&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> Commons, Counter-Terrorism Bill Committee, 22/4/08; col. 90.]</ul>
<p><a name="08101545000268"></a>That distinction is important.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08101545000205"></a>Another important difference between the two jurisdictions, highlighted by the Lord Advocate, was that post-charge disclosure could be counter-productive. She said that there is a danger of questioning too much. It may be the same south of the border; certainly by post-charge questioning there will have been disclosure by the Crown. The Lord Advocate said that, if it is post-petition, there will have been post-charge disclosure of the statements that form the basis of the Crown case. If you approach the accused with questioning, he will be able at that stage more intricately to link his answers to what he knows to be the state of evidence. Therefore, he may well be able to give answers that exculpate him rather than incriminate him.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08101545000206"></a>There are differences between the two jurisdictions and the benefits of post-charge questioning in Scotland are perhaps more doubtful. It is very important that the structure of post-charge questioning must take into account the varying tradition and structure of Scottish law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08101545000207"></a>Amendment No. 54A would delete subsection (4), which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08101545000282"></a>&#147;A constable may question a person under subsection (2) or (3) at any time up to the commencement of the trial&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08101545000269"></a>When we dealt with amendments about the position in England and Wales, we mentioned that allowing questioning right up to the door of the court is itself highly questionable. I know that that particular subsection does not appear in the provisions for England and Wales, or in those for Northern Ireland. It may be in other provisions or in the PACE codes, but we are entitled to know why that provision is present in the Scottish clause but does not appear in the clause that relates to England and Wales, Clause 34, or to Northern Ireland, Clause 36. The Minister's elucidation of that point would be very welcome.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08101545000208"></a>I may have misheard the Minister, but perhaps he will confirm whether he said when we were debating an earlier amendment that there might even be the possibility of post-charge questioning between trial and retrial. The subsection may give a safeguard to the accused person, but we require some explanation.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08101545000209"></a>Amendment No. 55 deletes the authorisation by the police superintendent for the first 24 hours of questioning. I shall not rehearse the arguments produced when we discussed the similar position in England and Wales, other than to say that, standing on what I said about where the person who is being committed is under the protection of the court, it is the court's duty to see that nothing is done by the police that will prejudice his trial. We are going one step too far by allowing a police superintendent, off his or her own bat&#151;no doubt with cause in his or her eyes&#151;to seek that authorisation when a person is already under the protection of the court. If the person is under the protection of the court, the proper person from whom that authority should be sought is the court.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08101545000210"></a>The point has already been made that in Scotland that will be done by a sheriff, a professional judge. I do not think that the House was satisfied by the Minister's answer about why that was to be done in England and Wales by a lay magistrate. We have lay magistrates in Scotland. If the Minister has had an opportunity to get an explanation of why a professional judge is required in Scotland but not in England and Wales, it would be very interesting to hear from him when he replies.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08101545000211"></a>Another point&#151;former Lords Advocate present may want to comment on this&#151;is that criminal investigation in Scotland is ultimately under the direction of the Lord Advocate or the Procurator Fiscal, who is the Lord Advocate&#146;s appointee. It is unusual, to say the least, for a police officer, albeit a very senior police officer, to authorise questioning when, by that stage, the responsibility for the direction of the investigation rests on the shoulders of the Lord Advocate. It gives rise to the suspicion that full account was not taken of the structure of criminal justice in Scotland when the clause was put together. At the very least we should have an explanation of why it was thought appropriate to cut the Lord Advocate out of the process set out in the clause. Our primary position is that it is not a matter for the police. From the very beginning, authorisation should be sought from the court. I beg to move.</p>

I, like the noble Lord, was surprised to find the reference to questioning up to the commencement of the trial in this part of the Bill and not in relation to England. I put two large question marks against subsection (4) when I read it. It shows how extreme the proposals are that are now being put before the Committee, but it is enough to say that I entirely support the deletion of that subsection.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08101545000213"></a>I also support Amendments Nos. 55 and 56, for all the reasons that have been mentioned. I do not support Amendments Nos. 57 and 59 so strongly because I still do not like the idea of a time limit on questioning. I would much prefer to leave that to the discretion of the judge in the Crown Court.</p>

In Scotland, the accused is under the protection of the court, as he has said, and interference in the rights of the accused may be manifest at the point of questioning. In particular, Amendment No. 55, which would remove the role of the constable and the superintendent, is appropriate, because it would place the whole duty to protect the accused on to the shoulders of the sheriff, where it should properly reside, and not on to those of the police officer.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08101545000215"></a>The noble Lord is also right to point out the role of the Lord Advocate in Scotland and the fact that the criminal investigation of the offence is under her and the procurator fiscal acting on her commission. Have any discussions been held with the Lord Advocate on the way in which the clause will operate, and will any guidance or instructions be issued by the Lord Advocate to police officers on the operation of Clause 35(5)(a)? In other words, will it be incumbent on the superintendent to seek the authority of the Lord Advocate before authorising the officer conducting the questioning? I might be more comfortable if it is, although full protection should still be there, but I am very uneasy about the position in which this leaves the accused in Scotland.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08101545000216"></a>Moreover, allowing the questioning of a person right up to the commencement of the trial is invidious. As the trial gets nearer, the pressure on the accused, and on those advising and representing him, becomes even more acute. If that preparation for the trial, both mentally and in terms of advising and consulting with legal advisers, is to be interrupted by questions from police officers about the matters that are going to trial, that is to be deplored.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08101545000217"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to give some reassurance on those points and will be able to take them away to look at the implications of the Government&#146;s position on these important matters.</p>

The rights of a person charged are the same in whichever of the three jurisdictions

One would therefore expect to look at each of the clauses dealing with the rights of the charged person and find that they have been dealt with, as far as procedure is concerned, in precisely the same way and are protected in precisely the same way.</p>

<a name="81015-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08101545000219"></a>I have already made the point that in the Scottish provisions there is reference to the judge. There is no such provision in England or Northern Ireland. In Scotland there is a right, apparently, to question up to the commencement of trial, but not in England and Northern Ireland. These three clauses seem to have been drafted under completely different circumstances without any regard for the underlying rights of the individual who is subject to post-charge questioning. No doubt, because of the different procedures in each of the three jurisdictions, these matters have to be dealt with separately, but the effect should be the same throughout. Therefore, I support entirely the thrust of these amendments so far as they affect Scotland, but on a much more general basis.</p>

I am not a lawyer and I find the discussion on the precise procedures difficult. But I am clear on what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, has just said. The rights of people wherever they are are the same, wherever they are charged, and they should be respected in the Bill. Will the Minister consider these matters and consult his colleagues in Scotland, as well as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and perhaps write in some detail to those of us who have taken part in this matter? How do the Government justify the differences in the way in which people are treated, not in the procedures or on how the traditions in the different parts of the country are manifest, but on rights? How do the Government justify that those rights should be different in Scotland from those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the Minister agree to do that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08101545000224"></a>On Amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 58 concerning the police, I think that this applies in England, Wales and Scotland. Letting a police superintendent authorise the first 24-hour period of post-charge questioning, as I discussed on the amendments concerning England and Wales, is important. It is important that questioning should proceed quickly and with urgency once the charges have been laid. We do not need authorisation for other forms of post-charge questioning and we do not need to do it if we have other evidence or it is in connection with another offence. I would prefer to leave those provisions in the Bill and for the amendments to be withdrawn. We discussed this with the Lord Advocate, but I do not know the full details. My noble and learned friend Lord Boyd asked whether the superintendent would get approval from the Lord Advocate, and I shall come back to him on the next occasion. I also take to heart the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. Some inconsistencies here need to be resolved.</p>

Will he reflect on that because it is by no means certain that a court would be able accurately to identify whether or not the circumstances of the questioning were oppressive? As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, it is readily foreseeable that oppression will occur in those circumstances when a police officer is doing it.

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08101545000242"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a brief amendment to raise the question of why the extension to five days is in the Bill. This amendment makes the period three days. I confess that a period of three days is as arbitrary as one of five days, but when something impinges upon the position of someone who has been charged with an offence and is awaiting trial, right up to the door of the court, we should hold the Government to account about why they want the longer period. This is a probing amendment to find out why this period was chosen as opposed to a shorter one. I beg to move.</p>

Normally the sheriff would grant another 24 hours. We felt that if a case were really complex&#151;and we have had a number of debates about how complex some of these terrorist cases can be&#151;more days would be required. That is why we arrived at five days, which we think is about right. The period would normally be extended in 24-hour blocks. Five days is only an estimate by the professionals of the time that would be required in a very complex case. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08101545000284"></a> Clause 35, page 24, line 22, at end insert &#147;, and</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08101545000248"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment inserts into Clause 35 a requirement that a person subject to post-charge questioning has access to legal advice throughout the questioning. The Government may argue that that would happen anyway, but I do not see any harm in having that in the Bill. This amendment takes account of Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides that everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right,</p>
<ul><a name="08101545000293"></a>&#147;to defend himself ... through legal assistance of his own choosing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101545000270"></a>When we are dealing with post-charge questioning, it is important to ensure that it is fully compliant with the ECHR. In this clause, we are talking about someone who has been charged and is entitled to the continuation of the court&#146;s protection. We believe that the best way of achieving those policy objectives is to ensure that there is adequate access to legal advice. I beg to move.</p>

That is subject to the condition that the solicitor&#146;s behaviour during the interview will not interfere with, or obstruct, the conduct of the interview.

<a name="81015-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08101545000255"></a>There does not appear to be any comparable provision with regard to post-charge questioning in Scotland, partly, of course, because we do not have the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that guidance should be issued, a matter referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, in an earlier debate. I have raised the issue with the present Lord Advocate, who confirmed in a letter of 6 August that her officials were considering this. I subsequently wrote and asked about possible publication of any guidance. In her reply of 6 October, she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08101545000288"></a>&#147;The guidance being considered in relation to the post-charge questioning provisions of the Bill will be developed to reflect the legislation once it is enacted. Given that there may yet be more amendments to the provisions of the Bill, in my view it would be premature to consider publishing guidance at this stage but I can again confirm that such guidance will be developed and issued to the police. I do not anticipate placing the guidance before Parliament&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101545000272"></a>That is a welcome assurance from the Lord Advocate, but given that there is a comparable requirement in law on how post-charge questioning will take place in England and Wales on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the other, it would be helpful for similar statutory provision to be made for that guidance in Scotland. It is my understanding&#151;no doubt I will be readily corrected if I am wrong&#151;that codes of guidance under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act are promulgated by way of statutory instrument. I am not seeking that, but it would be very helpful to have guidance issued by the Lord Advocate to reflect some of the concerns that have been raised in our debates on this clause and very helpful indeed if that were enshrined in statute. I beg to move.</p>

Why are these issues subject to codes of guidance, which have a proper grounding in statute in England and Wales, yet when it comes to Scotland the Government are prepared to leave it? I do not for one moment doubt the good will of the Lord Advocate but there is no statutory grounding for this. I shall not press this for the moment but I ask the Minister to discuss it further with the Scottish law officers.

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08101555000032"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 40 deals with the universal jurisdiction, allowing a prosecution to take place in any part of the United Kingdom notwithstanding the locus of the offence. As I said at Second Reading, I do not necessarily object to that in principle, as it could in some cases make good sense. However, if we are going to do it, it is important that we examine the measure carefully&#151;and an amendment to which I shall speak later makes provision for guidance on it to be issued by the respective law officers. A number of important consequences can arise from the choice of jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08101555000033"></a>Sometimes there is a mantra&#151;I notice that it was used by the Lord Advocate when she appeared before the Public Bill Committee that dealt with the Bill in another place&#151;that this is just doing what was done by the Explosive Substances Act 1883. I think that we now have four distinguished former Lord Advocates in the Chamber, and I will bow to them, but I have looked at this and there is certainly no section in that Act comparable to what we find in this clause. Section 7 of the 1883 Act says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08101555000212"></a>&#147;If any person is charged before a justice with any crime under this Act, no further proceeding shall be taken against such person without the consent of the Attorney General, except such as the justice may think necessary by remand, or otherwise, to secure the safe custody of such person&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000192"></a>Section 9(2) of the Act says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08101555000213"></a>&#147;In the application of this Act to Scotland the following modifications shall be made ... The expression &#145;Attorney General&#146; shall be deemed to mean the Lord Advocate, and in the case of his inability or a vacancy in the office, Her Majesty&#146;s Solicitor General for Scotland&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000193"></a>Far from bestowing a universal jurisdiction, it is arguable that it made very clear the distinction between the two jurisdictions.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08101555000034"></a>I understand that the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 has provision for universal jurisdiction but, while no one minimises for a moment the importance or seriousness of VAT fraud, there is a difference between that and the serious terrorism offences that we are discussing in the context of this Bill. Certainly,  


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_771"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 771</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it would not be possible to lock up a company for 140 days or longer under the Customs and Excise Management Act.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08101555000035"></a>It is important that we make it clear what the structure is and what the arrangements are if this universal jurisdiction is to be invoked. Of course, there are significant differences, depending on whether a person has to face trial north or south of the border. We have just discussed post-charge questioning, and it was obvious that there are differences in the procedures to be followed for post-charge questioning north and south of the border. In spite of the Minister&#146;s saying that he wishes to see consistency, as the Bill stands it is inconsistent; yet a person has some right to know whether and at what stage that jurisdiction is being transferred, either to the north or to the south, so they know what regime would apply with regard to post-charge questioning&#151;and that is why we need a written agreement.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08101555000036"></a>Once a person is committed in Scotland the indictment has to be served within 80 days, and the trial has to commence within 140 days. There is no such provision in England and Wales. But if there is to be a transfer of jurisdiction, surely the person committed is entitled to know which safeguards of the Scottish criminal law with regard to days in custody before the trial commences will apply. I shall be very careful in my remarks about a current trial regarding events in Glasgow on 30 June last year. I shall simply observe as a matter of fact that that trial, which started last week, was 466 days after the person was arrested. The trial of someone arrested and committed for trial in Scotland would have had to commence within 140 days of the person being committed.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08101555000037"></a>There is a working assumption, although it is never expressed, that the flow will be one way&#151;that a person committing an offence in Scotland will be taken south and tried south of the border. Perhaps your Lordships would like to consider the possibility of the flow being in the other direction. If an offence were committed in England and the person was arrested, charged and sent to Scotland for trial, the right of habeas corpus would not apply. On Monday the Committee heard much about the importance of Magna Carta, and I am sure that the safeguards available to the subject in 1688 or 1689 resonate just as much with your Lordships today. Yet we appear to be willing to concede without anything other than a handshake between the Lord Advocate and the Attorney-General that a person's right to the protection of habeas corpus can be dismissed when a person is sent north to Scotland for trial.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08101555000038"></a>These are important issues of principle here. As I say, it may be in the best interests of justice that a universal jurisdiction should apply. However, if we are going to establish one, then we must be very clear that it has the concurrence of both law officers, and the accused should know when that happens. If a written consent is given, then there will be a moment in time when that happens. The Government may be reluctant to hedge round the provision with criteria, as the ends of justice could be thwarted if someone sought a judicial review, but neither this amendment nor a later one to which I shall speak seeks to do that. Rather, the amendment would ensure that there is some structure about transferring jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08101555000039"></a>Amendments Nos. 72 and 78 are all-embracing for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, whereas Amendment No. 77 simply deals with transfer from Scotland to another part of the United Kingdom requiring the consent of the Lord Advocate, who is responsible for prosecutions in Scotland. In some respects the amendments are alternatives. The one that is all-embracing as a matter of principle is probably better but the point is made by both. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="08101555000040"></a><a name="81015-0007.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="81015-0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08101555000290"></a>Lord Fraser of Carmyllie:</b> There are three distinguished Lord Advocates in this Committee as well as myself. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, in some respects but would like to question some points of detail. I would be grateful if the Government could indicate the principles.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08101555000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is absolutely correct when he says that this clause introduces into our law a universality of jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. As he also correctly says, that is not unprecedented; it goes back for more than 100 years. However, Clause 40(1) indicates that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08101555000214"></a>&#147;Where an offence to which this section applies is committed in the United Kingdom ... proceedings for the offence may be taken at any place in the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000042"></a>We then discover in Clause 40(2) the offences to which this provision applies. Helpfully, in Section 51 of the Terrorism Act 2000, we find that parking a vehicle in contravention of a restriction is such that it could be tried in, say, England. Let us say that there is a difficult granny in Wick who parks her car in contravention of a restriction at the harbour. As I understand the provision, she could find herself subjected to prosecution in Bristol. If I have misunderstood that, I would be grateful if someone could explain it to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08101555000043"></a>The more difficult point which the noble Lord raised remains unclear. What is a &#147;law officer&#148;? It may seem a rather obvious point but, as I understand it, the Government are proposing&#151;although the Select Committee has rejected the notion&#151;that the law officer of the day in England should be a non-political person. That is certainly the direction of movement in England. What is troubling me is that if the Government accept the proposal&#151;I do not know if they will&#151;that the Attorney-General of the day should remain a political law officer, and in Scotland, for example, the Lord Advocate becomes someone who is simply the senior and best lawyer in the Civil Service, then I cannot envisage circumstances in which that senior civil servant lawyer will not defer to the political law officer, the Attorney-General in England. That would seem to be absolutely in line with all the precedents that we have seen. I am afraid that the noble Lord is absolutely correct. It is likely in such circumstances that any offence committed in Scotland could in fact be tried in England. That seems to open up a can of worms, particularly at a time of jurisdictional and devolutionary issues.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08101555000044"></a>That is unconscionable at the present time. It would be bad enough if the law officer in Scotland was, as now, of a different political persuasion from the law

Everything seems to have been posited on the basis that they are both of the same political persuasion. They are not at present and it is unlikely that they will be so in the future. In such circumstances we have a real can of worms that we have to examine very carefully. This may not be an opportune moment to do so, but I certainly want to warn the Minister that it is something to which I will want to return on another occasion.</p>

When I was Lord Advocate, I pressed for universal jurisdiction on the basis of my experience in examining the evidence put before me to support a terrorism offence. It rapidly became clear that the lack of universal jurisdiction might hamper a prosecution. Such was the nature of terrorism offences that it seemed that that should be remedied. I am pleased that the Government have taken this on board with this clause.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08101555000046"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, has just pointed out, it is not without precedent. I am afraid that I have not looked at the Explosive Substances Act 1883 in the detail that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has done&#151;at least, not for the past couple of years&#151;so I cannot answer his point on that issue. However, it has certainly been accepted that there is universal jurisdiction under that Act, and other Acts as well; he also mentioned the Customs and Excise Management Act.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08101555000047"></a>We should not put on one side the fact that offences brought to light in one jurisdiction may well have jurisdiction elsewhere. Nowadays, there are arrangements between countries and jurisdictions to agree where the best place to bring individuals to trial would be. That happens particularly through the operations of Eurojust, the European body that represents prosecutors from each of the member states. These issues will arise increasingly as international commerce, trade and travel grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08101555000048"></a>The noble and learned Lords, Lord Fraser and Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, and I had an interest in the Lockerbie trial, where there was jurisdiction both in the United States and in Scotland. These situations are not unusual and prosecutors have dealt with them on the basis of agreement and consensus. I, of course, recognise the dangers that might flow from universal jurisdiction, but those have always been present. I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, that in relation to the poor granny in Wick&#151;I am not entirely clear why he chose Wick&#151;we are talking about an offence under the Terrorism Act. One presumes that the offence that he discussed exists to prevent car bombs from being set off; it is not simply a parking offence but rather an offence under the Terrorism Act.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08101555000049"></a>One accepts that there may be occasions when jurisdictions disagree about where an accused person should stand trial. I hope that the arrangement that has existed hitherto, whereby the relevant jurisdictions have discussed these issues and reached agreement on them, will continue. I very much hope that the noble Lord will be able to say that when he replies.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08101555000050"></a>I take issue with what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, said in relation to the possibility of the Lord Advocate becoming a civil servant. The Lord

I do not think that it matters one whit what the politics of individual law officers are; it certainly should not matter. The discussion should concern the evidence and which trial location best serves the interests of justice. The interests of justice comprise a number of factors. For example, where is the evidence? Is it mostly in England or mostly in Scotland? Where was the effect of the offence felt? If a loss of life occurred in one jurisdiction or another, that might indicate which jurisdiction would be the best and most proper place for the person to be brought to trial. There may be issues in relation to the accused that affect consideration of where might be the best place for someone to face trial.</p>

<a name="81015-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08101555000051"></a>I sympathise with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, but I do not believe that what he suggested is the right way to go about this. It seems to me that the arrangements that have been in place for a long time between the Attorney-General, the Lord Advocate and the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland should continue. The sensitivities should be recognised on all sides. I very much hope that the noble Lord will be able to say that there will be full discussion and agreement between the relevant law officers before a decision is taken about where someone ought to be brought to justice.</p>

I follow on very much from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd, whom I hesitate to speak after, since his experience is so great. I draw attention to the evidence given in the second day of Commons Committee, when the Lord Advocate gave evidence. She made it clear that the current arrangements work extremely well and do not require any shoring up. There are regular discussions on these matters between the senior law officers in both countries and the question of universality, which is now interposed in the Bill, I think came at her suggestion.

We start off with the premise that an offence has been committed in a particular place in the United Kingdom, as a result of which the police have taken action and have charged an individual, who, from that moment onwards, is at least initially committed to the care of the courts of that jurisdiction. I want to be clear at what point it is suggested that the words,</p>

<p><a name="08101555000194"></a>come into play. Is it at the point where an individual is committed for trial in England, Northern Ireland or Scotland? In Scotland, it would be on petition; I presume that it would be on indictment in either England or Northern Ireland, in the instance of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Perhaps the Minister could help me with that, because I have a slight difficulty for the moment on the question of universality of jurisdiction at the point when there are in fact some proceedings being taken that fall within the jurisdiction of a particular court.</p>

First, the issue raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, about car parking relates to a car being parked for a car bomb or the like, as my noble and learned friend Lord Boyd said. I was passed a note by the Box saying that apparently the Explosive Substances Act 1883 does not provide UK-wide jurisdiction, but I certainly do not want to get into that battle when there seem to be differing views in all directions. Clearly, the issue relating to customs is there, but that does not include a legislative requirement for law officer consent working on some of those difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08101555000055"></a>The principles of common law mean that, for a court to take jurisdiction over an offence, a substantial measure of the criminal activity must have taken place in that part of the United Kingdom. That common law rule has been established for sensible reasons and, in the vast majority of cases, it creates the right result in terms of the court being best placed to deal with the offences having jurisdiction. However, where there are cross-border situations, the rule might result in linked offences that happen in two different parts of the United Kingdom having to be tried in separate trials in different parts of the United Kingdom. That is obviously inefficient and a waste of resources. It is almost certainly less effective than if the cases could be tried by the same court, which is why the clause has been introduced.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08101555000056"></a>Amendment No. 77 would make it a legal requirement for the Lord Advocate to consent to the transfer of cases from Scotland to another part of the UK for prosecution under the jurisdiction provided by this clause. Amendments Nos. 72 and 78 would require the written consent of the law officer for the jurisdiction in which the offence was committed before any proceedings could be transferred under the provisions of this clause.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08101555000057"></a>The decision on whether to prosecute in one jurisdiction or another is properly a matter for the independent prosecuting authorities and will, of course, depend on the facts of each case. Where there is concurrent jurisdiction, investigators and prosecutors already liaise from the outset of the investigation to decide how best to proceed in the circumstances of the case. Cross-border crime occurs frequently and our prosecutors have a wealth of experience in handling cases on their merits in the overall public interest.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08101555000058"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned, the Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, gave evidence at the Commons Committee stage about the excellent relationship between the offices of the law officers. That experience shows that she and the Attorney-General would engage immediately in discussions about the appropriate jurisdiction in which the offence should be tried. It was the Lord Advocate&#146;s clearly expressed view that she and the Attorney-General, as chief prosecutors acting in the public interest, will inevitably consult on the decision as to the most appropriate place for the prosecution to take place and that this practice, which is already in place, provides sufficient protection. I also understand that the Lord Advocate   


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_776"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 776</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the Attorney-General propose to articulate the general principles that will be relevant to such decisions when the legislation comes into force.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08101555000059"></a>Decisions on how to pursue effective investigations are likely to be taken very early when evidence is being gathered. Knowledge of what has happened and where is likely to be swift-moving and not apt to be overtaken by bureaucratic requirements such as written consent or compliance. The decision on where an investigation should take place has to be left to the exercise of discretion by investigators and prosecutors in the interests of a successful overall investigation in the heat of what may be a major attack on the UK or wider.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08101555000060"></a>I reiterate that this clause does not undermine the Scottish legal system. It does not weaken the constitutional independence of the Scottish legal system, change the role of the Lord Advocate or remove any powers from the devolved Administration. As the Lord Advocate made clear in the evidence session, this provision appears in the Bill at her request. The provision would be applied only in cases where terrorist activity took place in more than one UK jurisdiction, which occurs infrequently. We would not expect prosecutions to occur in a jurisdiction to which neither the offence nor the offenders were connected. On that basis, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

There is a general acceptance, for the most part, of the merit of our universal jurisdiction; no one sought to challenge that and, indeed, no noble Lord or noble and learned Lord raised any question as to the undermining of the Scottish legal system or the robust independence of the Lord Advocate. That is not at issue.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08101555000062"></a>Rather, in the exercise of the universal jurisdiction, a number of practical issues arise. The opposition Front Bench&#146;s argument was based on the fact that the Lord Advocate and the present Attorney-General have an excellent relationship&#151;the Minister referred to that when he cited the evidence given by the Lord Advocate. In my view, that is always one of the weakest arguments to make. The next set of law officers may not have an excellent relationship. We cannot have a system of criminal law based on the fact that at a given time the Attorney-General gets on well with the Lord Advocate. It does not matter whether they are of different parties or the same party. I am always wary of leaving these matters to good chance.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08101555000063"></a>This relates to the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie. I share the view of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby: heaven forbid that the Lord Advocate should ever be a senior civil servant. Even if there were to be a division of responsibilities between the head of the prosecution service in Scotland and whoever is the Scottish Executive&#146;s principal legal adviser, the historic, important and independent role of the Lord Advocate should continue to be filled by someone who recognises the importance of that role and who, therefore, would be willing, if circumstances demanded, to engage and negotiate with the Attorney-General or, indeed, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland on equal terms. It would not be, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, suggested, a rollover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08101555000064"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, raised a practical issue when he asked when proceedings should start. At which point of the process are they to be triggered, because consequences would flow from that? We may pick this issue up in the next amendment, but the absence of any given point that would be established by a written agreement between law officers gives rise to uncertainty. It may not have happened yet, but some desperate people looking for a defence may well start legal challenges because of the uncertainty. There is a common ground in the Committee that we should try not to allow loopholes to emerge. If uncertainty gives rise to a loophole, I hope that the Government will look at that.</p>

It picks up some of the points that have already been rehearsed and I shall not detain your Lordships further, other than to give an important example, which perhaps the Minister could address.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08101555000071"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd, indicated, such cases often involve multiple jurisdictions. For example, a multiparty conspiracy to explode a car bomb at Waverley Station in Edinburgh might involve perpetrators in Glasgow, Motherwell and Manchester. However, the explosives might be procured in Leeds and the ringleader might be in Lincoln. En route to Edinburgh, the car is intercepted on the M8 by police and the perpetrators explode the vehicle, resulting in serious injury to two police officers. Heaven forbid that it should ever happen, but it is the kind of scenario that we are dealing with in the Bill. Given that the explosives and perhaps the car were procured in England and the ringleader was in England, it might be thought that the sensible place to hold the trial would be in England. There is an agreement between the Lord Advocate and the Attorney-General that the proceedings should go ahead in England. When the case comes to trial, the Attorney-General accepts a plea or obtains a guilty verdict on conspiracy to murder or procurement of explosive substances, but has not heard a plea on the charge relating to the severe injury to the police officers. If she chose to drop the prosecution on that charge, there would be legitimate concern in Scotland because police officers had been injured. Yet the Attorney-General, perhaps in her view properly exercising her discretion, did not seek a prosecution. Would it be open to the Lord Advocate to prosecute in Scotland on that charge? I simply do not know the answer to that by looking at this clause. I hope that the Minister and other noble Lords agree that this is an important issue. It should not be left open but should perhaps be agreed in a protocol between the law officers.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08101555000072"></a>I pick up a point that the Minister made in answering the previous debate. In a letter to me of 6 August, the Lord Advocate said that she had asked her officials,</p>
<ul><a name="08101555000267"></a>&#147;to work with the Attorney General&#146;s officials to ensure that a protocol is prepared on how this will operate in practice&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000195"></a>in other words, the decision to transfer&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08101555000268"></a>&#147;and to be in place prior to the provisions coming into force&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000196"></a>If it is indeed the case that the law officers are preparing a protocol, it may be pushing it too far to say that it should be subject to parliamentary approval. However, it would be very useful and in the interests of everyone&#151;not just those who are accused, who have a right to know under which system they are being prosecuted, but also, for example, if there is a decision not to proceed with a particular charge&#151;to know what the agreement is between the law officers. Therefore, my plea is that, if a protocol is being prepared, it should at least be made public, even if it is not subject to parliamentary approval. Some assurance on that from the Minister would be very welcome. I beg to move.</p>

If I may, I should like to go away and confirm when that is to be done.

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08101555000083"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford. Clause 42 relates to sentences for offences with a terrorist connection in England and Wales. Under the amendment, the question of whether an offence had a terrorist connection would be a matter for the jury to determine rather than the judge. The impact of such a determination on the sentence would, however, remain a matter for the court.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08101555000084"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, Clause 42 contains a provision aggravating certain offences if they have a terrorism connection. Schedule 3 lists the offences covered and includes common law offences, such as murder and manslaughter, as well as a range of statutory offences relating to explosives, hostage-taking and others. The conviction for any of these offences will now be accompanied by a requirement for the court to determine whether there is a terrorism connection. In making that determination, the court can hear evidence and must take into account any defence or prosecution representations which are relevant for the purposes of sentencing. If an offence has a terrorism connection, it must be treated as an aggravating factor for sentencing, and other legal consequences will follow from that.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_780"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 780</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81015-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08101555000085"></a>There is no dispute on these Benches with the principle; namely, that a connection with terrorism should be seen as an aggravating factor in sentencing. However, we have a concern with regard to the manner in which the determination of a terrorism connection will be made. Clause 42(2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="08101555000226"></a>&#147;If ... it appears to the court that the offence has or may have a terrorist connection, the court must determine whether that is the case&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000197"></a>In other words, the determination will be a matter solely for the judge, as opposed to one of evidential consideration by the jury. I think that traditionally and historically matters of fact are determined by a jury, while matters of law are determined by a judge. To have such a determination made by the judge, as opposed to the jury, is a departure from the traditional criminal court procedure and one which has not, in our view, been justified to date. It is quite a serious matter to have an offence aggravated by terrorism; it is not something that would be done lightly. Therefore, it should be based on the facts and determined by a jury which has heard the facts.</p>

<a name="81015-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08101555000086"></a>Furthermore, a finding by the court that an offence had a terrorist connection could lead to the making of a notification order under a later part of the Bill. Notification requirements involve onerous obligations involving notification and restrictions on travel for those subject to them. Again, if one is going down the road of such onerous obligations potentially being put on someone, it is not unreasonable, in accord with our traditions, that these matters of fact should be determined by a jury. Against that background, I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Lord has just said, considerable consequences flow from a finding, whether by judge or jury, that an offence has a terrorist connection. If an offence is regarded and treated in law as an aggravated offence in the context of terrorism, that has enormously serious consequences, with potential sentences of 30 or more years. The principle that we have always followed is that matters of fact are for the jury, matters of law are for the judge and matters of sentencing are for the judge. This is essentially a matter of fact, and the jury will of course have heard all the evidence. It seems to me that the amendment raises a very important question and I look forward with great interest to hearing what the Government are minded to say in response.</p>

However, I should like clarification on the clause.

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08101555000089"></a>In the magistrates&#146; court, there is what is called a Newton hearing, when a specific aspect of evidence is tested. It is a completely separate hearing. As I read this clause, there is effectively a Newton hearing here. Subsection (3) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="08101555000227"></a>&#147;For that purpose the court may hear evidence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08101555000198"></a>As it has been hearing evidence all day and has presumably come to a conclusion on one aspect, this looks to me like a completely separate hearing to decide whether there was a terrorism influence. It would presumably take the form of a Newton hearing. The judge could not be excluded from that and the jury would of course make the decision as in any other case. I am not certain what the objections are to this clause when I think that we have a separate procedure here carried out by the court, which seems a perfectly sensible way of going about it. My noble and learned friend has leapt up in support, so perhaps I am worrying slightly over this, but I might as well ask for the explanation.</p>

As my noble friend on the Front Bench said, the English procedure in respect of guilty pleas involves the possibility of a Newton-type trial in which there may be an investigation of the facts by a judge to decide the sentence when there is a difference between the accused on the one hand and the prosecution on the other on the content of the offence to which the accused has pled guilty. To some of us it is a rather anomalous procedure but it is well established and has been going for a long time. I suspect that that is what is envisaged here as the time at which that decision should be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08101555000091"></a>If, on the other hand&#151;I can see the importance of it&#151;it is to be decided by a jury, procedural requirements will need to be met in relation to the formulation of the indictment so that the jury can have an opportunity to decide the issue.</p>

Indeed, judges currently make such decisions in sentencing when an offence is aggravated by virtue of motivation related to race, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Of course the courts&#151;judges&#151;already aggravate sentences for offences with a terrorist connection. These provisions merely formalise existing practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08101555000093"></a>We did consider whether the determination should be made by the jury&#151;in effect by creating a new category of terrorist aggravated offences as part of the consultation on the Bill. This included discussing the option with experienced prosecutors in this area. There are, however, practical issues in going down the jury route. For example, having to prove the terrorist connection as part of the trial would lead to lengthy diversions were the defence to argue that the action of the suspect did not fall within the definition of terrorism. Contesting the terrorist element could therefore significantly lengthen terrorism trials which are already comparatively long and would divert the prosecution from its primary aim, which is to secure the conviction or free the person being tried.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08101555000096"></a>The jury will of course decide whether the defendant is guilty of the relevant offence. After that, it is entirely right and proper that the judge should make the determination as to a terrorist connection as part of his sentencing function&#151;as indeed he decides any other aggravating or mitigating factor. Further, under our proposals&#151;this is the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;where a person pleads guilty to an offence but disputes that it was connected to terrorism there would be a Newton hearing, which is when the judge hears evidence on the facts disputed between the prosecution and the defence when these affect the appropriate sentence in the case. If the jury were to be responsible for determining whether there was a terrorist connection, it would have to be summoned to make such a determination following a guilty plea. This would be an unnecessary and inappropriate procedure. Sentencing is, quite properly, a function for the judge. We therefore think that the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08101555000097"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 82 is to require a court considering a connection to terrorism to be &#147;satisfied beyond reasonable doubt&#148; that the offence has a terrorist connection. This is already the case; a court must determine the connection beyond reasonable doubt, which is the criminal standard of proof. This is the case for all such sentencing matters, including the requirement to increase sentences in Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 where the offence is aggravated by factors concerning race, religion, disability and sexual orientation. There is no provision in the Act to spell out that the standard is beyond reasonable doubt and similarly I do not believe that it needs to be spelt out in this Bill. It is already the case that the court will apply the criminal standard. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.</p>

My understanding of the Newton hearing system, to which reference has been made, is that the judge and not the jury decides questions of fact that are raised in the Newton hearing. A trial is not necessary apparently because the accused has pled guilty but there is a dispute between the accused and the Crown&#151;the prosecutor&#151;about what the offence involved to which he has pled guilty. That is somewhat illogical to my way of thinking, but as a matter of practice for long established in England and Wales, it is decided by the judge on evidence from both sides. I assume that the clause deals with that kind of hearing in relation to whether or not the offence was connected with terrorism.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08101555000104"></a>The offences in Schedule 3 on the face of it are ordinary offences which do not include a reference to terrorism in their definition. The question of whether the circumstances were connected with terrorism is involved in the evidence as it emerges. The jury is not required to determine that; it is required to determine guilt or innocence of the offences charged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08101555000107"></a>It has been an interesting debate. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, put her finger on it when she asked what we mean by a court.

I was arguing about the basis on which the judge passes sentence. We have been asked to accept that if there is an aggravation by a connection to  


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_784"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 784</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>terrorism, that should be reflected in the sentence. The issue is how to re-establish whether there has been a connection to terrorism.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08101555000108"></a>I hear the strength of the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, echoing the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about the Newton hearings, but the clause makes no distinction between where an accused person has pleaded guilty and where a case has proceeded to trial after a not guilty plea. It was evident from the Minister's reply that he was dealing with situations both where there had been a full hearing on the evidence after a not guilty plea, leading to conviction, and where there had been a hearing after a guilty plea. I can see that there is a distinction between the two&#151;perhaps, although I want to reflect on this, it may not be appropriate to have a jury where there had been a guilty plea&#151;but that distinction is not made in the clause at the moment. If I am going to think about it again, perhaps the Minister may want to think whether greater clarification is needed with regard to those two separate issues.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08101555000109"></a>I was equally confused, as was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, about how what the Minister described as a terrorism trial would take time to establish that there was terrorism. I thought that that might be at the heart of the trial, especially if some of the charges involved statutory terrorism offences. Where a person has pleaded not guilty and, as a matter of fact&#151;whether or not there is a connection to terrorism&#151;it may be established that the person is guilty of murder, all the facts having been put before the court, surely the jury can make up its mind as to whether that murder had a connection to terrorism. Therefore, I am not wholly satisfied that the matter should be left to a judge when the jury has heard the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08101555000110"></a>I hope that the Minister will reflect on the points that I made about guilty and not guilty pleas. I want to reflect on what has been said in the debate. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08101555000120"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendments is twofold. First, they require a service court&#151;the court martial, for example&#151;to determine whether an offence under Armed Forces legislation which is equivalent to a criminal offence specified in Schedule 3 is connected to terrorism. Secondly, they make the notification requirements apply to someone dealt with by a service court in equivalent circumstances to those which will trigger the notification requirements in civilian courts.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08101555000121"></a>We consider that prosecutions for terrorism and terrorist-related offences will rarely be brought in service courts, rather than civilian courts, against members of the Armed Forces and certain civilians who are subject to Armed Forces legislation when they are abroad&#151;family members and contractors, for example&#151;so had previously exempted service courts from a requirement to determine whether certain offences are connected to terrorism cases, and from the imposition of notification requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08101555000122"></a>However, on further reflection we believe that it is possible that service courts may hear such cases. Therefore, these amendments change the sentencing provisions in Clauses 42 to 44, which provide that a terrorist connection is an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes, to ensure that they apply to service courts in the same way as they will apply to civil courts.</p>

<a name="81015-0009.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08101555000149"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the notification requirements apply only when a person is sentenced to 12 months&#146; imprisonment or more or, in certain circumstances, when a person is made subject to a hospital order. This is generally what is meant by &#147;dealt with&#148;. However, the court&#146;s original sentence may be altered on appeal or otherwise, so the amendments make it clear that where, for example, an appeal court substitutes a sentence of less than 12 months for one that was originally 12 months or more, the notification requirements are to be treated as never having applied to that person.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08101555000172"></a>We accept that the simple fact that someone is young does not make them any less dangerous if they have a propensity to terrorism. We also accept that if someone is insane and has a propensity to terrorist offences, that might also render them extremely dangerous. However, there may be more appropriate regimes for dealing with these two classes of offenders than the notification process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08101555000173"></a>In the case of juveniles, one must hope that a young person who develops terrorist connections and is accused and convicted of terrorist offences is capable of rehabilitation and education, and has the opportunity not to pursue that course in their future life following any sentence that they might serve. It may be more difficult for rehabilitation to work in the case of an adult, but we have always based our legal system on a clear principle of rehabilitation of young offenders, particularly when they have idealism. The noble Lord, Lord West, and I know all about younger and younger people being groomed, and know that this idealism might be misplaced, particularly where they come under the influence of others, and might be inappropriately expressed in the form of support for terrorist activities. I in no way wish to trivialise the offence; I am merely

There may also be a coercive element where a young person is in contact with people who are conspiring to commit terrorist offences. This applies particularly to information communication technologies and other methods.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08101555000174"></a>The Bill seeks to ensure that notification is applied to only the most serious terrorist-related matters by applying notification requirements to persons convicted of terrorist-related offences only if they have received a trigger sentence. However, we are concerned that this is not a fail-safe way to gauge the gravity of a terrorist-related offence and that it precludes a proper individual assessment of the risks posed by the person on release. In a case involving a young person, the trigger sentence will be one year or more in a juvenile justice centre or young offender centre. It is possible to envisage a young person aged 15 with a history of non-terrorist related convictions having served one or more custodial sentences. While not wishing to detract from the serious nature of the terrorist-related offences, it is possible that if this young person is convicted of encouraging terrorism, he may receive a custodial term of one year or more, not due only to the terrorist nature of the offence, but also because of any prior criminal record. On release, the young person is subject to notification requirements for 10 years without any assessment of risk or any opportunity in the intervening period to appeal, to review or to discharge of the notification requirements.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08101555000175"></a>We further argue that notification for children is not in keeping with the ethos and principles of reintegration in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Paragraph 15 of the committee&#146;s General Comment No. 10 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="08101555000259"></a>&#147;The Committee reminds State Parties that, pursuant to Article 40(1) CRC, reintegration requires that no actions may be taken that can hamper the child&#146;s full participation in his/her community, such as stigmatisation, social isolation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101555000202"></a>We believe that those requirements as they stand would stigmatise that very young person.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08101555000176"></a>Furthermore, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its report on the United Kingdom, published only a few days ago, recommended that the Government review the application of this Bill to children suspected of or charged with terrorism offences, including notification requirements. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s observation. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08101555000177"></a><a name="81015-0010.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="81015-0010.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08101555000326"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I have considerable sympathy with the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner. However, we believe that notification requirements should apply to all terrorist offenders provided they meet the necessary conditions as to how they are dealt with by the courts. By doing this, we are enabling the police to properly and effectively manage the risk terrorist offenders pose.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08101555000178"></a>Amendments Nos. 89, 91 and 95 seek to remove the application across the United Kingdom for those who were under 18. Amendments Nos. 90, 92 and 96 aim to disapply the notification requirements in relation to those found not guilty by reason of insanity, or found to have been under a disability and to have done the act charged, and made subject to a hospital order.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_790"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 790</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81015-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08101555000179"></a>We must remember that young terrorist offenders, who will have been convicted and sentenced for serious terrorist offences, could pose the same risk to the community on their release from custody as older terrorist offenders sentenced to imprisonment. It is right that notification requirements apply to these individuals to manage that risk. It is also reasonable for notification requirements to apply to those who were found not guilty due to insanity or were found to be under a disability at the time of trial because such persons will have been found to have carried out the act constituting the offence, albeit lacking the mental element by virtue of their condition, so they could still pose a risk to the community on their release. These are the same provisions as apply in the sex offender notification scheme.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08101555000180"></a>In addition, it should be remembered that the notification provisions impose minimal requirements on offenders&#151;merely notifying the fact that they have moved address, for example, to the police and keeping that sort of information up to date. It is not disproportionate to require convicted terrorists, even those who were under the age of 18 or with a mental disability at the time of the offence, to comply with these minimal requirements. For that reason, I resist these amendments, although I have considerable sympathy, particularly with the youngsters. I might want to just think a little about that&#151;not for those aged 18, but perhaps another age group.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08101555000181"></a>Amendment No. 104 would remove Clause 64(5). Subsection (5) sets out what happens to a person who has been found to be under a disability and to have done the act charged against them in respect of a terrorism or terrorism-related offence if they are subsequently tried for the offence. That might happen where the person recovers from their mental disorder and the Secretary of State decides that they should face prosecution for the offence. If they are acquitted, the notification requirements would no longer apply. If they are convicted, their notification requirements apply anew from the date of their conviction. Removing the subsection would mean that notification requirements would continue to apply to someone who has been found to be under a disability and to have done the act charged against them even if they were subsequently acquitted of the offence. On this basis, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08101558000006"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments seek to resolve a technical problem with the notification provisions in the Bill. At present, the Bill does not address the issue of those subject to the notification requirements who are subject to immigration detention. The policy is that where a person is in detention, for example serving a prison sentence or a hospital order, the notification requirements are suspended. Clearly, the person cannot, and should not, leave prison to report to the police. Immigration detention is another form of detention, not currently mentioned in the Bill, which needs to be added to the list of types of detention during which the notification requirements will be suspended.</p>

<a name="81015-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08101558000007"></a>These amendments would add a reference to immigration detention in each instance where these other forms of detention are mentioned in the context of the notification scheme. These are where the periods for the initial notification, notification of change or periodic notification are suspended when the person is in detention, and the notification period&#151;that is, the length of time the person is subject to the notification requirements&#151;is suspended for such periods. The amendments also require a person to notify the police on their release from immigration detention under Clause 59(4), just as a person is required to notify them on their release from other forms of detention. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08101558000020"></a>The noble Lord said: These are amendments to the notification scheme in Part 4. They make provision in relation to circumstances where someone subject to the notification requirements is abroad, voluntarily on holiday or on business for example, or following a removal, such as having been deported or extradited from the United Kingdom.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_793"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 793</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81015-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08101558000021"></a>Under the Bill, a person subject to the notification requirements who is abroad when they are due to notify technically commits an offence if they fail to return to the UK to notify any changes to notified information or to make their annual re-notification. We do not think this is appropriate; these amendments rectify that by effectively suspending the requirement to notify while a person subject to the requirements is abroad. They would then be required to notify their details, if notification was due, within three days of their return to the UK. The amendments also tighten up the rules so that a person who voluntarily goes abroad must notify of any details due to be notified before they go, even if this shortens the normal three-day period a person has to notify such information.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08101558000022"></a>The new clause suspends the requirement for a person to make an initial notification where a person is removed from the UK within three days of the end of their detention. Where a person is deported immediately following their period in custody for the terrorism offence or immigration detention, they will not have to make their initial notification, but where a person leaves the country voluntarily because, for example, they want to go to France immediately they come out of prison, they will have to make their initial notification before they go, even if they go less than three days after their release. Such a person will also need to inform the police of the details of their intended travel plans because of the provisions in Clause 63 which allow the Secretary of State to require those subject to the notification requirements to provide such information.

Before I go to the specifics of this clause&#151;and I am having a second bite of the cherry&#151;I want to say a few words by way of background briefing to these amendments. The noble Lord knows that situations will arise where the court and indeed the authorities accept that a person convicted of a serious terrorist offence in the past has genuinely and permanently renounced violence. A notable feature of the Northern Ireland peace process has been the involvement of those previously associated with sectarian violence. The notification requirements are not intended to be a punishment. If they were, they would be in breach of the bar on retrospective punishment contained in Article 7 of the Human Rights Act. Instead, they are intended to allow details of those convicted of terrorist offences to be kept for public safety purposes. It would serve no purpose and would be a questionable use of police resources not to allow scope within the Bill to review the notification requirements for those who, at some future assessment, are found to present no risk to public safety.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08101558000046"></a>As the Bill is constructed, there is an indefinite period for serious cases and a 10-year period for less serious ones. The amendments would effectively put break clauses in those periods every five years. The initial notification period would be five years, and in the case of serious offences it could be renewed on a five-yearly basis to the point of being an indefinite notification. For less serious offences the period would be five years in the first instance but could be renewed  


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_795"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 795</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to apply for a further five years, thereby making the period of 10 years that the Government are requesting in the Bill. In effect, we are asking, not to change the outcome, but for reviews at certain points to see whether we need this fairly onerous and bureaucratic process to achieve an end that may not be necessary.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08101558000047"></a>The most important thing is to allow the courts to consider the individual&#146;s circumstances, the environment in which the order is made, and to ensure that the notification orders are still appropriate. They may be inappropriate because the person has changed their views and conduct entirely, and can demonstrate that to the satisfaction of the courts&#151;so the bar remains the same in terms of demonstrating that. People who have engaged in terrorist activities can sometimes make quite substantial changes to their lifestyles to the point where they become part of society here in the UK and abroad. Those would be cases where I assume it would be inappropriate to retain a notification procedure.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08101558000048"></a>The circumstances of the individual and their propensity to be a danger to the public may well change. It is appropriate for a court to consider all the matters before it and to decide in a quinquennial review whether the notification procedure is still required. If necessary, the courts can renew it; if not, onerous requirements on the individual will be lifted at the point where they cease to have an effect in protecting the public rather than being a burden on the individual. That is a punitive burden rather than one for the wider good. On that basis, I hope the Minister will consider reviewing the requirement and accept the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

There are many objections to people being put on a register forever without any kind of break time or reconsideration. I accept that it will be for serious charges and offences, but there will be gradations, and it seems only sensible that the registration period should be looked at again.</p>

Where the individual is sentenced for five years or more for a terrorism or terrorism-related offence then, given the evident seriousness of the offence, an indefinite notification period is appropriate. Where a person is sentenced to between one and five years, a period of 10 years is appropriate.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08101558000051"></a>Amendments Nos. 101 and 103 would give the court discretion as to whether the notification requirements should continue to apply beyond the five-year period proposed in the previous amendment. They would allow the notification requirements to be renewed by a court if it considered it necessary for protecting members of the public from the risk of terrorism. However, it is not clear to us on what basis an assessment would be conducted of whether the offender is considered to present a continued terrorist risk to the public. It would involve difficult decisions. The fact that a person has not reoffended is not sufficient to establish the absence of such a risk.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08101558000052"></a>It must be remembered that the notification requirement will apply only to convicted terrorists&#151;that is, those who have been involved in supporting, organising or plotting the most serious of crimes, where often the ultimate purpose is to terrorise and harm large numbers of the public. It is right that the police should have the tools to help monitor those who have been involved in such crimes.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08101558000053"></a>Secondly&#151;this is important&#151;the notification requirements are not onerous; they do not stop the person from doing anything. All they require them to do is to provide the police with information such as where they live, where they are staying for periods if they are not at their home address, if they change their name and if they intend to go overseas. That is all that is required and represents a proportionate interference with a person&#146;s right to a private life given the serious crimes in which they have been involved; they do not stop the person from doing anything.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08101558000054"></a>The notification requirements we are proposing are less onerous than those applied to sex offenders. Terrorism is surely as serious in many ways&#151;if not more so&#151;as the sexual offending that triggers sex offender notification. So, although I have some sympathy with the amendment&#151;I like to think that people can look at something and see whether they can shorten it&#151;in this case we should stay as we are. I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="08101558000055"></a><a name="81015-0011.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="81015-0011.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08101558000260"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> I am disappointed with the Minister&#146;s reply for a number of reasons. First, he keeps reminding us that the offences would be serious ones and that is why it is necessary to have an indefinite requirement to notify the authorities. Of course, the sum of the measures in the amendments is not necessarily to reduce the term for which the person would be required to notify the authorities. We are seeking to put in place a periodic review so that it can be seen whether or not the person still posed a risk. In the cases I outlined and the examples I gave, the net effect for the different tiers of offences would still be exactly what the Government want in the legislation. But the amendment would provide an opportunity to decide that public safety was no longer threatened at some point in the person&#146;s life.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08101558000056"></a>There is another reason why I am disappointed. I do not go in for cultural relativism and, as noble Lords will remember from Second Reading, when I reassured the House on this matter, I do not go in for special pleading for communities or religious groups, particularly not those that I belong to. However, the repetition that we have had throughout the course of the Bill, comparing terrorist offences, particularly in the area of notification, to sex offences, sex offenders&#146; registers and so on is unhelpful. The Minister knows the community I am talking about extremely well&#151;I am full of admiration for his knowledge in that regard&#151;and he knows that for this particular religious group there is enormous stigma attached to being associated with or compared in any way to people who might be on a sex offenders&#146; register. Perhaps we might move away from those kinds of analogies.</p>

<a name="81015-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08101558000057"></a>The requirements may not be onerous but they can affect periods of a person&#146;s life, particularly when they last decades. We know from demographics how long

So we are talking of someone who may well still be subject to notification requirements some 60 or 70 years after the terrorist act was committed. Surely it would not be sensible so much later&#151;if only because of the cost and bureaucracy&#151;to still ask that person to notify the authorities of when he is going to leave the UK borders to go on a channel ferry, on the Eurostar to France, or to Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08101558000058"></a>I am trying to inject a degree of pragmatism while recognising that people change, which is the whole basis of our belief in rehabilitation. On that basis I feel a little frustrated.</p>

Her basic idea is that a person may have changed fundamentally&#151;as happened, for example, in Northern Ireland. One way of dealing with that would be for the person who is the subject of a notification requirement to be able to apply to the court to have it lifted on satisfying the court that there is no longer any danger. Something of that kind might meet the point rather than having a quinquennial review. Different people may not be affected at all during the five years whereas an individual may have a good case. It would limit the amount of bureaucracy required by a quinquennial review.</p>

This issue concerning notification orders arose in Committee in the other place, and Tony McNulty agreed to consider the possible ways forward. Officials have since been looking at this issue, but I am afraid that we are still working on the final drafting of the amendment that we will be bringing forward as the solution. However, it will be ready for Report.</p>

<a name="81015-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08101558000082"></a>The issue, put quite simply, is this. The notification orders provided for in Schedule 5 enable those convicted of terrorist offences overseas to be made subject to the terrorist notification requirements if they come to the UK. This might cover, for example, a British citizen who has been convicted of a terrorism offence overseas, who has served his sentence overseas and who is then deported to the UK when he is released from prison. It might also cover an EU national who has been convicted of a terrorism offence in another EU country who decides to come and live in Britain. It is clear that we would want such people to have to notify their personal details to the police, just as we would someone who is convicted of a terrorist offence in this country.</p>

<a name="81015-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08101558000083"></a>The police would apply to the court for a notification order. Since the notification requirements apply automatically to someone convicted of terrorist offences in this country&#151;we have already discussed the reasons for that&#151;the court would have to make a notification

The main test is that the offence for which the person has been convicted overseas is equivalent to one that would trigger notification in this country.</p>

<a name="81015-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08101558000084"></a>The issue that arose in the other place was that the provisions as drafted could mean that a court would be required to make an order even if the overseas conviction was based on torture evidence. We acknowledge that that would not be right, and it is not our intention that an order be made in such circumstances. We therefore all start from the same place on this issue. We believe that notification orders will be useful, but we do not want them to be based on an overseas conviction that was obtained on the basis of evidence obtained through torture.</p>

<a name="81015-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08101558000085"></a>The problem with the amendment is that it goes too wide. It covers not only convictions based on torture evidence, but also other evidence obtained by any means that would render it inadmissible in a court in the UK. The reference to &#147;other means&#148; is too uncertain and imprecise in its scope. We accept that there may be cases other than those involving torture evidence where the foreign trial was so unfair that it would not be appropriate for a notification order to be imposed on the individual, but we do not believe that this amendment has got it quite right in drafting terms.</p>

<a name="81015-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08101558000086"></a>We accept absolutely that we need to find a way of ensuring that notification orders are never made on the basis of convictions overseas that are likely to have involved torture. However, we need to do that in a way that does not undermine the fundamental nature of the terrorist notification regime and does not impose completely impractical obligations on the courts or create huge resource issues.</p>

<a name="81015-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08101558000087"></a>My officials are still working on an answer to these issues today, but I give the noble Baroness a commitment that I will consider this very carefully before Report with a view to coming back with an appropriate government amendment that will remove the possibility that a notification order could be made on the basis of torture evidence. I hope with that commitment the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

Restricting travel is a serious matter. I presume that these orders would apply to people who have been released from prison and are still under notification as part of the notification procedures. I am a bit worried about paragraph 6(2) of Schedule 6, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_126"></a><a name="08101558000190"></a>&#147;The order must only impose such prohibitions as are necessary for the purpose of preventing the person from taking part in terrorism activity outside the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101558000142"></a>If we know that someone is going to take part in terrorist activity outside the United Kingdom, would it not be a requirement that we did rather more than place travel restrictions on him? It seems an unusual position. There must be other reasons, of course, for travel restrictions to be put on. I presume these people are still under the eye of the police. Passports are often removed from people prior to charge while they are on remand, but this is post that, as I understand it. If it is while they are on remand, that is a different matter. Are these people subject to notification? If they are, then that is post-sentence. If they are still considered likely to go abroad to carry out terrorist activities, is that really all we are going to do?</p>

That means, as the noble Baroness says, that they would have been convicted of a terrorism or terrorism-related offence and sentenced to 12 months or more. It would not be possible to apply for an order under these provisions for those who have not been convicted of an offence, even if the police had good reason to believe that they intended to travel overseas for a terrorist purpose. We are not able to do that, unfortunately. Secondly, the person must have acted following being dealt with for the offence that led to the notification requirements being imposed. The order can specify only prohibitions on travel that are necessary for preventing the person from taking part in terrorist activities; they are not, and cannot be used as, an additional punishment. We believe that this is a helpful tool. We are unable to do more at the moment; therefore, we would like Clause 67 to stand part of the Bill.</p>

Will the restriction be imposed on the basis of suspicion that that might happen because they had been convicted of a terrorism offence? This is a very strange clause. Are we saying that the fact that police have a suspicion that people might go abroad to carry out terrorist activities is the only reason for restricting their travel? I can imagine a huge number of other reasons even after they have finished their sentence, but that seems to be the only reason given in this clause.</p>

Some 400,000 British citizens a year travel to Pakistan. Many of them hold dual nationality. Were they to wish to circumvent these restrictions, how practical would the restrictions be? They could simply book their ticket, travel and re-enter under their other passport, so these restrictions would be impractical in real terms.</p>

There are a number of people whom I would love to be able to stop in some way but there is no way in law to do that. Because these are civil rules of evidence, we can use hearsay evidence to stop these people travelling abroad. I would much rather stop some other people, but we must look at how to do that within our legal system. To enable us to capture those people, I would prefer Clause 67 to stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81015-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08101558000123"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft rules arise from Sections 21 to 23 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 which, when commenced on 3 November, will create new arrangements that will allow time spent on bail while subject to an electronically monitored curfew to be credited against a subsequent custodial sentence. These new arrangements give effect  


<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_810"></a><b>15 Oct 2008 : Column 810</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to a measure recommended by my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles in his review of prisons to help manage demand for prison spaces.</p>

<a name="81015-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08101558000124"></a>It may assist the House if I briefly explain how the credit will operate before I go on to explain the purpose of the rules. To qualify for the curfew credit, defendants must have been subject to an electronically monitored curfew, which I will refer to as tagged bail, for at least nine hours per day. Electronically monitored curfew conditions constitute a significant restriction to a defendant&#146;s movements and compliance is rigorously monitored. But a curfew is clearly less arduous than being remanded to custody, and so to reflect the position that being subject to a curfew does not equal a deprivation of liberty whereas remand to custody clearly does, each day of tagged bail will provide a potential credit against sentence of no more than half a day. The court will have discretion, if it considers it just in the circumstances, not to count all or any of the available days and will be required to take into account the defendant&#146;s compliance with the curfew. The sentencing judge must state in open court the number of days spent on tagged bail that will count as time served towards the sentence imposed. This is a sensible measure that will provide an incentive to those remanded on tagged bail to comply with their conditions as well as providing relief to the prison population.</p>

<a name="81015-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08101558000125"></a>The purpose of the draft rules is to set out specific circumstances in which the court must not grant credit under the new provisions. It is appropriate to restrict the credit given in particular circumstances where it would undermine public confidence in the provisions. The rules are consistent with the equivalent rules made by the Secretary of State in relation to crediting periods of remand in custody. We have consulted the judiciary on the content of the draft rules through the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee. All its comments have been taken on board.</p>

<a name="81015-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08101558000126"></a>Draft Rule 2 will prevent a court making a direction which would have the effect of counting twice the same period of time spent subject to tagged bail. This covers the situation, for example, in which a defendant spends a period under tagged bail in relation to two offences and is then sentenced at different times. Where the first sentencing court directs the time to count towards the first sentence, the rules will prevent the second court counting the same period toward the second sentence.</p>

<a name="81015-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08101558000127"></a>Draft Rule 3 will prevent the court making a direction in relation to days spent on tagged bail where the offender was also subject to an electronically monitored curfew as a consequence of early release from prison, or as part of a non-custodial sentence such as a community order with an electronically monitored curfew requirement. Similar provision can be found in rules made under Section 240 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, where time spent remanded to custody at the same time as time spent serving a custodial sentence is prevented from being directed to count against any subsequent sentence. The draft rule will ensure that offenders who have been released early under the home detention curfew scheme and those who have been released on general licence subject to an electronically monitored curfew do not receive credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08101558000128"></a>Draft Rule 4 deals with the unlikely event that a prisoner released from prison under temporary licence appears before a court on further charges during that period without first being returned to prison for breaching the terms of their licence. Prisoners who are charged with an offence during a period of temporary release will ordinarily have their licences revoked and be returned to prison quickly. The rule is simply a precautionary measure to make it clear that prisoners released from prison under temporary licence must not receive credit.</p>

<a name="81015-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08101558000129"></a>It would of course be open to the court to use its discretion not to grant credit in the specific circumstances set out in the draft rules. However, the rules will remove any doubt by providing the courts and defendants with absolute clarity about the circumstances in which a sentencer must not give credit.

Today, at Question Time, we had a slightly more robust noble Lord, Lord Bach, who was firm in his belief that there was no need for him to provide information for my noble friend Lord Onslow, who sadly is not here, despite being a member of the Government who introduced the Freedom of Information Act. We hope today that, of those two versions of the noble Lord, the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, it will be the Dr Jekyll who triumphs, that we will get the apologetic, friendlier version of him and that he will assist us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08101558000132"></a>I must ask just one or two questions to guide me in our tour through the regulation. The minute that I saw that it was related to the credit period, I suspected that it was another excuse for the Government, particularly in relation to the <I>Times </I>article that I mentioned today at Question Time, to keep the prison population down and thereby save money, even if its long-term consequence would be to increase the spend. I then discovered that, because the rules are related to disapplication of credit period, there must be some other motive in introducing them. I then looked carefully at the Explanatory Memorandum and listened to the Minister&#146;s explanation, for which I am grateful. He explained that draft Rule 2 is related to double counting, draft Rule 3 to double counting in connection with early release, and draft Rule 4 to release on temporary licence. In other words, it is designed to put right the inadequacies of a Bill that we passed as recently as last summer and was going to come into effect on 3 November, and the Government have had to come back with the draft

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08101558000133"></a>If I can go back to the Dr Jekyll side of the Minister, I think that a brief apology on his behalf and that of the department for not getting it right with the 2008 Act is due. We made it clear that we did not particularly like the idea of the credit period, but if the department was going to have one, it might have got it right in the Bill, without the need to bring forward the rules. We suspect that, as it passed through this House, the Ministers involved did not spot this and did not deal with it as it should, and that is why we are dealing with the rules today. For that reason only, I hope again that the noble Lord, because he is very good at apologies late at night, would feel that he could apologise on behalf of his department for getting it wrong and wasting just a few minutes of the House&#146;s time on these rules.</p>

I did not know that this was Liberal Democrat policy, so I made inquiries and discovered that, in so far as hefted sheep in Welsh upland areas are concerned, it was thought to be an unnecessary ramification, and my colleague, Mr Steve Webb, was demanding that the Government make yet another U-turn.</p>

<a name="81015-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08101558000135"></a>However, we have always supported the tagging on bail of offenders as an alternative to remanding an individual in custody. The benefits are obvious: the person is enabled to stay within the family, to retain his accommodation and to attend work and education. Since he is not to be held to be guilty until he is convicted, that is all very beneficial. Accordingly, although we join the noble Lord, Lord Henley, in criticising the Government for getting it wrong in the iniquitous criminal justice Bills that they so frequently pass, we support the rules being put forward today.</p>

<a name="81015-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08101558000136"></a>Since we are in favour of tagging during bail, I should be interested to know what the compliance rate is&#151;if the Minister has that information&#151;and whether technical problems have been overcome. I am aware of technical problems in relation to tagging in the early days, so I would be interested to know whether the Government are now satisfied that the tagging provisions work properly. Subject to that, we have no objection to the rules as proposed.</p>

In my best Dr Jekyll mood&#151;he was the nice one&#151;I shall say in the nicest possible way that there is no inadequacy in the Act at all. The order-making power was made clear in the primary legislation. The rules are entirely consistent with the remand rules created in 2005. We have always said that it would be at the discretion of the sentencer whether credit would be given and we have pointed out three situations in which credit cannot be given. That is all that we have done in these short but necessary rules.</p>

No data are held centrally on defendants&#146; return to court as a result of breach of bail conditions, including tagged curfews. Of course, individual courts take account of whether there has been a breach in deciding whether and how much credit should be given against custodial sentences. Data provided by the electronic monitoring contractors say that the number reported to the police as having breached is as high as 64 per cent&#151;16,000 cases out of about 25,000. However, there are caveats to that: tight rules are applied and, if you are not at

Those are the occasions on which the police have been told, but it does not follow that each of those occasions is a breach demanding an immediate removal of bail or any punishment on its own. People can legitimately be late home. It would be dangerous to suggest that that 64 per cent somehow represents extra criminality. It does not. I hope that that is a clear answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08101546000009"></a>Having been appointed as the Government&#146;s anti-corruption champion this week, I am writing to inform the House of progress made in our anti-corruption efforts.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08101546000010"></a>For two years, the Government have undertaken a concerted programme of action to co-ordinate and to improve our anti-corruption systems through annual anti-corruption action plans driven forward by my predecessors John Hutton and Hilary Benn. The role of anti-corruption champion is a personal appointment by the Prime Minister and the Secretariat and support functions remain within BERR.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08101546000011"></a>Government investment in dedicated police resources has led to a dramatic increase in the number of investigations into allegations of foreign bribery by UK nationals and companies, up from four investigations in 2006 to over 20 live cases this year. Investigations are feeding through into prosecutions and convictions of wrongdoers.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08101546000012"></a>We will make further significant progress in the next few months on the reform of the law on bribery. The Law Commission is expected to report in November on the full range of structural options. As announced in the draft legislative programme, we propose to publish a draft bill in the next Session of Parliament, which will be informed by the Law Commission&#146;s review.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08101546000013"></a>This week the working group on bribery at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will publish a report on the UK&#146;s progress against its recommendations. We have written to the OECD about our plans to develop a comprehensive UK strategy for tackling foreign bribery. This strategy will build on the solid foundation we have established for combating foreign bribery and strengthen our work with international partners<I>, </I>establishing a clear legal, regulatory and policy framework.</p>

This was the third G6 plus US counterterrorism symposium meeting (previous meetings took place in Venice in May 2007 and Schwielowsee in November to December 2007). I attended on behalf of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08101546000017"></a>The symposium was divided into four substantive discussion sessions:</p>
 general aspects of counterterrorism (prevention, countering radicalisation, criminal law, law on threat prevention);remote searches of computer hard drives;diplomatic assurances; and right to self defence.
<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08101546000018"></a>The discussions underlined the importance of transatlantic co-operation on counterterrorism. We reflected on developments in the field of international terrorism, continued our exchanges on the development of effective countermeasures and recognised that it was important to be able to respond effectively to new challenges. The symposium emphasised that all state responses to the threat of terrorism must fully respect the international legal framework on the protection of human rights and the rule of law.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08101546000029"></a>Due to developments in financial markets, ECOFIN Ministers devoted a significant amount of their time to developing a co-ordinated set of principles to guide actions. The principles, which the UK fully supports, stresses that member states should:</p>
ensure that any interventions are timely, with the support being, in principle, temporary;be watchful regarding taxpayers interests;protect the legitimate interests of competitors, by having regard to state aid and competition rules; andavoid possible negative spillover effects.

Discussion focused particularly on prudential capital requirements and supervision of cross-border insurance groups.

Many of these systems have now exceeded their economic service life and major modernisation work is urgently required. It is becoming increasingly difficult to manage the existing services and to replace, repair or extend them as required in an efficient manner and there is a growing risk that breakdown in these services could not be quickly repaired. The complete project will take many years and will involve considerable cost.</p>

<a name="81015-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08101546000037"></a>The mechanical and electrical replacement must be carried out in the most economical way consistent with enabling both Houses to operate properly. Normal practice is that major works are only undertaken in the Palace of Westminster during the Summer Recess but the extensive scale of the work planned requires that a full range of options should be carefully considered. The House of Commons Commission has therefore ordered a detailed feasibility study to examine whether substantial savings in cost, time and risk could be made by moving some operations of both Houses out of the Palace for a period to enable modernisation to be carried out continuously until its completion. The Lord Speaker and I have agreed that the House of Lords will participate in this exercise. The feasibility study is expected to report in the middle of 2009. No decision will be taken until all options have been fully assessed.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08101546000039"></a>This consultation fulfils a commitment made by Government in an oral Statement by the then Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly, on 7 July where she emphasised that UK policy on biofuels will aim to ensure development of a sustainable biofuels industry.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08101546000040"></a>Amid growing concerns about the potential indirect impacts of biofuels on food supplies and prices, on deforestation and on greenhouse gas emissions, the Government commissioned Professor Ed Gallagher, chair of the Renewable Fuels Agency, to lead a review of the latest evidence on biofuels. The review concluded that the Government should amend but not abandon their biofuel policy. The review also stated that by 2020 biofuels have the potential to deliver greenhouse gas savings of 338 to 371 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and that there is a strong need for further evidence and monitoring to determine the sustainability and wider impacts of biofuels. In short, the review concluded that there was a future for biofuels, but that the Government should adopt a cautious approach until the wider environmental and social impacts of biofuels could be understood.</p>
