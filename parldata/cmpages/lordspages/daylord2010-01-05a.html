As a result, 50 services are at present subject to national commissioning, and the National Institute for Health Research supports vital research, including a great deal on haemato-oncology across the country.</p>

King's College Hospital is a world-class teaching hospital whose research in this area is absolutely superb, particularly at the new cellular therapy centre for research. We welcome close collaboration on all aspects of health science research, and in this instance we look forward to great results from this collaboration.</p>

As the noble Baroness will be aware, over a three-year period of transition we are funding research programmes contestably and transparently through rigorous competition. This is working very well indeed and we do not expect any reduction in the work. For example, the funding supports the department of haematology at King's College Hospital and the Guy's and St Thomas's Biomedical Research Centre. We have no reason to assume that this funding is under threat at all.</p>

Has any assessment been made of the reduction in charitable donations to such organisations? After all, some of the biggest donors were banking groups and many private donors are stressed for funds at the moment. Is there a plan B or will the work of these units be badly affected not only by cutbacks in government funding but by reductions in charitable donations?</p>

The department launched a consultation in December about this issue seeking views from industry, stakeholders and voluntary organisations on the development of the arrangements proposed in the Carter review, which the House discussed recently. This is about shaping how we commission services, new drugs and treatments for people with extremely rare conditions so that we end up with both a robust and fair system.</p>

In particular, is the Minister aware of the difficult circumstances of the unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, which is being affected by the shambles which has occurred in the PFI of the main part of the hospital? The buildings erected under the PFI are unfit for purpose and the remedy is to destroy part of the spinal injuries unit.</p>

The noble Lord and I both have connections with Stoke Mandeville-my grandfather spent 25 years of his life visiting the hospital-and we have discussed the issue of spinal injuries and how they are dealt with across the country. The location of spinal injury units and where people are given the best treatment is a major issue for those dealing with spinal injuries. I am not up to date on spinal injuries. The issue is not part of the Question, which is about haemato-oncology services, but I undertake to find out the up-to-date position on Stoke Mandeville and to let the noble Lord know.</p>

These are used extensively in teaching and research, as well as being open to the general public. The Government's policy is to continue to invest in higher education museums and galleries through special funding, which is administered by the Higher Education Funding Council for England-HEFCE. The fund currently invests £10 million a year. This funding is currently under review to ensure that judgments on special funding are based on clear principles, making the allocation of this special funding as consistent and transparent as possible.</p>

Does he acknowledge that university museums and galleries-which include, of course, the Ashmolean, the Fitzwilliam, the Courtauld, the Whitworth and the Sainsbury-hold no less than 30 per cent of all the nationally dedicated collections? That is an index of their importance not only to research and the creative economy but to the cultural life of us all. If, however, the existing £10 million of ring-fenced funding is to go into the general maw of a reduced block grant to the universities, what accounting procedures or other means will the Government require to be used to ensure that public funding in support of the university museums and galleries, which we ought to treasure as great national assets, is not diminished and remains clearly visible?</p>

We are currently undertaking a review of HEFCE funding for university museums and galleries. Sir Muir Russell is leading the review, which is considering both the museums and galleries that currently receive funding and those that do not. I have already expressed the view that we understand and recognise the importance of these collections, which my noble friend has indicated, because they are open to the public and because of their value in research and teaching. We fully endorse his view about the importance of these collections and we have made those views clear.

I draw the Minister's attention to the considerable contrast between the public funding of important national museums calculated on the basis of grant per visitor, compared with the grant per visitor to the Ashmolean Museum. Is it his belief that national museum grants range from £9.30 per visitor for the British Museum to £13.80 per visitor for the Natural History Museum, whereas funding for the Ashmolean-and, no doubt, for other university museums-is approximately £4.60 per visitor, and may become significantly less given the huge increase in the number of visitors since the Ashmolean's reopening?</p>

The cost per visitor is the result of a historical approach. Our concern should not be to decide which of these institutions is more important; the Ashmolean, the Petrie collection and a range of others, together with institutions such as the Natural History Museum, all have a valuable role to play. We believe that our funding overall has accomplished a significant and valuable task in helping these museums to survive, and we have indicated our intention that we want this to continue.</p>

It is also why we have introduced the educational maintenance award, which has had a huge impact on improving the participation of young people and why we are promoting the 14 to 19 reforms of the curriculum so that we are not trying to put square pegs into round holes and we really do have an engaging curriculum to encourage all young people; not only those who want to pursue an academic career.

Many of those about whom we are talking now who were educated in 2007 are now in the 18 to 24 year-old group. At 18.4 per cent, it is the highest level of unemployment since records began.</p>

The noble Lord knows better than most the impact of unemployment in areas of particular industrial decline around the country. However, we know from the review of my noble friend Lord Leitch looking at the skills that this country needs that we have to get more people into education. Low-skilled jobs are on the decline and it is vital that we have young people gaining skills and going on to university. That is why I, too, am proud that we have such ambitious aspirations to get more young people into university.</p>

In facing these tough economic times, young people in this country are in a better position than ever before. For example, we have a much lower rate of long-term youth unemployment now than we had in the 1980s and 1990s. We have the September guarantee, under which this Government have committed to ensuring that all 16 and 17 year-olds have a suitable offer of a place to continue in learning, should they wish to take it. This year, we also have the January guarantee, which is funded fully to make sure that all young people who find themselves NEET this month have the opportunity to take back-to-work courses and have education maintenance allowance. None of this was evident in the 1980s or early 1990s.</p>

We made it clear that she would be the first chief regulator following the passage of the relevant legislation and have repeatedly said that since. In June 2008, the Government announced that appointments of new<I></I>candidates<I></I>to various posts, including that of chief regulator, should be subject to pre-appointment hearings and that<I></I>existing appointments, such as that of Kathleen Tattersall, would fall outside those arrangements.</p>

Does the Minister not recall how many times during the passage of the apprenticeships Bill only a few weeks ago she tried to reassure me of the Government's commitment to a really independent Ofqual? In the light of that, would it not have been consistent and demonstrated that commitment, let alone been wise and uncharacteristically gracious, if the Secretary of State had consulted the Select Committee before finally appointing the chair of Ofqual?</p>

I say seriously on the point that the noble Baroness makes that I have looked carefully at this and asked officials to go through it in some detail to make sure that this is the case. Through the passage of the ASCL Bill, we were absolutely clear about the process for the appointment of the chief regulator and the chief executive of Ofqual. I am slightly bemused over how there could be such a misunderstanding about how the appointment of the chief regulator should be made. We made it clear when the interim chair was advertised, through the advertisement and the candidates' packs, as well as in quotes in the media, that once appointed as the interim chair the successful candidate-Kathleen Tattersall-would go on to become the chief regulator subject to the passing of the Bill. Also, the right honourable Jim Knight wrote to the chairman of the education Select Committee setting out how the process would work. I am slightly bemused as to how the misunderstanding has arisen, because we have been very clear.</p>

In her role as interim chair of interim Ofqual, I am sure she would have welcomed any invitation from the chairman of the Select Committee. There is absolutely no doubt about that, but it is not what we are talking about. We are talking about a proper, correct process that was independently monitored and scrutinised in the appropriate way by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. When you introduce a new policy, as I think was the case on 2 June 2008 when the Government announced the appointments that would be subject to pre-appointment process, there has to be a line. This appointment fell before that line, and so it has always been the case that Kathleen Tattersall would be, subject to the legislation creating Ofqual, appointed as the chief regulator. The Select Committee has the opportunity, whenever it wishes, to see Ofqual's chief regulator. I am sure that that will happen in due course.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="10010511000052"></a>Two thousand and twelve will be a landmark year for Her Majesty, Britain and the Commonwealth. Queen Victoria is the only British monarch to have celebrated a Diamond Jubilee. However modestly our present Queen might approach this celebration, I know that people across the whole country will want the chance to recognise this remarkable achievement, paying tribute to the Queen and celebrating with great pride and affection Her Majesty's 60 years on the throne. It will also be an opportunity for us as a country to reflect on the incredible changes that have taken place, both here and around the world, over the past six decades. We want this to be a nationwide celebration. Working with colleagues in Buckingham Palace and the devolved Administrations, we are currently planning a series of fitting events to enable communities all over the country to mark the Diamond Jubilee. Although we are still in the early stages of organisation, I can confirm to the House that these celebrations will take place around the first week of June 2012.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="10010511000053"></a>In honour of Her Majesty, we will create a special Diamond Jubilee weekend, moving the late May bank holiday to Monday 4 June, and adding an extra bank holiday on Tuesday 5 June. In Scotland, national holidays are a devolved matter and we will work closely with the Scottish Government to help ensure that people across the United Kingdom can celebrate the jubilee together.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="10010511000054"></a>In keeping with previous jubilees, we also plan to issue a Diamond Jubilee medal. Over the next few months we will be considering this in more detail, and who should be eligible to receive it. In addition, we will be holding national competitions to be launched later this year for city status, a Lord Mayoralty and Lord Provostship. Further details of these and other government plans for the Diamond Jubilee are available in the Printed Paper Office as well as online, via the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's website (www.culture.gov.uk/diamondjubilee).</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10010511000055"></a>Finally, I can confirm that the Queen has agreed, as a mark of royal favour, to confer royal borough status on the London Borough of Greenwich. This rare honour is to be bestowed in recognition of the historically close links forged between Greenwich and our royal family, from the Middle Ages to the present day, and the borough's global significance as the home of the Prime Meridian, Greenwich Mean Time and a UNESCO world heritage site.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10010511000056"></a>Further announcements will follow as our plans for the Diamond Jubilee are confirmed, but I know that voluntary organisations and local communities will benefit from this early indication of the relevant dates. This will be a truly historic occasion and a testament

We very much welcome his announcement that Her Majesty the Queen's Diamond Jubilee is to be recognised by an extra bank holiday.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10010511000058"></a>This announcement follows the introduction of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Bill in another place by my colleague Andrew Rosindell on 10 November last. As a member of Her Majesty's Opposition and one who has held the position of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Treasurer of Her Majesty's Household, I agree entirely with the Minister's tribute to Her Majesty's remarkable achievements. Her Majesty has led this country and the Commonwealth unerringly through the many years of her reign. The United Kingdom and the world have changed enormously since she ascended the throne. Throughout it all, Her Majesty has been an example to us all.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10010511000059"></a>The success of the Golden Jubilee in 2002 showed just how strongly the public feel about such an exemplary monarch. The outpouring of patriotism, respect and pride that we saw then owes nothing to any manufactured sentiment. It was not the result of a government focus group or a political campaign but a spontaneous expression of the pride and respect that citizens of this country feel about our society, heritage, institutions and, above all, our monarch. Despite the knocks that we have suffered in the past few years, the current state of the economy and the disillusionment with some of our institutions, this public pride in our country still stands firm. There is no doubt in my mind that the Diamond Jubilee will be the most popular and celebrated event.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10010511000060"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a little more detail about exactly what plans are being considered by the Government, especially given the speculation over several possible schemes which appeared in the newspapers at the end of last month. In particular, can the Minister confirm that he is considering a new youth volunteer scheme? I strongly believe that encouraging the participation of young people in volunteer schemes is a wonderful idea. My party has for years called for greater support of voluntary bodies.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10010511000061"></a>Volunteering benefits both society and the individual and often provides the glue that holds communities together. With youth unemployment at today's record levels and the rising number of young people not in education, employment or training, I hope that these celebrations will include events that will confirm the critical role that young people play in our society and the enormous potential they have to enrich local communities and the public sphere.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10010511000062"></a>Will there be any acknowledgement of the Olympics during these celebrations? We recall that government sources indicated that there was an intention to link the two events in a single celebration, but there is no mention of that in the Statement. Does that mean that  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_13"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at last the Government appreciate that Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee is of sufficient moment itself to justify a very special celebration? What other plans are being considered for welcoming the Olympics to London?</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10010511000063"></a>I add my congratulations to the London Borough of Greenwich on its new status, and I welcome such an important historical area being honoured in this way. I also welcome the striking of a special medal to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee, and I hope that on this occasion the long public service given by key parliamentary staff will be recognised. We look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

First, to get the matter out of the way, many congratulations to Greenwich. It was represented in Parliament by Gladstone, although, as Roy Jenkins points out in his biography of Gladstone, he never actually visited his constituency.</p>

<a name="100105-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10010511000065"></a>Interestingly, although the Commonwealth is mentioned in the Statement, there is no mention of consultation with Commonwealth heads of government. Given that the Queen has so often throughout her reign emphasised her pride in and her commitment to the Commonwealth, can we be assured that Commonwealth Governments will be involved in these preparations and celebrations? Taking on the theme of youth, it would be an excellent opportunity to set up a jubilee education fund for the Commonwealth that is associated with the Queen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10010511000066"></a>The Lord President is far too young, but I remember the 1953 coronation and the street parties and the mugs. We must have both street parties and mugs. My 1953 coronation mug has been lost, so I certainly want a 2012 jubilee mug, and I will be on the look-out for that. The other thing that I welcome is the competition for city status, so that Britain's premier seaside resort, Blackpool, can join Britain's number two seaside resort as a city.</p>

He is right in saying that I do not remember the coronation in 1953, as that was the year in which I was born. I am, none the less, very happy to take ministerial responsibility for street parties.

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10010511000070"></a>I should say to the noble Lord that this will be a celebration not just for all of us in Britain, but also for those across the Commonwealth.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10010511000072"></a>I remember past jubilees. I remember the 1977 Silver Jubilee very well. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I were leading the British Youth Council at around that time, and worked very closely with the noble Lord, Lord McNally-that eminent political adviser to the then Prime Minister. In particular, I remember how various events and activities across the country brought people together in a national celebration, regardless of any differences that they might have had. The Golden Jubilee celebrations were similarly memorable, as, I am sure, the Diamond Jubilee will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10010511000073"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for once again suggesting the resurrection of some sort of youth volunteer scheme. I am sure that this will be among the ideas to be considered, but I can give no greater or further commitment than that. He asked about acknowledgment of the Olympics. I should stress that there will be no link between the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and the Olympics, although there will certainly be a great summer in the UK. It will start with the Diamond Jubilee and end some months later with the Olympics. Unlike my ministerial responsibility for the Diamond Jubilee, I have no further ministerial responsibility for the Olympics, so I am unable to answer his other questions about how we will welcome them. Contrary to impressions, I do not actually run everything, thank you very much, but I am sure that those who are responsible will be able to take up the point he made.</p>

I associate this Bench with all that has been said in appreciation of Her Majesty's service to this country and in anticipation of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. We in particular have reason to be grateful to her as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and to have valued her clear witness to her own Christian faith, while properly respecting and making space for those of all faiths and none within the citizenry of this country. As the Bishop of Leicester during the Golden Jubilee celebrations, I was able to witness at first hand how the communities-Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Jewish and all the world faiths-warmly responded in a united celebration by the whole city. I am sure that we all anticipate something at least as vivid and celebratory in the proposals that the Minister has brought to us.</p>

Would it not be a great opportunity for St David's Day to be recognised as an official bank holiday in celebration of the Diamond Jubilee? Also, I noted that there was little mention of Parliament. How are we, as a Parliament, going to celebrate? Will it not be an opportunity to have some sort of link between Parliament and the monarchy-an historical pageant even? Perhaps the Minister will consider setting up a working group to see how we in Parliament can celebrate this occasion.</p>

Trees have played a considerable, significant and important role in the Royal Family, who have frequently been associated with such ceremonies in various parts of the country. It would be an admirable gesture if all parts of the country were to mark the occasion with the planting of trees suitable for this environment.</p>

It has, after all, been the home of many monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I died there, George III went mad there, and most of it was my old constituency.</p>

Royal borough status is purely honorific. It is granted by the sovereign personally as an exceptional mark of royal favour. In case anyone is interested, I should say that it confers absolutely no additional funding or powers whatever on the borough concerned. None the less, it is a very important status and I am sure that due consideration will be given to Richmond, although I cannot lead the noble Baroness to expect an early announcement.</p>

We have chosen the latter course. Having made the announcement this afternoon, it will now be open, not only to the Government but also to the representatives of the Commonwealth, to have the kind of discussions which the noble Lord asks for.</p>

I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Queen still represents some Caribbean islands and that many people represent Her Majesty in those islands. I have a particular interest because my sister was the first native-born Grenadian to represent Her Majesty and she did so for six years. I hope that, this time, someone will remember to send such people a letter of invitation or at least recognise the part they have played in representing Her Majesty so ably.</p>

Over six decades, across the Commonwealth as a whole, many people have contributed to the success and enjoyment of the Queen's reign. Therefore, many people will want to be remembered and want to participate in the celebrations. They will not, of course, all celebrate in London or in this country; they will celebrate in countries and local communities in all parts of the world. That reflects the nature and strength of the Commonwealth and the enormous love which people have for Her Majesty the Queen in so many parts of the world.</p>

I thank him for doing so. I offer him a slightly broader thought. If my memory serves me right, I recall, as a boy, being herded along with thousands of other young people in Belfast to greet the new monarch. Although there will be an element of stress to Her Majesty, I encourage those who make the decisions throughout the course of the year-it cannot be done in a weekend-to enable as many people in the nation as possible to see their monarch on the Diamond Jubilee without having to come to London.</p>

Those armed forces now provide the dominant contribution to UN peacekeeping forces. We in this country are very bad at linking and symbolising the extent to which our military contribution is now undertaken with other European and Commonwealth countries.

In doing so, I welcome the fact that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford has chosen to make his maiden speech on this measure and look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10010511000097"></a>A decade ago this Government made an historic commitment to end child poverty by 2020. At the time we made that pledge, child poverty was rising inexorably and had doubled over the previous 20 years. Had we simply moved forward with the policies that we inherited, about 2.1 million more children would have been likely to be in relative poverty today. We did not; we chose to act. We acted by investing well over £25 billion in early years and childcare since 1997, with some 3,000 Sure Start children's centres currently helping 2.4 million young children and their families. We acted by delivering direct tax and benefit measures which, since 1997, mean that in 2010-11, households with children will be, on average, £2,200 a year better off; and households with children in the bottom fifth of the income distribution will be, on average, £5,000 a year better off.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10010511000098"></a>We acted by helping more lone parents into work. Since the New Deal for Lone Parents was introduced, more than 625,000 lone parents have been helped into work, of whom almost 60 per cent have moved into sustainable jobs. We acted by establishing the minimum wage, ensuring that people are not paid a poverty wage. Those and other measures have made a substantial difference to many families, without which many more would be in poverty today.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10010511000099"></a>We have made significant progress in tackling child poverty. We have turned around that upward trend and, by 2007-08, helped to lift 500,000 children out of relative poverty. We have halved the number of children in absolute poverty from 3.4 million to 1.7 million.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10010511000100"></a>Measures announced since Budget 2007 will lift a further 550,000 children out of relative poverty. That includes the announcement in last month's PBR to extend provision of free school meals to primary school-aged children in low-income working households. That may require primary legislative changes and we are considering whether it may be appropriate to include these changes in the Child Poverty Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10010511000101"></a>Despite substantial progress, there is still a huge amount to do to meet our commitment. Child poverty still blights the daily lives of many-too many-children, families and communities across the UK. A child who grows up in poverty may lack many of the experiences and opportunities that others take for granted, and can be exposed to severe hardship and social exclusion.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10010511000102"></a>Childhood experience lays the foundations for later life. Growing up in poverty can damage physical, cognitive, social and emotional development, which

To borrow an expression used by my noble friend Lord Morris in the Queen's Speech debate, this can create "spirals of poverty", pernicious cycles of inter-generational poverty that lock families into deprivation. Indeed, as my noble friend so aptly stated,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000243"></a>"the spiral continues-never upwards, always downwards. Not only does inequality affect the family now, it affects the future of every member of that family and, perhaps, for generations yet unborn".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/11/09; col. 512.]</ul>
<p><a name="10010511000225"></a>We can and must do more to ensure that disadvantage and deprivation do not transmit through generations.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10010511000103"></a>Tackling child poverty will help improve children's lives today, and it will also enhance their life chances enabling them to make the most of their talents, achieve their full potential in life and pass on benefits to their own children.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10010511000104"></a>Child poverty also places substantial costs and burdens on the economy and on public services. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates that child poverty is costing at least £25 billion a year in extra public spending, lost taxes and lost GDP. These costs fall not just on children and families in poverty, but on communities in general and the taxpayer, so it is clear that there is both a strong moral and economic imperative for taking further action to tackle the causes and consequences of child poverty. To do this, we must shape a society where children do not have their lives scarred by poverty and where every child has the chance to realise their potential, no matter what their background.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10010511000105"></a>The current economic circumstances we face have brought additional challenges to tackling child poverty. Everyone recognises it will be hard to meet the target to halve child poverty by 2010, but we will continue to strive to make progress, and the Bill underlines our commitment and determination to succeed.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10010511000106"></a>There are five key aspects of the Child Poverty Bill that I should like to focus on in this Second Reading speech. First, the Bill provides a definition of success in tackling child poverty by setting targets that must be met by 2020. Secondly, it will ensure that targeted and sustained action to address child poverty is taken on a comprehensive basis by requiring the Government to prepare and publish child poverty strategies through to 2020. Thirdly, it will boost the transparency and accountability of government through its reporting requirements. Fourthly, it will ensure that co-ordinated action is taken across the UK by requiring specific action from the devolved Administrations. Finally, it will require action at local level to prioritise the tackling of child poverty and improve outcomes for disadvantaged children and their families.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10010511000107"></a>Clause 1 imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to meet, by 2020, four challenging UK-wide targets set down in Clauses 2 to 5. The targets relate to relative poverty, absolute poverty, combined low income and material deprivation and, finally, persistent poverty. A range of targets is needed to capture the many facets of child poverty, and these four targets have been chosen following rigorous public consultation. The Government already measure progress against the relative, absolute and combined low income and material  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_20"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deprivation measures. The persistent poverty target was included following research demonstrating that long periods of poverty have a particularly damaging effect on a child's life chances and that the risk of escaping poverty decreases the longer the period in poverty. Taken together, the targets provide a challenging definition of success for tackling child poverty by 2020 and allow progress towards this goal to be measured.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10010511000108"></a>However, the Bill goes much further than just setting targets, important as they are. It establishes a mechanism for driving forward progress towards meeting them by requiring the Government to prepare and publish a child poverty strategy through to 2020. Clause 8 commits the Secretary of State to publish the strategy within a year of Royal Assent, and it must be refreshed every three years. The strategy is for the whole of the UK and should cover all children, so it is not only about meeting the targets but about ensuring that children in the UK do not experience socio-economic disadvantage.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10010511000109"></a>The Bill deliberately avoids being too prescriptive about the content of the strategy. Such specificity would not be appropriate, as each three-year strategy will need to respond to changing circumstances between now and 2020, building on evidence about what works in tackling child poverty. It is envisaged that more specific measures will be considered as appropriate for each three-year phase. However, Clause 8(5) specifies a number of broad policy areas that must be considered when preparing strategies. These encompass the main drivers for tackling child poverty, which have been developed following an extensive period of analysis, discussion and consultation with internal and external stakeholders. I should stress that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of policies. Indeed, there is nothing to prevent consideration of a wide range of policies which may help to end child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10010511000110"></a>We recognise that the causes and consequences of child poverty are multiple and complex, and that it is not possible to rely solely on one policy measure. Ending child poverty will require co-ordinated and sustained action across all areas of government policy. Noble Lords may be aware that this provision prompted much debate in the other place, with Members seeking to insert additional policy areas. We resisted this approach as many of the proposed areas were already effectively covered in the Bill. There was, however, clear support on all sides that childcare should be more explicitly stated in the Bill, a proposition we accepted by way of a government amendment.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10010511000111"></a>Before I move on to other measures of the Bill, I should like briefly to touch on Clause 9, which requires that the strategy is informed by a range of views, including those of the Child Poverty Commission and the devolved Administrations. There was some concern in another place that the Bill does not spell out our intention to seek the views of children as clearly as it could. Some Members felt that Clause 9(4)(c) should be amended so that the Secretary of State is required to consult such children and organisations working with or representing children as the Secretary of State thinks fit.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10010511000112"></a>We have always been clear that the strategy will be informed by the views of children and their families, particularly those with direct experience of poverty.  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_21"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We are committed to ensuring that children's views underpin all our policies to improve outcomes for all children. However, we recognise a concern that the Bill could be interpreted as leaving room for the option of not consulting directly with children and we are considering whether it is necessary to clarify the wording on this matter.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10010511000113"></a>Another important aspect is about setting an accountability framework and securing expert, independent advice to inform the development of child poverty strategies. Clauses 13 and 14 require annual reports to Parliament on progress made on the targets and steps outlined in the strategy. This means that Government will, for the first time, be properly held to account for delivery on their strategies to end child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10010511000114"></a>Clause 7 and Schedule 1 establish the Child Poverty Commission, an advisory body that the Government must consult when preparing child poverty strategies. Clause 9 requires the Government to have regard to the commission's advice and Schedule 1 requires that this advice is made public. This will ensure that it is clear to Parliament and the public what steps the commission thought were necessary in the development of the strategy. Commission members will be selected on merit against criteria published at the start of the appointment process. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 requires that the Secretary of State will appoint the chair and any such number of members as he sees fit. In addition, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will each appoint a member. In appointing members, paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 requires that the Secretary of State must aim for a commission that has knowledge and experience of child poverty policy, research and work with families. This will ensure that the commission is able to provide the best possible advice on what works best in tackling child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10010511000115"></a>During debate in another place, Members on all sides pressed the Government to provide the commission with a research function to support its work under the Bill. We were persuaded that using its expertise and experience the commission may identify particular areas where, in order to improve the quality and effectiveness of its advice, it feels new research would be helpful. It may be that the necessary new knowledge can be generated by mining existing research and data from a fresh perspective, or there may be a need to conduct entirely original primary research.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10010511000116"></a>We responded by tabling a government amendment to Schedule 1, which now, through paragraph 10, empowers the commission at any time to request the Secretary of State to carry out or to commission research on its behalf with a view to improving the effectiveness of its advice. This model follows the very successful one used by the Low Pay Commission, an advisory body that is renowned for the quality of its research. This will improve the quality and independence of its advice to the Secretary of State. There are also non-legislative research means at the commission's disposal. The commission will be provided with a secretariat that will offer librarian-style research support that includes finding, and where necessary collating and summarising, research materials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10010511000117"></a>The goal to eradicate child poverty by 2020 is UK-wide, although a number of the levers for tackling child poverty are devolved. We recognise that the devolved Administrations are best placed to determine how to tackle child poverty in their jurisdictions in line with their particular priorities. Clauses 10 to 12 separately provide for Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers to prepare their own strategies. These strategies will set out how they will contribute to the UK-wide targets as well as how they will ensure that children in their respective countries do not experience socio-economic disadvantage. Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers are required to consult a range of partners, including the Secretary of State and the Child Poverty Commission, and must prepare annual reports on progress. Our goal is UK-wide, so our approach to tackling child poverty must be co-ordinated across all Administrations. Strategies prepared by the devolved Administrations must also be considered in future UK child poverty strategies.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10010511000118"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government introduced the proposed Children and Families (Wales) Measure on 2 March 2009. The measure places similar duties on Welsh Ministers and other public bodies in Wales to prepare child poverty strategies and to report on progress as the Child Poverty Bill places on the Secretary of State and Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers. Clause 9(5) includes provisions to ensure that the UK Government have regard to the Welsh strategy when preparing a UK child poverty strategy. The Welsh measure also includes provision to consult the Secretary of State on the content of Welsh Ministers' strategy. The two pieces of legislation therefore complement each other and provide a joint framework to ensure that all four countries work together towards the 2020 goal.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10010511000119"></a>Finally, tackling child poverty is not just a priority for central government; it should also be seen as core business by local authorities and their delivery partners. This view was shared by witnesses to the oral evidence sessions in another place. The justification for this focus is clear; child poverty is present in every locality across the country but is often masked by overall affluence. In many areas, poverty has persisted for generations, damaging the general and economic well-being of the area. Tackling child poverty helps local communities. It will reduce the burdens placed on local services and create a more cohesive society.</p>

<a name="100105-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10010511000120"></a>Many local authorities have already made a commitment to tackling child poverty, and pockets of excellent work are under way. There are examples of vision and leadership in helping families to get support, in narrowing gaps in education, in helping parents into work or in regenerating communities to help families to escape the experiences of poverty. Unfortunately, progress varies across the country and best practice is not universally shared. We now have to make it a priority for all local areas. Meeting our challenging target therefore requires all local authorities and partners to do more. We know that we can achieve our ambitions only with their absolute buy-in and with child poverty high on their agendas. Clause 20 therefore introduces a new requirement on responsible local authorities and relevant delivery partners to work together to tackle child poverty in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10010511000121"></a>Respondents to the Bill's consultation indicated that it was important to name the key partners in the legislation. We share this view and have listed the relevant partner authorities in Clause 19. The importance of understanding the needs of local communities was also raised by respondents to the consultation, and we have responded by placing a duty to carry out a local child poverty needs assessment in Clause 21. We intend to set out how local partnerships should carry out a needs assessment in statutory guidance. The Bill will ensure that all local authorities and their partners take strategic, co-ordinated action by requiring them in Clause 22 to prepare joint child poverty strategies based on an analysis of the needs and characteristics of children in poverty in their areas. The Bill also amends the Local Government Act 2000 to ensure that local authorities take the duties under this Bill into account when preparing their sustainable community strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10010511000122"></a>Child poverty is not only a moral issue but also a key component of economic and social prosperity in the UK. It is right that we refresh and strengthen our commitment to deliver on the 2020 goal through the Child Poverty Bill. It will give us a renewed impetus to deliver on our goals, to ensure that the right strategies are in place and to stimulate actions which make a difference. It will build on and sustain the momentum towards eradicating child poverty, create a clear definition of success, put in place a framework for accountability, and improve partnership working and collaboration to tackle child poverty at the local level. We believe this legislation is part of creating a fairer Britain, one where no child suffers from deprivation and every child has the opportunity to aspire and to flourish. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<a name="10010511000123"></a><b><a name="100105-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10010511000356"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, why did child poverty in the UK stop declining in 2004? It simply should not have happened. Everything was set up to see the measure continuing to improve. We were talking then about the fourth largest economy in the world; that economy was enjoying a major boom, and we had a Government who had focused on the reduction of child poverty as a major policy goal. Whatever criticisms I may have of the Government in this area, I do not doubt for a moment their sincerity in wishing to reduce the levels of child poverty. So why did those improvements go into abrupt reverse in 2004? It is the sociological whodunit of our era.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10010511000124"></a>Let me provide the figures to your Lordships. When this Government came into office in 1997, 4.2 million children were in households below the poverty line, defined as below 60 per cent of median income and using the figure after housing costs. In 2004-05, the best year, the figure had fallen to 3.6 million, but by 2007-08 it had risen again to 4 million. I do not use these figures to make a cheap political point. I do not accuse the Government of callous disregard. The truth is that the Government have been pouring money into the fight against child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10010511000125"></a>In the first year, 1997-98, transfers in the shape of credits and benefits to households with children stood at £15.5 billion. By our turning point year of 2004-05,  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_24"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they had nearly doubled to almost £29 billion, from which level they have continued to grow. So it is not a lack of government spending that lies behind this disturbing trend. Indeed, the OECD found that by 2003 we were spending more on our children than most other OECD countries.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10010511000126"></a>Let me try to explain these counterintuitive developments. Clearly, there has been an effect from the slowdown in earnings growth since early in the decade. That slowdown has been magnified by the sharp redistribution of income in favour of the richest in the country. It means that the conventional measure of income inequality, the Gini coefficient, rose to its highest level since records began in 1961. I must confess that until I studied these recent numbers closely, I had not realised that new Labour was quite so much the party of the rich. Nevertheless, these factors alone are not enough to explain the disturbing trend in child poverty that we have seen. The clue has been lying under our noses all the time. Perhaps it is not the case that child poverty has risen despite money being transferred to the poorest sections of the community, but maybe the financial transfers themselves have masked poverty and created poverty traps. At this point, let me make it quite clear that, despite Government alarmism, we will retain tax credits. They have been a financial benefit to families but we do not assume, as the Government have in the past, that they are the only answer to child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10010511000127"></a>There were warnings about the operation of the poverty trap in the 1970s but, as we contemplate what is forecast to be a substantial shortfall from the interim 2010 child poverty target, perhaps we should turn to examine what has more recently been dubbed the iron triangle of benefit reform. For the first time we can begin to assess its impact as a result of the analytical work of the Centre for Social Justice and Oliver Wyman in their recent publication, <I>Dynamic Benefits</I>-a formidable achievement by a working group chaired by Dr Stephen Brien.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10010511000128"></a>The triangle is the closest thing to scientific law in the social sciences and establishes a mathematical relationship between three factors: the level of benefit; the earnings break-even point; and the rate at which benefits are withdrawn. The analysis in <I>Dynamic Benefits</I> offers up the grim warning that,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000244"></a>"there are mathematical constraints on the design of the benefits system. These mean that simply pouring money in will make little difference-and indeed is massively inefficient-and that we must make a normative choice based on a societal vision: a society mostly on benefits or off benefits".</ul>
<a name="100105-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10010511000129"></a>As it stands, the Bill is two-headed. It contains within it the drive towards income transfers, which has been the hallmark of Treasury strategy in this area, as Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Permanent Secretary, explained to the Treasury Select Committee in 2007. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000245"></a>"financial support is the most important lever".</ul>
<p><a name="10010511000226"></a>This is the kind of intervention that our experience since 2004 suggests has broken down-failed. However, the Bill also encourages a wide range of interventions via public services of the kind that is embodied in the Welfare Reform Act that we have just passed. It is this   


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_25"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>latter aspect of the Bill that we wish to reinforce. Our strategy will concentrate on tackling the causes rather than the symptoms of poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10010511000130"></a>Child poverty is not a concept commonly used in European social policy. This is not surprising as children normally do not have income or wealth themselves. It sounds great; it is a compelling soundbite; and in March 1999, when Tony Blair first announced a goal to end child poverty in a generation, it captured the imagination of the country. However, there are two ideas at war with each other within the soundbite: the first concerns general poverty and minimum standards of living for citizens; the second is about child well-being. It is dangerous to put the two together in the unthinking way that new Labour has done, not least because we risk undermining the strategies that matter most for child well-being. We urgently need to get those strategies sorted out. According to UNICEF we are ranked bottom of 21 rich countries in child well-being despite spending more and being richer than most of them. Not half way; the very worst.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10010511000131"></a>The Child Poverty Action Group recommends a holistic approach to tackling the problem of poverty and pursues the approach now being developed in welfare to work. It states that in the same way it is already recognised that a,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000246"></a>"personalised, multifaceted service is required to assist jobseekers successfully into employment",</ul>
<p><a name="10010511000227"></a>so a similar approach needs to be applied to poverty. This mirrors our strategy-perhaps not surprisingly, given our involvement in developing this policy approach in welfare.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10010511000132"></a>First, let me emphasise the Conservative belief in the importance of tackling poverty. This goes to the roots of one nation conservatism. Secondly, let me confirm that we believe that poverty is indeed a relative phenomenon-in other words, that we should seek to ensure that the poor are not excluded from the mainstream of society. That means a series of strategies to tackle problem areas which have been increasingly well documented in recent years. I particularly want to emphasise the importance of stable families, which has been a central Conservative policy for many years. The number of lone parent households-those most likely to be in poverty-has increased by 40,000 a year for the last quarter century. Yet the Child Poverty Action Group found that,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000247"></a>"the effect of separation on a couple (whether married or cohabiting) in terms of increasing the risk of poverty was much greater than for any of the other triggers that we were able to investigate, including job loss".</ul>
<a name="100105-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10010511000133"></a>Let me summarise the four problem areas we will target. On family breakdown, our commitment to ending the couple penalty in the tax credits system is just one of a series of measures to tackle this critical issue. The second is addiction to drugs and alcohol. We will put rehabilitation at the forefront of efforts to tackle this problem. The third is education and skills. We will introduce a pupil premium to ensure that extra funds follow the poorest children to the school that educates them. The fourth is work strategy. We will push ahead aggressively to establish outcome-based financing to support those who are economically inactive and able to work back into the workforce.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10010511000134"></a>How would we amend the Bill? Our key concern is that the targets set out in the Bill are poor proxies for achieving the eradication of child poverty. We will aim to widen the agenda and build up targets, which are more likely to address the underlying causes of poverty. Let me spell out our concern about the statutory financial targets. While financial measures can be a useful guide to action, when they become targets we need to look at them with much more rigour. If they are taken seriously, they will inevitably become subject to serious manipulation and may encourage counterproductive activity by the state. There are already disturbing signs of this. According to Save the Children and the IFS, the number of children in severe poverty had been growing even before the 2004 turning-point year, as policy concentrated on pushing those just under the 60 per cent line to just over it. That is exactly opposite to the effect that most voters, appalled by child poverty, actually want to see.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10010511000135"></a>The targets selected for this Bill do not measure the problem accurately enough. A substantial number of families, according to the IFS, manage to remain out of hardship even during prolonged periods of poverty. We see here the distortions created by a set of targets relying in the main on surveys with all the confusion for respondents on what to report. This distortion is undoubtedly compounded by the anxiety that people operating in the black economy must feel in providing accurate information.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10010511000136"></a>Central to the Government's targeting is the OECD reference point of 60 per cent of median income, with a standard equivalence scale. This makes it possible to compare our performance with that of other countries. But we are, I believe, the first country to aim to adopt this figure and scale as a statutory target, and a statutory target carries with it a far higher requirement for precision. First, how genuinely comparable is the figure across countries? It does not include benefits in kind; it does not adjust for the benefits of free healthcare, for instance. There are a lot of apples and pears in the basket.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10010511000137"></a>Does the equivalence scale, which adjusts for different sizes of household, work? Ominously, the IFS found that the modified OECD income equivalence scale may be inappropriate. As Policy Exchange has pointed out, different equivalence scales will generate quite different poverty estimates. These discrepancies really start to matter if we have statutory targets. We will be driven to devote resources to the wrong people. The purely financial nature of the measurement is a real danger. As the OECD publication <I>Doing Better for Children</I> recommended:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="10010511000235"></a>"Interventions in early childhood need to be both in cash and in kind.... The higher the risk in the family situation, the more effective ... services in kind will be".</p>

<p><a name="10010511000228"></a>Yet such effective interventions will be discouraged under this legislation. It could also spell the death knell for passported benefits delivered in kind and not included in the measured target.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10010511000138"></a>What is it with round numbers? As a comparison base, using the figure of 60 per cent is not a matter of great moment. As a statutory target, however, it takes on an altogether different significance. The laws of the iron triangle are inexorable. If we wish to reduce the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_27"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>numbers in poverty, we need to set strategies that work within the constraints of the three sides of the triangle, not set one side at a predetermined level that will inevitably not optimise outcomes.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10010511000139"></a>Such considerations will drive the amendments that we will seek. We will want the flexibility to establish financial targets that will work in the real world. We will want targets that capture the real outcomes that we have identified. We will also want a commission that will help us in this strategy. At the moment the membership is locked in. That reeks of a political subterfuge designed to trap a successor Government rather than a measure to help the poor.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10010511000140"></a>My noble friend Lord De Mauley will deal with the role of local authorities and the duties of the proposed new commission in his winding-up speech. We look forward to the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10010511000141"></a>I shall summarise the points that I have made. We have the lowest child well-being in a comparison of 21 rich countries. The Government's child poverty targeting regime has failed, broken on the iron triangle. This double failure suggests that the next Government must urgently search out and establish an alternative approach. For that reason, our policy in this area will concentrate on the causes of poverty and inadequate child welfare, with particular focus on the four main drivers: family breakdown, addiction, inadequate education and skills, and work. We will seek to incentivise outcomes in these areas, and we will wish to use poverty targets as a guide and spur to performance but not as a driver towards financial manipulation. The difference between our Benches and the Government on child poverty is that we will apply policies to deal with the causes, while all they have to offer are stale and historic soundbites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10010511000144"></a>On the plus side, the Bill puts child poverty explicitly further up the political agenda than it has ever been, and the statutory nature of targets in the Bill should ensure that it stays there.

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10010511000145"></a>Several myths were exploded during the evidence sessions, especially where lone parents and poverty are concerned. The first myth is that most lone parents are teenagers, whereas only about 2 per cent are-the average age of lone parents is in fact 36. Another myth is that single parenthood automatically leads to child poverty. In countries with a similar rate of single parenthood, child poverty is much lower than it is in this country. However, it is true that children in single-parent families face twice the risk of poverty facing those in two-parent families. A major cause of that is spelt out in Gingerbread's written evidence: the fact that median gross weekly earnings for male lone parents is £346 whereas the median for lone mothers, who are the majority of lone parents, is £194.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10010511000146"></a>The Long Title of the Bill states that it sets,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000248"></a>"targets relating to the eradication of child poverty".</ul>
<p><a name="10010511000229"></a>Many people have questioned the novel use of the word "eradication", which seems to allow for 10 per cent of children to remain in poverty when eradication has been achieved. Perhaps it is a smoke screen to hide the fact that, in 2007, 23 per cent of UK children were in poverty-shamefully, as we have heard, among the worst figures in Europe. The Government's target, announced by the Prime Minister in 1999, of halving child poverty in 10 years will now certainly not be met. Have the Government introduced the Bill to atone for their failure to deal adequately with child poverty over the past 10 years? Steve Webb, my colleague in another place and an expert in this field, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10010511000236"></a>"Tackling child poverty is a bit like running up a down escalator. If we do not do very much, we end up going backwards".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Child Poverty Bill Committee, 27/10/09; col. 191.]</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10010511000147"></a>Beside that figure of 23 per cent, a 10 per cent target by 2020 looks quite good, if unambitious, and appears to be a sustainable figure compared to equivalent countries in Europe, although it still means that two-thirds of 1 million children will be left in poverty. On top of this figure must be those children not included in the household surveys, such as the 60,000 looked-after children. We recognise that it is very difficult to measure the level of poverty of children who do not live in households, but Richard Kemp, the deputy chair of the Local Government Association, put his finger on an important point when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="10010511000237"></a>"If we do not help them early, we know we will be dealing with them for the rest of their lives".</p>

<p><a name="10010511000230"></a>My noble friend Lady Walmsley will say more about that problem later.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10010511000148"></a>To a layman, the four targets in Clause 1 seem at first glance to be mind-numbing in their subtle complexity and seeming similarity, but with the help of the <I>Peers Information Pack</I> one discovers the differences. We believe  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_29"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the one target that could be dropped is the absolute low income target. The figures for households below average income-HBAI in the jargon, which we shall come across a lot in the Bill-provide statistics for the preceding 10 years, so, nine years later, poverty is virtually certain to have been improved in that time. In other words, the Government are bound to meet that target without even trying. This is a classic example of picking the low-hanging fruit. Our suggestion is either to drop that target, attractive though it would be to any Government, and substitute it with a different target that measures income after the deduction of housing costs, or to add this as a fifth target. This would not involve more work, because the information is published regularly in the HBAI statistics.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10010511000149"></a>As we all know, housing is a large part of most people's budget and thus of their living standards. The cost of housing is particularly important in low-income areas, where rents are no lower as a result of the recession but income probably is. It is also important in London and other urban areas, where housing takes a high proportion of people's income. If it is argued that even poor people can choose whether to live in a more expensive or a cheaper house, evidence shows that this is not the case. People often have no choice about what sort of house they live in, because of constraints over jobs, schools, transport and other factors. Another reason is the curious fact that the measure of income before housing costs includes housing benefit. Unless this figure is discounted, it will look as though a large family receiving housing benefit has a pretty high income, which makes a nonsense of the figures. It also masks the situation in poor rural areas where housing takes up a disproportionate amount of a person's income.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10010511000150"></a>The Minister may say that housing is included in the questions under the material deprivation measure; so it is, but the questions are only about keeping a house adequately decorated and having enough bedrooms. Housing costs are not stripped out as they would be with an after housing cost target. Kate Bell of Gingerbread said that the sector view has always been that the after housing costs measure of poverty is the better one; Neera Sharma of Save the Children agreed. This is echoed in the summary of consultation responses, under the heading "Targets and measurement" in the impact assessment for the Bill, on page 122 of the <I>Peers Information Pack</I>. The second bullet point reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10010511000238"></a>"Measuring income after housing costs was considered by stakeholders to be the best way to determine accurate levels of poverty".</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10010511000151"></a>If the Government themselves continue to collect the after housing costs, this proves that they think that they are worth having, so why not add them as a target for relative low income?</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10010511000152"></a>Perhaps the real reason why the Government want to stick with the before housing cost target is that this is the figure used in most of Europe. The Minister in another place said that the ability to make comparisons was vital, as it would allow Governments to benchmark their performance. Is being able to make comparisons with other European countries really the most vital thing, particularly given the problem of apples and pears, about which the noble Lord, Lord Freud, talked? Surely the most important issue is what gives the

We shall introduce an amendment along these lines at the appropriate stage.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10010511000153"></a>I turn to the problems relating to households with either a disabled parent or a disabled child, on which the Bill appears to be silent but which are very important, given the high costs associated with disability. Clause 6 is about various matters to be set out in regulations. We believe that the costs associated with disability should be included at this point. In a nutshell, either disability living allowance should be taken out of the figures to find out what a household's disposable income is or account should be taken of the higher cost of living for somebody with a disability, which might include increased heating, particularly in this weather, a particular diet, transport, specialised childcare or all of these. If DLA is included in the household's disposable income, it will surely distort the figures, giving that household a relatively high income with no account being taken of outgoings.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10010511000154"></a>The figures associated with disability are truly shocking. Families with disabled children are more than 50 per cent more likely to be in debt, while only 16 per cent of mothers with disabled children work, in comparison with 62 per cent of mothers with non-disabled children. That is a staggering difference. Barnardo's says that one in six families with disabled children go without essentials, such as food and heating, due to lack of money. It is often very difficult, if not impossible, for families to find the right childcare for a disabled child, particularly an older child. Any Bill on child poverty-a major part of which is to collect the most relevant and carefully calibrated statistics on household incomes-surely ought to capture the number of households in this category.</p>

<a name="100105-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10010511000155"></a>I turn briefly to perhaps the most challenging part of the Bill, and that which involves local government in the strategy. Many local authorities, but not all, already have child poverty as a priority in their sustainable communities strategy. There is evident concern that the Government are, with this Bill, passing even more of the buck to local authorities to deliver their policy. We hope that the guidance that the Child Poverty Unit is working on will do more than try to micromanage local authorities, and that the Government will offer more practical help, such as training and support for partnership working. Steve Webb made a telling point when he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000239"></a>"we are setting national targets based on some very specific definitions and then asking local authorities to be partners in delivering targets based on definitions that they cannot access or measure".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Child Poverty Bill Committee, 3/11/09; col. 315.]</ul>
<a name="100105-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10010511000156"></a>The link between national targets and local delivery is unclear. Perhaps the Minister can address that problem in winding up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10010511000157"></a>One matter that interests me particularly is what several local government councillors and officials have said about the benefit system, which is very relevant to child poverty. We heard the old familiar stories about delays and reassessments with benefit claims throughout the country. Local authorities would welcome working with the DWP to provide a more flexible and localised approach to all benefit claims, not just housing and council tax benefits. Can the Minister tell us whether

The way in which the benefit system interacts with, in particular, rules about low-paid and part-time jobs is of crucial importance to whether a family is in poverty. Will the Minister also clarify whether there will be any extra funding at all under the Bill for local authorities?</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10010511000158"></a>I have not mentioned many of the important issues to be explored during the rest of the Bill's passage-such as the importance of consultation with children themselves, and whether Clause 15 weakens the Bill and is a get-out clause for the next Government. I look forward to the rest of the debate, particularly the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford.</p>

I am most grateful for all Her Majesty's Government's efforts on behalf of children growing up in poverty. I was grateful to be reminded of the Government's investment in children's centres and Sure Start. It is unacceptable that, in a nation as prosperous as ours, so many children continue to grow up in such poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10010511000160"></a>As a reflection on what the Minister said, I regret that there is no strong voice for social work because social workers should surely be the champions in this area. I hope that the investment the Government are now making in social work, including the social work task force and the development of a royal college for social work, may raise the status of the profession and that, in future, social workers will be a powerful voice in eradicating child poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10010511000161"></a>I listened with great interest to the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and was pleased to hear what he said about tackling addiction in parents. I was also pleased that he highlighted the UNICEF report and how poorly we perform against all other developed nations in regard to children. I wonder whether he and his colleagues will give special attention to the proposal in the forthcoming schools Bill to put personal, social and health education on a statutory basis. That will contain sex and relationship education. The clear evidence from the Netherlands and the United States is that good quality sex and relationship education reduces the number of teenage pregnancies and will help to achieve the target that the noble Lord wishes of more stable parents and more successful families.</p>

As vice-chair of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Children and Young People In and Leaving Care, I have a particular interest in the children we are speaking of as there is such a strong association between poverty and children being taken into public care. It is hardly surprising to find that where families find their basic needs are not being met, the result can be family dysfunction and risk to the children.</p>

Issues of this kind so easily get lost. I remind your Lordships of the appalling lack of strategy in the development of sufficient housing for our people. I was grateful to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, raise this issue. It appears that in the sale of social housing no thought was given to our people's needs. Clearly, there have been other pressures such as immigration and reduction in the size and increase in the number of households, but the failure adequately to plan has had catastrophic consequences. It has contributed to powerful resentment against those incomers who are provided with the housing they need. Many families live in unsuitable, unsanitary, overcrowded accommodation.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10010511000164"></a>A few years ago, visiting families in West Ham with a health visitor, we saw some of these conditions: a mother sharing her one room with her two young children; another mother with three young children and water running down her mildewed walls; a man showing us the flooded basement of his family home; and a father showing us the lavatory which combined as a shower. More recently, again visiting a family with a health visitor, this time in Walthamstow, we spoke to the mother of a seven week-old baby. A lone parent and a refugee, separated from her own family in Africa and with the father of the child expressing no interest in the child's welfare, she shared the kitchen and the bathroom of this accommodation with five other families. Further testimony of our failure to plan to meet the housing needs of our people has been provided to us by users of Barnardo's Families in Temporary Accommodation Project. So many of these families are separated by long multiple bus journeys from their extended families and communities because of the lack of appropriate accommodation in their area. I pay particular tribute to John Reacroft, who has led this project for many years and has supported your Lordships in understanding this area. A proper strategy to address child poverty that is robust, well implemented and resourced is vital if we are to avoid the same failure as we have witnessed in housing.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10010511000165"></a>By contrast, the Government's rough sleepers' strategy of 1998 delivered. A clear target was set to reduce rough sleeping to one-third in three years and a robust implementation mechanism was established. Louise Casey was appointed to get this job done. I saw for myself the change that she and the Government wrought. A winter shelter for homeless 16 to 23 year-olds with which I was very familiar was transformed. Prior to 2009, it had seen the least experienced staff working with the most vulnerable young people. The staff were young, some of them were just globetrotters overwintering in the UK and picking up what work was available to them. Among the residents was a young man who had been on the street injecting heroin. His time in the hostel was the opportunity to get him off drugs and into work, training or study and proper accommodation. Another young man had communication difficulties, easily isolated himself and was frustrated at his inability to connect with others. Both of these young men's needs were unmet and the chance to intervene was lost. However, the following year, a crack team of professionals was introduced to the shelter. I had the honour of working with one of them for some time at  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_33"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a later date. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of that team as I was not a visitor to its project, but I am certain that these workers stood a far better chance of intervening effectively and assisting these young men into some meaningful activity and secure accommodation than those present in the previous year had done.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10010511000166"></a>Having clear targets and time frames and sufficient resources can ensure that the differences we would all wish to see in improving outcome for our children and young people do happen. Many times I have heard my noble friend Lord Laming call for a clear strategy for children's homes in order to address the shortcomings in that sector. To make a difference we need to make a sustained and focused effort over a number of years and certainly over more than one Parliament.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10010511000167"></a>Turning to the detail of the Bill, I share the concern expressed by Barnardo's and others that the Bill should not miss the needs of the most needy. I hope we can strengthen the targets to ensure they reach down to the most vulnerable and that no especially needy groups are overlooked. Sure Start has proven a great success, but its early efforts were put under a cloud by the first evaluation, which found that it failed to reach the most vulnerable group: teenage parents. In framing this Bill, I hope we can ensure that Travellers, black and ethnic minorities, care-leavers, families of ex-offenders and other important groups are not overlooked.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10010511000168"></a>I welcome the new duties on local authorities and other local agencies to work together to combat child poverty. I would like to be certain that there are sufficient levers to ensure the development of good quality childcare and appropriate accommodation in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10010511000169"></a>I declare my interest as a trustee of the Sieff Foundation. At last September's Michael Sieff conference, Professor Melhuish, Professor of Human Development at Birkbeck College, University of London, made a powerful presentation on the effectiveness of good quality pre-school education on improving the educational attainment of children in deprived areas. He clearly demonstrated that children from similar deprived backgrounds had quite different educational trajectories depending on their exposure to good quality pre-school. In particular, he showed that good quality pre-school care inoculated children against the effects of poor quality primary education. At the age of 11, those children who had experienced good quality pre-school were, on average, doing well in education, whether they had experienced a poor primary school or a good one. Good quality childcare is a key factor in breaking the cycle of failure, and I hope that this Bill will make it more available to families in poverty. Professor Melhuish's presentation on the long-term effects of good quality early years care is on the Sieff Foundation website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10010511000170"></a>There is much public concern about the increasing prevalence of gang culture and gang violence in some of our communities. Last year, a number of parliamentary groups, including the parliamentary group for children and its chairman, the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, whom I see is in her place, met to learn about gang violence. We were addressed by Professor John Pitts, who is a youth worker as well as an academic. We heard from him that what was at the root of this

The immense disparity and the polarisation between the wealthy norm and these impoverished places contributed to a severe intensification of problems. This provided the breeding ground for the new gang culture, which is so much more virulent and anti-social than in the past. I very much hope that this Bill will help to play a part in recognising these areas and ensuring that they receive the interventions needed to prevent them becoming ghettoes.</p>

Of course, on its own it means nothing, but if local authorities and governments show themselves determined to meet the challenges set out in this legislation it can be an important force for good. I very much regret that I will be absent from your Lordships' House from 26 January to 5 February but, as far as I am able to participate, I look forward to working with your Lordships to improve the Bill in Committee.</p>

Universities and colleges must be able to demonstrate that they are offering genuine courses that will benefit students seeking to study in the UK. This new regime has reduced the number of institutions able to bring students to the UK from over 4,000 to approximately 2,000. Following the refusal of his application, Abdulmutallab's name was added to the UKBA watch-list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10010511000180"></a>In the light of the serious questions this incident has raised, I want to set out today the immediate steps we are taking to tighten aviation security, what measures we are taking to prevent radicalisation in our universities, and the actions we are taking to disrupt al-Qaeda in countries where it is known to be active, in order to prevent future terrorist attacks and to improve co-operation with our international partners.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10010511000181"></a>It is of great concern that Abdulmutallab was able to penetrate airport security at Amsterdam. The device he used had clearly been constructed with the aim of making detection by existing screening methods extremely difficult. Abdulmutallab underwent a security check at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam, as do all passengers transferring from Nigeria to another flight. Although Schipol Airport is trialling body scanners, they were not in use for that flight. He passed through a metal detection gate, which would have detected objects such as explosive devices with metallic components, knives and firearms. However, certain types of explosive without metallic parts, and which can be concealed next to the body, cannot be detected by this technology, which is the reason why airports also search passengers at random.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10010511000182"></a>To defeat the terrorist threat requires constant vigilance and adaptability. A great deal of progress has been made in enhancing aviation and border security since 9/11. But terrorists are inventive, the scale and nature of the threat changes, and new technology needs to be harnessed to meet new threats, while minimising inconvenience to passengers.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10010511000183"></a>Last year, we issued new public guidance to the industry on our technical requirements for screening and the detection of improvised explosive devices. The Prime Minister instigated an urgent review of airport security following the incident in Detroit. My noble friend the Secretary of State for Transport and I have been intensively engaged in this review and we are today setting out our initial steps.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_36"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10010511000184"></a>It is clear that no one measure will be enough to defeat inventive and determined terrorists, and there is no single technology which we can guarantee will be 100 per cent effective against such attacks. We therefore intend to make changes to our aviation security regime. Air passengers are already used to being searched by hand and having their baggage tested for traces of explosives. The Government will direct airports to increase the proportion of passengers searched in this way. There may be some additional delays as airports adapt, but I am sure the travelling public will appreciate the reasons behind this.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10010511000185"></a>The Transport Secretary has also brought into force new restrictions which tighten up security screening for transit passengers and is reviewing the support we provide for security standards in airports operating direct flights to the United Kingdom. Passengers will also see an increased presence of detection or sniffer dogs at airports to add to our explosives detection capability.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10010511000186"></a>We also intend to introduce more body scanners. The first scanners will be deployed in around three weeks' time at Heathrow. Over time, they will be introduced more widely and we will be requiring all UK airports to introduce explosive trace detection equipment by the end of the year. We are discussing urgently with the airport industry the best way of doing all this, which will include a code of practice dealing with operational and privacy issues.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10010511000187"></a>BAA has started training airport security staff in behavioural analysis techniques, which will help them to spot passengers acting unusually and target them for additional search. Beyond this, we are examining carefully whether additional targeted passenger profiling might help to enhance airport security. We will be considering all the issues involved, mindful of civil liberty concerns, aware that identity-based profiling has its limitations but conscious of our overriding obligations to protect peoples' lives and liberty.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10010511000188"></a>These measures build on the substantial progress we have made in recent years to strengthen our borders. The roll-out of e-Borders, which will check passengers, including those in transit, against the watch-list, will be 95 per cent complete by the end of this year. This makes us one of only a handful of countries to have the technology that can carry out advanced passenger data checks against our watch-list before people travel to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10010511000189"></a>Those who apply for a visa-whether they do so from Bangkok, Lahore or Pretoria-have to provide fingerprints and their records are checked against our watch-list, which holds over 1 million records of known criminals, terrorists, people who have tried to enter the country illegally or been deported, and those whom agencies consider to be a threat to our security. Through the e-Borders programme and through screening passengers against this watch-list, we have made 4,900 arrests for crimes including murder, rape and assault since 2005. In addition, UK Border Agency staff based overseas working with airlines prevented over 65,000 inadequately documented passengers travelling to the United Kingdom during 2009.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10010511000190"></a>Abdulmutallab's failed attack highlights the importance of information-sharing between the various agencies about people who pose a threat to our security. The UK watch-list is managed by the UK Border Agency and incorporates intelligence from the law enforcement and security and intelligence agencies into a single index. Although the integrated approach works very well, we want to see whether we can further strengthen it. The Home Office will therefore be conducting an urgent review of the robustness of our watch-list. The review will report to me in two weeks' time, and I will report, subject to security restrictions, the findings to Parliament.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10010511000191"></a>The House will no doubt also be concerned about the possibility that Abdulmutallab's radicalisation may have begun or been fuelled during his time studying at University College, London. It is important to remember that the values of openness and intellectual scrutiny and the freedom of debate and tolerance promoted in higher education are some of the most effective ways of challenging views that we may find abhorrent but that remain within the law.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10010511000192"></a>However, we know that a small minority of people supporting violent extremism have actively sought to influence and recruit people through targeting learners in colleges and universities, and we must offer universities the best advice and guidance to help prevent extremism. As part of a measured and effective response to this threat, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has published guidance on managing the risk of violent extremism in universities and is working closely with universities in priority areas to provide targeted support.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10010511000193"></a>Alongside this, each university has a designated police security contact that university management can discuss concerns with. The Prevent strand of our counterterrorism strategy works closely with the higher and further education sectors and funds a full-time Prevent officer at the National Union of Students. As I have said, Abdulmutallab's family believe he turned to violent extremism after leaving the UK, but we need to ensure that this close co-operation continues in our efforts to stop radicalisation of young people in our colleges and universities.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10010511000194"></a>Finally, I want to say something about our work internationally and the steps the Government are taking abroad to disrupt al-Qaeda wherever it is active. Our success in tackling the international terror threat depends on strong relationships with our international partnerships. In our efforts to thwart al-Qaeda, we have a long-standing, productive partnership with the United States.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10010511000195"></a>I am not prepared to go into detail on this particular case about what was shared with the US and when. It is an established and accepted principle that we do not routinely comment on intelligence matters. Moreover, some of these issues are still current and are highly sensitive. However, I would like to clarify that while we did, in line with standard procedures, provide information to the US linked to the wider aspect of this case, none of the information we held or shared indicated that Abdulmutallab was about to attempt a terrorist attack against the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10010511000196"></a>This morning, I met Jane Lute, the United States Deputy Secretary of State for Homeland Security. We discussed how, over the coming months, in the light of this failed attack, we will work together with our other international partners to maintain public confidence in aviation security and deepen our partnership to disrupt al-Qaeda's activities overseas.</p>

<a name="100105-0005.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10010511000197"></a>Pushed out of Afghanistan and under increasing pressure in the border areas of Pakistan, affiliates and allies of al-Qaeda-like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group claiming responsibility for the Detroit bombing-have raised their profile. With the failed Detroit attack they have again demonstrated their intent to attack innocent people across the world. The aim of our counterterrorism strategy is not just to reduce our own vulnerabilities, but also to dismantle those terrorist organisations which pose a threat to the UK, whether at home or abroad.  </p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100105-0006.htm"/>


<a name="100105-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10010511000198"></a>Al-Qaeda will take any opportunity to exploit ungoverned space and instability. Whether the threat is in the Sahel or Somalia, or Yemen, Pakistan, Iraq or Afghanistan, we must support Governments and work with partners to address both the threat of attack and the underlying causes of extremism and instability. We have been working with the Yemeni Government for a number of years, helping to improve their law-enforcement, intelligence and security apparatus, to disrupt al-Qaeda, and to deny it a safe haven in Yemen for the future. We are also one of the leading donors to Yemeni development-our current commitment stands at £100 million by 2011.  We recognise the need to strengthen further our partnership with countries in the region and beyond, so we can co-ordinate our efforts against al-Qaeda more effectively and provide greater support for the Yemeni people to reject violent extremism. International co-operation is critical to meeting what is a global threat. The coming together of the international community in London later this month to discuss Yemen will be an important step towards security there and across the globe.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10010511000199"></a>It is important to reiterate that this was a failed attack by a Nigerian national on the United States, by someone who was refused entry to the United Kingdom and who it seems was radicalised after he left this country. However, there are lessons to be learnt by the international community and the measures I have outlined will provide the United Kingdom greater protection from terrorist attack. Along with our work overseas with our international partners, enhanced airport security and more thorough collation of intelligence, we will be able to strengthen our efforts to tackle the root causes of violent extremism and reduce the threat of future attack".</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10010511000202"></a>The failed terrorist attack on Christmas Day was a wake-up call. The terrorist threat continues to evolve, as he rightly said, and to adapt. As I have said before, following the Mumbai attacks, terrorists actively seek to understand and to counter the capabilities of our  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_39"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>security services. They innovate tactically to obviate security measures and confuse authorities, so being ahead of them in preventing, responding to and recovering from potential attacks is of the utmost importance. We cannot always be in catch-up mode.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10010511000203"></a>We must also expect that more and more countries will be used as a base by terrorists, particularly as pressure on them in Afghanistan and Pakistan increases. There will be a greater number of points of origin for people travelling to the UK that represent a danger to us and where precautions have to be taken. We welcome the assistance that the Government are providing to Yemen, but it is a pity that the Government made that announcement without telling our American partners that they were going to do so. Can the Minister confirm that the Government are identifying what other countries may need to counter terrorism and in capacity-building assistance? Again, I come back to the point about not always being in catch-up mode.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10010511000204"></a>The Minister mentioned a number of measures that will be introduced to improve airport security, including greater searching of passengers by hand, the increased presence of sniffer dogs and the introduction of full-body scanners. He also mentioned that new restrictions had been introduced for transit passengers, but he did not say what those were. Will he do so? We accept that such additional measures should be put in place at airports, but why has the introduction of some, such as full-body scanners, been so long delayed? To my certain personal knowledge, that technology has been available for at least 10 years.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10010511000205"></a>The Minister said that the first tranche of those scanners will be deployed within three weeks, but I know that at least one key industry player suggests that certain models will be available only between four and six months from now. One wonders how long we will have to wait to reduce vulnerability from that aspect of the threat. There are many months before we get coverage-which, I think everyone agrees, will not of itself necessarily deal with the threat encountered the other day, but will nevertheless reduce the scope for evasion. How long will it be before we have not just the introduction but proper coverage of body scanners at our major airports?</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10010511000206"></a>The core of the issue is surely to prevent dangerous passengers getting on to planes in the first place, and preventing them getting on to planes in other countries. Technologies can mitigate that threat, but they are not, we can agree, foolproof. It seems unlikely that the body scanners currently available would have picked up the substance which that young man had put around his body, so I am glad that the Minister agrees that we need a risk-based approach to passenger security checks. That must be intelligence-led, based on assessments of the threats posed by or from within particular countries and by particular travel routes, and on observation of suspicious behaviour. The US, for example, has designated certain flight routes for additional checks. Will the Government also do that?</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10010511000207"></a>The second key aspect is international co-operation in preventing the travel of dangerous or potentially dangerous individuals. The Minister referred to the robustness of the UK Border Agency's watch-list. As he said, it has a lot of names on it: 1.3 million. As  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_40"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far as I know, those names are uncategorised. Is it realistic to suppose that our security services can effectively target individuals using that system? Will it be reformed in any way? The Minister said that the Government were looking at that. It would be helpful to know what aspects of it are under consideration.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10010511000208"></a>A related point is the stark fact that the UK does not have a no-fly list, unlike the US. Does the UK have the information and the intelligence base sufficient to put in place such a list, which would then be genuinely useful? There is no point in having a list that does not necessarily have an information base behind it. Is enough advance passenger information being collected by the UK? As I understand it, our systems are not the same as those of the US. The Minister did not make entirely clear when the e-Borders programme will be fully operational. To what extent does he think that that will be helpful in this area?</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10010511000209"></a>How have the Government worked with the US Administration, who have conducted their own reviews, to ensure that their findings and the security standards and procedures they are introducing are consistent with developments here? The US is obviously our most important partner in many respects. Particularly on the electronic side, the Americans have been in the lead. It would be helpful to know the extent to which the US reckons that its collaborative partner and the one where the standards have to be met is the UK. What other countries are involved in, or are being drawn into, the findings of these reviews? It is clear that ultimately the issue is international.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10010511000210"></a>This attempted attack also demonstrated the continued challenges posed by radicalisation. The lesson here is that academic institutions have to get real about this challenge and the terrorist threat. No one in this House wishes to see academic freedom reduced, but terrorism poses a threat to the very values that universities stand for, so educational establishments must help in identifying those who are vulnerable to extremism that can lead to violence. If the Minister were able to say what targeted support the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is lending, it would be helpful.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10010511000211"></a>Finally, press reports suggest that the Prime Minister misled the public and the US about the information provided to the US authorities. I note that the Minister is not prepared to go into detail but he told us, correctly, that it is an established and accepted principle that the Government do not routinely comment on intelligence matters. Therefore, one has to wonder why the Prime Minister made these public remarks. It must be uncomfortable for the Government to be told by the White House that they made a mistake. Tackling the terrorist threat that we face requires public trust and confidence and the trust and confidence of international partners. These are the sort of remarks that risk damaging both.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10010511000212"></a>These attacks remind us that the terrorist threat remains severe. We must continue to be vigilant and united to defeat it. The threat is posed by a small number of deadly extremists who do not speak for the majority of Muslims in this country or around the world. We must make this distinction. People of all faiths have been victims of terrorists over the past decade, and it must be our common endeavour across all communities to overcome them.</p>

I do not propose to question him about security measures because I do not think he would wish to answer any questions. I realise that this is a very sensitive subject. However, one thing that I reflect on from reading and hearing the Statement is the fact that a great deal of emphasis is being placed on the airport authorities-on BAA-and on delays at airports and the inconvenience to passengers. I wonder to what extent consideration is being given to involving the long-haul airlines more closely. They have passenger manifests days or weeks in advance of the flight. To what extent are those manifests subject to checks to ensure that anybody who is in any way undesirable, and I use that word in its broadest sense, is prevented from flying? If the manifests are checked properly, we should have weeded out most of those who are a danger by the time that people are arriving at the airport. It seems that whatever sophisticated device we install at airports, it is bound to cause trouble, delay and frustration. I feel that we need to make a fresh breakthrough so that we can spot these people before they get in a queue at the airport.</p>

The noble Baroness rightly said that this is a wake-up call. The need to adapt is constant because the nature of the terrorist threat changes constantly. Although she is absolutely right to say that some particular areas highlighted by the Detroit attack are important for future development-including body scanners, which she mentioned in particular-I would not accept that we have been slow to adapt. We constantly adapt and change our security apparatus at airports and our security apparatus nationally, including e-borders and the development of the watch-list, to meet the threat.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10010511000215"></a>While none of us is complacent, I am glad to say that, in this particular case, this individual was not granted a visa to come and study in this country. The visa regime did work. The course for which Abdulmutallab applied was not at a properly accredited institution, so he did not get a visa to come to this country. We need to ensure that the robustness of our security regime continues to apply in this way case by case. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said that this is a particular issue in respect of aviation security. That is a massive challenge for us. More than a quarter of a million passengers leave British airports every day. There are 110 flights to the United States alone. Ensuring that the system works well and does not fail is a massive undertaking. On behalf of the whole House, I should like to pay tribute to the security staff and the airlines. They make this system work day in, day out. There is also a considerable amount of public pressure in the situations with which they have to deal. They do a splendid job. However, we need constantly to improve the quality of the service that we provide as we deal with new threats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10010511000216"></a>The noble Baroness asked me a large number of questions and I will go through as many of them as I can. She asked about co-operation with the United States.

She met my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and me this morning and we exchanged a good deal of useful information about future policy developments. Our relative officials and experts have been in constant dialogue both before Christmas and, since Christmas Day, about the issues raised by Detroit. She was proceeding to Brussels, where she will be consulting further with our European partners. Janet Napolitano, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, plans to meet European Transport Ministers soon to discuss a number of the specific issues being raised by the sorts of changes we need to discuss in aviation security and to exchange the thinking in our respective countries about how to tackle this threat.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10010511000217"></a>I am satisfied that the degree of co-operation and co-ordination is high but we need continually to improve it. It is important, for example, to discuss, bilaterally and multilaterally, many of the issues to do with the regulation of new technology. It is no good us having enhanced security regimes in place at our airports if they are not in place at the airports from which flights are departing to come to this country. A good deal of international activity will therefore be required as well. We provide international aid, assistance and technical advice to countries where we think there may be vulnerabilities in airport security in order to ensure that proper standards are met. We are looking at how we can improve that technical advice and assistance and at how we can do so in a co-ordinated way with the United States and our partners. Good work is taking place in this area, but we need constantly to raise our game. We are not in any way complacent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10010511000218"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about e-borders. The e-borders scheme will be 95 per cent operational by the end of this year, so we are making very good progress on putting that in place. She asked me about transit passengers. Under the regulations which I brought into force on New Year's Day, transit passengers will henceforth be treated in precisely the same way as transfer passengers. All transit passengers-passengers on a flight which is continuing to a destination beyond the United Kingdom but who are not changing flight-will be subject to the full search and security regime applicable for transfer passengers. They will need to be searched, as will their hand baggage, and they will not be able to proceed on the flight until that has taken place. That will affect about 30 flights a week, so it will be a significant further enhancement of our security arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10010511000219"></a>The noble Baroness asked me why body scanners had been delayed. We have been trialling body scanners. My noble friend Lord West, whom I am glad to see in his place, last year issued a paper to the industry with innovations and ideas on countering this terrorist threat and highlighting areas in which we wish to see enhanced collaboration between universities, the private sector and the Government on new technologies. A whole part of that document was on screening apparatus, so we have been highlighting this as a priority and trialling the technology.</p>

We are looking to do the same, and we will move with all deliberate speed in so doing. The first full-body scanners will be operational at Heathrow within a matter of weeks. I cannot give a precise timescale for extending that operation across the airport sector of the UK, but we intend to move as rapidly as we can thereafter, consistent with good operational practice and the industry's ability to develop products that are of sufficiently high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10010511000221"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked about the work that we do with airlines. There is already a well-established system for notifying passenger data in advance. The watch-list to which the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, referred is an integral part of the process of granting visas, and is in effect a device that allows people to travel or not to travel. Indeed, the watch-list and the data that come from airlines are fully integral to deciding whether people can enter the country and therefore fly.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10010511000222"></a>The radicalisation of students at universities is a very sensitive area. In all my experience, formerly as an Education Minister and as a Transport Secretary now, I have been impressed by the seriousness with which university authorities take this issue. They are in no way complacent. Noble Lords who heard Professor Malcolm Grant, the provost of UCL, interviewed on the "Today" programme a few days ago will have been struck by the seriousness with which he takes his responsibilities in this area. As he said in that interview:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10010511000240"></a>"We are obliged ... to secure freedom of speech on campus",</p>

<p><a name="10010511000231"></a>but,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10010511000241"></a>"We walk a very narrow line between ... that",</p>

<p><a name="10010511000232"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="10010511000249"></a>"ensuring that nothing occurs which would result in the incitement of racial hatred",</ul>
<p><a name="10010511000233"></a>and he spelled out steps which the university had taken, including uninviting radical speakers who might have provided such incitement in the case of his own university.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10010511000223"></a>Other university leaders have similar stories to tell. Universities have the power to ban speakers from their premises when they believe that those speakers will incite hatred. They take these responsibilities seriously. They are working very closely indeed with the Prevent strategy and are directly supporting the work of the National Union of Students and Islamic student organisations to combat the threat that is posed, and we are satisfied that they are extremely vigilant in their responsibilities in this area.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10010511000224"></a>To conclude, it is very important that we make the point loudly and clearly from this House that the Muslim mainstream majority in this country abhors the terrorist threat every bit as much as every other citizen in this country does. We are all united in seeking to combat this threat. No one could have made that clearer than the Muslim Council of Britain, which, on the day after the attack, condemned it in the strongest terms. Its secretary-general, Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="10010511000242"></a>"We all have a collective duty to stand against those who wish to perpetrate terror against innocent civilians wherever it may occur. Terror and violence is not the way to convey a message however legitimate the cause may be. It is totally counter-productive".</p>

<p><a name="10010511000234"></a>That is the view of the mainstream Muslim majority in this country and of all other citizens in this country, and we work with the Muslim community as much as with the wider community to combat this threat at its very source.</p>

If that is the case, will we have to go through a period of consultation? How long is that likely to be and who is going to be consulted? Moreover, can we take it that in no way will Her Majesty's Government be put off from introducing a profiling system, which can be of enormous benefit to honest, regular travellers who are unnecessarily being hugely inconvenienced these days, merely by complaints from certain people who think they might be unfairly treated?</p>

So we are not holding back at all from action in this area. However, we need to ensure that it is the right action, and that is what we are considering seriously. I can assure my noble friend that we are not holding back from taking appropriate action because of concerns about how this might be regarded by the public, because we have no doubt at all that they will welcome proportionate steps that safeguard their security as they pass through our airports.</p>

Would the Minister agree with me that tactical profiling has in fact been in use by the police and the intelligence services in this country to great effect for a very considerable time and is well developed? Further, would he join with me in welcoming the spread of tactical profiling by teaching behavioural analysis to airline staff? Does he share the view that tactical profiling has been dealt with sensibly by the control authorities in this country in consultation at times with black and minority ethnic groups? Does he also share the view that scanners and other machinery, as well as detection dogs, although useful, are no more than a supplement to well-organised, accurate, properly funded and appropriately shared intelligence?</p>

There must be constant vigilance in terms of our security efforts including, as my right honourable friend the Home Secretary said, looking to see how we can improve the way that we maintain and deploy the watch-list, and we need vigilance in all the institutions where there might be a danger of extremist activity taking place. Those responsible for running the institutions should take appropriate action to nip in the bud extremist activity as soon as it exhibits itself.</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10010516000005"></a>On prioritising passengers about whom there may be concerns for search at airports, as I made very clear in the Statement, we welcome unreservedly the decision of BAA to start systematically training airport staff in the identification of suspicious behaviour and seeing that such passengers are properly targeted for search procedures, and we are looking at how such techniques could be extended more widely.</p>

<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="10010516000006"></a><b><a name="100105-0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10010516000067"></a>Lord Mawhinney:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for the Statement, which a lot of us will have found encouraging in the difficult circumstances. I want to ask him two questions that arise from it. First, if my memory is right, the Minister said that the operation of the new security arrangements was going to be subject to a code of practice. Those of us who have been privileged to serve in government will have been disheartened by that because a code of practice is probably the least effective and most lax arrangement that can be chosen. Would he be willing to reconsider that and put in place a more robust framework for these important new security operations?</p>

<a name="100105-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10010516000007"></a>Secondly, I shall also turn to the question of profiling. As someone who once held the Minister's post, I am well aware of the debate about profiling, but I think the time has come to get on with it. BAA is introducing something that as far as it goes is fine, but the Government cannot stand aside and let a commercial organisation take responsibility for profiling, not least because BAA does not run all the airports in the country. Therefore I encourage the Minister to let it be known that profiling is government policy and to put his shoulder behind a variety of efforts, all of which should be based on profiling given the intelligence that is available to him, and not to conduct any more public debates about it. He should just do it; that is what the public want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10010516000009"></a>On the code of practice, I should make it clear that we are talking about the regime in which full-body scanning will operate. Because a number of sensitive issues are raised by the practice of full-body scanning, the airport authorities look to the Government to put in place a regime within which they can provide the proper training of staff and the supervision that will be required for the operation of full-body scanning equipment. This is not a substitute for a robust system of applying full-body scanning; it is the means by which such a system will come into operation. Obviously there are important issues about how staff are trained and supervised-for example, how images are treated and what happens to them after they have been made-which are of concern to the public. Such issues do not stand in the way of the introduction of full-body scanning but Parliament would expect the Government to pay proper attention to the regime to ensure that full-body scanning is done in a responsible way in which the public can have confidence, and  that the practice of full-body scanning and its images is not abused. That is what the code of practice  will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10010516000010"></a>There is not an issue as to profiling. I could not have made more clear in my Statement that it is right that passengers who fall into defined risk categories should be subject to appropriate screening. The question is how one identifies that. The most obvious case is those who exhibit behaviour at an airport that gives rise to concern. The whole process of the watch-list and how that regime operates acts as a way of identifying risk groups even before they get to the airport.</p>

Who of those involved directly with aviation have been or will be consulted about the issues that concern the House of Lords today? As to BALPA, does the Minister agree that airline pilots are probably the most uniquely well-qualified to advise on what can best be achieved on or within aircraft? Secondly, how is the European Cockpit Association-which is the umbrella organisation for European pilots-to be consulted? It is most important that it should be.</p>

I have two questions. The Minister has just referred to body scans, which are an intrusion into the privacy of an individual. It is for this reason that some communities are culturally sensitive as to what could happen to them. What kind of training programme will be available for those responsible for taking the scan and, more importantly, will the code of practice be available for us to see to make sure that such scans are not abused?</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10010516000016"></a>Secondly, there is a need to take great care over racial stereotyping. As I have been advised again and again, and as the Minister knows, this could be against the Race Relations Act. Will the Minister ensure that much of the scanning and requirements regarding the passengers are based on intelligence received and that stereotyping will in no way form a part? If not, we will have the same problem as we had in relation to stop and search in this country with regard to black and ethnic minority communities.</p>

I know that that is particularly true of the University of Bradford, where there is a large minority of Muslim students. Does the Minister agree that those suggesting that Abdul Mutallab was radicalised in the Yemen were being slightly ingenuous? Radicalisation does not happen overnight or in a few weeks but over several months and several years. I was in Pakistan in December, which was an interesting and not very comfortable experience, given that terrorist bombs were going off practically every day, although mercifully not where I was. I was interested to speak to a large group of students in one of the universities there, and was aware of the intense anti-American feeling among students. The majority of Muslims in this country are under 25. They are young people. While universities might ban meetings of Hizb ut Tahrir, these meetings then take place elsewhere, privately. Leaders of mosques tell me that there is no radicalisation taking place there, but there are the radicals across the road waiting to meet young students to try to affect them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10010516000020"></a>I am sure that the Minister would agree that the whole process of turning young, disaffected Muslims into not only radicals but terrorists is one that the whole of our society needs to counter.

It is precisely for the reason that he gives that we have the Prevent strategy, which is substantially funded and has been doing excellent work. Only at the end of last year, a big conference in Birmingham was attended by more than 1,000 people, all of them engaged in Prevent, including a large range of Muslim organisations, the police, the Prison Service and others. That demonstrated the wide and very constructive work being done across our universities and our wider civil society to tackle the root causes of extremism and promote those shared values of tolerance and civilised life, which the overwhelming majority of people in this country share in common, whatever their creed or racial background.</p>

The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10010516000038"></a>"With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement about December's Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, at which I represented the United Kingdom alongside my right honourable friend the Prime Minister.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10010516000039"></a>Today I want to report back to the House and set out where we go next in the global battle against climate change. Let me say at the outset that the outcome of Copenhagen was disappointing in a number of respects. We are disappointed that Copenhagen did not establish a clear timetable for a legal treaty, and that we do not yet have the commitments to cuts in emissions that we were looking for. However, the accord agreed at Copenhagen does mark significant progress that we can build on, and I want to explain how.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10010516000040"></a>The Copenhagen accord, which is available in the Library of the House, was agreed by a group representing  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_50"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>49 developed and developing countries that together account for more than 80 per cent of global emissions. It endorses the limit of two degrees of warming as the benchmark for global progress on climate change. Unlike every previous agreement, not just developed but all leading developing countries have agreed to make specific commitments to tackle emissions, to be lodged in the agreement by 31 January. And for the first time, so that we can be assured that countries are acting as they say they will, all countries have signed up to comprehensive measurement, reporting and verification of progress.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10010516000041"></a>On finance, there are significant commitments made by the rich world to developing countries. This includes fast-start finance worth $10 billion dollars a year by 2012, with a total of up to $2.4 billion from the UK, and specific support to tackle deforestation. In the longer term the accord supported the goal, first set by the Prime Minister, of $100 billion a year of public and private finance for developing countries by 2020.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10010516000042"></a>By any measure these are important steps forward, but we know that the world needs to go much further. We need more certainty and a greater scale of ambition. So the urgent task ahead is to broaden, deepen and strengthen the commitments made in Copenhagen, drawing on the large coalition of countries that wanted more from the agreement.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10010516000043"></a>Broadening the commitments is vital. Forty-nine countries are not enough. To tackle this global problem we need a wider group. The United Nations is seeking to persuade all countries to sign up to the accord and the UK will play its part in making that happen.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10010516000044"></a>In addition, we must act to deepen the commitments on emissions made by countries across the world. The noble Lord, Lord Stern, has shown that if nations make the biggest emissions cuts in the range that they have put forward, we can be within striking distance of the two-degree pathway that we need, including the peaking of global emissions by 2020.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10010516000045"></a>We know that this is in our economic as well as our environmental interest. Greater certainty about emissions is necessary to provide the strongest incentive to business, including through the carbon price. So we will work to persuade other countries that we all need to show the highest levels of ambition on emissions as part of the commitments that we make. For Europe, provided that there is high ambition from others, that means carrying forward our commitment to move from 20 per cent to 30 per cent reductions by 2020 compared to 1990. We must also act to strengthen the accord, including by continuing our efforts to secure a legally binding framework.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10010516000046"></a>In taking on clear commitments and actions, we should recognise how far major developing countries have come, but we must allay their concerns that they will be constrained from growth and development by the demands of a legal treaty. We must draw on the coalition between some of the world's richest developed countries and some of the world's poorest developing countries, such as Ethiopia and the Maldives, all of which want a legally binding structure.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10010516000047"></a>Strengthening the accord also means that richer countries must make good on the promises made on fast-start finance to 2012, and show that we can fully

These efforts to make progress on substance must be accompanied by reform of the process of decision-making.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10010516000048"></a>The conference was held up by disagreements over procedure: which text negotiators should look at and whether, as in Kyoto, a representative group of countries could be formed to avoid having to discuss everything in a plenary of 192 nations. These disputes about process meant that it was not until 3 am on Friday, the last day of a two-week conference, that substantive negotiations began on what became the Copenhagen accord. By then, there was simply too little time to bridge some of the differences that existed, so we need to find better ways of running the process of negotiation. I welcome the UN Secretary-General's decision to look again at these issues.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10010516000049"></a>We also welcome the decision by Chancellor Merkel to host a conference as part of the mid-year negotiations in Bonn, and will work with the incoming Mexican presidency, who will be hosting COP16 in November. But dialogue and negotiations need to restart before June, something that I made clear to the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change when I met him just before Christmas in London.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10010516000050"></a>In looking back at Copenhagen, we must bear in mind that agreement was inevitably tough because we are seeking consensus among 192 countries. Like most ambitious efforts, it was always going to be difficult to succeed first time round. But we should not let frustration with the two weeks at Copenhagen, albeit justified, obscure the historic shift which this past year has marked. I want to pay tribute to the enormous effort of those in the UK, from the scientific community, civil society, British business and from the general public who have mobilised on climate change. Their ideas and energy helped drive us forward over the past twelve months and during the Copenhagen conference itself. Let me assure them and this House that we are determined to strengthen and sustain the momentum behind the low-carbon transition in the UK.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10010516000051"></a>Building on our low-carbon transition plan, a world-leading policy on coal, and our plans for nuclear, in the coming weeks and months we will be making further announcements on energy generation, household energy efficiency and transport, and following Copenhagen, as part of the work already ongoing on the road map to 2050, we are looking at whether further action is necessary to meet our low-carbon obligations and will report back by the time of the Budget. This will include looking at the advice of the Committee on Climate Change published last autumn.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10010516000052"></a>Internationally, thanks in large part to the deadline of Copenhagen and the mobilisation behind it, every major economy of the world now has domestic policy goals and commitments to limit their greenhouse gas emissions: the US, China, Japan, Russia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and of course the EU. Throughout the world, policy is now set to improve energy efficiency, to increase investment in low-carbon power, to develop hybrid and electric vehicles and smart grids, and to reduce deforestation.

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10010516000053"></a>This global shift may not yet have found international legal form, but scientific evidence, public opinion and business opportunity have made it irreversible. In 2010 and in the years ahead, this Government and, I am sure, the vast majority of this House, are determined to ensure that we redouble our efforts to complete the unfinished business of Copenhagen. Climate change remains the biggest global challenge to humankind. It requires a global solution. We owe it to our children and their children and the generations that come after to find it. The work has started, it will continue this year and it will succeed. The fight against climate change will be won. I commend this Statement to the House.</p>

I echo my honourable friend's remarks in another place regretting the absence of the Prime Minister. We welcome the Prime Minister's personal involvement in the debates in Copenhagen and it is unfortunate that he has not chosen to report back himself to Parliament on what he achieved. His absence says a lot about how disappointing the Government judge the outcome of the talks actually to have been.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10010516000055"></a>In December, through various press releases and articles, the Government gave a damning indictment of the whole process. The Prime Minister labelled the process "chaotic" and "flawed" and the Secretary of State for Energy noted "serious, substantive disagreement" remaining between countries. Many of those criticisms have just been repeated in another place and by the Minister here today.</p>

<a name="100105-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10010516000056"></a>By any measure, Copenhagen has been a disappointment. There was, as ever, a lot of talking but very little of the concrete and binding agreements that we need so badly. There is no agreement over the level of emissions that must be cut and by when. There was no clarity on where the money is to come from to finance the adaptation to the changing climate that all agree is critical and there was no binding agreement on how to preserve the world's remaining rainforests.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10010516000057"></a>The Minister has worked hard to make this Statement sound optimistic and forward-looking and I agree that there is much more that needs to be done. We must continue to focus all our efforts on achieving the commitments that proved so elusive last month. The Minister talked of strengthening the agreement and making it legally binding. Surely he agrees, however, that much more work must be done to resolve the many outstanding areas of disagreement before anything meaningful can be made legally binding. What steps will the Government take to bring round those countries which have yet to sign up to the accord? What progress has been made on those areas that did not even make the accord?</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10010516000058"></a>I am happy to see that there was little of the blame game in this Statement that the Government indulged in last month and I hope that this marks a new understanding on the part of the Government that  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_53"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>developing countries do not, will not and cannot be expected to prioritise carbon emission cuts over the well-being of their populations. On these Benches, we have always seen the development of a sustainable green economy as part and parcel of building a strong economy in the future. There need be no conflict between strong growth and sustainable growth and we must seize the opportunity now of developing technologies and establishing the infrastructure that will allow us to cut our carbon emissions and provide the cheap and secure energy supplies that we will undoubtedly need. In this, we should be at one with developing countries. None of us can afford to ignore the dangers of continuing reliance on fossil fuels. That is not ideology or wishful thinking: it is a practical and realistic assessment of the future of the global economy.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10010516000059"></a>The Prime Minister likes making apocalyptic statements about saving the world, but that sort of overblown rhetoric is not really what is needed, especially when it is combined with government delay and obstruction on exactly the sort of projects that will lead us to a sustainable economy. Over the past 15 years, Labour has been far too slow to legislate and implement policies on rolling out smart meters, developing carbon capture and storage, providing and producing the planning guidelines for nuclear power stations or supporting renewable technology and microgeneration investment. The Minister called attention to the great advances that have been made in the past few decades and he is quite right to identify the enormous support that there now is from scientific evidence and public opinion. I hope very much that that support will lead to a meaningful agreement very soon and will not, as has been the case in this country with the Government, result only in yet more talk and still no action.</p>

I echo the thoughts of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, but I would make the point even more strongly: this conference was an absolute failure. Let us be clear about that. We did not move forward; particularly psychologically, we moved back to before Bali and all the optimism and work that had been done before Copenhagen at the end of last year. That is a great challenge and a great problem.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10010529000002"></a>Of all the words and phrases that could be found in the diplomatic lexicon, "accord" was chosen. It means "agreement", but agreement about what? As the Minister said in the Statement, the accord was deposited in the Library of the House. I went there earlier, as I had not read the accord word for word, and found that it had just 12 paragraphs. It contains hardly any numbers-the figure of 2 degrees at the beginning, a wish for a $30 billion transfer of funds, with $100 billion by 2020, and one other figure, which I shall come to later. That is it. There are fewer promises in it than in the Tories' pre-election manifesto, which we heard about yesterday. That is something to beat in terms of aspirations. We have a great failure.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10010529000003"></a>Another thing that Copenhagen showed was a massive transfer of global power. What did we have? We had the deal led by China with South Africa, Brazil and India. Russia was not even there. More important, the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_54"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>European Union did not figure at all. The United States was brought in, but without the President being one to one with the Chinese Premier. That left the rest of the world and most of the nations out of the agreement. It is a major shift. I say that in great sadness. Before, we had Europe leading with a unified voice, with targets and with the desire to be legally tied to real outcomes, yet the European Union was not even part of bringing together the accord.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10010529000004"></a>As the Minister said, there were some good points. One that has not been mentioned was the agreement for verification across the world, particularly by China, which should, we hope, eventually make an agreement deliverable by the United States Senate. There was also the agreement straightaway for a $30 billion transfer of funds, which will primarily relate to forests. The REDD-plus agreement moved forward, which I hope will be one of the major achievements to be delivered from the conference, because if we lose rainforests they are lost for ever.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10010529000005"></a>We will have a debate next week, when I will broaden out some of those themes, but I should like to know from the Minister what the European Union is going to do now in relation to the reduction of 20 per cent versus 30 per cent. This agreement cannot fulfil the requirements for a 30 per cent reduction by 2020 at the European Union level. Where does Europe go from here, after this diplomatic disaster at Copenhagen? I am also interested in the Copenhagen green climate fund that it was decided should be set up. Perhaps the Minister could say a little about whether that is about to happen. Is it part of the United Nations? How does it fit in? How do we know whether this transfer will work properly? I would be interested to understand a little more about the technology transfer organisation.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10010529000006"></a>One of the ironies of the accord lies in paragraph 12, which says, "After we've done all this by 2015, we'll then reconsider whether we should strengthen the target to 1.5 degrees, as the island nation states demanded". Of course, with the weak agreement that we have, that target has become impossible. In many ways, that is the hypocrisy of the accord.</p>

I say to them both that it is important to be optimistic and to look for the positives that came out of Copenhagen. We should map out a trajectory, setting out those parts of the discussions that led to the accord that lead us to see the progress that can be made over the next few months. It is important that we build on those  foundations.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10010529000008"></a>There are risks in simply writing off Copenhagen as a failure. It is important that we remain as optimistic as we can be and, over the next few months, build on what was agreed by 49 nations. Of course there cannot be complacency. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, was right to point to two aspects of the accord that were not mentioned in the Statement: first, verification, which is vital to the integrity of what was agreed and what we hope will be agreed in the future; and, secondly, deforestation.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_55"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10010529000009"></a>I think it important simply to reflect again that this endorses the limit of 2 degrees Celsius as the benchmark for global progress. I remind noble Lords that the countries that signed up to the accord-"agreed to the accord" is probably a more appropriate description-have agreed to make specific commitments to tackle emissions, which are to be lodged in the agreement by 31 January. One hopes very much that the commitments that those nations lodge will build on the offers that were made in the lead-up to Copenhagen. We should not ignore the progress that has been made in terms of the countries that have lodged actions that they will take in relation to climate change. We need to build on that. We remain committed to a legally binding agreement and we will work hard to ensure that that happens.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10010529000010"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked what happens next and what actions the UK Government will take. Clearly, we are still thinking through some of the implications and it is right that we should do that. I welcome the opportunity that we will have in eight days' time for a Thursday debate on climate change, which I am sure will be helpful. Of course we will redouble our efforts to encourage countries to associate themselves with the accord. We will work to get finance flowing to developed countries. We will work hard to contribute to the establishment of a high-level panel on sources of finance and we will do everything that we can to encourage countries to consider the benefit of a legally binding agreement.</p>

<a name="100105-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10010529000011"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said that she was glad that we were not engaging in blame. We have never sought to engage in a blame game. My right honourable friend has, in describing the process at Copenhagen, pointed out simply and accurately why certain countries could not sign up to a legally binding agreement. That is not a blame game and I do not think that it would be sensible for us to indulge in one. We have to take the good bits of what happened at Copenhagen and build on them in the future, engaging with those countries. We are not seeking to inhibit the growth of developing countries, many of whose citizens live in abject poverty. I agree with the noble Baroness about that. We wish to see a sustainable, low-carbon economy developing both in this country and in other countries. I do not accept her criticism of this Government in relation to the action that we have taken to encourage a low-carbon energy policy. We have taken action in relation to new nuclear, the development of clean coal through carbon capture and storage, the reform of the planning legislation, the commitment in the Climate Change Act to an 80 per cent GHG reduction by 2050 and the development of smart meters. All of this is hard evidence of a Government strongly committed to the benefits of a low-carbon economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10010529000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, specifically raised the role of the EU. The EU was at the forefront in developing policies prior to Copenhagen. We should not ignore that. The EU has shown leadership capacity in that regard. It is not accurate to say that the EU was excluded from the agreement on the accord. Other countries were around the table when it was agreed. Of course there were side meetings. I think the noble Lord is referring to one such side meeting. It is fair to point out that there were any number of such meetings

We should not underestimate the role of the EU in that regard. The noble Lord is right then to ask about where we are. Noble Lords will know that the EU signed up to a 20 per cent reduction by 2020, but with a commitment to moving to 30 per cent if an ambitious global deal was reached. The Government are committed to 30 per cent. We wish to see a move to 30 per cent. We will discuss this urgently with our European partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10010529000013"></a>On the issue of holding climate change to 1.5 degrees, my understanding is that, on the current trajectory, even if all emissions were stopped now, 1.4 degrees of warming is inevitable. I do not think that, in any circumstances, 1.5 degrees could be practical, but the noble Lord is right to remind us of the importance of pursuing progress with great energy; building on the accord; encouraging more countries to agree to the accord; making their commitments known by 31 January; and doing everything that we can to secure legally binding agreements in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10010529000014"></a>On the question of the green climate fund and the technology mechanism, it was encouraging that decisions were made. We believe that, essentially, it was recognition of the importance of international financial and technological support for the development and diffusion of low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies. The details of how that will be taken forward have yet to  be agreed but I am always happy to discuss this  further with the noble Lord when we have more information.</p>

Nevertheless, does the Minister recall that last year I pointed out that his own department put the cost of the Climate Change Act to the British economy at anything up to £18 billion a year, year in, year out, and that there would be no conceivable benefit unless there was a global agreement of the same kind? Therefore, I asked him a year ago whether he would undertake, if there was no such agreement at Copenhagen, to repeal the Act, or at least to put it into suspense. He replied that the question did not arise because he was confident that there would be a wholly satisfactory agreement at Copenhagen. Since the Minister's confidence, like everything else that he has said, has been proved to be wholly misplaced, will he now undertake-unlike the European Union, which has made this conditional-to put this wholly unconditional, hugely damaging and hugely costly burden on an economy which is not in the most robust condition anyway into suspense as a result of the total failure of Copenhagen to achieve what he was confident it would achieve? Clearly, no useful purpose can be served by carrying on with this at present.</p>

We estimate that those will reduce emissions by around 10 per cent against business-as-usual projections. They also show that China is embarked on a pathway towards a low-carbon economy. That is happening and it is inevitable. It would be foolish in the extreme suddenly to say, "We are going to stop. We will reverse our policies and move to a high-carbon economy". It is very foolish to think that a high-carbon economy will, long term, be low-cost to this country. It will not.</p>

I observe first, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, that we are living absolutely in the real world. The real world is one in which climate change is happening and poses the biggest threat that any of us faces over the coming generation.

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10010529000020"></a>I thank the Minister for his Statement and pay tribute to the role that the UK has played in seeking international agreement, both at and prior to Copenhagen. However, the outcome of Copenhagen is obviously deeply disappointing. We have emerged with an imperfect, flawed and partial document that offers only a tiny part of a solution to a tiny number of relevant issues. However, the worst possible response to Copenhagen would be to throw up our hands in horror and say that nothing can now be achieved and we must all pack up our bags and go home. Does the Minister agree that it is essential that we redouble our efforts to secure, by the end of this calendar year at the very latest, a binding international legal agreement that will ensure that we reach the two-degree target that was agreed as part of the partial accord?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10010529000022"></a>We should not ignore two facts. First, the accord contains some important gains; it was very important that we put these in the bag. Secondly, several significant offers were made by both developed and developing countries in the lead-up to Copenhagen. We must hope that they translate themselves into the commitments that are made by those countries that agreed to the accord at the end of this month. My understanding is that the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Stern, shows that if you combine the impact of those offers, particularly the highly ambitious end of them, you are within

Of course, there can be no room for complacency. I agree with my noble friend that we should do everything we can to encourage a legally binding agreement.

Many significant nations absented themselves from direct participation in the key decisions. Although Britain could lead by example in what we do about the carbon economy domestically, is it none the less futile for us to seek to work on our own in this area? Will the Government seek to give the European Union the clout which its collective economies ought to enable it to wield, and to do this significantly before the discussions which are to take place thanks to Chancellor Merkel? We have to begin now to get these institutional arrangements in place. We cannot simply wait for suggestions that may emanate from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which are bound to take time and to require widespread consensus of a kind which will probably be too weak to deal with the urgency of the situation.</p>

He will understand that we found it a frustrating experience. Much of the discussion was about process rather than the substantive points that needed to be agreed. It is very important that lessons are learnt from that. One cannot underestimate the challenge of achieving consensus among more than 190 countries. However, it is clear that the process needs to be improved. We were encouraged by the remarks of the UN Secretary-General about his willingness to look at that. I agree with the noble Lord that this is not something the UK can achieve on its own. We have to work with our partners. Working with the EU is particularly important and has been shown to be beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10010529000026"></a>However, on the whole question of institutions, it is worth saying to the noble Lord that for the first time the Copenhagen accord will see developing, as well as developed, countries subject to monitoring, reporting and verification. That is very important. Clearly, we have to work very hard to make sure we have the right mechanisms in place to ensure the integrity of those processes. I assure him that the Government will discuss those matters with our partners in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10010529000029"></a>We will vigorously promote the need for an internationally binding agreement, as my noble friend has suggested. We are considering what specific actions we need to take. I am sure that our debate next week will be very helpful in informing the Government on those matters. My noble friend mentioned the USA and China. Comment has rightly been made about the importance of the role of both those Governments in international negotiations. In the lead-up to Copenhagen, China announced policies which we found encouraging. It is also worth pointing out to my noble friend that the USA recently announced, through its President, that it was prepared to table an emissions commitment of 17 per cent below 2005 levels. The President has made it clear that that is the start of that process. Although, historically, there has been great disappointment about the position taken by the US, it seems to me at least that it has come a long way in a very short time. We are not going to make progress internationally by hectoring and lecturing. We have to work very hard to persuade and to act through consensus. We need to acknowledge progress when it has been made.</p>

Could the Minister clarify the position as regards verification and monitoring? Frankly, the passage in the accord that deals with that is totally inadequate and will prove to be a flimsy and fragile thing which will gradually fall to pieces.

It can be very long indeed and we do not have enough time to disappear down it. Why do we not make use of the G20 meetings to be held this year, which will bring together people who emit something like 80 to 85 per cent of the world's carbon emissions? Can we not use that mechanism, which exists and is stated to be the primary institution for the co-ordination of international economic issues, as the main way to start building up some of the building blocks that will be needed by the end of the year?</p>

I very much take that point. None the less, the experience at Copenhagen has clearly concentrated minds. We should not dissuade the UN Secretary-General from at least looking at the issues and seeking to make changes. We must hope that processes will be put in place at Mexico that will allow decisions to be made in a more realistic environment. The G20 countries will be important in that regard and I do not seek to underestimate the role that those groupings can play. The noble Lord is absolutely right about monitoring, reporting and verification. It is very important that we have institutions of integrity that are transparent and can command confidence-I have no doubt about that. However, it is important to acknowledge that in the Copenhagen accord we are for the first time seeing developed as well as developing countries subject to monitoring, reporting and verification.</p>

Surely it is equally ironic that the Met Office-in one of those long-range forecasts that one would have thought they would have abandoned by now, so unsuccessful have they been-only a few months ago told us to expect a mild winter. The inputs of the Met Office are one of the pillars on which the whole IPCC rests.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10010534000002"></a>I declare an interest as chair of the Children's Society. In July 2001, the General Synod of the Church of England reaffirmed its commitment to the practice of justice through ensuring that, within society, the needs of each person and family, especially the needs of children, are met. I anticipate that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford will have more to say about the church's responsibilities for children in his maiden speech in a few moments.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10010534000003"></a>One of the most striking aspects of contemporary British society has been the growing gap, which has been referred to already, between the rich and poor. Most recently, the Children's Society's Good Childhood Inquiry concluded that the well-being of all our children is directly proportionate to the levels of inequality embedded in our society. We need to tackle not only child poverty, but also the inequality that results from our excessively individualistic style of life. A year ago, I was privileged to be part of that inquiry panel, whose report was debated in this House last February. The inquiry received many submissions from individuals, groups and organisations; but also, more importantly, heard from many children themselves about their concerns and hopes for their childhoods. The report had a good deal to say about child poverty and its causes, and for this reason I unapologetically rehearse one or two of its findings today, in the hope that, as the Bill progresses through your Lordships' House, some of the voices heard and issues raised in the inquiry may find expression in the legislation that we pass.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_62"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10010534000004"></a>One of the most striking things about the evidence received from children was how frequently they mentioned their basic needs. More than 5,000 children responded to the inquiry about their lives. The three topics that they talked most about were friends, family and what was termed their material needs. They spoke mostly about the importance of having a home, a bed, clothes, warmth, food and water. Interestingly, far more children talked about those things than mentioned what we might call material wants such as money and possessions. The central theme of the Good Childhood Inquiry panel's final report is the relationship between poverty and inequality. Noble Lords will be aware that, after the United States, Britain is the most unequal of the rich countries, and we all now understand how tragically this affects our children. The Good Childhood Inquiry panel argued that even more must be redistributed from the rich to the poor if we are to end child poverty once and for all. The evidence here is very clear: this is an issue that children themselves are concerned about.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10010534000005"></a>We know that the relationship between poverty and inequality has a profound effect on children's well-being. However, this is not just about material disadvantage, but also about the ways in which it interacts with other forms of disadvantage to impact on children's life experiences and opportunities. Put starkly, poverty shortens lives. A girl in Manchester can expect to live six years fewer than a girl in Kensington, Chelsea or Westminster. Children in the inner-city schools of Leicester, where some 70 per cent may be on free school meals and where, in one school, 46 languages are spoken, can expect a life six years shorter than that of their near neighbours in the suburbs of the city. Evidence suggests that the experience of poverty in early years can also have a long-term impact on children's cognitive development and educational attainment. A child's cognitive development at 22 months is a strong predictor of future attainment, but the effect of poverty outweighs ability so greatly that, by the age of six, low-achieving children from more advantaged homes will outperform high-achieving children from less advantaged homes. By the end of compulsory education, the divergence is stark. Only 33 per cent of those eligible for free school meals achieve five good GCSEs, compared to 61 per cent of their peers.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10010534000006"></a>The Children's Society works directly with some of the children most likely to experience poverty in our society, including disabled children, children from Traveller, Gypsy and Roma families, and children living in families seeking asylum. Sadly, many of these children do not live in the family units counted as qualifying households in the Bill and its associated guidance. If the aim of the Bill to eliminate child poverty by 2020 is to stand any chance of success, we must include those groups that are the most disadvantaged. I will illustrate their needs by focusing on children living in families seeking asylum. Families claiming asylum are given benefits at 70 per cent of income support levels. They are not allowed to work. When a family is refused asylum, the Government have the power to stop all money and accommodation for the family when they believe that that family is not taking reasonable steps to leave the United Kingdom.

When granted asylum, families have 28 days to leave their accommodation and find somewhere else to live. This is an intensely vulnerable time for families, which can lead to destitution.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10010534000007"></a>A recent survey carried out by the Children's Society, in association with its West Midlands Destitution project, uncovered stories of children growing up in households without any food, heating or toys, mothers who felt forced to prostitute themselves to survive, and young people in care-cut off from any help at 18 -becoming homeless.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10010534000008"></a>My concern is that some of these children and families who are at the greatest risk of living in poverty are not captured by existing data based on qualifying households. Not all children live in qualifying households, and those who do not are often the poorest. Existing surveys of household income do not include data on some of these groups. Surely these children are poor by any measure of poverty, and yet they are excluded from the targets of the Bill. That cannot be right, and I urge the Government to set out how they intend to tackle child poverty for all children and to consider targeted measures for these particular groups, over and above the scope of the general targets.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10010534000009"></a>The Children's Society is not just a campaigning organisation, but strives to tackle the issues at a local level through its practice base. The organisation currently operates 25 children's centres across England in a range of settings, and offers employment and training advice to parents as part of the core offer. The staff see at first hand, over and over again, the difference that this can make to children and families. Their approach is to ensure that the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families receive these services, because financial insecurity can be a real block to parents accessing services.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10010534000010"></a>Therefore, I welcome the provisions in the Bill that place duties on local authorities to measure child poverty in their area and develop a strategy to combat it. It is vital that local authorities work with local partners, including the voluntary sector, to deliver effective local services that will help to break the cycle of poverty and reduce inequality.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10010534000011"></a>Of course we welcome the commitment of the Government to deliver this Bill, but we urge them to go further. It is vital that children's voices are heard in this debate about their poverty. The Government must go further to address the links between poverty and inequality in our society and need to widen the scope of those they survey as living in poverty to include some of the poorest in our society. I hope that the Government will find innovative ways to work locally in partnership with strong public, private and voluntary-sector organisations to deliver the goals of this Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10010534000012"></a>I look forward to taking part in further debates as the Bill makes progress through your Lordships' House.</p>

Others have a lone parent, a disabled parent, a BME parent or an unemployed parent-usually a mixture of them all.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10010534000014"></a>Therefore, this Bill is about income and outcomes for children. It seeks to turn the Government's aspiration, which I am sure is shared by the House, of halving, then eradicating child poverty, into targets-binding targets. Normally in draft legislation, we do not insert a Clause 1 as a statement of intent. Here we have an entire Bill devoted to it. It cannot be done. It has to be done. It is impossible, but it is essential.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10010534000015"></a>Why? In the other place, much of the debate, as my noble friend mentioned in his opening speech, centred around whether tackling poverty of income should be the objective of the Bill, or whether, given that poor children were by definition within poor families, there were drivers behind that poverty of family income-education, worklessness, debt, addiction, family relationships and poor mental health-which should be tackled first. That argument was run by the noble Lord, Lord Freud.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10010534000016"></a>The Government argued, rightly in my view, that their work in other fields-Sure Start, schools, the New Deal for Lone Parents-have progressed in parallel with their pledge on child poverty, and that therefore it was right that this Bill should remain focused if we are to transform the life chances of every child. Without an assault on income poverty, the successful outcomes that we all want to see-happy, healthy and well-educated children-are infinitely harder, if not impossible, to achieve. We need this Bill, not a different Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10010534000017"></a>However, that does not make the task that this Bill sets for itself any easier. Why is it so difficult-perhaps even impossible-while at the same time essential? There are four tests of poverty in this Bill, and they are mostly problematic, as I want to suggest. The first relates to relative poverty-those at below 60 per cent of national median income. It is of course a statement about inequality at least as much as poverty, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester absolutely rightly said. Fewer children in Greece, I suspect, may be-or are, indeed-below the 60 per cent line. But does that mean that there are fewer children in poverty? No, because I suspect that Greek incomes are lower and, therefore, children above the poverty line in Greece may in real terms be worse off than children in England below the poverty line. In other words, international comparisons-I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Freud-without carefully worked-out equivalences of livings standards between countries are, frankly, a waste of space. Indeed, it is arguable that if you take the total benefit package into account, UK children are in the top three or so of OECD countries.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10010534000018"></a>There is a second problem. Conventionally, benefits for people of working age are increased by inflation. Those in work, however, can normally-I do not mean now-expect to see wages rise each year by 2 per cent above inflation. Those below 60 per cent median, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, rightly said, keep falling behind. To catch up, benefits not only have to be linked to earnings, rather than the RPI, to maintain the status quo-and that is expensive enough-but need actually to increase faster than earnings, in  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_65"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order to narrow the relativity gap. Only then will you decrease inequalities. Even if that were acceptable and affordable, if you have several children and only one unskilled earner, what then happens to work incentives? The poverty trap becomes an unemployment trap, unless you revisit the work stop of the 1970s.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10010534000019"></a>Not surprisingly, but unfortunately, therefore, we mostly see a reduction in children in relative poverty where there is recession, where earnings fall and the median bar drops. Thereby, we reduce relative poverty because the country is getting poorer and inequalities close. I am not absolutely sure about this, but that may account for the question of the noble Lord, Lord Freud, as to why attempts to achieve the child poverty targets have done relatively badly since 2004. I suspect that that is due to real wages rising rapidly between 2004 and 2008 and, therefore, the bar has risen faster than children on benefits could keep pace with. That shows the problematic nature of the measure.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10010534000020"></a>This Government admirably have sought to square this circle and make work pay through the minimum wage and tax credits. However, again, if they seek to reduce in-work poverty, as they must, the median bar is raised ever higher and it becomes harder for relatively poor children on benefits to hurdle.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10010534000021"></a>In a sense, the Government have set themselves up to fail. Despite my profound misgivings about the deliverability of the relative poverty target, I do not for a moment believe that it should be discarded. My noble friend reminded us that some 500,000 children have come out of relative poverty, and he hopes that a further 500,000 children shortly will join them. Many lone parents with children under 14, for example, already receive benefits above the 60 per cent median line. But however difficult and demanding it is-and it will be-we have to go further, otherwise children in the bottom quintile will fall further and further behind. As society becomes more unequal, children see themselves as onlookers-the excluded-while other children's well-being rises. I will support anything that increases equality and reduces inequality, as this test does. Therefore, as a test of poverty, the relative poverty measure is flawed, but in terms of social decency, so that children are not left behind, I judge it to be essential.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10010534000022"></a>What none of those who understandably may press for amendments in Committee in order to go further and faster-5 not 10 per cent of children below the line; AHC rather than BHC-should forget, which I am sure they do not, is that the targets in this Bill are frankly already truly heroic and, if we can achieve them, transformative.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10010534000023"></a>The second test-income combined with material deprivation-is also in my view deeply problematic. It combines in one test both income and expenditure, thus brigading what we used to call primary poverty, which is real enough, with in some cases additional secondary poverty-that of expenditure choice. Research shows that of two families with identical income, one may suffer material deprivation, the other not, according to whether those in one family smoke but those in the other do not, or whether they belong to a credit union or, alternatively, have loans at very high APR figures, which plunges them into debt.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_66"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10010534000024"></a>Expenditure also quite properly reflects people's choices. To put it flippantly for a moment, if I may, a member of my family is below the poverty line on material deprivation indicators while being a higher-rate taxpayer. I realise that the index is weighted both for preference and for widely available goods, and of course it is combined with low income. I also recognise that the material deprivation indicator importantly allows us to pick up people whose income seems nominally high because of their housing or disability benefits but whose expenditure is equally high, or higher, as well. Bedroom overcrowding-a problem that has grown with reformulated families, each partner bringing children into the relationship, and to some degree with immigration-or keeping the house warm, which is important where there is a disabled parent or child, are key examples. However, I have always thought it a somewhat odd list of indicators, originally modelled on the Irish bundle of goods. Household contents insurance, for example, is often a generational choice, and safe play facilities or open space close by are less about income than the built environment, but those are alongside the big ticket items, such as overcrowding, and very modest ones, such as affording the 35p once a fortnight for a baked beans and sausage tea for a friend. I remain somewhat hesitant about this list.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10010534000025"></a>Incidentally, talking about housing-and despite the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas-I think that the Government are absolutely right to go for BHC rather than after housing costs. I absolutely understand the argument that housing costs vary dramatically, but equally it can also be argued that they may reflect a choice of higher quality over other goods. However, an argument that I think has so far not been made is that high housing costs usually run alongside cheap transport. Cheaper housing, outside London, usually comes with higher transport costs, estimated to be on average £20 to £30 a week more-the result of sparsity and poor public transport. AHC weights for London at the expense of the rest of the country. Before housing costs, I believe, more fairly assess country incomes as a whole. If you want AHC, you have to run with it by including transport costs, but in all fairness I do not think that we have the detailed statistics to do so.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10010534000026"></a>Similarly, the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, raised the issue of DLA and disability costs. However, DLA does not pay for costs; it is assessed on care needs. Someone living at home with severe depression, for example, may be on the middle rate, receiving the DLA care and mobility elements, but have few extra financial costs in the way of diet, heating or appliances. There may be a case for raising DLA, and I would support the noble Baroness on that, but that is not part of this Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10010534000027"></a>The third test, absolute income, is also not trouble-free. It sets a benchmark, an underpinning to relative poverty figures, which I support. We have been using the 1999 figures, and they show that half the cohort of children who were below the poverty line in 1998-99 were by 2009 lifted above that line. We are talking about 1.7 million children, which is a huge achievement. As this benchmark is independent of what is happening to earnings, it is about real standards of living rather than relative ones.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_67"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10010534000028"></a>The difficulty is that, even with RPI built in, every decade or so you have to rebase your figures, otherwise the benchmark gets too far behind generally accepted standards of living, and you therefore build in a jagged edge every time you rebase and do not end up with the consistent statistics that you need to guide policy. However, consultation with the lobby groups showed that they wanted to retain this and I think that they were right.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10010534000029"></a>Persistent poverty, the last of the four tests, is in my view the most important of all. It is the poverty that scars and affects about 10 per cent of our children. A temporary drop into poverty-while, for example, for six months dad draws contributory JSA-will for most families be fairly quickly overcome when they join the world of work and rebuild their lives. If however you are persistently poor, everything is more expensive-each square foot of your living space, the cost of your fuel, your food, your loans, and certainly your ambitions and aspirations. Persistent poverty defeats the parent and denies the child most of the things that make up the good life. It is the one that really matters.</p>

<a name="100105-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10010534000030"></a>Therefore, I think this is a brave Bill and it is one for which I applaud my noble friend. I edited <I>Opportunity for All</I> on behalf of the Government from its inception to 2005 or so, and 20 or so of our 40 poverty indicators expressed child poverty targets. Those reports sought to measure child outcomes across the field of government activity. This Bill, I believe, completes the jigsaw, turning an aspiration to end child poverty into a commitment, enshrined in law, by which any and every Government rightly should be judged. I think it will be impossibly hard to deliver but we must try. We owe all our children nothing less, for every child matters.</p>

The Government face a formidable challenge in meeting the complex and often long-standing needs of the most vulnerable children and families. Unfortunately, recent research has found that Governments are failing to make the best use of public resources to improve children's lives. As a consequence, the UK spends far more money than its European neighbours remedying preventable social problems. We know that the impact of deprivation can scar lives over generations and result in high levels of child neglect. On the other hand, we know that well targeted early intervention is cost-effective and helps to release families from the trap of cyclical deprivation and reduce the likelihood of family breakdown.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10010534000032"></a>So what will legislation achieve? Well, it will achieve nothing on its own. Its success will depend on the quality of the implementation and the detail of the strategies. Therefore, it is welcome that the powers and duties are given to national, devolved and local government and many other partners, and that the Bill also sets up an expert advisory group.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10010534000033"></a>The Bill contains four targets, about which we have just heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. However, I am concerned that organisations will concentrate  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_68"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>too much on children just below the border-line, in order to raise them just above it, instead of focusing help on those in the deepest poverty, in the same way that schools focus on the border-line C/D grades in GCSEs, raising those that are anticipated to get a D so that they just get a C for the sake of the league tables. Whatever targets we use, we must avoid that.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10010534000034"></a>Then there is the matter of what we mean by eradication, on which I heartily agree with my noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester. Even if we reached 5 per cent, that would still leave 600,000 children in poverty-hardly eradication.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10010534000035"></a>There is another area where the Bill is deficient. Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that a child is,</p>
<ul><a name="10010534000065"></a>"every human being below the age of 18 years".</ul>
<p><a name="10010534000058"></a>Yet Clause 25 defines a child for the purposes of the Bill as,</p>
<ul><a name="10010534000066"></a>"a person under the age of 16",</ul>
<p><a name="10010534000059"></a>or qualifying for child benefit. Why the difference? The danger is that the NEETs and young care-leavers may be excluded from measures to alleviate poverty, and that would be a disaster because many of them suffer extreme poverty at present.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10010534000036"></a>The Government have already had a hard mountain to climb. According to the Library Research Paper 09/62, the number of children living in households on less than 60 per cent of median income in 1979 was 13 per cent and this had risen to 27 per cent by the time Labour took over. This is the horrifying record of the last Conservative Government and we should never forget it, even though it was conveniently forgotten by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, in his attack on the Government earlier this afternoon. Since 1997, things have improved as the figure is now 23 per cent so something has been achieved by this Government, even though they have not hit their targets.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10010534000037"></a>In 1999, Tony Blair pledged to eradicate child poverty within 20 years. We are halfway there in time but not in achievement, so we need to accelerate our actions. What are the Government's priorities? In April 2009, an Oxfam report on poverty noted that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="10010534000063"></a>"Hundreds of billions of pounds have been made available to banks in an effort to avert financial meltdown-throwing into sharp relief, for example, the £4.2 billion needed to meet the interim child-poverty target".</p>

<p><a name="10010534000060"></a>The figure of £4.2 billion comes from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. So have the Government committed this amount? No. The 2009 Budget committed only £140 million extra and yet child poverty costs the Exchequer £25 billion every year, so failing to invest adequately in eradicating child poverty is economically short-sighted and fiscally foolish.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10010534000038"></a>I have two main concerns about the Bill. The first is about the independence and powers of the Child Poverty Commission and the second is about the voice of the child. How can we be assured that the Government will take any notice of the commission? Will it have enough resources to be able to commission research and call for evidence? Will it have a duty to consult children? Will it be truly independent? Based on my recent experience of looking at the independence of Ofqual in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill and the subsequent behaviour of the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_69"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secretary of State for Education, I think the answer is not very independent. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 says that the chair and everyone else, apart from the appointees from the devolved Administrations, are to be appointed by the Secretary of State. How independent is that? I will be seeking to oblige the Secretary of State to consult Parliament, in the guise of the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families, before appointing the chair of the commission. I will also be seeking, as conceded by the Government in the case of Ofqual, to have the members of the commission appoint the deputy chair themselves rather than the Secretary of State doing it.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10010534000039"></a>I welcome the fact that the voice of the child is mentioned in the Bill but it is not enough. Apart from the fact that there is no mention of consulting children in the clauses on the commission, the Secretary of State in Clause 9(4)(c) on consultation with children, is to consult,</p>
<ul><a name="10010534000067"></a>"such children, or organisations working with or representing children, as the Secretary of State thinks fit".</ul>
<p><a name="10010534000061"></a>I will seek to change that "or" to "and", and I was delighted to hear from the Minister in his opening remarks that he may support that.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10010534000040"></a>Other changes are needed to make to the Bill fit for purpose. One of my major concerns is Clause 15, which obliges the Government and the commission to have regard to economic and fiscal circumstances. Presumably this means that in adverse economic circumstances the Government could be exempt from the legal commitment to meet the target. I believe this is unnecessary and could weaken the legislation. I mentioned earlier the high cost to the state of child poverty. What we need here is long-term thinking. The Action for Children's <I>Backing the Future</I> report, produced with the New Economics Foundation, reveals that the cost to the UK economy of addressing current levels of social problems, such as crime, mental illness, family breakdown, drug abuse and obesity, all of which are linked to child poverty, will amount to almost £4 trillion over the next 20 years. They found that, for every £1 invested annually in their own targeted early interventions, society benefits by between £7.60 and £9.20. The report shows that a £191 billion 10-year investment programme of targeted interventions for our most vulnerable children, alongside a £428 billion 20-year programme of investment in universal childcare and parental leave, would deliver net savings of £486 billion over the next 20 years.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10010534000041"></a>This excellent return on investment is approximately five times the current annual budget for the whole of the NHS, so is a very good deal. Why are the Government not proposing a financial package such as this alongside the current legislation? We need cross-party commitment to succeed in the war on poverty. There are to be annual progress reports on the success of the Bill, so let us not make them just an opportunity for party political carping and knocking the Government.

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10010534000042"></a>One of the Bill's main principles is getting parents into work. This is fine as long as it allows parents of very young children, who wish to stay at home to look after them, to do so. We need longer and better paid

We need to have in place all the measures that enable parents to work and care for their children; for example, flexible working hours, part-time workers to be properly paid and to have the same rights as full-time workers, and high quality accessible and affordable childcare. We also need a fair deal for part-time students who should have the same access to grants and loans as full-time students.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10010534000043"></a>We also need a fairer tax system. One of the best ways to remove low-paid families from poverty is the Liberal Democrat tax plan to raise the threshold for paying income tax to £10,000 thereby taking 4 million low-paid people out of tax altogether and saving the average working adult £700 per year.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10010534000044"></a>Does every child matter? The Secretary of State should measure the impact of all these policies on all children and make explicit reference, as has been said, to the most at-risk groups when setting out the impact of measures under the building blocks. Asylum seekers are one such group as their benefits are lower than those of citizens. The Government should allow the adults to work while they are waiting for their applications to be decided. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester mentioned the problem of children in communal accommodation, as the criteria based on households do not apply to them. They may be Gypsy and Traveller children and children in care in children's homes as well as asylum seekers in detention centres.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10010534000045"></a>Fostered children are another vulnerable group: 75 per cent of foster carers earn less than the minimum wage from fostering and most do not have time to work full-time outside the home as they look after the children. Some BME groups, such as Pakistani and Bangladeshi families, also feature highly on the poverty statistics and my noble friend Lady Thomas mentioned disabled children.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10010534000046"></a>We also need to look at debt. In the past 12 months, there has been an increase of 170,000 in the number of children in families living on benefits. Many of them get into debt and pay outrageously crippling interest rates. We need action by the financial services industry to avoid low-income families getting into high-interest debt.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10010534000047"></a>This is an important Bill for children and I look forward to this House making it even better.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10010534000049"></a>This afternoon I want to concentrate on one serious defect which I see. I do not believe that the Bill will achieve its objective because it largely ignores the role of parents. The choices which parents make are an inevitable ingredient in child well-being and so, evidently, in child poverty. The decision to bring a child into the world is made by parents, whether intentionally or carelessly. Parents also choose whether to make a long-term commitment to the well-being of their child;  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_71"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they decide whether the two parents will form a household together and make a home for their child; and if they do, they decide who will look after the children, who will earn the money and how the household income should be spent.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10010534000050"></a>Parental behaviour is not set in stone. There is much more that we could do, for example, to encourage adults to think carefully before conceiving a child. There is more that we could do to encourage both parents to make a long-term commitment to their child's well-being-whether in the form of marriage or not. Many disadvantaged parents need more help to acquire the relationship skills that they will need to make a happy home together a realistic aspiration for their child and for them.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10010534000051"></a>Having so very little reference to parents in the Bill sends the wrong message about the importance of parents in ameliorating child poverty or in child well-being. I do not have the time this afternoon to discuss in detail the problems or the things that should be done to encourage, help and empower disadvantaged parents, but they will no doubt come up in Committee.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10010534000052"></a>I hope that I will not tread on the toes of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, as chairman of the Children's Society, but I, too, will cite the <I>Good Childhood</I> inquiry. I quote from the report written for the Children's Society by the noble Lord, Lord Layard. That excellent report is based on research and an extensive inquiry into the needs of children. Personally, I believe that it should be compulsory reading for anyone seriously interested in reducing child poverty. The quotation that I have chosen perhaps exposes a slightly different aspect of the report than that which the right reverend Prelate emphasised. On page 134, the noble Lord, Lord Layard, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="10010534000064"></a>"So poverty is related to poor outcomes for children. But does this mean that poverty is a direct cause of these poor outcomes? Only partly. In all studies of individuals the effect of family income is greatly reduced, and even sometimes disappears when other causes of child wellbeing are taken into account".</p>

<p><a name="10010534000062"></a>So although poverty is statistically associated with poor outcomes for children, that does not mean that poverty is necessarily itself the cause of those poor outcomes.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="10010534000053"></a>The Bill, instead of addressing the underlying causes of child poverty, tries to address only the symptoms. It focuses on household income and the role that the state can play in supporting household income; it ignores the role of parents. There is only one brief mention of parents, in Clause 8(5), and it is limited to the context of the first UK strategy and relates only to more access to employment and financial support for parents. Worse still, in Clause 9(4), as was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, the Bill refers to a list of persons and organisations whom the Secretary of State must consult before publishing a report. Among those, it mentions children and organisations representing children-not a mention of parents. Why not? Child poverty is profoundly influenced by the behaviour and lifestyle choices of parents. As I said, their choices affect both the income of the household and the way in which it is spent, or not, on the children.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_72"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="10010534000054"></a>There are three main players in the prevention of child poverty: fathers, mothers and the state. It is like a three-legged stool, and it works only if all three are playing their part. Up to now, this Government have shown a lack of faith in parents. For the past 10 years or so, it has been the Government's official and often stated policy that it is not the job of the Government to interfere in the way that parents choose to live their lives. Suddenly, two weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Education made a statement to the effect that he believes in marriage and the importance of parental commitment, and that a Green Paper on relationships and the family is to be published in February. I welcome that good news, but I am concerned that the Bill was obviously drafted before the Government had this welcome change of heart. We now need to know what the Government's future policy on parenting support and family structure will be. Can the Minister give the House an assurance that we shall not be asked to debate this Bill in Committee without seeing the Green Paper, or at least a draft of it?</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10010534000055"></a>Finally, I should like briefly to mention one or two issues which we shall have to address in Committee if the Bill is to have a chance of meeting the targets that it sets itself. First, household income is not necessarily a good measure. Child well-being is a better one. Secondly, poor, dysfunctional and hard-to-reach families have a range of problems which will have to be addressed more effectively by the Government and local authorities, supported by extended families and communities where appropriate, if the Bill's targets are to be met. For example, as many noble Lords have mentioned, they may suffer from poor health, mental health problems, loneliness, drug or alcohol abuse, a member of the family in prison, domestic violence, relationship problems and parental separation, debt, poor or unsuitable housing-the list goes on.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10010534000056"></a>If we are to win the battle against child poverty, public attitudes to the responsibilities of becoming a parent will have to change. Children unwanted or neglected by one or both of their parents are more likely to be poor and disadvantaged. Parental neglect and rejection is very damaging to a child's social and emotional development. The role and responsibilities of fathers in our contemporary society need to be clearly defined, based on research and widely publicised by the Government. The role of paternal grandmothers could be very important in the support and well-being of children. Much child poverty is caused by poor relationships within the family. There is an urgent need for more and better relationship education.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10010534000057"></a>Those and other issues affecting child poverty we shall have to discuss in Committee. Many of those issues will not be resolved by making laws alone. There is a need for painstaking, sustained persuasion-what is now often referred to as the nudge-linked to better research-based information and parenting education. Only if those problems are addressed shall we have a chance, in my view, of meeting the targets set by the Bill. Both the Government and the Opposition are well aware of those problems, yet the Bill appears to ignore them. In its present form, it should not be allowed on to the statute book.</p>

<a name="10010541000001"></a><b><a name="100105-0010.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10010541000064"></a>The Lord Bishop of Hereford:</b> My Lords, like many of you before me, I begin by expressing my gratitude and thanks for the welcome extended to me in the very brief time that I have been in your Lordships' House. A good deal of advice has been offered to me, much of it pointing in the same direction, but not so, perhaps, with regard to the weighty matter of when to make a maiden speech. Some say, "Do it immediately"; others say, "Wait a few months until you are more used to the place", with a whole range in between. Maybe that reflects something of the diversity of views that we hold on so many other rather more important matters. Nevertheless, I am delighted to be able to make a contribution on this Bill. I have long been of the view that within the United Kingdom, the two most urgent and pressing matters are the inequality and widening gap between rich and poor, on the one hand, and the breakdown of family life and marriage, on the other. Hot on the heels of those two-perhaps that is the right phrase-as we have been observing, has been climate change, and many other issues, but none, I think, is more important. Both those issues come together in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10010541000002"></a>We meet on the first sitting day after the Christmas Recess, and have therefore been focusing our thoughts on the birth of Christ, knowing, as we do, that there was no room in the inn. There is a tendency among far too many people to want to romanticise the stable and to suggest that somewhere that was clearly cold, draughty and immensely unhygienic was nevertheless somehow suitable-though not, we would imagine, for our own children or grandchildren to be born, let alone for the son of God. Within a very brief time, he was a refugee, having to escape for his life. We do not know quite what impact these experiences had later on his thinking and teaching, but we know that he taught that every child matters and that unless we,</p>
<ul><a name="10010541000058"></a>"turn and become like children",</ul>
<p><a name="10010541000049"></a>we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10010541000003"></a>The Church of England has nearly 5,000 church schools and 1 million or more pupils within them. We have 500,000 children and young people involved in other groups, in worship and in activities during the week, and thereby we demonstrate our deep commitment to valuing children, to working with them and for them and to serving them as best we can. Naturally, like others, I welcome the Bill, but I also urge that we keep before us the obvious fact that, vital though it is to set the targets-and we may well find ourselves modifying quite how they are expressed-the crucial part is to meet those targets, as well as the action that follows.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10010541000004"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester spoke about the outstanding work of the Children's Society and other noble Lords referred to the Good Childhood Inquiry. This major work has emphasised that what children say they want above everything else are stable, secure, loving relationships within their own homes. The absence of this love and these relationships are the greatest of all poverties. This is in no way to minimise the horror of the abject financial poverty that is the focus of the Bill, or, as has already been   


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expressed, the moral obligation upon us to do our utmost to eradicate it, but it is to put the financial poverty into the right perspective.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10010541000005"></a>We have already been reminded of the 2007 UNICEF report that placed us at the bottom of the league table of the 21 richest nations. That was a league table of well-being, which is not just about money. Poverty affects many aspects of a child's life and is contributed to by a wide diversity of factors. Among those is poverty of aspiration, which contributes to the fact that the proportion of children from poorer homes in higher education has not changed over recent years, despite the extra places in colleges and universities and the encouragement of children from poorer households to look to that opportunity and take it.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10010541000006"></a>In a similar vein, there is a real quandary for a lone parent without work if she or he is offered work. The quandary is between the extra money that they are likely to bring into their household and the pressure that that places on their time and the lessened opportunity they have to give to their child or children the emotional support they need. We need to do more to provide a financial taper that allows this line between unemployment and full employment to be crossed more easily. We also need a taper in other areas, where changing a category of classification can result in a step change in circumstances. A financial taper would, for example, make it easier for a single parent to be able to afford childcare, which is so necessary.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10010541000007"></a>If poverty is not just about money, we need to be more joined up in our thinking and action in addressing all the underlying causes, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said. As the shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions put it,</p>
<ul><a name="10010541000059"></a>"family breakdown is a route into poverty for many children".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/7/09; col. 616.]</ul>
<p><a name="10010541000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, also intimated that earlier. In a similar vein, the Institute for Public Policy Research report in 2006 observed:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="10010541000054"></a>"Much recent US research reports a consistent overarching finding that children who grow up in an 'intact, two-parent family' with both biological parents do better on a wide range of outcomes than children who grow up in a single-parent family. While this research may be instinctively difficult for those on the Left to accept, the British evidence seems to support it".</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10010541000008"></a>Surely it must follow that in being serious about addressing child poverty, we must also address the need to support parents and recognise that support needs to be given early. There is ample evidence, for example, that relationship education programmes make a difference. The churches do a great deal in terms of marriage preparation and support, relationship development, parenting courses and so on. We know what significant contributions they can make in aiding all types of families, whether with married, co-habiting or single parents. Whatever the nature of the family unit, early support can make a real difference.</p>

<a name="100105-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10010541000009"></a>The director of One Plus One, Penny Mansfield, wrote recently:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="10010541000055"></a>"If we are concerned about the wellbeing of children, we must look first at how their parents are getting on".</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10010541000056"></a>"Our research shows that relationships can be strengthened and breakdown in some cases prevented. Good early interventions have been shown to decrease costs incurred later by schools, social

But it takes bold political will to spend now to save money later".</p>

<p><a name="10010541000052"></a>This research, like so much other, comes from the voluntary sector and underlines the need for voluntary agencies to be encouraged in their work with properly funded statutory agencies, both making their unique contributions as equal but different partners in the joint enterprise. As the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions observed when introducing the Bill:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10010541000057"></a>"We know that no law alone can end child poverty".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/7/09; col. 603.]</p>

<p><a name="10010541000053"></a>It has to be accompanied by the will and the action from all quarters.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10010541000010"></a>The diocese that I have the privilege to serve covers not only Herefordshire but south Shropshire, about 20 parishes in Wales and a little bit of Worcestershire. Half of its small total population of 330,000 lives in communities of less than 500. Not surprisingly, we are therefore the most rural English diocese, so noble Lords will not be surprised if at this point I say that we must not forget rural poverty and rural households in greatest financial need. Rural poverty may largely be invisible as a statistic, which is part of the problem, but if you are the child, it is not invisible but extremely real.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="10010541000011"></a>To give an example from my diocese, one of our village schools has only 87 children, 24 per cent of whom have free school meals. In a village community, that is a massive figure. The head teacher there, like head teachers of so many schools, says that the number of children who are entitled to free school meals is considerably higher, but parents are reluctant to request them, partly because of the stigma that they still see attached to them-however much they are meant to be confidential, in such a small community, they are not-and partly because of rural pride. Therefore, the statistics do not always reveal the whole truth. South Shropshire has been the poorest rural district in our country. With a small population, this issue is desperately difficult to address. Households are scattered and communities are tiny. Thankfully, the problem can be helped by the strength of many of our communities themselves and by the part that the churches and the villages play within it.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10010541000012"></a>Reference has been made already to Sure Start, and I want to refer to Peterchurch, a village in Herefordshire, where a hugely innovative project is being undertaken by the church and the church council, which, in partnership with the Church Urban Fund, the Herefordshire Council and the DCSF, have raised £500,000. Part of the church has been set aside for a children's centre which is run by Sure Start and serves the very scattered communities of the golden valley. It addresses the needs of all households, including especially those with the lowest incomes, by providing, among other things, integrated early learning and childcare for babies and children under the age of five, childcare which is suitable for working families, family support and outreach, child and family health services, and so on.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10010541000013"></a>While it is fundamental that we commit ourselves at every level of organisation-governmental, statutory, voluntary including the churches, and so on-to reduce  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_76"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>child poverty, it is also vital that we address, as the right reverend Prelate stressed, the associated issue of inequality. In part, measures of child poverty, as we have been reflecting, touch on that, but the recent work of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett highlights widening inequality as exacerbating all the issues that those in poverty face. They say that among the wealthiest nations the four that have least inequality between richest and poorest also have the best quality of life for all. The General Synod of our church called for "minimum income standards", as have others, which would strengthen the focus of eradicating child poverty and close the inequality gap.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10010541000014"></a>Finally, while equality has risen within this country and the others of the United Kingdom, it has also risen across countries. That to which we aspire within our own shores must be that to which we aspire for others within our global village. We have committed ourselves to world millennium development goals which include much to do with child poverty. As we strengthen our processes and resolve again to eradicate that poverty in Britain, let us similarly strengthen again our resolve to achieve those millennium goals for the benefit of those who are far poorer in other countries. I look forward to pursuing some of these issues further and, above all, to their being reflected in future legislation and action.</p>

However, the right reverend Prelate's speech shows what an asset he will be to this House. As chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children, I am delighted that we seem to have another recruit to the superb confederation of those who speak on their behalf in this House.

I asked yesterday whether he, like so many other Bishops I know, is keen on cricket. I was told that this was not the case but that he is interested in golf and fly fishing. I am not sure how he combines the two. Perhaps this is an example of his versatility. We are welcoming to the Bishops' Benches someone with a wealth of experience, understanding and humour.

<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_77"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the 2010 target to halve child poverty. Eradication by 2020, even when that means less than 10 per cent of children and young people living in poverty and not absolute eradication, is a challenging target. This Bill provides, therefore, a welcome impetus to focus again on this all-important issue. This Government have done much to try to combat disadvantage through financial and educational initiatives. I know that more is being done to encourage low income parents to take advantage of child trust funds. Family intervention projects are working well. Sure Start is a success. The number of people in drug treatment has doubled in 10 years. I must declare an interest as chair of the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse. Those are examples of tackling the causes of poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10010541000018"></a>As many have said, we are faced with inequalities in income. In the UK, the richest 20 per cent is seven times richer than the poorest 20 per cent. Millions of children in the US and Britain seem destined to inequality from the day that they are born. Poverty engenders disadvantage and disadvantage is likely to result in poor cognitive, social and physical development and, in some cases, behavioural problems-not necessarily, but likely. As UNICEF points out-I declare an interest as a board member of UNICEF-the Child Poverty Bill represents an opportunity to enhance human rights and, specifically, child rights in the UK. These are rights to health, education, protection and development as an individual. We cannot punish children for the shortcomings of their parents.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10010541000019"></a>The proposed establishment of the Child Poverty Commission is welcome in relation to monitoring progress on these fronts. I know that the House will follow with interest the composition and terms of reference of that commission. Consultation with children is essential, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, stated. I would hope that consultation with parents, carers and those individuals and organisations who support children will also be carried out.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10010541000020"></a>As many have said, it is also important that all young people are supported. Every child does matter. I know that there were amendments in Committee in another place to include young people under the age of 18 rather than 16 in addressing child poverty. International and European law support the age of 18 and under as the definition of the word "child". The age of 18 is also relevant to child protection and <I>Every Child Matters</I> reforms. We are bedevilled by different definitions of what constitutes a child. While I understand the complication of age limits in relation to child benefit, as others have said, it is an issue.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10010541000021"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission, together with other bodies supporting children and families, strongly supports this Bill and welcomes the duty on the Secretary of State to report on the four targets of relative low income, low income and material deprivation, absolute low income and persistent poverty, although there is some criticism that the targets are too income focused. Specific groups are mentioned in the commission's briefing, on which others have and no doubt will comment, including missing or under-represented groups, non-resident parents, lone parents, the disabled and looked-after children. This Bill and subsequent action on the Bill has to be about all children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10010541000022"></a>There has been an interesting discussion about targets and the causes of poverty, particularly in the very detailed speech of my noble friend Lady Hollis. One of the good things about the Bill is that it focuses not only on targets but on the means of delivering them. In particular, I welcome the emphasis on the collaboration between national and local government that my noble friend the Minister welcomed. Delivery at all levels, supported by a commission, is surely the way to achieve results.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10010541000023"></a>The building blocks outlined in the strategy include not only support for parents but the involvement of health, education, childcare and social services and housing and social inclusion, all of which are essential in tackling child poverty. A closer relationship to the <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes, including enjoyment and leisure, may have been useful. The principles behind the building blocks are also important, with their emphasis on work being the best route out of poverty, on strong families, on early intervention and on the high-quality delivery of services. An existing example of excellent support to families, as I mentioned earlier, are the family intervention projects, and I hope that this model can be built on.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10010541000024"></a>I shall dwell briefly on another group about which I have spoken before in many debates: kinship carers. The Minister will not be surprised at my raising them; he has several times met kinship carers, particularly grandparents, to listen sympathetically to their worries, and all concerned are grateful to him for this interest.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10010541000025"></a>Poverty begins with parents and carers and may be intergenerational. This is the link that must be broken. Many grandparents who look after grandchildren permanently are impoverished. Some 300,000 children are living with family and friends: that is, with kinship carers. Three out of four such carers experience financial hardship. Four out of 10 live on £200 a week or less. Only one in six of local authority placements are with kinship carers; the rest are placed in non-relative foster care. Yet the outcomes for children in kinship care are much better than for those in other care situations. It makes financial and social sense to support kinship care. The number of care applications has increased by 47 per cent in recent months, and there is a shortage of foster carers for more than 8,000 families. Family and friends' care is part of the solution, but kinship care must be properly supported. I shall table amendments to that effect.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10010541000026"></a>This is a good Bill and is much needed. I agree that a cross-party approach is important. No doubt the Bill's progress through your Lordships' House will improve it further, and I look forward to interesting times and to the Minister's response. I apologise for my husky and spluttering voice. It is not because of emotion; I have a sore throat.</p>

He gave us a very high goal to reach in addressing child poverty, and perhaps most importantly he identified the two critical issues that we should address: the widening gap between rich and poor, and the breakdown of family life. These are the twin prongs of the fork that pins children into a life of poverty and distress.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10010541000028"></a>The right reverend Prelate also indicated his belief in the need to meet the millennium development goals. I have my own concerns about the efficacy of the implementation of this Bill and whether or not the goals that it sets will be reached. Surely the fact that the Government at this very late stage have decided to set a strategy for conquering child poverty gives rise to questions, when noble Lords on all sides of the House, and indeed the UN family, are committed to meeting the millennium development goals. The two keys here are access to health and access to education. Reaching those two goals by the target date of 2015 would be the biggest way of sweeping aside child poverty in the United Kingdom that we have known.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="10010541000029"></a>My concern about the Bill is that the lines are drawn so narrowly that it is a matter of figures and targets and of identifying things that can be measured and that may indicate what child poverty is in the United Kingdom. I wait to hear whether these targets have been chosen because they are quantifiable and easily measurable, can be put down in figures, and are likely to clarify why child poverty in the United Kingdom is so pervasive and widespread. Will the Minister confirm this? I am intrigued that this Government are setting the strategy for the next Government and not for themselves. If this is the case, my concerns widen somewhat.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10010541000030"></a>This Bill is said to comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child but, because of the narrowness of its drafting, it overlooks the fact that UK government policies also directly affect child poverty outside Great Britain and Northern Ireland, not least through the economic migration of workers into the United Kingdom. Throughout eastern Europe, children are being abandoned in institutions as a direct result of one or both parents going abroad to work. They come here to the United Kingdom in great profusion, as well as to other selected members of the European Union and to Russia, and they leave their children behind with members of their extended family, frequently the grandparents, who can rarely if ever meet either the extra economic burden or the big physical burden of bringing up their grandchildren. The grandparents simply do not have the strength, and they most certainly do not have the money.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="10010541000031"></a>Furthermore, many single mothers are inadvertently produced by the father travelling abroad to work, and money that is not forthcoming from the father working abroad can result in family breakdown and children being placed in institutional care. A key example of this is Russia withholding remittances from Moldova for quite a few years. Since 30 to 40 per cent of Moldova's income is from remittances, you can only imagine the effect that this has had on children there. Moldova is not alone. The inescapable fact-alas, it is evidence-based-is that migratory workers suffer much higher rates of mental illness and of drug and alcohol addiction through loneliness. They also suffer hugely

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="10010541000032"></a>Family breakdown in the countries of origin is now a common occurrence, so where are the stable and loving relationships which the children need and to which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford so rightly referred? Many thousands of young children in residential care in the World Health Organisation European region are without a parent. In eastern Europe, only 14 per cent of children are in residential care as a result of child maltreatment; one in three have been abandoned by their parents, generally for reasons that I have already identified; one in two are there because they require a place to live, generally through family poverty that is unalleviated by government measures, such as child benefit, that are standard throughout the EU member states; and one in two children in social care are disabled. Only six per cent are true orphans with no living parent, although the institutions in which they are placed are often wrongly called orphanages. I refer noble Lords to Kevin Browne's study of 2009, <I>The Risk of Harm to Young Children in Institutional Care.</I></p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="10010541000033"></a>This Bill, which is so narrowly drawn, does not take these wider implications into account. I would like the Bill at least to pay tribute to joined-up government. Where is the trade provision to help these families to find jobs at home? Where is the provision to support them? What advice do the Government give to the Governments in question in eastern Europe? After all, we are the second biggest net contributor to the European Union, and the European Commission, with its wider Europe policy, is heavily engaged with all these nations. I visit British embassies there-they are magnificent-and I am deeply concerned about the withdrawal of funding from those embassies so that they have little capability to do those things that they can see so clearly could be done and in which we have so much competence ourselves.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="10010541000034"></a>I suggest that the Lisbon treaty and the work of the European Commission have failed to recognise the consequences of EU economic policies on the preservation of families and of the right of children not to be separated from their families against their will, to which Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child refers. To prevent child poverty throughout the European Union and here, there needs to be a concerted effort by all member states to look at the effects of economic policies on family life. The Bill does not address this in any way. While the European Union has no competence for children's issues, and as we know has no legal base, none the less, EU member state responsibilities to implement fully the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was comprehensively identified by the Council of Ministers in 1998 when it declared that failure to implement the UNCRC would rank as failure to implement the treaty, with all the consequences and gravity that that implies. Her Majesty's Government were inevitably part of that declaration and we are committed to it.</p>

Falling back on Article 12 of the UNCRC, as the Bill before the House today does, is an inadequate and unsatisfactory position for Her Majesty's Government to adopt.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="10010541000036"></a>The Forensic and Family Psychology Research Group at the University of Nottingham, led by Professor Kevin Browne, to whom I have already referred, has recently received significant ongoing financial support from the EU Daphne programme on violence against women and children to explore the full extent of child abandonment throughout Europe and to identify best practices for its prevention. The team has already identified the extent of young children in residential care across Europe and best practices connected with the deinstitutionalisation of these children by building services to support children returned to their families and the community. But progress in this endeavour has been slow and laborious because of a lack of commitment and funding.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="10010541000037"></a>The same amount of financial support needs to be made available to Bulgaria which joined at the same time as was made available to Romania, and to the new accession states of Croatia, Turkey, Macedonia and upcoming Bosnia in addition to the other central and eastern European member states that joined in 2004. The Minister and I know that this has not happened. Personally, I believe that very little funding is required to swing the balance back towards support for families and children in the wider eastern European Union states and that the British Government, the Foreign Office and experts who can give advice from here would have a large part to play for a small pocket of funding, particularly if it were made available to the British embassies.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="10010541000038"></a>The most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury reminded us in his new year's message of our responsibilities to those outside our gates. Child poverty, perhaps we think of today, as here and now, and indeed it is. But I make no apology in the light of the Archbishop's message and of the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford today to make the fundamental point that we as a critical and powerful member of the European Union could do so much more, yet the Government have pulled back funding for the Foreign Office and our embassies for this work. I do not believe that is right and I urge the Minister to think again and to incorporate into this Bill measures to cover the points I have mentioned.</p>

Child poverty has been endemic in Northern Ireland for a very long time. Currently we have around 96,000 children living in poverty. We have higher rates of persistent unemployment and economic inactivity. Those children who are living in poverty are much more likely to have done so for longer periods of time, so the effects are more likely to be ingrained and  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_82"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>severe. I see this reflected in my own community and in those nearby me where some children are living in families that are experiencing third or even fourth generation unemployment. This affects children's health, education, leisure and, in the long term, their aspirations and outcomes. I welcome any legislation or action that puts a responsibility on government to address this.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="10010541000040"></a>In terms of the Bill itself, I think that the clause which makes measuring child poverty the responsibility not simply of Westminster and the UK Government but of the devolved Administrations, is crucial. It is right that the Northern Ireland Executive should measure child poverty annually and report its findings to the Assembly. This is right both in terms of the democratic process and because it may act as an impetus to government to ensure that action is taken to begin to address child poverty rather than simply subscribing to an overall aim of reducing poverty without any clear actions to do so.</p>

<a name="100105-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="10010541000041"></a>It is only in the last number of years that Northern Ireland has measured child poverty in terms broadly comparable with those elsewhere in the United Kingdom It is important that we provide an accurate picture across the UK of the overall levels of poverty and how all our children are experiencing poverty, otherwise it is too easy for some nations to fall far behind. I understand that there are still some difficulties in terms of measuring persistent poverty in Northern Ireland and I would urge the Government to ensure that the necessary steps are in place to enable this very significant measure of poverty to be reflected across the UK.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="10010541000042"></a>Northern Ireland has had Lifetime Opportunities, an anti-poverty strategy which was in draft for some years and was ratified last year by the Northern Ireland Executive. However, this has not seen any clear and consistent action really to begin to address child poverty. The lack of targets and associated programmes of action within the strategy has meant that it has had little or no effect. It is also a strategy that has had no associated resources, but relied on individual departments to undertake and resource actions for moving it forward; this has not worked. We have not seen the kind of significant programmes that would address child poverty where it is located in concentrated pockets. Some communities in Northern Ireland have rates of child poverty of over 90 per cent, a staggering figure, and any serious anti-poverty strategy must address it.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="10010541000043"></a>My understanding is that the NI Executive has agreed that the Child Poverty Bill should place a duty to produce a child poverty strategy on the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister and, importantly, should place an equivalent duty on all Northern Ireland departments to contribute to the strategy. It is then to be reviewed and progress monitored. This I welcome as vital if we are to make any real headway in addressing the underlying causes of child poverty. I also think it is crucial that the Northern Ireland Executive should demonstrate that all parties can work together on what is one of the most significant issues for children, families and communities. Clause 8 sets out a clear duty on the Secretary of State, when producing a child poverty strategy, to take account of the employment of parents, the development of the skills of parents, the provision of financial support, health education,  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_83"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>social services, housing and the built environment, and the promotion of social inclusion. These are vital in addressing child poverty, and it is therefore crucial that there is also a duty on the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister and other NI departments to take these into account.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="10010541000044"></a>One example of why this is so important is that currently in Northern Ireland 47,000 young people aged 16 to 24 are not in education, employment or training. This represents around 20 per cent of that population group, which is higher than the United Kingdom average. A significant number of these young people are currently parents, or will go on to become parents in the next few years. However, in Northern Ireland we do not have a strategy to address the problem of getting them back into employment and training whereas England, Scotland and Wales all have such strategies already in place. We have yet to begin a pilot of the Future Jobs Fund that has been put in place for young people in Britain, where 95,000 jobs have been allocated for creation. In Northern Ireland, the Department for Employment and Learning is suggesting a 50-job pilot later in the month. We are clearly lagging behind on a significant issue linked to child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="10010541000045"></a>This illustrates why it is so important that the full range of duties under this legislation linked to the strategy and its actions are included for Northern Ireland. My understanding is that this amendment has been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive and I look forward to considering it more closely.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="10010541000046"></a>Finally, I wish to address the issue of resourcing. We cannot address child poverty without putting in place programmes and actions that are resourced to reduce the underlying causes. What is required is support for employment, access to affordable childcare, intensive family support, programmes that address school readiness or support children from disadvantaged areas to do much better at school, combined with measures that build communities and address the fragmentation that many disadvantaged communities experience.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="10010541000047"></a>We have heard a great deal of talk today about poverty and what it is, about family life and so on. For me, poverty is explained in the letters of the word: it is about powerlessness; it is about having no opportunities to do anything; it is about having no voice-everyone talks for you but not to you; it is about having low attainment in education; it is about having trust in no one; it is about having no resources. And the last and most important letter in the word poverty is "y", which is about yourself; it is a very lonely place to be.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="10010541000048"></a>This Bill must be resourced. Without adequate resourcing it will not make a significant difference; with resourcing it may begin to reduce child poverty levels across the United Kingdom. On that basis, it is to be welcomed.</p>

In the United Kingdom at present, 4 million children are living in poverty, after housing costs. As a highly industrialised country and a member of the G8, this is not only an abject failure but should serve as an embarrassment. This state of affairs was a contributory factor to our ranking bottom for levels of child well-being out of 21 OECD countries in the UNICEF Report Card 7. I hope that the Bill will be strengthened during its passage through your Lordships' House in order to reassure the people of the United Kingdom that we are taking bold steps to eradicate this inequality which permeates so many young lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="10010543000002"></a>Clause 7 makes provision for the Child Poverty Commission and Schedule 1 elaborates on the components of the new body. It is important that we ensure that the organisation which is established is not only independent but also fully accountable to all layers of society. There is a genuine concern that the new organisation should not contribute to the bureaucratic burden of those in the voluntary sector and local communities in their work to tackle poverty among young people. The commission should give credence to the multi-faceted approach that is desperately needed successfully to reverse the unacceptable levels of deprivation among our children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="10010543000003"></a>Clause 8 makes it incumbent on the Secretary of State to create a nationwide strategy to address the issue of child poverty. I support subsection (5)(a) as it ensures that due consideration will be given to the employment status and skills of parents when producing the scheme. Children quite often inherit poverty from their parents and, therefore, adult poverty and its causes are of equal importance in adequately addressing child poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="10010543000004"></a>At present, 5 million adults are illiterate and 17 million struggle with basic literacy. A significant number of these adults are parents to some of the poorest children in our communities. As a result, the lack of opportunities these children face extends beyond economic poverty and affects their education and future employment prospects. Children who live in households where adults do not engage in any form of employment are not only the most deprived in our society but are more likely to follow this example once they leave compulsory education. This generational cycle of unemployment is a key factor in the rising levels of welfare dependency and deprivation.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="10010543000005"></a>However, a number of these parents who are in employment are typically in receipt of low incomes. The incomes of the poorest 20 per cent of families have consistently fallen every year since 2004. This inequality will not be rectified but in fact will be compounded by the Government's proposal in the Pre-Budget report to increase national insurance contributions by 0.5 per cent for all workers who earn £20,000 or in excess of this figure. There will be families who earn this amount or slightly more who will fall into this bracket. One of the reasons commonly given as to why people on low incomes leave full-time employment is that they believe there is little financial incentive to work. One can argue that the rise in unemployment will have an undesirable effect on child poverty. There is a connection between adult

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="10010543000006"></a>Clause 9(4) gives details of the relevant groups that the Secretary of State should consult when preparing the child poverty strategy. I am concerned about subsection (4)(c) as it implies that it is optional for the Secretary of State to consult children in regard to the strategy. The strategy can only benefit from the input of children who have experienced deprivation. If this clause remains elective rather than mandatory, the legitimacy of any future strategy may be compromised. Furthermore, it can be argued that failing to consult children could breach their rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that young people have a right to be represented irrespective of the context. The contribution that children can make to future policy could be vital to measuring its impact. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the matter of the involvement of children will receive further consideration.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="10010543000007"></a>Clause 20 promotes collaboration among local agencies in tackling child poverty through providing local authorities with a duty to liaise with relevant bodies. I welcome this clause as it will promote greater dialogue between these groups when implementing the child poverty strategy to ensure the best outcomes for young individuals.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="10010543000008"></a>Child poverty is a complex issue. A multifaceted approach to tackling this problem is necessary, as there are divergent components which add to this injustice. Local authorities and agencies play a vital role in ensuring that children and the most vulnerable members of society receive the support that they need. It is only fair that they receive adequate training and resources to enable them to continue to fulfil these duties. Local authorities must be given the freedom and flexibility to address deprivation among young people without additional layers of bureaucracy. Levels of child poverty are higher among the black and Asian communities at 31 per cent and 42 per cent respectively, as compared with their white counterparts where it stands at 20 per cent. That situation concerns me.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="10010543000009"></a>Does the Minister agree that areas where child poverty is prevalent should be given extra resources in order effectively to implement the proposed child poverty strategy? Conversely, the offending rate among Muslim youth is rising. Can the Minister explain to your Lordships' House what steps the Government will take to address this situation?</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="10010543000010"></a>One glaring omission from the Bill is the failure to recognise the relationship between family breakdown and child poverty. Research suggests that children from broken families are 75 per cent more likely to fail academically; 70 per cent more likely to engage in drug abuse and 35 per cent more likely to experience long-term unemployment and become reliant on state benefits. Approximately 1 million children live in homes where adults engage in alcohol abuse, whereas close to 350,000 young people have parents who struggle with drug addiction. Does the Minister agree that fixing our broken society will result in reducing the number of children living in poverty? Does he agree that we need to do more to combat alcohol and drug addiction as part of a child poverty strategy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="10010543000011"></a>In 1999, the former Prime Minister made a pledge to end child poverty within 20 years. Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that the Government will fail to meet their target of halving child poverty this year by 600,000 children. To call this situation disappointing would be a gross understatement.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="10010543000012"></a>Child poverty is not just about money. It encompasses access to education, healthcare and suitable housing. Education can provide a route out of deprivation. As a former visiting lecturer, I attach a great deal of importance to the power of education as a means to enhance the opportunities of young people irrespective of their background. I should like to see admission to tertiary education become a plausible aspiration for all young people who live in poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="10010543000013"></a>The failure to make progress in this area reflects the narrow approach of the tax credits system. We cannot afford to waste the potential of our young people. We have both a civic and an economic duty to deal with the prevalence of child poverty in our society. The lack of success in dealing with this predicament calls for us to adopt a bold approach to ensuring that we eliminate this problem in the immediate future.</p>

However, I disagree with at least some of the things that have been said. I was there when Tony Blair stated Labour's intention to abolish child poverty by 2020. A sort of frisson went through the audience, because no one expected anything so far reaching at the time. It was announced in the William Beveridge lecture that Tony Blair gave in March 1999. William Beveridge was one of my predecessors as director of the London School of Economics, and of course is widely acknowledged as the founder of the modern welfare state. Blair deployed one of my favourite quotations from Beveridge in what he had to say. When he was 80, Beveridge wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10010543000058"></a>"I am still radical, and young enough, to believe that mountains can be moved".</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="10010543000015"></a>Blair was not quite 80 at that particular point, but he took as his theme the inspiration that mountains can be moved, and in that speech also affirmed Labour's intention to introduce a minimum wage. The whole point of the speech was to say that the welfare system and the welfare state have to be radically revised because of the fundamental transformations happening in the wider social and economic order. That is an imperative that we still have to sustain today.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="10010543000016"></a>Child poverty was the right thing to be radical about. Other noble Lords have explained why-because of its pervasive nature and the massive impact that it has on all aspects of the wider life of society. Moreover, one should remember that at that time the country was faring spectacularly badly compared to other EU countries; depending on how you measure child poverty, it ranked 14 out of 15 EU countries. However, radicalism of intent has not been matched by radicalism of achievement. The mountain has proved extremely hard to move. It is an achievement, of course, to have lifted half a million children out of relative poverty. However,  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_87"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as other noble Lords have said, in terms of relative poverty, child poverty increased over the period from 2004-05 to 2007-08. The target for 2004-05 was missed. It is certain that, give or take the impact of the recession, the target for 2010 will also be missed.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="10010543000017"></a>The current Bill reaffirms seriousness of intent. For that reason, I am happy to support it. It is worth recognising that accompanying the Bill has been a flurry of documentation produced by the Government which has been very valuable-for example, <I>Ending Child Poverty</I> and <I>Making it Happen</I> and about five other major documents. These were supposed to initiate a debate with child poverty agencies, and this they have done. The responses from child poverty groups to the initial formulation of this Bill have been very valuable and I shall allude to one or two of them.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="10010543000018"></a>I want to make four points. I should like my noble friend the Minister to consider commenting at least on the first three, while the final one is for the opposition Front Bench. As an academic and a social scientist, I believe that a far more comparative analysis is needed than has so far informed the Government's approach. We must do a lot more to learn from best practice elsewhere. In the documentation to which I referred, there are allusions to other countries, especially in respect to what should count as abolishing child poverty, but no systematic comparisons-only superficial comparisons are made. It is essential, in dealing with an entrenched problematic issue such as child poverty, that we scour the world and look at best practice. To my mind, that has not really been done.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="10010543000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, said that his triangle was the closest thing to an iron law in the social sciences. As a practising social scientist for many years, I have heard all that before, but there are no iron laws in the social sciences, nor is there anything approaching one. I would counsel not too much reliance on that aspect of what he said.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="10010543000020"></a>When you look at different industrial countries in comparative terms, you find that some of the countries that have the lowest rates of marriage and the highest rates of single-parent households also have the lowest rates of child poverty. I have in mind the Scandinavian countries in that connection. We should beware these specious statements about marriage and the family unless they are backed up with detailed comparative research.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="10010543000021"></a>Incidentally, it is not true that child poverty as such is not discussed in continental countries. I started working on the issue with social scientists in many countries 15 years or so ago, when it was certainly discussed. I made several trips to Scandinavia and the United States at that time, and of course the European Union enshrines a good deal of this in its own programmes.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="10010543000022"></a>Secondly, and this is aimed more directly at the Minister and the Government: you do not move a mountain simply by removing the topsoil. You have to have serious earth-moving equipment in order to do that, and my question is: where is it? It is common knowledge that the best study recently of child poverty, produced by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says that something like £4.3 billion a year is needed if the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_88"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government are to get close to the targets that they are setting themselves. We have to remember, as other noble Lords have said, that since child poverty, at least by the EU measure, is relative, it gets harder and harder the more successful we are. It is not possible to achieve a step change, which is what is needed, without substantial resources being invested, and I do not quite see where they are.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="10010543000023"></a>As someone who has been working for the past year on climate change, I support what the Government are doing but it seems to be similar. We now have the most robust forward-looking framework for countering climate change, but our actual achievements are pretty minimal. We have only about 1 per cent of the total energy mix coming from renewable sources, compared with 40 per cent in Sweden. Funding will be necessary, whoever is in government, and it will to be substantial and regularised. I do not quite see where that is at the moment.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="10010543000024"></a>Thirdly, we will need to be much more radical at the level of policy innovation. I do not agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Freud, said in his address, but he is right that we have to be innovative, and he has tried to show this in the work that he has carried out in this area.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="10010543000025"></a>The existing strategy of depending on tax credits has been valuable, and I was pleased to hear that a Tory Government would sustain that, although I am not sure what the actual quantity would be. However, we know that it has its limits, and after the scenario I have described, these limits have been fairly well explored. We know that there is a lot of in-work poverty; something like 50 per cent of children who live in poverty are living in a family where at least one parent is in work.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="10010543000026"></a>All parties need more radical thinking at this point. If Beveridge could say, "I am still a radical at 80", and mean it and still produce radical thinking, that is what we should be doing. We have to be a lot more innovative than current policy suggests. However, I do not support some of the things that noble Lords have said about the specific nature of the Child Poverty Bill not looking at rounded notions of children's well-being. After all, the Government have put an enormous amount of effort into fostering child well-being; there have been many initiatives, beginning with Sure Start, which has been mostly successful, through to the Children Plan. Many other aspects of children's well-being have certainly been the concern of the Government. You might say that it has not all worked as it should, but the kind of criticism I am referring to is misplaced.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="10010543000027"></a>I address my fourth point to the Tory Front Bench. I was pleased to hear the Conservative Party's commitment to getting somewhere close to eradicating child poverty or making a serious dent in it. I was glad to hear, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Freud, said, that the party now accepts that poverty is a relative phenomenon. In other words, we are living in a society that is much too unequal. To me, countering child poverty is the main lever for potentially radically reducing overall inequality in our society.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="10010543000028"></a>I should like to hear a bit more from the Tory Front Bench about this, though. If targets are going to be abolished, for example, what will replace them? To eliminate child poverty is, of course, a target. You could define it as 5 per cent, as 10 per cent or, as the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_89"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>documentation does, as between 5 per cent and 10 per cent, but it plainly is a target. Targets give specific form to aspiration. I note that when Oliver Letwin mentioned the Tories' new commitment-at least, new to me-to radically reducing child poverty, he described it as an aspiration, not a pledge. I should like the Tory Front Bench to say a bit about how the pledge could be more hard-edged.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="10010543000029"></a>I agree with other noble Lords who say that this should be a cross-party endeavour, without political point-making but with serious debate. If the parties indeed work together, we can start to move the mountain.</p>

I absolutely agree with his final point about co-operating across parties to try to achieve this end. There is no purpose in point-scoring; it is too serious a subject for that. I will say two other things about his speech. First, he was interested in moving mountains. It is a long time since 1999 and we are still floundering in the foothills. Expectations have been dashed. It was a brave vision and the then Prime Minister was probably right to set out that vision, but we still have a long way to go. What worries me more than anything else about that is that the earliest reductions are the easiest to achieve. The hardest bit is yet to come. The last 10 years will be harder than the first 10 years. I think everybody understands that.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="10010543000031"></a>Against a background of climate change, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer making statements yesterday about how growth will be devoted to fiscal consolidation, it is not surprising that people are worried about where resources will come from. He made a powerful point about the need for extra resources, and I agree with that. He also made an important point about best practice. Actually, we have been too dependent in the past on American practice. We should be looking much more to our sister European countries for some of the ideas that we might need to innovate in the 10 years remaining if we are to be successful.</p>

<a name="100105-0012.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="10010543000032"></a>People are right to be less than enthusiastic about where we are. The Minister probably has the argument on points, but I would not put it any higher than that. The debate has been interesting and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, that it is always massively instructive to listen to colleagues because there is such a range of experience and different points of view. I will respond to some of them from my own perspective.</p>

Nothing will be different after it is passed. I say that as someone who has watched this argument from the Beveridge lecture in 1999. I was one whose jaw dropped when the commitment was made. Since then, there has been a huge amount of activity in terms of developing the policy such as in the 2004 <I>Child Poverty Review</I>, which was a substantial Treasury document. In 2006, we had Lisa Harker with a very important take on what needed to be done. In 2008, we had an interesting and instructive report from the Commons Select Committee, with a plethora

We have had public service agreement targets and the 2002, 2004 and 2007 CSR periods. We had <I>Opportunity </I><I>f</I><I>or All</I>. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was absolutely right: it is a document that I read avidly and it has not really recovered since she gave up the editorship. We have had targets all over the place. Is the Secretary of State expected to resign in 2010 or 2020, whoever he or she may be, if these targets are not met? What is different about putting them on the statute book? That is an important question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="10010543000034"></a>I now turn to the commission because the Child Poverty Commission is not that new either. We have been blessed with lots of experts. The Social Policy Research Unit at York, with Jonathan Bradshaw and his colleagues, and many other institutions-not just the LSE-have done marvellous, world-leading work on analysis of the problem and on offering prescriptions. What will the Child Poverty Commission add to what has been done there and in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, or work done by Donald Hirsch? It is world-class and I do not see how the Child Poverty Commission will find it easy to better that. It is all available free anyway, so what will the Child Poverty Commission bring that has not been available to us in the past?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="10010543000035"></a>One thing that I would like the commission to undertake is firm qualitative research-and no doubt we will discuss that in Committee. I am particularly worried now about some of the persistent levels of poverty in working families in the United Kingdom. I have been subscribing to and agree with the Government's active labour market policies, and I concede that the Government have done a lot. I acknowledge that, but we are now finding that there is persistent poverty in working families. That might be because there is a lot of part-time work in the system now. We need to understand that because if people think that it is safe to get people into jobs and assume that the problem is solved, they are wrong if some of these statistics are right. Maybe there is some work to be done there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="10010543000036"></a>I enjoyed the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Freud. I do not know anything about iron triangles. I did O-grade geometry and there are isosceles, scalene and obtuse triangles. I do not mean obtuse to be a derogatory term because it is a type of triangle with an angle of greater than 90 degrees within it, but I will go away and learn about iron triangles as well as three-legged stools for mothers and fathers and the state. I will go away and think about all those things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="10010543000037"></a>Although the noble Lord, Lord Freud, was trying to establish clear blue water between himself and everybody else, I do not think that he is that far away from us in saying that we have to produce the resources in a holistic way. I agree with him on that. He is worried about family breakdown and I know where he gets that worry from. My good friend Mr Andrew Selous is a very good thing and I am in favour of him. The only thing about which I disagree with him-he was a member of the Select Committee on which I served-is that he has this thing that families need fathers; he thinks that everybody needs to be married before the world will be right. I do not think that that

The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, made the important point that in Scandinavian countries lone-parent families are very successful, so I do not buy the idea that the vows make the difference. I think that you can support and work with family units that are less than two married people.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="10010543000038"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Freud, is to address family breakdown, addiction, worklessness and the lack of educational skills, I am with him, but that needs not only a holistic approach but investment. I notice that neither he nor the Minister mentioned Clause 15, which is the get-out for any Government in the long term, as it makes all this subject to financial capability and that kind of thing. The Committee will want to drill into what that means for both major parties. If it represents a complete block on extra resources, we really are toiling.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="10010543000039"></a>All parties at the coming election will need to find some way of devoting extra resources to this problem, whether through the benefits system or through the more holistic approach that I think the noble Lord, Lord Freud, has brought to the table. He is an innovator. He is the man who won the argument about getting the Treasury DEL and AME rules changed. However, if it is true that you can do that in a welfare/work context, why do we not say to people who live in families that are multiply deprived and in persistent poverty, "If you can prove that for an expenditure of £X,000 you can trade your way out as a family unit, never mind the benefit that you are on"-Professor Gregg has persuaded me that it does not matter what benefit you are on-"and if you can find your way to the table, to the local authority or the Jobcentre Plus personal adviser, and say 'Look, just get me the resources, the grant or the loan that I need to become a nurse or a teacher and I can get my family into a much better place in three or five years', we will say to you, 'Come on down!'"? We should give those people the money. That is the kind of innovation that I hope we will be able to look to in the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="10010543000040"></a>How should we present all this? The British population hates poor people, mainly due to the <I>Daily Mail</I>. That is an exaggeration, but only a slight one. There is a poisonous atmosphere to the debate, which is all about "scroungers" and the rest of it. We should start changing the rules. My noble friend Lady Walmsley made an important point about the cost-benefit analyses in the IFS and Joseph Rowntree Foundation studies. We should demonstrate that by spending money early-by early investment, pre-empting some of the worst effects of the long-term disadvantage that poverty causes-we can save the taxpayer money. We will explore the figures in Committee. I defer to colleagues who know more about the human values and moral virtues of protecting the life chances of individuals who are young and need protection, as they do, but I believe that we should get a bit more realistic about presenting this debate. We should take a much more cost-benefit analysis approach and say, "We can save a lot of money doing it this way". If we did that, we would be much better able to engage public support.</p>

I hope that the Committee will have the chance to look at some of that. There are all sorts of issues in which we can get involved in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="10010543000042"></a>More than anything else, as a political institution that is interested in doing something in this area, we have to understand that, although money is of course going to be difficult to find, we must find ways, if we are to make any progress, of investing sensibly over the next 10 years in domestic households that are at the bottom of the social ladder. I am absolutely up for looking at new ways of doing this. There are problems with some of the Centre for Social Justice suggestions, which seem to ignore the fact that benefits are for households while taxation is about individuals. I do not yet see how those marry properly, but that is perhaps because I do not understand the iron triangle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="10010543000043"></a>I was told by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, in the period between the debate stopping and starting again, the very bad news that the book is 800 pages long. It might take me until next Christmas to read that. We must all expose ourselves to any new ideas that we can find, but we must also rededicate ourselves collectively-across the House, through all parties and the Cross Benches-to finding extra resources if we are going to tackle this problem adequately.</p>

In particular, I welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford to your Lordships' House. I congratulate him on his maiden speech and agree, in particular, with his emphasis on the importance of the family.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="10010543000045"></a>This has been a very interesting debate which has quite properly highlighted the strength of feeling that many have about the importance of reducing child poverty. As my noble friend Lord Freud made clear in his opening remarks, it is a strength of feeling that the Conservative Party wholeheartedly shares. During the Bill's passage through another place, it was sad to see many of the debates degenerate into acrimonious arguments about what did or did not happen more than 15 years ago. Before I go any further, I reiterate the Conservative Party's support for the Minister's desire to reduce the number of children growing up in poverty, and echo my noble friend Lord Sheikh in his general support for the Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="10010543000046"></a>I am sure that your Lordships' House will debate the detailed provisions in its usual constructive manner, and that we will be able to pass a Bill that gives the Government the powers they need to make the necessary changes to people's lives. Unfortunately, the Bill is not yet there. The Bill is flawed, not in what the Minister claims it is setting out to do-we all agree with that-but in how it tries to achieve those aims.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="10010543000047"></a>I am very pleased, as I am sure are all other noble Lords, that the Minister responsible for piloting the Bill through our Chamber is the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for whom we all have the greatest respect. I hope that, since his department is keeping control of the Bill, we will see a greater appreciation of the power  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_93"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of individualised intervention, as opposed to the Treasury's often narrow-minded and ultimately ineffective reliance on financial manipulation. I hope that the Minister will be willing to see the principles on which the Welfare Reform Act was based translated into this Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="10010543000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, rightly emphasised, as did my noble friend Lord Freud, the importance of understanding the causes of poverty and addressing these directly, rather than sweeping them under the carpet and treating only the symptoms with direct financial transfers. As an IFS report commissioned by the Government tells us, it would take £19 billion a year in today's money to achieve a solution through purely financial means. Of course, that was a static analysis; it ignored the spiralling effects of encouraging more and more people to live on benefits.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="10010543000049"></a>Even the Government agree that this is unsustainable, especially when their own finances are in a hole to the tune of £178 billion. If the Government have failed to meet their own 2010 target after a decade of unprecedented growth, the next Government will clearly have to use different and more effective tactics to meet the targets in the Bill during the bust into which Labour's economic policies have driven us. Unfortunately, the Bill does nothing to set out what tactics this Government think should be used. It talks of creating strategies but gives no clue as to what those strategies should be. It would be interesting to hear what the Minister thinks were the flaws in Labour's policies in recent years that have led, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, mentioned, to the 2010 target being missed. What changes does he think should be made in order to do better in the future?</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="10010543000050"></a>The Bill is also silent on many other important details that will be critical to successful implementation. There has been confusion, for example, about the intended role the commission will play. We would support, of course, the establishment of a credible body that focuses on collating and commissioning high quality and relevant research and giving unbiased and constructive advice to the Government. However, there are considerable and understandable fears that instead we will be landed with just another lobby group, this one taxpayer funded, which adds little value to government policies.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="10010543000051"></a>We need to explore as well how the Government envisage local authorities and partner authorities will meet their obligations under the Bill. What difference will this legislation make? Local authorities are, of course, the right place to start; poverty is very much a local problem, caused by local issues and needing locally targeted solutions. However, as my noble friend Lord Sheikh suggested, local authorities already have significant obligations on them to look out for those in their area who need support. We must make sure that these provisions empower local authorities and do not stifle them or bury them under more box-ticking paperwork.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="10010543000052"></a>Our most fundamental disagreement with the Bill is, as my noble friend Lord Freud made clear, that it focuses on the symptoms, not the causes, of poverty. We will seek throughout Committee to ensure that the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_94"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>measures target those experiencing genuine deprivation. As my noble friend Lord Freud said, children as a group do not generally have incomes or wealth, so we are driven to the income and wealth of their families as a proxy. However, it is a deeply unsatisfactory proxy because not all families share out their income as we would like. The Centre for Social Justice estimates that about a million and a half children are growing up in substance-abusing households, either of drugs or alcohol. That is likely to be a very substantial proportion of the children we are concerned about. What good does it do to tackle the problems in these families by increasing benefit payments? Surely that is a strategy designed in these cases to delight the local drug dealers and off-licence stores.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="10010543000053"></a>In order to make a real difference to these children's lives, we must be honest about those factors which lead to poverty. As my noble friend Lord Freud said, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, unemployment-the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford also referred to that-and lack of education, which the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, mentioned, are the big four causes. Although they might not cover every single example of a family struggling to bring up a child in poverty, they are certainly among the reasons for most of them. The Bill must address these causes squarely.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="10010543000054"></a>Nor must the Bill become a tool for whitewashing. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester referred to the vital need to pay the closest attention to those deepest in poverty. We agree that it would be quite wrong for government to focus attention on those families who fall just under the target income levels. Indeed, I am sure that this is not the Minister's intention. However, such a flawed policy would be the most efficient way of meeting these targets and allowing a Government to present the appearance of making headway. We must make sure that the reports on these targets give accurate information about what difference the Government's policies are making to real people, not just to statistics.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="10010543000055"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, the Bill must instead be targeted at those most in need. Children in care or those caring for a disabled parent, to whom the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, referred, are often the most vulnerable and those at risk of suffering serious or persistent poverty. What is there in the Bill to make sure that, in the desire to meet an arbitrary target, those most deserving of government assistance are not ignored in favour of those closer to the 60 per cent mark?</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="10010543000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, for whom I have great respect, asked what would replace targets if a Conservative Government were to abolish them. My noble friend did not say that we would abolish targets; he said that we needed the right targets. He said that we will aim to widen the agenda and build up targets that are more likely to address the underlying causes of poverty. Our debates in Committee will allow us to expand on that. I dare not, as a layman, go into the intricacies of the iron triangle, but I shall say for today that a Conservative Government would certainly seek to reduce poverty among children, but we must address the causes, not the symptoms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="10010543000057"></a>The Government have much to explain in the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson, asked why they are tying future Governments to a target when they have failed to meet their own, but that question has not yet been answered. I look forward to the debates in Committee, where I hope we will be able to extract considerably more detail about these provisions and persuade the Government to improve the Bill.</p>

I acknowledge the honest doubts of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and I hope that along the way we will be able to encourage him to feel warmer about the Bill.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="10010555000002"></a>I congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford on his impressive and wide-ranging maiden speech and I look forward to his future contributions, some of which, I hope, will be on subsequent stages of this Bill. He talked to us about the role of the church in supporting families, and he made the telling point that setting targets of itself does not change things; those targets have to be met. I agree with that. He referred to issues around poverty of aspiration. The Bill is not only about targets; it is about strategies that should seek to ensure that all children do not suffer socio-economic disadvantage. There are fascinating issues around lone parents and how we encourage them into work and the support that we have given them in the Welfare Reform Bill which we debated not long ago.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="10010555000003"></a>It is encouraging to listen to the many interesting contributions to this debate. It is clear that this House, across parties, is passionate about tackling child poverty and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to realise their potential. I look forward to working with noble Lords to ensure safe passage of this measure through your Lordships' House in what we know will be a truncated Session.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="10010555000004"></a>I shall try to deal with as many of the points raised as I can. I shall start with the noble Lord, Lord Freud. I say to him, as he talked about figures since 2004-05, that I do not think he gave proper recognition to the measures that were announced in and since the Budget 2007 which should lift a further 550,000 children out of poverty. I will come on to some of the detail of those measures later. There is also the simulation and the work that IFS did, which predicted that child poverty would fall by more than half a million between 2006-07 and 2010-11 to around 2.3 million; so it is not right to represent that these things are mired and moving in an increased direction. The noble Lord talked about the UNICEF report and suggested that the UK performs badly on child well-being. We accept that the 2007 UNICEF report highlighted some significant challenges for children's well-being in the UK, and we are not complacent. However, much of the data used are old, with some taken around 2003 and some relating to 1999 to 2001.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_96"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="10010555000005"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Freud and Lord De Mauley, suggested that in a sense our approach is all about income transfers. That is not the case. Certainly, income transfers, the working tax credit and child tax credit in particular, have been a key part of the strategy to tackle poverty and child poverty, but the building blocks set out in Clause 8 cover a whole range of key policy matters-some of which, from the noble Lord's analysis, we actually share. It is to do with employment and skills; it is to do with health and education; it is to do with childcare and social services; and it is to do with housing. It is not just about looking at income.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="10010555000006"></a>Regarding the iron triangle, if the noble Lord, Lord Freud, looks at the data, he will see that fewer people experience high rates of withdrawal of benefits than under the predecessor Government. I am not sure if that was the noble Lord's party at the time, but if he looks at the data, that is the case. A lot of effort has gone into making sure that work pays through things such as the national minimum wage and tax credits.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="10010555000007"></a>The commission is not a political appointment and the OCPA rules will apply to it. It is a genuine advisory body and I hope that the noble Lord would welcome that.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="10010555000008"></a>He asked why we use the 60 per cent median income measure. The Government consulted widely on the measure of child poverty during 2002 and 2003, and it was strongly agreed that income was central and that 60 per cent of median threshold is an internationally recognised standard. While other EU countries do not have statutory targets on this measure, all use this indicator as part of the annual monitoring of social inclusion undertaken by each member state.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="10010555000009"></a>The noble Lord and others asked why we focus only on targets around income. The targets explicitly focus on tackling income poverty and material deprivation. This reflects our aim that children should not live in poverty in the UK or suffer the effects of wider socio-economic disadvantage, and of ensuring a focus on income and material deprivation is central to that. Indeed, income poverty is at the heart of the Bill because of the evidence of the impact that it has on children's lives, both in their experiences now and their chances for the future.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="10010555000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, also talked about the accuracy of the poverty statistics and said that these were not a sound basis on which to be judged. The HBAI is an annual statistical series that has been running for two decades. It is a well-established comprehensive data source for estimates of poverty and measuring UK household income distribution. It complies with international best practice in measuring household income.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="10010555000011"></a>A number of noble Lords-the noble Lords, Lord Freud and Lord Northbourne, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford in particular-talked about child poverty and family breakdown, and touched upon marriage. Research shows that the quality of parental relationships and family functioning, rather than its form, has the greatest effect on children. It is just too simplistic to say that family breakdown causes poverty. Research has shown that children are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes following family breakdown. However, the difference between children  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_97"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from intact and non-intact families is small, although statistically significant. Some children can actually benefit when breakdown brings to an end a harmful family situation-for example, when there are high levels of parental conflict, including violence. Evidence suggests that although child poverty is associated with family breakdown, there is no clear causal link. It is the high level of worklessness among lone parents that increases the risk of poverty for children in lone-parent families, rather than the family structure itself.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="10010555000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asked when we would publish the families and relationships Green Paper. We are planning to do that later in the year; I do not have a precise date, and I cannot promise that the paper will be available in draft by the time we reach Committee stage.</p>

<a name="100105-0013.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="10010555000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, also referred to the couple penalty. Tax credits treat couples and lone-parent households equally and are not designed to favour any particular arrangements. Lone-parent households face particular difficulties, as is evidenced by the fact that the risk of a child growing up in poverty is twice as high in a lone-parent family as in a coupled family. Arguments that the tax and benefits system disadvantages couples are too often based on simplistic comparisons that assume that a separated couple will continue to pool their income. At this juncture I shall not dwell on reinstating on some basis the married couple's allowance and on how much that might cost. However, it seems to me that any approach of that nature is most likely to produce less for the poorest in our society compared with the richest.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="10010555000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, and others talked about equality in income distribution. Although income inequality is slightly higher today than it was in 1997-98, movements have been small compared with the sharp increases in inequality in the 1980s. The Institute for Fiscal Studies' analysis showed that tax and benefit reforms since 1997 have clearly been progressive, benefiting the less well-off relative to the better-off. Without those reforms, inequality would have risen a good deal further.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="10010555000015"></a>The noble Lord chided new Labour for being friends of the rich. He may wish to know that living standards for the poorest 20 per cent of households have risen by more than 1.5 per cent a year in real terms since 1997-98, keeping pace with the incomes of the richest 20 per cent of households. In the 1980s and mid-1990s, living standards for the poorest 20 per cent of households rose by less than 1 per cent a year compared with 2.5 per cent for the richest 20 per cent of households. It does not seem to bode well to propose inheritance tax cuts for the very rich. I do not see how that will help child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="10010555000016"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Walmsley, said that a target of 10 per cent would not mean the eradication of child poverty. I suggest that less than 10 per cent is an ambitious but challenging goal for sustaining the eradication of child poverty and will put the UK's child poverty rate firmly among the best in Europe. A relative child poverty level of below 10 per cent would be the lowest in this country since at least 1961 and would more than reverse the doubling of relative child poverty between 1979 and 1998-99. I acknowledge that it is a challenging target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="10010555000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, talked about disability costs and equivalised income. She is right that the current low-income measure does not take into account the extra costs of disability. This is a difficult issue. We recognise that additional costs are associated with disability but research shows that these vary significantly in level and nature. There is no general agreement on how to measure these costs but perhaps we can develop these discussions further in Committee; indeed, I am sure that we will.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="10010555000018"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether local strategies add up to the national target. Local action to tackle child poverty will make a big contribution towards achieving the national targets. Success in tackling child poverty requires the delivery of high-quality services to support parents into employment, increase the take-up of financial support and improve children's life chances. However, the 2020 targets cannot be achieved by local action alone; national Governments must, for example, take responsibility for the tax credit and benefit system.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="10010555000019"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, raised issues concerning looked-after children and asked whether they were missing out on the measurements. The vast majority-something like 84 per cent-of looked-after children and children in care are placed with foster parents, for adoption or with their parents and so reside in private households, which will be captured by the targets in the Bill. Therefore, the majority of looked-after children will be covered.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="10010555000020"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the measure should be after housing costs. There are a number of reasons why the Government have chosen to maintain a before housing costs measure in the Bill, although I noted that the noble Lords, Lord Sheikh and Lord Freud, quoted the after housing costs data. First, income is measured before housing costs to allow comparisons with other European countries that also measure poverty in this way. We have stated our ambition to be among the best in Europe and therefore such comparisons are vital. Secondly, as the noble Baroness predicted I would say, measures of housing quality are currently included in the list of items used for the combined low-income and material deprivation measure. Of course, measuring income after housing costs can understate the relative standard of living that some individuals may have by paying more for better-quality accommodation.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="10010555000021"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about burdens on local partners and whether we would impose a duty on local authorities which would add burdens and bureaucracy to what they already face. Fulfilling that duty need not be an additional burden. Local partnerships should already be taking action to improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged families in their areas. A number of local authorities are already taking significant strategic action to tackle child poverty.</p>

Given what is happening on the clock, perhaps I can pick that up in Committee or write to the noble Baroness about that. There is much support for these plans.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="10010555000024"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, talked about housing. Clearly, it is one of the building blocks on which the strategy has to focus. Since 1997, when there was a £19 billion backlog of repairs to social housing and 2 million homes were below basic decency standards, some £23 billion of public and private money has been invested in improving social housing-that is up to April 2006-and over £40 billion in total will have been invested by the end of 2010, making a significant difference to the decent homes standards.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="10010555000025"></a>The noble Earl also referred to the importance of good quality childcare. Childcare places have more than doubled since 1997. For the first time, local authorities now have a statutory duty under the childcare Act to secure, as far as is reasonably practicable, sufficient childcare for working parents.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="10010555000026"></a>The noble Earl, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, talked about vulnerable children excluded from the targets. The targets can apply only to children for whom we can measure household income. The surveys which will be used to measure progress will be the best instruments available for measuring the household income of children across the UK. Although some children from vulnerable groups are not covered by the surveys, including some disadvantaged groups such as Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children, asylum-seeker children and looked-after children, no children are excluded from the surveys on the basis of status. I stress that the strategies which have to be introduced are for all children in the UK.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="10010555000027"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester spoke about his engagement with children and his understanding of their needs and aspirations. In part, that illustrates why issues of material deprivation and persistent poverty are part of our targets.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="10010555000028"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis, as ever, produced a thought-provoking contribution, running through the targets which we have proposed and how they might apply. When incomes generally remain static or maybe decline, of course, having an absolute poverty target must mean that, if it were met, the income of the poorest would nevertheless have to increase. That is why we have the absolute poverty target.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="10010555000029"></a>On the point that one way of tackling poverty is to seek to ensure that benefits are uprated by more than inflation and by more than earnings, I shall run through some of the measures that have occurred in recent years. In April 2008, we increased the child element of the child tax credit by £175 a year. In October 2008, the child maintenance disregard in out-of-work benefits increased from £10 a week to £20 a week and there was a full disregard in child maintenance for housing benefit and council tax benefit at that time as well. We increased the eldest child benefit rate by £20 a week and, in April 2009, we increased the child element of the child tax credit by £75 above indexation. So in a way we are addressing some of the points that she raised.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_100"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="10010555000030"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that early intervention is important, and I agree. She referred to the fact that there is a risk under the targets that we focus on those who are nearest to the border-line. That is why we have more than one target and each target must be met; it is not a question of picking the target that you want. She raised the point, as did the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, about Clause 15. Let me be clear that the duty to meet the target in the Bill is absolute. The only way to get out of the duty is by returning to Parliament to repeal the legislation. Clause 15 is about how we meet the targets, not whether we meet them. The clause in no way mitigates a failure to meet the targets; it simply means that the Government are required to consider the most cost-effective way to reach them in order to protect the taxpayer's pocket and the wider economy.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="10010555000031"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to funding for the banks. Perhaps we should not get into that debate at this hour. She talked about the independence of the poverty commission. I should stress that it is an advisory committee. Of course, it must publish its advice, and it must be consulted. Those are requirements under the Bill, so it will be plain for all-Parliament and the public-to see what advice the commission has given. As I mentioned earlier, the OCPA process will be the basis on which appointments are made. I, too, very much hope that we can get a cross-party consensus on this measure. That is important. In my opening remarks, I dealt with issues about consultation with children. Perhaps I may write to the noble Baroness about the definition of "child" and why it differs from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is to do with how the surveys are constructed.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="10010555000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said that he had doubts about the Bill because he thought that it ignored the role of parents. With great respect, I do not believe that that is the case. The Government are committed. We have not lost faith in parents, as the noble Lord suggested. During 2006-08, the Government provided local authorities with a parenting strategy support grant. That provided funding to enable local authorities to develop and implement a strategic approach to parenting support and to build on strategic approaches already in place. The Government recommend that local authorities appoint a parenting commissioner to oversee and develop that strategic approach. We have also published guidance for local authorities on developing a parenting strategy.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="10010555000033"></a>I think that I have dealt with the issue of the Green Paper. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asked why we should focus on child poverty rather than family poverty. The Bill is about helping children in poverty, stemming from the Government's pledge in 1999, as we heard from my noble friend Lord Giddens, but supporting parents and families as well as children and young people is a central part of tackling child poverty. An effective child poverty strategy must support families by improving the employment opportunities of their parents, providing access to good quality and affordable childcare for their parents, and so forth.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="10010555000034"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford talked about minimum income standards. We are committed to ensuring that the tax and benefit system  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provides adequate financial support, and families in the poorest fifth of the population are about £5,000 a year better off as a result of personal tax and benefit changes. However, in providing extra money to these groups, we need to be careful not to reduce their incentives to work. Many of the most disadvantaged people are able to work, given appropriate support, and work remains the most sustainable route out of poverty. Guaranteeing that out-of-work benefits lift families out of poverty would be a resource-intensive and unsustainable approach to tackling child poverty. It would require substantial spending to achieve and could entrench the intergenerational cycles of worklessness that are one of the underlying causes of child poverty.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="10010555000035"></a>Time is moving on. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford talked about rural poverty not being included in the strategy. Rural poverty is an important issue, as families in rural areas may face additional burdens as a result of their location or because of lack of good transport links, especially difficulties in accessing employment opportunities or services such as health, education and leisure facilities, but those are part of the building blocks that must be addressed in strategies, both local and national.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="10010555000036"></a>My noble friend Lady Massey again raised kinship carers. I know she is committed to this cause and I pay tribute to her. The evidence points to care by family and friends being the best approach for many children who cannot be looked after by their birth parents. We want to recognise fully the additional support needs of this group as well as the contribution that family and friend carers make to the life chances of vulnerable children. My noble friend will be aware that we held a cross-government grandparents summit to listen to the experiences of grandparents. This will feed into the families and relationships Green Paper, which is due for publication later this year, in which the role of grandparents and the wider family will be a key theme.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="10010555000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson, made an extremely interesting contribution and challenged me for anything like a detailed reply. I should make clear that the Bill is focused on poverty in the UK, but what she said was very thought-provoking. I shall take this matter away, write further and perhaps set up a meeting with her to see how, and the extent to which, the points she raised have already been addressed or might be addressed. However, it is outwith the scope of the Bill as drafted.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="10010555000038"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, vividly described the downward spiral of deprivation that parts of her community have suffered. I am pleased that she welcomed the role of the devolved Administrations provided for in the Bill. In particular, she referred to difficulties on measurements of persistent poverty. So far as Northern Ireland is concerned, they particularly arise because of the problems of getting an appropriate sample size. We are looking at the <I>Understanding Society</I> publication, which is a more detailed study.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="10010555000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, talked about abject failure. I simply refer him to his Government's experience on child poverty. He talked about a multifaceted approach, and I agree. He talked about the need to help people reach employment and the impact of unemployment on poverty. Again, I agree, but I point out to him that  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_102"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when the Government put £5 million funding into Jobcentre Plus for things such as the Future Jobs Fund, his party opposed it. He talked about a broken society. That is his term; it is not one that I would use. The data about ethnic minorities and child poverty are correct. We need to make sure that the strategies that are developed focus on those issues.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="10010555000040"></a>My noble friend Lord Giddens again challenged me with a thought-provoking contribution. He talked about the need for a more comparative analysis with other countries. We have learnt a lot from our experiences over the past 10 years, and the target has always been incredibly challenging. Experience has shown how ambitious the interim and long-term goals are. We understand the importance of assessing the contribution that a wide range of public services can make in tackling child poverty, but we also need to make sure that we understand what progress other countries have made and that that analysis is properly fed into the strategies that are being developed. My noble friend asked where the earth-moving equipment is. I think the IFS suggested that £4.2 billion would get us to the interim target for child poverty by 2010, but that amounted to something like increasing the child element of the child tax credit by about 30 per cent on top of the uprating already planned, and that is not something that we see as currently affordable. He asked whether I agree that we need more radical policy innovation. That depends upon what "radical" means. I have seen plenty of documents with "radical" stuck in the front to imbue the strategy with some aura. If "radical" is relevant and can be delivered and make a difference, then I agree.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="10010555000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, talked about expectations being dashed. I accept that there is a long way to go, which is what this Bill is all about. I was asked what difference the Bill will make. It will make a difference because a clear duty will be put on the Government and local government to meet targets and to produce strategies. There will be reporting obligations and obligations will be imposed on local authorities. As to what the Child Poverty Commission will bring, I believe that it will bring expertise from people who are knowledgeable in this field and can advise the Government in a way which can make a real difference.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="10010555000042"></a>Finally, I acknowledge what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, termed as general support for the Bill in tackling child poverty. I am still unclear as to what type of targets he would wish to substitute for those in the Bill, those which he would seek to remove and those which his party would not see itself to be bound by. But perhaps that will emerge from the debates in Committee. I do not think that there is confusion on the role of the commission. If there is, Committee will be the chance to understand and to iron out that confusion.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="10010555000043"></a>Our vision is of a fairer society in which no child is left behind and has their future life chances damaged by living in poverty. Still too many families are on the edge of coping and we should not accept that there are children and families who lack the basic needs enjoyed by so many in this country. The Government are working to tackle injustice and inequality, and to create a country where every child can grow up enjoying  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their childhood and be full of ambitious expectations for their future; where everyone, whatever their background, has the opportunity to lead a healthy prosperous life; and where cohesive communities prosper in safe and secure environments. Child poverty stands in the way of these goals, which is why we are determined to deliver change and to defeat it. That is the purpose of the Bill and I commend it to the House.</p>

I look forward with great anticipation to the contributions that will be made by noble Lords in all parts of the House who not only have so much detailed knowledge of sport and the Olympics but are also making such huge individual contributions in planning for London 2012 and in securing the legacy afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="10010555000046"></a>I am pleased to be able to tell the House that London 2012 continues to be on time and on budget. With well over 40 per cent of the construction programme now complete, the Olympic Delivery Authority has made outstanding progress in creating the Olympic park and venues for 2012, and already it is possible to see how dramatically the landscape of east London is being transformed. The external structure of the Olympic stadium is now complete, with work progressing on schedule. The impressive aquatics centre roof is also in place, along with the huge land bridge that forms part of the roof of the venue and which will provide the main pedestrian entrance to the Games.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="10010555000047"></a>The construction of the distinctive velodrome is proceeding well, while the 4,500 tonne steel outer structure of the international broadcast centre was

I had the good fortune to be taken around the site by John Armitt and his colleagues on 22 September 2009. The progress that had been made up to then was very impressive, and a great deal more has been achieved since.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="10010555000048"></a>It is not only what the ODA is achieving but how it is doing it that is particularly inspiring. The London 2012 big build is breaking new ground for sustainability. It will be the first major event of any sort to undertake a full analysis of its carbon footprint, with the aim of minimising emissions. The measures that have been put into place will reduce by 400,000 tonnes the amount of CO2 that is produced and will make the Games a model for future mega-events worldwide.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="10010555000049"></a>The Games will provide a unique opportunity to promote healthy living. As an example, tobacco and cigarettes will not be sold at any of the Olympic venues. Smoking will be prohibited in all the enclosed Olympic and Paralympic venues, and LOCOG is currently looking at how it can best provide a healthy and enjoyable environment for all visitors to the Games.</p>

<a name="100105-0014.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="10010555000050"></a>The construction of the Olympic park and venues are not only helping to provide the basis for the regeneration of east London, but have helped to create opportunities for businesses across the UK in a time of economic adversity. Contracts worth £6 billion will be directly procured by the ODA and by LOCOG, generating tens of thousands of supply-chain opportunities for UK businesses. Of the 1,000 companies that have already won more than £5 billion of work to supply the ODA, more than 98 per cent are UK-based, 46 per cent are outside London, and around two-thirds are small or medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="10010555000051"></a>At the end of last year, the Olympic Delivery Authority produced a nationwide snapshot of some of the British businesses that have won 2012 contracts to date. It shows that building the venues and infrastructure for the Games is truly a nationwide endeavour, whether it is a basketball arena from Glasgow or structural decking from Poole, wetland planting from Norfolk or steel reinforcements from Neath. So far, thousands of companies across the UK have taken advantage of the London 2012 CompeteFor service, which not only provides businesses with the information they need to bid for 2012-related contracts but offers them dedicated business support that can help them to win.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="10010555000052"></a>The Games are not just benefiting businesses; they are also making a direct investment in people. First, London 2012 is creating jobs. Since the start of 2009, the number of workers on the Olympic park and village sites has more than doubled to nearly 7,500. More than half the current Olympic park workforce are from London, and one in five are from the Olympic host boroughs. Secondly, the Games are helping to change the face of the construction workforce. Programmes such as Personal Best are drawing in the hard to reach or previously unemployed, while the Women into Construction project has helped to bring the numbers of women working on site to more than double the national average. Thirdly, London 2012 is helping people to acquire the skills and expertise that they need to stay in work. A total of 2,250 traineeships,  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_105"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apprenticeships and work placements will be available on the site over the course of the build, while three dedicated east London training centres will offer as many as 20,000 places over the next five years. With courses designed to furnish the workforce with the skills that will be in demand in the years ahead, it is an opportunity to ensure that our training systems anticipate the needs of future employers. London 2012 therefore represents an investment in skills that will help the construction industry to deliver other major infrastructure projects of national significance such as the £16 billion Crossrail scheme, which is the largest civil construction project in Europe and one that is set to enhance London's rail capacity by 10 per cent when it opens in 2017.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="10010555000053"></a>The development of the Olympic park is not only providing opportunities now but will provide the basis for a sustainable and prosperous community after the Games have come and gone. Indeed, 75p of every £1 that the Olympic Development Authority spends on the Olympic park goes towards the regeneration of an area that includes four of the 10 most deprived boroughs in the UK. London 2012 is aiming to achieve 30 years of development in less than five years.</p>

The park will deliver five world class sporting facilities, over 15,000 new homes, more than 150,000 square metres of high quality employment space and 10,000 new jobs, all surrounding over 100 hectares of new parkland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="10010555000055"></a>And the benefits will not be confined to London. There is a clear cross-government commitment to delivering a legacy for the whole of the UK, not least by boosting sports participation and getting more people active and healthy. We are using the opportunity of London 2012 to help transform the levels of young people participating in sport, with the goal of making five hours of school sport available each week to the under-16s. Already, the opportunity for five to 16 year-olds to participate in up to five hours of sport per week is in place in over 90 per cent of school sports partnerships, with over 90 per cent of children meeting the initial two-hour target. Overall, London 2012 has the goal of making 2 million adults more active, and that will have a lasting impact long after the Games are held. There have been successes already through initiatives such as the free swimming programme which resulted in over 10 million more swimming sessions in its first six months-6.9 million by the under-16s.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="10010555000056"></a>At the same time, the Cultural Olympiad is also playing a major role in helping to use London 2012 to, in its own words, "inspire a generation". Launched in September 2008 with an Open Weekend celebration involving around 650 events across the UK, the Cultural Olympiad is a four-year, UK-wide cultural festival aimed at inspiring young people, welcoming the world, and leaving a lasting cultural legacy. And this commitment to "inspire a generation" is not limited to the UK. The International Inspiration programme has now been launched in nine countries worldwide, offering millions

The goal is to extend the programme to up to 20 countries by 2012.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="10010555000057"></a>We can therefore see that London 2012 is already creating a legacy, both here and abroad, of better businesses and better jobs, more active citizens and more attractive neighbourhoods. But of course the first challenge is to deliver an Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 that inspire the world. The London organising committee-LOCOG, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Coe, whose speech I look forward to particularly-is leading on the delivery of the Games and is making first-rate progress. In an exceptionally tough economic environment, LOCOG has to date secured 25 domestic sponsors and generated nearly £600 million-worth of sponsorship revenue, about two-thirds of its target of £700 million. In this sense, LOCOG is ahead of any previous organising committee in securing sponsorship for the Games.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="10010555000058"></a>Beyond its strong revenue-raising efforts, LOCOG's practical preparations for the Games are also progressing extremely well. It has secured the services of Sir Ian Johnston, the former Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, to lead on security planning. Sir Ian's appointment is an important step in ensuring that we create a safe and secure environment for the Games to be staged. His expertise and vast policing experience, with which I am very familiar and to which I have often paid tribute in debates in your Lordships' House on the role of the British Transport Police, will be invaluable to LOCOG in preparing the stage for the Games in 2012 and will ensure that the organising committee works seamlessly with the Metropolitan Police Service, the BTP and other police forces across the UK.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="10010555000059"></a>The International Olympic Committee remains impressed with LOCOG's preparations after its recent co-ordination commission visit. Add to that the fact that the build programme continues to be on or ahead of schedule and that our legacy plans are more advanced than those of any other Olympic hosts at this stage, and it is clear that the UK is all set to stage a highly successful Games in 2012.</p>

Nevertheless, I shall be as swift as possible. I declare an interest as chairman of the British Olympic Association, a director of LOCOG and a member of the Olympic Board.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="1001061000002"></a>A few years ago when Kate Hoey, a Member of Parliament and the Mayor's Commissioner for Sport, and I co-chaired the independent sports review, we prefaced our 2005 report with the following observation:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="1001061000083"></a>"The success in Singapore has raised the bar. The United Kingdom now has less than seven years to develop a world-class sports policy which will form the basis of London 2012's ultimate legacy-a fitter, healthier, more active nation".</p>

<p><a name="1001061000080"></a>Today's debate provides an opportunity to monitor progress and I intend to concentrate my few remarks on the key building blocks of an Olympic sports legacy.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_107"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="1001061000003"></a>A new policy framework is required-a policy framework to deliver a comprehensive, nationwide network of sporting opportunity. Through this network every man, woman and child must be able to play their chosen sport at their chosen level, and every child should have their sporting talent identified and the opportunity to develop it to its full potential. That requires a nationwide system with clearly accountable delivery mechanisms.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="1001061000004"></a>Reacting to increased concern from the sporting community, the Government set up a sporting legacy board, on which I sit. Sadly, since Singapore 2005, it has had only two brief meetings. The Government have also established a further three boards and steering groups to look at aspects of sporting legacy, which brings to 11 the number of government boards designed to develop different aspects of the 2012 legacy. Inevitably, this level of bureaucracy leads to ineffectiveness. In this context, the Government announced in the pre-Budget Report that they would rationalise up to a third of the DCMS's arm's-length bodies. That is commendable, but can the Minister inform the House which sports bodies are to be streamlined under this policy, particularly those relevant to the London 2012 Games?</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="1001061000005"></a>Given the vital importance of the Minister for Sport working closely with Ministers from health, the Home Office and education, the proposal to create a new Cabinet Office cross-departmental division to co-ordinate initiatives provides a focal point for sport and recreation in government and is commendable. When Kate Hoey and I considered the sporting landscape during the months soon after the historic decision to award the games to London, we concluded that today's patchwork-quilt policy based on luck and isolated islands of good practice needs to be replaced with a comprehensive system constructed on universal opportunity. Sporting success, as I am sure we will all agree, is systematic and should not, as at present, be left to chance.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="1001061000006"></a>In 2005, Tessa Jowell, as the then Secretary of State at the DCMS, rightly described the public sector structure over which she and Richard Caborn presided as "a nightmare". While a great deal has been achieved by UK Sport to streamline the high-performance delivery mechanisms to our governing bodies, I still believe there is merit in housing the two separate quangos-one covering Olympic sporting excellence in UK Sport; the other mass participation in Sport England-together into one in order to share overheads, further streamline delivery to our governing bodies and, above all, deliver a pathway from participation to excellence. We must ensure that central to the Olympic sports legacy is having a world-class performance system in place that is robust, inspirational, resourced and sustainable; a system which covers the pathway from children, through juniors, through seniors to podium success; a system based on the requirements of volunteers, clubs, governing bodies, coaches and, above all, the athletes.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="1001061000007"></a>My second point is that a further key pillar of an Olympic sports legacy is sports infrastructure spend across the United Kingdom. The report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, was the most important on sport commissioned by the Government. We have an ageing stock of sports facilities. Many were built during the  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_108"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>1970s' boom in capital investment and are now reaching the end of their economic lives. A Sport England report estimated that it would cost £550 million to bring sports centres owned by local authorities in England alone up to a safe and acceptable standard. The capital cost of maintaining the stock thereafter was estimated at between £144 million and £151 million per annum.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="1001061000008"></a>While that analysis concentrated on local authority leisure facilities, the Football Association has calculated that it will cost some £2 billion to bring the stock of local authority playing fields, changing rooms, hot water and showers and pitch drainage up to a reasonable standard. The most important part of an Olympic sports legacy must be a new national sports infrastructure fund to renew the stock of local facilities across the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="1001061000009"></a>What is also a key aspect of this contribution to an Olympic sports legacy is the requirement for government to introduce a much-needed statutory requirement to ensure that there is adequate provision of sports facilities for sport and recreation in England and Wales. In Scotland, where such legislation exists, per capita funding for sport during the last decade was £46; in England, where local authorities are under no such obligation and are struggling to meet there statutory requirements, it is no surprise that the per capita spend was £19. Sports infrastructure spend is critical to an Olympic sports legacy. That is the catalyst to provide a sea change in opportunity for young people, inspired by the Games. This is even more important as we enter a new decade with nearly 1 million children who do not receive the basic two hours of sport and PE each week. The prospect of an afternoon of sport every week-say, a Wednesday afternoon-linked to governing bodies, clubs and local authority programmes, should be introduced throughout the United Kingdom and act as the catalyst for inter-school competitions and club membership throughout the country. This would be a substantial building block in the delivery of an Olympic sports legacy.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="1001061000010"></a>For my part, I shall pursue the proposals outlined in a government report written by my noble friend Lord Coe and myself some 23 years ago, in which we said that we looked for greater uniformity of purpose and approach internationally in the fight against drug abuse. As a result, I shall introduce a Bill into your Lordships' House shortly. I should add, as a response to the comments made to the British Athletes Commission spokesman yesterday, that absolutely no proposal exists to allow the police to undertake random searches in the Olympic village or elsewhere. Under the legislation that I am drafting, the police would have to have reasonable grounds for believing that an offence had been committed under the proposed Act and obtain a warrant issued by a court before any search could be undertaken. In this context, random police searches would be wholly unacceptable to me.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="1001061000011"></a>Finally, with just over 1,000 days to go and reinforcing the non-political approach that should always characterise sport, I led the British Olympic Association in strong support of Gordon Brown's sports manifesto when the then Chancellor announced at Marlborough House in London on 25 October 2006 the following measures: to  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_109"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>offer children four hours of school sport a week by 2010; to lead the world in 2012 as one of the fittest and most sporting of nations; to offer afterschool sports and links to a wide range of local sports clubs; to have every school in the country playing competitively in local leagues; to increase sports volunteering in schools and communities by 1 million; to provide every potential young sports star with extra support to help them to train and develop; and to ensure that every school should have access to playing fields and better sports facilities.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="1001061000012"></a>Sadly, I cannot report to your Lordships' House that any of these measures have been delivered. We could start with a national volunteering strategy, which is absolutely central to an Olympic sports legacy. The hard work will start now-otherwise, the Olympic sports legacy from the Games will be housed solely, necessarily and exclusively inside the Olympic park and its satellite venues, which are being so admirably delivered by my noble friend Lord Coe, John Armitt, the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, and the first-rate private-sector-led teams. Now is the time to build on a coherent, well designed, fully financed and implemented nationwide Olympic sports legacy programme, with all 2012 stakeholders working together to support and contribute to its success.</p>

I declare an interest as the chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games-or LOCOG, as we have become known-and as a member of the Olympic board.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="1001061000014"></a>Two thousand and twenty will see the pace and intensity of our preparations increase as people across the UK become involved in the Games, their delivery, inspiration and participation. In just 133 weeks we will stage 26 simultaneous world championships during those Games, before working day and night for a fortnight to reconfigure venues and transform London into a Paralympic city, and then to do pretty much the same with 20 Paralympic world championships. The scale and complexity of this project is unique, and I am pleased to report that our progress and momentum are strong.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="1001061000015"></a>As I have noted before, LOCOG raises its staging budget almost entirely from the private sector, save for a small contribution to assist Paralympic transition. Despite the economic climate, we have raised, as the Minister remarked, nearly £600 million of our £700 million target for domestic sponsorship. We now enjoy partnerships with 25 world-class companies, with more to come. This has enabled the recruitment of a world-class team, as the organisation's workforce looks to grow from 70 in 2005, when I first reported to your Lordships' House, to over 2,000 at Games time. We have also spent time carefully developing our operational plans in over 50 venues across London and the UK. Next month we look forward to adding knowledge and understanding at the Winter Games in Vancouver. I take this opportunity to wish my noble friend

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="1001061000016"></a>The story of London 2012 will be the story of people touched, inspired and delivering the Games. Already we have made an impact. Over 35 Olympic and Paralympic teams have agreed to hold pre-Games training camps in Britain, including Usain Bolt's Jamaica in Birmingham and the Australian Paralympic team in Cardiff and Newport. Over 800 activities, sporting and cultural, formed our open weekend in July. Our Inspire mark, the first from a host city for non-commercial activities, has been awarded to over 260 projects, 60 of them in sport, and 14,000 schools in the UK, nearly half the total, now use London's 2012 Get Set education programmes.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="1001061000017"></a>I have little doubt that these programmes explain why over 80 per cent of the British public now say that we will stage a successful Games in 2012-but we cannot take our foot off the pedal. We know that the economic climate remains tough. Despite that, LOCOG's commercial team has punched through the downturn, allowing us to move with clarity, certainty and, crucially, independence through the exacting phases of this project.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="1001061000018"></a>Bringing our sponsors to the table early-earlier than previous host cities-has also helped us to harness the creativity and market penetration of these companies in activating their sponsorships, which in turn helps us to meet the legacy commitments that we made in Singapore: the Lloyds Banking Group with the national school sport week, Local Heroes, the construction of adiZones for partnerships in the inner city, EDF with its sustainability campaigns, BP with its work within the Cultural Olympiad, British Telecom for its commitment to the Paralympics, and British Airways with its Great Britons campaign. I could go on.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="1001061000019"></a>Security, of course, remains central. We continue planning for our in-venue responsibilities while working in partnership with the Home Office, the Metropolitan Police and other agencies that lead on London and the UK's wider security at the Games, as the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, commented. Sir Ian Johnston has recently been appointed as director of security at LOCOG. He brings a wealth of experience to that post, and is known to many in your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="1001061000020"></a>Over the coming year we will be busy as we lock down our venue plans, submit 117 planning applications and finalise sports competition schedules, test events and our ticketing strategy. We will go to the market with £700 million-worth of business. We will drive the Cultural Olympiad and the International Inspiration programmes. We will start recruiting up to 70,000 volunteers and introduce a new face to the Games-the mascot.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="1001061000021"></a>I recognise that, at best, this can be only a quick romp across the landscape, but I hope that I have demonstrated both delivery and commitment. While recognising the leading role of legacy played by London and national Governments and the Olympic Park Legacy Company chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, let me restate LOCOG's endeavours as a legacy enabler with key support from our commercial partners.</p>

<a name="1001061000023"></a><b><a name="100105-0015.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1001061000097"></a>Baroness Morgan of Huyton:</b> My Lords, I, too, welcome the debate tonight. The new year feels a particularly appropriate time to look ahead with optimism towards the Olympic Games and the Olympic legacy. I declare an interest as a member of the Olympic Delivery Authority board.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="1001061000024"></a>My first reason for optimism is the broadly strong working relationships that exist around 2012. In previous Games, one would rarely have seen such strong working relationships between the development authorities, Games organisers and legacy authorities. Linked to that is strong, cross-party commitment, strong partnerships with business and local government and high and sustained public support.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="1001061000025"></a>My second reason for optimism is that engineering, design, manufacturing and construction in Britain have been and are stepping up to the mark and have a great opportunity to showcase to the world, and we are delivering on time and on budget. I am not normally in the habit of quoting from the <I>Daily Mail</I>, which has not necessarily been my favourite publication over the past decade or so, but I was struck by something Max Hastings said at the turn of the year. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="1001061000084"></a>"We must use the opportunity to showcase Britain, to justify the vast expenditure of public money by demonstrating that this country can do something really big really well".</p>

<p><a name="1001061000081"></a>Today, notwithstanding the huge challenges that lie ahead, I want to draw attention to the fact that we are indeed doing very well. I know that others will speak about the Games and the sporting legacy, the regeneration legacy and the importance of the Games to London, so I will focus on the construction project.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="1001061000026"></a>The ODA inherited a complex site criss-crossed with rail, water and electricity pylons-one that had suffered from generational neglect. We are responsible for delivering a construction programme twice the size of Terminal 5 in half the time; arguably the biggest construction project programme in Europe. It is fair to say that there was widespread cynicism about our ability within the UK to deliver that. So far, I am pleased to say, that has proved unfounded. Indeed, the challenges of the project-its size and timescale-have galvanised UK industry into seeking innovative and ambitious solutions.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="1001061000027"></a>Some of the less publicised areas of the work are worthy of attention. I want to talk briefly about three. The first major project was power lines-not the most exciting but absolutely essential. The site had 52 huge overhead pylons and 130 kilometres of overhead wire. In order to unlock the landscape, we had to construct two, six kilometre tunnels underneath the entire site enabling all the power for the Games and the legacy developments to be carried underneath. In all, 1,300 tonnes of steel were removed and recycled and an electricity substation is now completed and operational. The handling of material created by demolition was a huge challenge too, but 97 per cent has been reclaimed  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_112"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and reused. A huge operation has taken place to clean and reuse thousands of tonnes of soil, which otherwise would have had to be transported offsite. The so-called soil hospital is well worth a visit. It is somewhat surreal. Huge washing machines shake and clean the soil free of contamination including the tar, petrol and oil of many years and produce clean material that is being used in the creation of correct land levels, foundations and parklands.</p>

<a name="100105-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="1001061000028"></a>The second area that I find very interesting is logistics. Usually, understandably, attention focuses on the big venues, but underpinning all the work that happens every day on the site is a colossal logistical operation-a warlike operation. Tonnes of material have to be delivered every single day and 9,000 workers have to get in and out of the site, so the logistics centre co-ordinates the arrival of four delivery vehicles a minute at the construction site, which is now reaching its busiest phase, which will reach a vehicle every 12 seconds at its peak. The ODA's road logistics centres on the M11 and in Barking manage deliveries to the Olympic Park. They take vehicles from the north and west through one centre and through the south and south-east to the other centre. Deliveries go to the centre to be screened for security purposes and are then recorded on to the tracking module. They are taken on to the site at regular intervals so that no time is wasted.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100105-0016.htm"/>


<a name="100105-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="1001061000029"></a>Access to the site is difficult, as many of your Lordships know, as it is blocked by waterways, dual carriageways and railways. However, those barriers of rail and water have now been turned to advantage, allowing the more efficient delivery of materials and helping to achieve sustainability targets. The target of using water-in other words, barges-and rail to shift half of all materials has been exceeded. Over the construction period, 4 million tonnes of goods will be moved by rail, saving 120,000 tonnes of carbon and reducing congestion on the roads around London.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="1001061000030"></a>My final example is the aquatic centre-perhaps the iconic symbol of the Games. This is the site on which a lot of media and public attention will focus. Everyone knows about the design and the architect, but I think that people are less aware of the detail of the massive construction and the challenges that have had to be faced in order to deliver that design. The 3,000 tonne steel roof was fabricated off site and assembled on to temporary supports. Then the so-called big lift began. It is fair to say that you could feel, even measure, the tension in the air as the structure was moved literally inch by inch on to its three permanent supports. The steel trusses were fabricated in Newport and the plate was produced in Gateshead, Motherwell and Scunthorpe-it has been a great UK-wide project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="1001061000031"></a>As an ODA board member, I am rather proud of the innovation that has been achieved so far in design, in health and safety, in planning and in the pioneering work in sustainable construction. I am also proud of the effect on employment, about which my noble friend the Minister has spoken. I hope that there will be a wider and longer-term effect in raising the levels of interest among those still at school not just in sport but in the great opportunities that will be open to them in engineering, construction, planning and the development of Britain in the coming decades.</p>

There is a genuine wish that London should be willing and able to demonstrate our ability to welcome and interact with the teams and visitors from more than 200 countries through the confident use of many languages, not just English. We have much of the raw material at our fingertips in a richly multilingual capital city, as more than 300 languages are used by Londoners. Sadly, however, some of the people with exactly the language skills that we need to harness do not necessarily yet feel that their skills are being recognised or used.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="1001061000034"></a>In addition, as I flagged up in the previous debate on this subject in June last year, I believe that there is still a great deal that could be done to link the language needs of the Games to what is happening with the teaching of languages in schools. The pay-off would be not just a greater engagement with the Games in 2012 but a hugely important aspect of the long-term legacy of the Games in helping to equip more young people with a critical skill to enhance their future employability.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="1001061000035"></a>My understanding is that around 150 professional interpreters are to be recruited. I should be interested to know more about the competitive tender specifications list and the timetable. In particular, I hope that LOCOG will ensure that the language talent already in London will be used. I suggest that it consults the Institute of Linguists in order to access the network of people who hold the diploma in public service interpreting. This diploma is for those who work in hospitals, with the police or in the courts. With about 1,000 people a year taking the diploma, demand has never been higher. Around 50 different languages, combined with English, were on offer in 2009. There will also be 1,500 language volunteers and I am keen to know more about how they will be identified and managed.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="1001061000036"></a>The Capital L group has been working with Sports Leaders UK to get schools and FE colleges to understand the importance of languages and the opportunities that the Olympics will offer. Capital L has also been working with the organisation Podium Skills on workshops for students, but I understand that the funding for this ends in March this year and I wonder whether there any plans to fill the gap that this will leave.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="1001061000037"></a>I mention especially the work of the Welcoming the World programme, run by Regional Language Network London. This is the programme designed to help prepare businesses for the Games. This could range from help with translating signage and brochures to training staff in basic language skills and intercultural awareness. We know that companies, both large and  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_114"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>small, that can do business in more than one language are more successful than those that remain stubbornly monoglot. It is not just a question of commercial success, but of delivering outstanding customer service to international visitors and the benefits to reputation that that will bring in the longer term. Again, making sure that we can deliver on language competence puts a big tick in the legacy box.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="1001061000038"></a>So far, more than 60 companies have sent staff to Welcoming the World training sessions. These include international hotel chains, tourist attractions, museums and galleries, food and clothes stores, restaurants and transport companies. Until now, the initiative has been supported financially by the London Development Agency, but this funding will cease in April this year, at which point the Welcoming the World resources will be available only on a commercial, paid-for basis. To ensure continued take-up and the resulting benefits for London's businesses and the London Games, companies will need to be loudly and enthusiastically encouraged by LOCOG and others to realise that the language and cultural skills on offer are an essential part of what they need to succeed.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="1001061000039"></a>To me-and, I am sure, to many other noble Lords-this might seem an obvious message but, unfortunately, the people running Welcoming the World are finding it frustratingly difficult to convince others in a position to support their work to do so, or to benefit from their services. For example, their offer to adapt the programme for training volunteers has been declined and funding applications to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Higher Education Funding Council have not been successful, apparently because there is not a close enough fit with their criteria and priorities.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="1001061000040"></a>It is a depressing uphill struggle to get these language issues on the map and recognised as a core part of the overall preparations for 2012. There needs to be a pretty quick step change in official recognition by the Games' organisers. I hope that, by highlighting this work in your Lordships' House today, I can do something to trigger a turnaround in attitude. Language skills should not just be an afterthought or something that will be taken care of by volunteers on the day. There is professional specialist preparation to be done.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="1001061000041"></a>For the Barcelona Games in 1992, the organising committee set up a language service department four and a half years before the start of the event. The official report for the 1992 Games highlighted that this foresight was shown to be more than justified. In Sydney in 2000, there was more financial support for language services, training and volunteers than in any previous Games. London 2010 presents the UK with an unprecedented opportunity to shed its monolingual image and project the vibrant multiculturalism that contributed to our success in winning the Games in the first place. I appeal to all noble Lords with an influence in the preparations for 2012, whether in government, LOCOG, the Olympic Park Legacy Company or elsewhere, to speak up about languages and make sure that this opportunity is not wasted.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_115"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this evening. We have heard two wonderful phrases which are like manna from heaven: "on schedule" and "within budget". Good, and good again. There are, however, a number of issues that have been discussed in your Lordships' House, none of which has been addressed in the detailed responses that we have heard. I will ask a series of seven or eight questions, which will provide the means of updating the House on the points of concern that have been expressed.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="1001061000043"></a>I start with Hackney Marshes. When we first heard of the development plans for the 2012 Olympics, we were told about the media centre which was going to be placed on Hackney Marshes. It was going to cost £14 million and was to be sold as a going concern afterwards to recover the cash. We very swiftly found that it was going to cost £42 million, not £14 million, three times the original cost. We have had no update since then about whether it is to be sold as a going concern. Can we please be informed whether it is there as a permanent entity? Will the nation own it, or will it be sold as a commercial venture? Is the money coming back for it? Can we have an update on what happened there, please?</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="1001061000044"></a>Relating to the same site, we believe that the media centre was going to be built on what was known as the arena centre for the 120 football pitches, and the leagues which play there, on Hackney Marshes. We were told that arrangements would be made for the relocation of the arena centre, which is a very aspirational target for the young people of Hackney who do not have much else. Has that relocation of the arena centre been achieved? On what footing will it be provided and when will it be available for the young people of Hackney, please?</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="1001061000045"></a>Moving from Hackney to the Olympic Village itself, we have two or three important questions, all of which we have discussed. The first concerns the question that was raised by the padre appointed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford, in whose diocese this is located, who heard great disquiet expressed by the workforce undertaking the excavations on the village site due to the large deposits of radioactive material that were lodged there, having emanated from various London hospitals over many years. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, made a Statement to the House in which he said that it was all down to the phosphorous on the control panel of a crashed Spitfire which had embedded itself in the marsh at that point. No, it was not. This has been a site of intensive radioactive deposit for 80 years since X-rays became a major factor in London hospitals. How successful was the removal of this material before the workforce had to engage directly with it, and what steps were taken to protect them?</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="1001061000046"></a>The other issue concerning the Olympic Village, which was much discussed on numerous occasions, is whether the delivery unit has succeeded in getting satisfactory clearance from the Islamic religious authorities in this country as regards the compatibility of the dwellings being provided for private worship. Some seven different requirements had to be met. Having built an Islamic village for a university campus in Libya 25 years back, I know to my cost that very sensitive issues are involved. I remember having to  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_116"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>take Colonel Gaddafi on a guided tour of the finished product, at the end of which he said: "You've only got one bit right, why shouldn't I hang you?" I said, "Because you should hang the architect instead, Colonel". He said, "Can't do that, did it last month". If the Government face a similar situation, they will be confronted with adopting the same solution I had to do, which cost millions. You have a lot of work to do to put it right. Therefore, will the Government please tell us whether they have Islamic religious clearance on the dwellings?</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="1001061000047"></a>Moving from the problems of the dwellings to the issues of religion itself, we had a very strange Statement-I think that it was again made by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham-on the arrangements that were being made for the building of temples, mosques and buildings for Christian worship, but I have no recollection of being told that there would also be a synagogue. Are we omitting the Jewish faith from any religious representation on the site? What arrangements will be made to include them? It is not tactful not to include them in the present circumstances. I should like an update on that, please. As regards the Dome, do the Government now have a satisfactory arrangement in place-the DCMS did this very successfully indeed. I do not say much that is nice about the DCMS, so that is a notable point-for sharing the Christian facility among the various Christian denominations on a shared timetable so that everybody can participate fairly?</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="1001061000048"></a>The next area that we need to look at is that of Greenwich Park, not because of whether it is in or out-I am assuming that that is a done deal-but because there are points of detail on which an update would be hugely welcome. Is it correct that the survey work has discovered that the small fragment of Roman remains that were there is part of a much larger and more important Roman site? In that case, it would be the biggest Roman site that has been discovered anywhere in the greater London area for more than 100 years and will have huge historical value. What steps are being taken to preserve that site and protect it from construction traffic and the hoof beats to come so that it can be excavated properly after the Olympics have ended? It is of huge cultural benefit if it is true that it is as big as is said.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="1001061000049"></a>Has there been a resolution of the siting of the water jump for the three-day event? The last we heard, there could not be an assurance that the duck pond which is the greatest single collection of wildfowl in this country was not going to be destroyed to make way for the water jump. Since there could not be an answer to my noble friend Lady Trumpington's question on this, will the Minister now give an assurance that the cricket field and the rugby field will not be concreted over to make car parking within the environs of the park?</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="1001061000050"></a>We have heard nothing whatever about the merchandising plans. Here, I offer the awful warning of the Dome's experience, where we had a £27 million profit projected on total sales of £48 million. We ended up with a £7 million loss on sales of £32 million. They started too late and they did not know what they were doing. The DCMS labours under the dreadful misapprehension that it is a brilliant retailer because it

I declare an interest, in that I am chief executive of London First, a non-profit-making business organisation which has consistently supported the Games coming to London, particularly for their legacy. I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, has taken on the challenge of delivering that legacy in east London. I will focus today on four issues: business opportunities; the use of the Olympic Park before the Games; delivering on our transport promises; and the opportunity for all of London to celebrate being the host city.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="1001061000052"></a>First, as the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, has said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="1001061000085"></a>"With both Government and business working together, companies of all sizes across the UK can share in Olympic gold".</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="1001061000053"></a>As the Minister mentioned earlier, CompeteFor was established by the regional development agencies as a procurement portal to help businesses, particularly smaller ones, compete for a share of Olympic contracts. I should declare that, while receiving no financial benefit, my organisation, London First, has provided a home for CompeteFor's small team. I am glad that we did so, for it now has 100,000 registered UK businesses. Both the ODA and LOCOG are placing contracts on the system and encouraging their suppliers to do likewise.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="1001061000054"></a>Beyond Olympic contracts, CompeteFor has now been adopted as a procurement tool by other public bodies, including Transport for London and several boroughs; so CompeteFor is delivering a legacy benefit now. The Minister may be unaware that the Government seem intent on commissioning another procurement portal, which would duplicate both their own Supply2Gov and the successful CompeteFor portal. I welcome the Government's ambition to open up government contracting opportunities to the nation's SMEs. But surely this could be done more economically by adapting what we already have.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="1001061000055"></a>Secondly, I add my congratulations to the Olympic Delivery Authority on the advanced state of its preparations. I recently visited the site again. It is an impressive hive of well managed, bustling activity, huge progress and is a remarkable transformation. The park may even be completed a year early. In a rather British way, we seem to be regarding this as a problem. Surely we should regard it as an opportunity. Why not offer the many companies that have contributed to building the park the opportunity to lease all or part of the park for a week at a time, to show international clients around? This would animate the park, show off what British business can do, and generate an income to cover some of the caretaking costs.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="1001061000056"></a>My third point is a gentle reminder. Increased capacity on the Northern Line by 2012 was promised to the IOC as part of London's bid. The Minister's colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, must bang heads together at London Underground and contractor Tube Lines to make sure that as well as learning lessons from the Jubilee Line upgrade, the timely  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_118"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>delivery of the upgrades is assured. Olympic visitors and London's everyday tube commuters would be grateful for some elbow room.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="1001061000057"></a>Finally, the organisation of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, LOCOG, has jumped through many hoops in order to remain on track to meet commercial sponsorship targets, in a very tough fundraising environment. Noble Lords will wish to note, however, that the supplement on Londoners' council tax will raise some £600 million towards the Games, so London is contributing much more than any individual corporate sponsor.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="1001061000058"></a>For understandable reasons, the organisers are wary about protecting the brand. They are protective about the word "Olympic", and about "Games", and "gold", "silver", and "bronze". Even mentioning London and 2012 in the same sentence can result in a shot across the bows from the brand police of the noble Lord, Lord Coe. We should be building the excitement. My worry is that the reputation earned by LOCOG's stormtroopers threatens to undermine the potential for London and the UK fully to embrace the sporting celebration ahead. Such is the absence of branding in and around the city, Londoners and visitors might not be aware of the Games taking place.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="1001061000059"></a>London should be given the status of so-called tier 1 sponsorship, including branding opportunities. Surely we should see Mayor of London posters, badged as Olympic host city, on our transport systems. Those posters should be in the arrivals lounges at Heathrow and city airports, on some of our red buses, on Tube platforms and in carriages, on taxis, and even on the Mayor's new hire bicycles. This will not damage the value to the commercial sponsors of the Games. By building awareness, anticipation and a shared sense of ownership, it could even enhance value.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="1001061000060"></a>I ask the Minister: when will London be able to wear its Olympic badge with pride, and when will Londoners and the rest of the country be able to fly Olympic flags from their upstairs windows?</p>
<a name="time_46"></a>

Clearly it is a lesson for many future developments and is much better than many in the past. We have heard many supportive speeches, which is great. I fear that in my remarks I might pour a little cold water-or, rather, hot polluted air-on the project.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="1001061000062"></a>It all started when, as chairman of the Rail Freight Group, I expressed strong concerns about the failure of the ODA to require suppliers to use rail or water, not just for the easy bulks but also for the other structures and materials, similar to the arrangements provided by the British Airports Authority for Terminal 5 at Heathrow. It is not often that I congratulate BAA, but on that occasion it did very well. Since then there have been some improvements, such as those outlined by my noble friend Lady Morgan, but nothing like the potential if the ODA had set up common-user consolidation centres in a few places around the country to deliver materials by rail. That, I calculated, would have saved about 800,000 lorry journeys around Stratford between last year and the time of the Olympics.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_119"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0016.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="1001061000063"></a>I am afraid that that is just one concern that I have about air quality issues. My noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester said in his opening remarks that the Olympics are breaking new grounds of sustainability in a healthy and enjoyable environment. I hope he is right. Sadly, however, there are serious problems of air quality in the Stratford area and in London generally which, unless they are tackled urgently by the Government and the Mayor, could mean that the main Olympic site will be in breach of air quality limits during the Olympics. Do we want them to be called the high-pollution Olympics? I hope not.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="1001061000064"></a>I spoke briefly about this during the debate on the Queen's Speech, but there have been further developments since. Two prime legal breaches of air quality in London affect the Stratford site. The first relates to the air quality laws for dangerous airborne particles which we call PM10s. Those laws have been breached in London every year since January 2005, when they entered into force. They were breached again in 2009. For example, on the Marylebone Road the allowable daily average of 50 micrograms per cubic metres was breached on 39 days, when only 35 were allowed. That was in a mild and wet year. I suggest that it could have been  a lot worse in hot years such as 2003 and 2006. On  11 December 2009, the European Commission rejected the UK's application for a delay until 11 June 2011 to comply with the PM10 air quality laws for London. These laws must therefore continue in force, but will they be breached again in 2010 or 2012? The Government may even be faced with a £300 million fine from the European Commission for failure to implement these laws.</p>

<a name="100105-0016.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="1001061000065"></a>The second breach is in the air quality laws for nitrogen dioxide, NO2, which entered into force on 1 January, only five days ago. These require annual mean levels of NO2 not to exceed 40 micrograms per cubic metre and for no more than 18 hours in a year  to exceed 200 micrograms per cubic metre. However, last year in Brompton Road, by Harrods, the annual mean was 88 micrograms per cubic metre, and the  200 micrograms per cubic metre standard was breached 341 times-in other words, nearly daily instead of nearly monthly. There are similar figures for Marylebone Road according to the London Air Quality Network. The hourly standard for NO2 is likely to be breached in London by a very wide margin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="1001061000066"></a>Therefore, even if the UK Government win a delay from the Commission for NO2 from 2010 to 2015, which they are apparently seeking, they must still ensure that annual average concentrations of NO2 do not exceed 60 micrograms per cubic metre, which is a long way from the figure of 107, or 88 which I have just mentioned. We have detailed maps of all the most seriously polluted areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="1001061000067"></a>The problem is that it is the responsibility of the Mayor of London to take action on these issues. One has to ask why the mayor took nearly 18 months to produce a draft air quality strategy, which the European Commission said on 11 December 2009 did not even meet the minimum conditions for a time extension to comply with the air quality laws for PM10. This means that the Commission rejected the British Government's application for an extension due to the poor quality of  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_120"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the mayor's response. This was the mayor's responsibility. I have to ask my noble friend why the Government are being so patient with the mayor. Why have they let the mayor remove or delay valuable transport measures that were planned to contribute to better air quality? For example, he has postponed phase 3 of the low emission zone and plans to remove the western extension of the congestion charging zone. Of course, he will lose revenue from the failure to extend the zone, and the cancellation of the £25 CO2 charge for gas guzzlers will make a black hole in TfL's financing, which will not help either.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="1001061000068"></a>Therefore, I suggest to my noble friend that the Government give the mayor full legal responsibility for complying with these air quality laws, at least for PM10s, for which the necessary measures are within his grasp. NO2 compliance is more difficult and requires national solutions. It is very good that the Government announced this morning the launch of the boiler scrappage scheme, which will help dramatically to reduce some NO2 emissions. We have to remember that the UK is the largest emitter of NOX in the whole of the EU and is set to breach the emissions ceiling by 2010.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="1001061000069"></a>That may all seem a little scientific and detailed but it is worth reminding ourselves that the Campaign for Clean Air in London estimates that in 2005 up to 7,900 premature deaths were due to dangerous airborne particles in London. On average, those people, who account for about one in eight of the total deaths in London, may have died 10 years early.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a><a name="1001061000070"></a>Therefore, I suggest that the solution lies largely in the mayor's hands. First, he should ban all pre-Euro IV diesel engines from London well before the Olympics, as it is diesel that produces the pollution. There are plenty of newer vehicles around and there should be a London-wide ban. Secondly, with such a huge public health problem, widespread breaches of the air quality laws since 2005 and a mayor who is going backwards and not forwards, I question how the Government can say that the preparations for the Olympics are going well and breaking new grounds of sustainability in a healthy and enjoyable environment. The site may be very sustainable-I congratulate those who designed it-but because of its location that part of London will certainly not be healthy unless the Government and the mayor take urgent action. My recollection is that in Beijing they solved the problem of pollution by banning cars for some time before the Games. I hope that between the mayor and the Government they can do something a little more sensible and more long-lasting. I wish the Games well.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_121"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100105-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="1001061000072"></a>No one raising security matters now can be accused of scaremongering since the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, in a speech in mid-November 2009 to the Royal United Services Institute said that our Olympics would be,</p>
<ul><a name="1001061000086"></a>"possibly the greatest security challenge that the United Kingdom has faced since the Second World War".</ul>
<p><a name="1001061000082"></a>I recognise that there have been no fatalities in any Olympics since that pipe-bomb explosion in a crowded Atlanta park which, alas, killed two poor people in 1996, in a city which I visited at the tail end of October last year.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="1001061000073"></a>That our UK security task in 2012 is both formidable and likely to grow in cost formidably is self-evident from what has been done in the run up to the forthcoming winter Olympics 2010 in Vancouver, now less than two months away. The preparation for the winter Games started off with a published planning assumption for security costs of 175 million Canadian dollars. The budget is now just under 1 billion Canadian dollars, about what the Greeks spent, in effect, for a whole summer Olympics in 2004, compared with the much smaller forthcoming winter Games events in Vancouver next month. It is very instructive to see where this nearly fivefold increase over the initial planning estimates of security costs will be spent. It will be spent on everything from enforcing airspace restrictions on over-flying to the costs of some 15,000 police, military and private security guards, all of whom are just now being vaccinated against certain viruses as part of their own protection. I trust that the Government will look very close indeed at what I hope will be peaceful Vancouver Games and at the security lessons that we can take and apply to London 2012.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="1001061000074"></a>I understand there is a notional sum of some  £800 million in the £9.3 billion budget for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. That sum is certain to escalate very substantially. As it is a matter of public security-the security of athletes, their coaches and the spectators who come to view these great events-that security bill will have to be met, as we meet others from outside existing budgets. That said, I have two main points to make about our Games relating to physical attack against people and property and one further main point about threats to the ticketing, logistics and organisation of 2012 posed by co-ordinated cyber attacks on our systems in this country.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="1001061000075"></a>On violent terrorist attacks, since the 7/7 outrages in this country in 2005 and the almost daily litany of reports of explosions in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Pakistan, we are all too familiar with the current, most prevalent means of causing mayhem via demented suicide bombers or by improvised explosive devices, IEDs. To these, from information reaching me, I must now add improvised chemical devices-ICDs-those deadly twins of IEDs. Let us have no accusations of scaremongering just because so far those spectres have not attended any great Western sporting events. We must, rather, learn from the success of others in stopping just such potential chemical assaults. I think in particular of how Germany dealt with that specific threat in the run-up to and during the 2006 football World Cup-an object lesson for this Government and for us generally in chemical readiness. Pre-emption was paramount, as in all good anti-terrorist work, of course, but underlying  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_122"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it was a brilliant chemical surveillance plan allowing any suspect substance to be analysed quickly. Those devices were in continuous standby mode, but installed so that spectators were completely unaware of them, and thus unalarmed.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="1001061000076"></a>Without, of course, going into any sensitive detail, will the Minister in his wind-up speech answer this specific question: is a chemical attack/prevention and chemical surveillance plan in development for 2012 or not? If not, will there be one? If the Minister cannot, for understandable reasons, answer tonight because he is not briefed on the point, will he none the less undertake to write to me with the answer, copied to all other speakers, and to place a copy of that letter in the Library of your Lordships' House?</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="1001061000077"></a>My second point about the prevention of attacks on the person is driven by the belief that terrorists do best, by their lights, by the simple tactic of working around or, best of all, before security measures are in place. Devices of a latent nature could still be left in the Olympic Park during the construction phase and elsewhere. I very much welcome the vigorous biometric checks that have been introduced for construction staff working in the Olympic Village, with a present workforce of about 4,500 doubling to 10,000 by the end of 2010. All those methods, from photographic smart cards in conjunction with hand scanners to iris-checking devices, must be used to help to prevent the courage of illicit and destructive materials on to the site.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a><a name="1001061000078"></a>However, fast forward not much more than a couple of years, and the same sort of checking will have to be in place for the many scores of thousands of volunteers who will willingly-I welcome this-give up their time for stewarding and other roles in the Olympics. That is a formidable security task. Terrorists, particularly suicide terrorists, use ever more concealed devices, as we have just seen, and there has been a Statement in your Lordships' House today about that. That is a hard question, with all the cost implications that it entails, but I suppose that we must consider whether whole-body scanners should be used for 2010's construction workers and, perhaps, for 2012's volunteers as well.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="1001061000079"></a>I end on this note. We face the threat of direct attacks on the person, but we also face formidable possible attacks from cyber methods to disrupt 2012 by a co-ordinated or partial assault on ticketing systems, on the related transport and hotel bookings systems, and certainly on our utility companies' electricity networks. I am advised that there are what are termed in the cyber trade Trojans, which can be placed across diverse systems and networks, and then simultaneously triggered from a distance, as the people of Estonia found out with the devastating cyber attack on their country back in 2006. Just as in the matter of the pressing need for an Olympic chemical attack and surveillance plan, do the Government who, in the end, are responsible for our security, have a cyber attack plan? Who is in charge of it? By the same token, if the Minister cannot answer tonight because he is not briefed on it, will he again undertake to write to me, copied to all other noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, and to place the answer in the Library of the House?</p>

<a name="1001063000001"></a><b><a name="100105-0017.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1001063000058"></a>Lord Pendry:</b> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester on initiating this debate and the able way in which he has presented a clear picture of how preparations are taking place for hosting the 2012 Olympic Games in London. My noble friend has a long history not only of supporting major games, such as the Olympics, but of helping young sports men and women for years as deputy chairman of the Football Trust. It is very fitting that he should be leading for the Government in today's debate. I also praise the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. His contribution to sport is well known, and in his current capacity as chairman of the BOA he has alongside him another Olympian. I am sure that between them they know well how to prepare for 2012.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="1001063000002"></a>I say to those who believe that these Games benefit only London and the southern counties that they could not be more wrong. The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games have already had a positive impact across the UK. I see this in my region in the north-west. As a former Member of Parliament for a Greater Manchester constituency, I assure my noble friends that in that area we do not have to be persuaded that there are positive impacts of hosting multisports events. We learnt from the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games that hosting world-class sports men and women in the backyard, as it were, is a great inspiration and enthuses young people with the power of sport. We also learnt that what you get out of that endeavour you have to put into communities, towns and regions to get the best out of your efforts. We saw that in Manchester in the preparation for wining medals.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="1001063000003"></a>Some of the benefits in the north-west are not just medals but the impact on the community and manufacturers in that area. Dew Piling Limited in Oldham is supplying piling services for the swimming centre that will serve as the gateway to the Olympic park at the time of the Games and will provide the legacy for London swimmers that Manchester athletes have gained through their own pool. Boole's Tools and Pipe Fittings Ltd in Stockport provided mechanical installations for sewage. There are many examples I could give, but time does not permit.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a><a name="1001063000004"></a>Pre-game training camps have already been agreed. The Australian Olympic swimming team has signed up to use the Manchester pool for training for five years. The Thailand National Olympic Committee has signed to use Manchester facilities. Fifty Pacific islands have also signed on a multisports basis across the north-west with the Northwest Regional Development Agency. There are also cultural benefits. Artists Taking the Lead's major project in the north-west is the Projected Column, which is a monumental spinning column of cloud and light in Birkenhead's disused Morpeth dock. There is also the live site big screens in Manchester and Liverpool, which will bring people together to share the experience of the 2012 Games. There are many initiatives in the north-west, but they are replicated throughout the UK, as I am sure many noble Lords agree.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="1001063000005"></a>I witnessed the power of the Olympic Games when I attended the Munich Games, the Moscow Games and the Atlanta Games and the winter Games in  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lillehammer. Alongside Manchester 2002, they demonstrated that the success of the Games comes with personal stories that leave a legacy of pride and young people inspired with the power of sport. I am delighted that the London legacy has already started to leave a mark around the United Kingdom. On top of these commercial benefits, we also have the athletes to grace the Games. From the British performance in the swimming world championships and in the cycling world cup series we know that we have athletes who are in great shape, and there are many more besides. I am confident that the unprecedented levels of investment and support for our sports men and women will allow them to carry this form into the Games.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="1001063000006"></a>The signs are certainly encouraging, but the Olympic and Paralympic Games are about much more than impressive stadia, medals and a month of drama and entertainment. They are all about a spirit which says that our struggle together is more important than our triumph. Through harnessing the very best in sport, humanity as a whole is better off. The 2012 Olympics provides a unique opportunity to inspire 2 million young people into sport and we cannot allow it to pass.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="1001063000007"></a>However, I must be honest. Until recently I was concerned about the lack of focus of this legacy. Following the announcement of London's success, almost all the spotlight was understandably on the delivery of the Games, and the hard legacy issues around facilities and regeneration. They are crucial to a successful Games, but they distorted the focus which led to an estimated £5.6 million being diverted from grass-roots sport into the Olympics project, which will not do. My fear is that the soft legacy has been assuaged somewhat by recent efforts prompted by pressure from politicians and sports organisations, such as the CCPR. These include the publication of the Government's legacy action plan, with participation funding challenged through governing bodies. These plans have been instrumental in changing the face of those of us who had some doubts about the legacy background, which is good progress. I welcome those developments, but more can and should be done. Specific legacy funding can be made available at the local level for initiatives linked to the Olympics, providing coaching or facilities for the community.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="1001063000008"></a>Life could also be made much easier for community sports clubs if the lasting legacy is delivered and eventually reaches a point where we can look back and say that it started with a particular effort by the Government and the authorities. Local community clubs face mounting regulatory burdens in areas such as music, alcohol licensing, water drainage charges and VAT, which increases their costs and administrative requirements. Easing those burdens would go some way to relieving the financial pressure on those clubs and would allow volunteers to spend their time delivering better sport rather than filling in forms and applying for unnecessary licences.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="1001063000009"></a>Let us not forget that while participation legacy is important, active communities are stronger, safer and more cohesive, and the future health of our nation relies on increasing levels of activity among all our citizens, particularly young people. If my throat stands the test of time, I will talk more about this in the

Noble Lords may have noticed that I have been struggling to get some words out. Clearly, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be a fantastic time for this country, but it is our duty as politicians to ensure that pressure for a lasting legacy is maintained. We should not take that duty lightly.</p>

I believe that it is the third time we have got to blocks, but the first time we have started. Much of the thrust on which I wanted to focus has just been spoken about by the noble Lord, Lord Pendry. First, I want to compliment the Olympic movement and, in particular, the ODA. I congratulate you on being so dull: you have been so good at doing what you have been doing that you have annoyed lots of journalists. This House and the whole of Parliament should salute, with considerable joy and relish, any organisation which has annoyed journalists. Well done!</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="1001063000011"></a>There have not been any great dramas. You have delivered on time and on budget-so far, so good. Unless something goes severely wrong-I always felt this about the Olympics-we will have a wonderful Games. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Coe, will not take it amiss if I say that if you manage to mess up something as intrinsically good as the Olympic Games, you deserve a place in history and infamy together, because the Games are so special.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="1001063000012"></a>I also believe that the entire Olympic movement benefited from the complete cock-ups that we had before it-I am thinking particularly of the Wembley fiasco-and the fact that people listened and learnt. They also learnt from the great success story of the Manchester Commonwealth Games, which gave British sport the confidence and the seriousness to apply for the Olympics.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a><a name="1001063000013"></a>This brings me to the central thrust of what I would say about the preparation for the Olympic Games. We will lose the major benefit from these Games if we concentrate only on the month in which the Olympics and the Paralympics take place. They must be seen as a point in a continual flow of activity. I always felt that the aim of getting 2 million more people actively involved in sport was basically absurd, but not the aim of getting 2 million more people to take up sport or to exercise regularly-in other words, to do themselves some good through exercise in a competitive or non-competitive environment. I do not know where the dividing line is. I have asked the Government several times, and it is quite clear that they do not know either.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="1001063000014"></a>What will be the drive behind that? The Olympics have given enough political energy and activity to this to allow it to happen. This is probably one of the great things that one can cash in on. I know that sport is usually a subject in which party politics do not get too involved, but, in this election year and for the next couple of years, when we will not face the most expenditure-friendly environment, we should remember the benefits for the health service, social cohesion  and all the other projects of making sure that we  allow greater activity and flow through. Such activity and flow through is helped by things such as the

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="1001063000015"></a>Without this idea of a continual pattern of activity, much of what we do in connection with the Olympics is in danger of being wasted. After that month of activity, there will be a huge temptation to shrug one's shoulders, to say, "That is done", and to let it go. It is a perfectly normal reaction, and we have all had it. We have had it in groups to which we have been attached. After a huge burst of activity, we have said, "Oh, let's do something else. Let's not hang on to the idea". I appreciate that my party is under-represented here today-consideration of the Digital Economy Bill tomorrow will take a lot of energy out of my party's DCMS team, but I have decided that I will treat them with the same contempt with which they treat me-but all political parties must ensure that we keep the drive going because without it we will not get very far.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="1001063000016"></a>I thank the Minister for allowing the Government and not someone from the Back Benches or the opposition Front Bench to take the lead in this debate. My questions to him are: what are the Government's plans to find out what does and does not work, and when will they publish them? These Olympic Games are taking on new activity and a new thrust, and they are bound to make a series of mistakes. With the best intention in the world, they are trying to get things right but you will get things wrong when you try new things. What works and what does not?</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="1001063000017"></a>I have asked the Government time and again which schemes are best for mass participation, which are not so good, which ones only get the kids running around for three weeks and then disappear, and which ones build up mass participation in grass-roots sports beyond the school-age drop-outs and the end-of-college drop outs. Which schemes are working? These are very important questions that I have asked many times.</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="1001063000018"></a>Also, have the Government decided, provided that they are still in a position to influence it-the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, might be able to give us an idea of his party's approach, should it be in a position to do so-which department will take ultimate responsibility for this judgment? Is the Department of Health in charge? It is, a bit. The DCMS is in charge a bit as well, but mainly this is done through other bodies, and here I pay tribute to the sensibilities behind the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, about the number of boards that get in the way. We could certainly lose half of them, although I am not sure I know which half. When I asked the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, about it, he said that the Treasury is in overall charge. The Treasury has no way of delivering or judging the issue even if it does provide the finance. Where will the judgment be made?</p>

<a name="100105-0017.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a><a name="1001063000019"></a>We have got to make this assessment at some point. Personally, if we going for mass participation and mass support, I favour putting the emphasis on the Department of Health. Apart from anything else, you need a big spending department to defend an issue, and if this is that department's particular baby, it will be defended. Anyone who has observed these things for a length of time and has their hands on the levers

What is going to happen? Can we be told who is going to carry on the project and make sure that this is not a one-stop shop? A physical structure will be left behind. People are looking forward to seeing a wonderful stadium, or better still-if you are a journalist-to seeing the stadium not being used. But what about having an idea of where we are going after 2012? Once we have sounded out what has worked and what has not, we must look at how we move on to the next series of sporting events. If we lose that, we will lose the real one-off opportunity of being able to benefit from how to bring the rest of the community together behind our major sporting events.</p>

It has been a fascinating debate and I have listened to all the different angles that noble Lords come from and all the comments made. The only interest I have to declare is as a past Olympian and one who has been totally and absolutely committed to this project. We talked earlier about cross-party support for a national project. If ever there was an example of a national project in the national interest, with all the parties coming together to support the Government of the day, I would suggest that this is it. Many Members in the Chamber tonight are part and parcel of that effort.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="1001063000021"></a>I should like also to join others in congratulating John Armitt and his team in the ODA and my noble friend Lord Coe and his team in LOCOG on the great progress they are making in the preparations for hosting the 2012 Olympic Games. Many milestones have been accomplished in the development of our Olympic park, most of them ahead of schedule and within budget, which was set in 2007. As my noble friend Lord Coe said, in the past six months or so LOCOG has brought in nine new sponsors and raised almost £600 million. The Olympic stadium is being completed at a speedy rate and other Olympic venues outside London are steadily being developed. The Olympic village, which will accommodate over 23,000 athletes and officials during the Games, is on track. I understand that Triathlon Homes has purchased 1,379 of the new homes that will become available as affordable, high quality housing for local people after 2012.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="1001063000022"></a>This is a commendable start, not to mention the progress being made on the green transport links into the Olympic park. The objective is to get 100 per cent of the spectators into the Games by walking, cycling or public transport. The necessary improvements are due for completion by the end of 2010. During the six weeks of the Games, competitors, officials and the media will travel to the venue by road. I ask the Government this: what measures are being taken to limit the impact that that will have on congestion in the area, and taking up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, what measures are in place to ensure that the vehicles used are as green as possible?</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="1001063000023"></a>The 2012 Games are beginning to transform the landscape of east London. However, despite these achievements, there remain issues within some aspects  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_128"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the management and organisation of the Games which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister, and I look forward to his response on these matters.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a><a name="1001063000024"></a>It is common knowledge that parts of the journey towards 2012 have not been straightforward, particularly in relation to the Government's budget miscalculations. The budget has soared from approximately £2.3 billion to £9.3 billion-we know the history of that-leading to unprecedented raids on good causes money from the National Lottery. Over half the contingency fund has already been spent, delivering only a third of the Olympic programme-I think that that is slightly out of kilter; it is probably nearer 50 per cent of the programme by now-and there have been funding cuts to sports such as shooting and water polo because of the £50 million shortfall against the Government's promise of £100 million. This has been brought about by the Government's failure to raise a single penny from the private sector against this commitment. As your Lordships will remember, there was a commitment from the Government to put £100 million into that pot, but they raised no money from the private sector for it, hence the £50 million shortfall.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a><a name="1001063000025"></a>How does the Minister propose to develop a grass-roots sporting legacy-about which we have heard a great deal today, especially from my noble friend Lord Moynihan-if the lottery funding intended for this purpose has been diverted to other areas of the Games? Is he confident that the current funding levels for all sports are sufficient to give the UK the best chance possible to beat its medal tally at the Beijing Games? While it is welcome that funding for smaller elite sports has been increased, what impact does the Minister feel the redistribution of funds away from other sports, such as rowing, will have on our medal prospects in these disciplines?</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a><a name="1001063000026"></a>Certain sports, such as gymnastics and badminton, have had to be moved from their proposed venue-a temporary site near the O2 Arena in north Greenwich-to Wembley Arena because of concerns about funding. Can the Minister tell the House why these events have to be moved to temporary sites, thereby destroying any permanent legacy for these sports, if the preparations for the Games are running to budget? I have had many arguments with local people and Tessa Jowell about the movement and siting of some of these sports; however, I shall be interested to hear the Government's position. How are the Government ensuring that a physical legacy remains for sports such as shooting and equestrian events, which are also being held in temporary arenas? What measures are being taken to ensure that businesses around Greenwich Park will not be unduly affected by the hosting of the equestrian and modern pentathlon events?</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a><a name="1001063000027"></a>Is the Minister confident that the contingency funding allocated to the Olympic village can be recouped by May 2010? Can he update the House on whether progress has been made to find a permanent tenant for the Olympic stadium after the Games? The LDA has run up an overdraft in acquiring the land; it has also budgeted for land receipts set at 2007 levels. This has caused a twofold problem of spending more than it thought and potentially getting back less than it expected. Can the Minister explain further how the land value  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_129"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>receipts will be balanced in the LOCOG or ODA budgets and what impact that will have on their sponsorship targets and ticket pricing?</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a><a name="1001063000028"></a>Most significantly, my noble friend Lord Patten has spoken at length about the worries and concerns over security. When do the Government propose to publish the security cost plan, which is bound to be a significant item, as demonstrated by my noble friend? Can the Minister say with whom the responsibility for security will lie? Is it ODA? Is it LOCOG? Is it various departments within the Government, or some other agency such as MI5 or MI6, or the Met?</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a><a name="1001063000029"></a>One of the most pressing issues is the policing requirements for the Games. We know that the Metropolitan Police will be under significant stress, with each borough having to accept a 2.5 per cent reduction in policing 12 months prior to and six months after the Games. The Metropolitan Police Authority has to recruit 10,000 extra specials to compensate for this extraction. What progress has been made so far on this? It is well known that for an event of such a scale, there is a shortfall of specialist policing capabilities, such as canines and armed officers. How are the Metropolitan Police addressing these shortfalls? Will they at least in part rely on the assistance of other police forces throughout the country for these capabilities and to meet normal policing requirements? My concern for many officers having to brought in from outside London is that their ability to respond to any security-related incidents-although, of course, one hopes that there will not be any-outside the Olympic arenas will be lessened. What progress has been made in developing a national demand profile for the policing requirement? The risk of displacement is real; those seeking to attack the Games might go not for areas such the Olympic site but for other locations that will none the less affect the running of the Games and confidence in the event.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a><a name="1001063000030"></a>Who is going to pay for the security management and so on during the time period between the ODA finishing the venues at the arena and the Olympic park and LOCOG taking them over? As I understand it, it looks as though there could well be a gap or void of a year or almost 10 months between completion by the ODA and the taking over by LOCOG. They will need to be maintained, guarded and looked after.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a><a name="1001063000031"></a>Finally, the Olympics were won on a commitment to use the Games to inspire a whole generation to take up sport. Participation in sport is tremendously important to society, especially to the young. It has the ability to change social patterns, improve health and transform lives. Sport England will invest £880 million in sport over the next four years to create a world-leading community sport system. We look forward to hearing more details on the success of that investment. The Government's flagship proposal for a community sports legacy was to offer free swimming to all those over 60. However, the inflexible administration system and limited funding is preventing local councils from delivering that pledge. When will the Government revise the scheme and honour their flagship commitment?</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a><a name="1001063000032"></a>Finally, as I said in my introduction, this is an exciting time. The Games are nearly here. Again, I congratulate everyone who has worked so hard to  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_130"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deliver these results. I wish all the projects success in their further development and emphasise to Her Majesty's Government the importance of ensuring, at almost any sacrifice, that there is a real and lasting legacy for sport for all of the United Kingdom post-2012.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="1001063000057"></a>10.54 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="1001063000033"></a><b><a name="100105-0018.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1001063000061"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I am looking at the clock and am conscious that at 10.55 I would not be terribly popular if I were to spend half an hour answering all the questions raised in this debate. There have been a huge number. I was just about on top of them until the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, got to his feet; I lost count at about 12 of his questions. I have the answers to almost all of them, but I hope that he will forgive me if I reply to him and other noble Lords in writing after the debate-otherwise we will be here until very late.</p>

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="1001063000034"></a><b><a name="100105-0018.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1001063000062"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I invite the Minister to write a paper on that which is available to all Members and to put it in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="1001063000035"></a><b><a name="100105-0018.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1001063000063"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> Yes, of course. I shall attempt to write a comprehensive note of a wind-up speech that I might have delivered if I had had half an hour in which to do it. If the House was gracious enough to accept that, it would make all our lives a lot easier.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a><a name="1001063000036"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this remarkable and interesting debate. One of the privileges of being a Member of this House is the opportunity to hear speeches from noble Lords who really know what they are talking about and are the foremost experts in their field, and this has been one of those occasions today.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a><a name="1001063000037"></a>As we debate the preparations for London 2012, it is important that we do not lose sight of the sheer scale of what we are working to achieve and the outstanding level of our ambition. As the noble Lord, Lord Coe, said, this will be one of the world's biggest peacetime logistical operations, the equivalent of staging 26 world championships back to back, with the security demands of holding two Wembley cup finals, the Wimbledon tennis championship and a G20 summit all on the same day.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a><a name="1001063000038"></a>I was pleased to hear the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Patten, asking about the security challenges. Security planning is well advanced. The appointment of Sir Ian Johnston is an important element in that. I will write to the noble Lord, and will put the answer in the Library so that it is available to everyone else, on the detailed issues that he raised on cyber and chemical threats, both important matters that I know feature in our 2012 planning.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a><a name="1001063000039"></a>My noble friend Lady Morgan was right to refer to the enormity of the construction project. I am sure that we were pleased to hear her contribution from the standpoint of the ODA; both it and LOCOG have made first-rate progress so far, but 2010 will see the pace of delivery increase still further. One of the important elements of this year will be the stepping up of the volunteer recruitment programme. The noble  


<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_131"></a><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Moynihan, referred to the desirability of encouraging volunteers in this area. There will be up to 70,000 Games-time volunteers, and LOCOG will start to procure £700 million worth of goods and services for the Games and finalise the ticketing strategy and sporting schedule.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a><a name="1001063000040"></a>In terms of gold medals won, Beijing was our best Olympics in 100 years and our best Paralympics in two decades. Our target this time is to reach the top four in the Olympic medals league and be at least second in the Paralympics, winning more medals in more sports. In a way, that answers one of the questions that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, asked, about what works and whether we are doing this in the right way. A medals target is certainly an important element but there are many others, including the participation by young people on a long-term basis in sport. The success of 2012 will be judged by the legacy that it leaves behind and the benefits that it continues to deliver to people around the country long after the Olympic flame has been extinguished.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a><a name="1001063000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James, also quick-fired a number of questions to me, all of them interesting. Some of them are not matters for the Government; some are for the ODA and some for LOCOG. If he permits me, we will see that he gets a reply, which other noble Lords will be able to read, on the interesting questions that he raised about Hackney Marshes, the Olympic village, radioactive material, religious provision, Roman remains in Greenwich Park and the restoration of the park to its pristine state. On the latter point I can tell him that LOCOG has been working with interest groups in Greenwich and submitted town planning applications before Christmas, with the purpose that it will make good the impact that the event will have on the park. This will be the subject of a detailed letter that will address the other points as well.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a><a name="1001063000042"></a>The noble Lord also raised the issue of the media centre. Its first job is to house the 20,000 journalists that will descend on east London during the Games. Afterwards it will be transformed into a mixed-use office and business space, a facility designed to attract the creative media and digital industries, which we believe will be an essential part of the industry, a source of employment in Hackney and part of the stunning transformation of east London that will come about as a result of the Games.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a><a name="1001063000043"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, spoke about upgrading the Northern Line and other transport links and urged me to persuade my noble friend the Secretary of State to bang heads together. He is quite good at doing that and I will certainly convey that message to him. She also asked about advertising restrictions. Certainly, striking the right balance in allowing businesses to benefit from the Games and protecting LOCOG's sponsors' rights is a fine judgment. Again, that is something that could be covered in a lengthier letter, but we are clear that protection must exist if we are to guarantee the private sector  funding that is so crucial to fund the staging of the Games. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Coe, would be happy to listen to and respond to the noble Baroness's concerns.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a><a name="1001063000044"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Pendry for his kind words about me and I am happy to reciprocate by paying tribute to his work as president of the Football Foundation. He was right to draw attention to the benefit the Games will bring to other parts of England and Wales-for example, the football competition being staged in some of our most famous stadia such as the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Old Trafford in Manchester and St James' Park in Newcastle and the final at Wembley. The sailing events will be at Weymouth. That is the first 2012 venue already to be completed-again on time and on budget. There will be opportunities for people across the UK to see sporting events in their own communities by the time 2012 comes along.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a><a name="1001063000045"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to training centres and training camps for the visiting teams, which will be in such varied places at Loughborough University, Stoke Mandeville and other centres. Those visiting teams will, I am sure, receive a warm welcome from local communities in their training camps in the months leading up to the Games. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, made an important point about the need for language skills to be exercised so that the warmth of the welcome for visiting teams is conducted not only in the single language of English. She was right to draw attention to that issue and I am sure that the organising committee will look very carefully at it.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a><a name="1001063000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, raised three important and major points. He raised an issue about the rationalisation of sporting bodies. With respect to him, that is not directly related to the Games but I am happy to answer it in writing. The Government take the view that there is a difference between UK Sport, which is responsible for elite sport, Sport England, which is responsible for community sport and the Youth Sport Trust which is responsible for sport in schools. We believe that that has already delivered results and indeed some of those results were due to his legacy as Minister for Sport a little while ago. I am happy to pay tribute to that as someone who worked with him in a modest way at that time. However, I do not believe that it is sensible to reinvent the wheel and completely reorganise sports administration in this country, particularly in the run-up to the Olympic Games.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a><a name="1001063000047"></a>The noble Lord asked a sophisticated question about the sports infrastructure spend. I will write to him about that if I may because the answer is quite complicated. He also referred to his impending Private Member's Bill on anti-doping. We are not terribly happy with the proposals that it contains, which I know will come as no surprise to him. Perhaps it would be better to wait for that debate when the Bill comes before the House.</p>

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a><a name="1001063000048"></a>My noble friend Lord Berkeley asked about air quality in particular. Again, it was a complicated question, to which I hope he will allow me to respond in writing. The commitment on air quality in terms of the Games as a whole is very firm. We recognise that good air quality makes the Games a platform for demonstrating long-term solutions to how you can improve air quality and the Olympic sites need to meet stringent requirements in the <I>London Best Practice Guidance</I> to reduce emissions from demolition in

<a name="100105-0018.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a><a name="1001063000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, wants a rather detailed answer on what works and what does not work. I should like to think about that and respond  to him in a letter, although I make the point that  there is a cross-government commitment involving the Department of Health and DCMS to get 2 million people more active by 2012. That is certainly part of the measure of success for the Games. Sport England has backed 46 sports governing bodies with substantial sums-£480 million-and is monitoring through its active people survey to find out the answer to the question that the noble Lord asked: what works and what does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_512"></a><a name="1001063000053"></a>My final words are to say that the Government promised to deliver a lasting legacy from the Games in 2012.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1001057000004"></a>I should like to inform honourable Members that the Secretary of State for Justice has received notice in writing from the Boundary Commission for Wales of the commencement of an interim review. The review will be of the boundaries of the parliamentary constituencies of Brecon and Radnorshire CC and Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney CC and will be based upon the number of electors on the electoral register at 21 December 2009.

<a name="1001057000005"></a><b><a name="100105-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="1001057000036"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Claire Ward) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1001057000006"></a>The Government have been working throughout this Parliament to improve safety on Britain's roads. In recent years we have enacted a number of measures designed to deal more effectively with those whose driving puts others at serious risk. We have:</p>
introduced the new offences of causing death by careless driving and causing death while driving unlicensed or uninsured, which have maximum penalties of five years' and two years' imprisonment, respectively; andincreased the maximum penalty for serious driving offences, including causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, from 10 to 14 years' imprisonment (CJA 2003, came into effect on 27 February 2004).
<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1001057000007"></a>But we need to do more. Dangerous driving is still too prevalent. We should not underestimate the devastating effect that bad driving can have on people's lives. I have listened to the representations from those who are campaigning for increased penalties for dangerous driving. I have come to the conclusion that they are right, and that the current penalties are insufficient.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1001057000008"></a>I therefore intend to increase the maximum penalty for dangerous driving from two years' imprisonment to five years' imprisonment. This will require primary legislation. An appropriate provision will be included in a suitable Bill when parliamentary time allows.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1001057000011"></a>Last August, we published our assessment of the UK's food security, and we held an online discussion forum on the future of food between August and October 2009. In total, over 600 people and organisations responded.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1001057000012"></a>Food security has come to the fore following food prices rising sharply in 2008 for the first time in a generation, provoking riots in some parts of the world. With a growing global population, a changing climate, and pressure being put on land, we are going to need to produce more food, to do so sustainably, and to ensure that the food we eat safeguards our health.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1001057000013"></a>Food 2030 sets out the steps that all those involved in food can take to put us on this path, in particular by helping consumers to be better informed and able to buy healthy food from sustainable sources; minimising waste; making sure every part of the supply chain is resilient, competitive and has the skills that match the challenge; and using science and technological advance to assist us.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1001057000014"></a>All of this will require leadership and co-operation from all those involved in farming, fisheries, food production and public health. I will update the House as the strategy is implemented.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1001057000017"></a>The department committed to the introduction of generic substitution in primary care in the National Health Service, subject to discussion with affected parties, in the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2009. The department is today commencing a consultation on the proposals to implement generic substitution, where a generic medicine is dispensed instead of a branded medicine.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1001057000018"></a>Discussions with, and views expressed by, stakeholders during the course of the last year have proved invaluable, endorsing in particular the need to appropriately account for patient safety in the implementation of generic substitution, and enable prescribers to continue to meet individual patient clinical need. Further to this

These options are to:</p>
do nothing introduce dispensing flexibility, but with specific exclusions, so that the arrangements do not apply to a selected group of products on an exempt list; andintroduce dispensing flexibility, but limiting the scheme in such a way that the arrangements only apply to a selected group of products on a select list.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1001057000019"></a>The department's preferred approach is the third option, supplemented by an "opt out endorsement". The reasons for this include considerations relating to patient safety and clinical need, savings to the NHS and manageability of implementation for clinicians and prescription infrastructure providers.</p>

<a name="100105-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>

These figures do not include military equipment, military personnel pay, service children's education facilities, estate works and maintenance, IT and communication, maritime visits or air charter; costs associated with these activities are met by other top level budget holders. The reason for the lower figures in the most recent years is due to a change in MoD accounting policy, under which fixed asset depreciation costs and the cost of capital on fixed assets is recorded elsewhere.</p>

For each one of these courts a draft impact assessment has been carried out and respondents to the consultation are invited to comment on the potential impacts of closure. The decisions on whether to propose closure were taken on a case-by-case basis. Consideration was given to the proximity of other courts, the size and type of workload generated from the local area, and local transport links. Therefore, HMCS has avoided a generic approach but in all 20 cases, the alternative court is within 30 miles of the court proposed for closure. However, this is not to say that 30 miles would always be the appropriate level for "reasonable travelling distance". In all cases it is possible to travel from the location of the old court to the new court on public transport or, in one case, on a combination of public transport and a local authority-run link service. It should be noted that all these courts were significantly underutilised and, at many of these courts, a representative group, which includes members of the local judiciary, had already decided to stop listing cases.</p>

This does, however, appear to the department to be a likely outcome. The internet campaign of vilification and harassment against Graham Badman and individual home educators who have declared they support aspects of the review has worried local authority officers. Some have suffered personal harassment through the internet, some have found individual home educators have ceased to co-operate with the local authority and others have come under severe pressure from repeated Freedom of Information Act requests which seem intended more to disrupt their day-to-day work than genuinely to be seeking relevant information.</p>

This is consistent for all users of the market.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_140"></a><a name="10010561000206"></a>In order to discharge the responsibility to deter and detect market abuse, the FSA and UK derivative exchanges focus on all large positions in commodity derivative markets, irrespective of whether they are held by financial or commercial participants, on an ongoing and real-time basis. Neither the FSA nor UK exchanges currently collect or make available aggregated position information by participant type.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_69"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what is their estimate of the current value of the financial derivatives market in London on the basis of (a) notional principal, and (b) the amount at risk in the event of a major financial crisis. [HL715]</p>

<a name="10010561000207"></a><b><a name="100105w0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10010561002743"></a>Lord Myners:</b> The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides an estimate for the size of the London and global derivatives markets. As at 2007, BIS estimates that London had 43 per cent of the global OTC derivatives market (compared to New York at 24 per cent) based on an overall size of c. $415 trillion. Whilst this is a high notional figure, it simply represents the value of the assets on which the contracts are based. The risk exposure, represented by actual cash flows, is considerably smaller.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_141"></a><a name="10010561000208"></a>Compression of trades has addressed much of this risk. The UK supports ongoing international efforts to further strengthen market infrastructures such as the establishment of trade repositories and encouraging greater use of central counterparties. These measures will help to monitor and measure systemic risk.</p>

<a name="100105w0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_142"></a><a name="10010561000209"></a>On 16 December, Government will publish a package of policy proposals, designed to mitigate the impact of a future investment bank failure. The document, entitled <I>Establishing resolution arrangements for investment banks</I>, sets out more than 30 proposals to ensure an investment firm can be wound down effectively, with limited impacts on clients and counterparties of the failed firm, and on financial markets. These proposals form part of Government's broader agenda of work to reduce the likelihood, and impact, of failure in systemic financial firms.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_184"></a><a name="10010561000258"></a>In the Great Lakes region, the UK has been working with the respective revenue and trade authorities and regional economic entities. Through governance reform programmes and initiatives to support greater regional economic integration, we aim to make trade-including of minerals like gold and cassiterite-more accountable and formalised, in order to reduce smuggling and illegal trade. We believe that this support and dialogue is having a beneficial impact, although we recognise that it will take some time before trade in the region becomes fully regulated.</p>

They comprise end-of-year non-consolidated performance payments and in-year special awards. These are an integral element of the reward package for staff. They help drive high performance in DWP by providing a tangible reward for good performance. The payments must be re-earned each year and, as they are non-consolidated, do not add to future pay bill costs.</p>

The expert group found that wrongful acts had been committed by the BTSB, which led the Irish Government to set up the Hepatitis-C Compensation Tribunal to operate on a non-statutory basis to review claims for compensation arising from the many civil actions pending in the courts. The Irish Government subsequently set up the Finlay tribunal of inquiry, which reported in March 1997. This found that wrongful acts were committed. Following the findings of the Finlay tribunal, the Irish Government placed the Hepatitis-C Compensation Tribunal on a statutory footing.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2188"></a><a name="10010561002337"></a>In the case of maintained schools, an inspection may occur where there are concerns about the education and well-being of pupils. A school judged inadequate is subject to monitoring and intervention measures which could result in closure. In the case of independent schools, emergency inspection visits can be commissioned by the DCSF if there is evidence that a school might not be meeting any of the independent school standards including concerns about the quality of education or procedures for safeguarding children. Any remedial action or deregistration would take place on the basis that one or more standard had not been met.</p>
